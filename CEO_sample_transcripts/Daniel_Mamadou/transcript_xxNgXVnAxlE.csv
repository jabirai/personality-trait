Speaker 0,Reporter,hi daniel thank you for the opportunity for me to interview you can you please introduce yourself and your company
Speaker 1,Daniel Mamadou,yeah absolutely and thank you very much for having me here my name is daniel mamadou blanco i'm the managing director of energy transition minerals we are listed on the asx and our stock ticker is etm we're focused on 2 main project areas the first one is the kwanefeld railroad project and the second one is we're expanding a portfolio of lithium properties in spain well where do you
Speaker 0,Reporter,see this current opportunity for the commodity cycle going
Speaker 1,Daniel Mamadou,well the commodity cycles commodity cycles in general are very long cycles and we are now in a period where with interest rates having gone up and inflation having gone up i see a multi bull market multi bull market for for commodities in general and very specifically for critical metals and minerals and that's driven by the fact that we've got this energy transition this shift from internal combustion engine vehicles for example to electric vehicles and move away from oil and gas into renewable energy and these renewable energy technologies require energy storage and energy storage is what drives basically the demand for metals like lithium but also cobalt nickel rare earth as well yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,right yeah so with the global rush for investment into resource companies right what do you think are some of the factors that investors should be looking for when they invest in ass junior resource company
Speaker 1,Daniel Mamadou,"yeah so i would like to take a step back because i don't think there is a global rush for investment at the moment in fact what you'll see is that a number of junior mining or exploration companies are finding it hard to raise capital the funding gap the funding gap in in terms of the energy transition is very very wide and there's not enough investment dollars coming into the supply chain especially at the upstream level i e new mining and new exploration and why or is less than what we anticipated and why is because mining suffers from an image issue right and basically the dilemma is to address climate change we actually need to impact the environment at least in the short term by mining more and there lies the the dilemma basically because we've got phenomenons like the nimby not in my backyard generally you know socially mining is not a very acceptable activity especially in areas where you know we already benefit from blue skies or from you know clean water we don't really want to have an industry like mining nearby us because that's considered generally considered dirty and damaging to the environment and so what's important i i would say in terms of investing in asx general listed companies look for companies that basically keep sustainable practices at the heart and at the center of their their philosophy so wow brilliant yeah so in one sentence why should people invest in your company right energy transition minerals are very very special stock we first first of all we own the exploitation and exploration rights for one of the largest railroad deposit in the world it is located in greenland it's called konefeld number 2 we also are now expanding our portfolio of lithium rich and highly prospective areas in western europe in spain specifically in the province of castilla and leon and that is that looks very very promising and basically we represent the best of both world we've got we've already got an asset it's got a 1,000,000,000 ton resource more than 100,000,000 ton reserves on the drop and we're also now about to obtain one of the largest ex exploration portfolio in western europe for lithium so it's a it's a good balance of rare earth which which are used in permanent magnets that equip electric motors and lithium which is obviously a critical element for energy storage in batteries right"
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so with the whole world the global the governments they are all talking about sustainability social impact how do you think this is going to impact onto your business and how do you foresee your business in the next 5 years
Speaker 1,Daniel Mamadou,yep so we foresee our business be to to grow a lot more than where we are today and we've put in place a set of initiatives where we are looking at expanding geographically now in terms of impact what's very very important is the social license and so obtaining that social license is a critical step for any company and when you look at our work for example in greenland we've operated over the past 15 years there successfully hand in hand with various governments only to find that at some stage there's been a shift in sentiment there's been also a change in government that has led us now into a dispute right and so i think i would say one cannot give the the the social environment one cannot take it for granted you know sentiment can change sentiment can can shift and that's a big challenge for our industry because our project tend to be multi decade projects so it is important to basically always take into account the feedback from the different stakeholders and also manage to stay the course and that's the biggest challenge right okay so thank you
Speaker 0,Reporter,very much daniel for your time today
Speaker 1,Daniel Mamadou,thank you thanks a lot for having me
