Speaker 0,Reporter,alright i am here with dale schwartz dale welcome to the podcast thank you alright tell us the story about pinstripes sure it goes back
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,58 years bowled as a kid in cleveland always enjoyed it took dates bowling after grad school i spent 4 years late eighties with private equity group in manhattan and was gonna buy a bowling alley on the upper west side 74th and broadway in 1989 we were gonna buy the bowling alley and do quality food coined the name pinstripes pinstripes suit upscale image pun with bowling didn't do it got busy left new york was in the biotech industry for a number of years then i started an integrated pharmacy concept and for 20 years kept mentioning to friends and family this bowling idea and then finally said life's too short and about 20 years ago spent about almost 2 years putting the pieces together and started binstraves mhmm
Speaker 0,Reporter,so but i mean before we get into it what was the best score you've ever had bowling
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,that was about 19 years ago 222 right i had about 5 beers when we were putting our team together for our first location and yeah yeah i got a little lucky i i i wouldn't roll a 222 if i bowl today yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah yeah but so you were a private you were in private equity and you were looking at buying a bowling alley with the private equity firm
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,no just put your 2 friends on the side
Speaker 0,Reporter,friends on the side no
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,private equity i was one of 3 principals buying businesses no this was totally on the side and then we all got busy we didn't do it and then i decided years later to just finally do it in a meaningful full time way and that was the genesis of starting the concert
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm so like what was your what was your thinking why did you think that good food with a bowling alley would would would would go together
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,well when when i grew up like a lot of people bowling once upon a time was just quality so it was the community venue where you enjoyed yourself with family and friends the industry didn't update its lanes etcetera for quite a long time and the the the vision was to go back to the future in the pharmacy business that i had started we were kinda redefining the pharmacy business so we had integrated pharmacies picture whole foods with with prescription products and i wanted to do the same with bowling and then we introduced bocce as well all in the context of quality connections and mind you we opened may 2007 2 months before the iphone was introduced so back then it was still just gather and spend quality time together bowling was just that sticky element that brought people together mhmm
Speaker 0,Reporter,and so what did you do to i mean what makes your food better than what you would see at a traditional bowling alley and how did you get that taken
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,care of the the exception to the rule is phenomenal food with entertainment yeah and so from day 1 we kinda kinda pictured hillstone houston's restaurant group as true north so our food is scratch kitchen and it's hard to do but we break the stereotype that have phenomenal food everything we do is the italian american duality bocce bowling italian american cuisine italian american wines so we have maple glazed salmon and we cook our we our flatbreads and pizzas we make our own pizza dough we make our own marinara sauce so really high quality food because we want it to be different mhmm
Speaker 0,Reporter,it's very different so i mean i mean it's i think in today's environment especially right now where we have so many entertainment mhmm concepts emerging and growing and then just period you know consumers have higher expectations yep bring it back and in in today's environment you know you i don't think that you can really survive as a restaurant chain unless you're you you you're not gonna survive very long unless you're really good like you're really good at the food you have to the food has to be right and i think that's been kind of a pretty significant shift in in your sector because like historically
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,uh-huh
Speaker 0,Reporter,like you're you know a a lot of the companies that you've competed with that you compete with have not necessarily focused on the food in fact i remember dave and buster's in particularly said our focus is on the games that is where the profitability is
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,oh correct but you they they can't
Speaker 0,Reporter,do that now and and what they're doing today is improving the quality of
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,"the food correct food generally speaking for the other entertainment concepts in the past the dave and busters the boleros the topgolfs and others food is more of an afterthought so in in our case it it it's almost much different so 75% of our sales is f and b not not 70% gaming bowling bod sheet no the exact reverse in fact we host weddings every weekend birthday parties corporate events so we'll we'll host a 1,000 events a year each location because of that elevated cuisine corporate events social events want and and deserve quality food if we can host a wedding we can certainly host a 20 person birthday party for 6 year olds yeah a 1,000 events thousand events a year per location"
Speaker 0,Reporter,wow per location per location so how did that like was that a deliberate thing or did that just happen naturally very deliberate
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,"that that was modeled 18 19 years ago after maggiano's so my first board member georga was one of the early founders of maggiano's and maggiano's back in the day was doing 14 16,000,000 top line at some of their successful locations 5 6,000,000 just in private events so our venues are 25 35000 square feet large venues that lend itself to private events"
Speaker 0,Reporter,right right so what is the percentage of sales
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,private events
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah from private
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,events almost half really 45 50 percent of our sales are private events almost equally split social corporate
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm okay now it so does that mean like each of these locations have like somebody who specializes in selling these or how do you get
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,to work each location we have anywhere from 3 to as many as 5 event sales team members that every day are selling corporate events and social events and are in the community and then we do a robust google adword campaign to drive lead generation but yes not not not not remote selling on-site mhmm
Speaker 0,Reporter,alright so but let's let's let's talk about the games because still like the the bowling obviously is very important uh-huh is it like who is the custom who like what let me say this like outside the special events of course who is your typical customer of a pinscher
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,our our customer is anyone that appreciates quality mhmm so it's everything from a 6 year old to a 4 year old birthday party to 3 generations playing bocce together grandparents singles couples we're not 18 and over after 9 pm on a friday night so you come to pinstripes you may see a wedding going on and 6 other parties and a grandmother with their grandkids it's it's just a community melting pot mhmm intentionally so
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah now do you do bowling leagues are they big lebowski style bowling leagues or is it targeted at just regular
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,less so leagues really we we do so many events that it's a little difficult for us to put aside the lanes for leagues and and and our locations generally we have anywhere from 12 to 16 18 lanes so we we we don't have 24 36 lanes where we can afford to put aside 12 16 lanes for leagues
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm what was the like because you added bocce ball later on why why bocce ball like why why do that bocce i i had well i
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,had seen bocce bertucci's in boston i was at harvard business school i used to enjoy it there i was golfing in scotland for nearly 20 years in a row in scotland it's lawn bowling and some good friends recommended when i was putting the pieces together for pince rice with initially just bowling to check out a bocce concept in los gatos campo de bacci i saw it and loved it and so decided to marry bocce with bowling so that we wouldn't one dimensionally just be a bowling martini bar like some of the other players at the time that were one dimensionally just bowling concepts so that's how we married the 2 yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,so alright so you spent most of your career doing things that did not have anything to do with restaurants correct or bowling actually for that matter except you know periodically bowling yourself did anything about this business surprise you when you got into it when you
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,plenty of things it it it takes takes a while to learn any new business you know we were fortunate with our first location in chicago we were busy certainly took a couple years to choreograph the right labor model and the right balance between private events and bowling and bocce what we call open play when people just show up in the venue so that took time and and just breaking the stereotype generally speaking when people hear bowling they assume that the food is just going to be fair and that is difficult to do so you're so you like others even if we say our food is elevated they still stereotypically assume that well it's maybe finger food so that takes time and not always easy to do
Speaker 0,Reporter,no well i mean i think the consideration set in most bowling alleys is not to eat correct it's just not you're going there to bowl and and food is almost like a secondary consideration you know and then you just and maybe you might get food correct
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,whereas whereas at pinstripe right we have many of our guests that come just for lunch and they just eat they may have old or had a party with us in the past same with dinner so we're a restaurant with entertainment not a bowling alley with food mhmm big big distinction
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah now that said you know i mean i live in minneapolis and i'm pretty certain you're probably aware of it like we have a local just a local bowling alley bryant lake bowl on lake street
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,in minneapolis
Speaker 0,Reporter,and most people don't actually even think of it as a bowling alley because the food is generally really good so it's sort of
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,and and and minneapolis had bricks it had a bocce concept on the roof yeah downtown minneapolis as well that that that we had checked out a number of times
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm yeah so alright so how many locations are you at today
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,so we're at 16 for another 4 days we're opening orlando friday i've been looking at that market for 16 years so we're we're beyond excited orlando's a very sizable exciting market and yeah our grand opening is this friday
Speaker 0,Reporter,oh yeah oh wow so you're probably just gonna head right over there aren't you
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,i'll head back to chicago early tomorrow and then i'll head to orlando late thursday
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm to to be with the team alright so now how like you you with those kind of size locations what kind of real estate are you targeting
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,"size wise we target 20 to 30,000 square feet sweet spot now is about 25,000 we generally prefer 2 level space and in any case we we we we like very attractive space next to exciting cotenants san mateo we're next to apple we're next to and above apple walnut creek they were opening in a couple months we're taking over the crate and barrel next to apple mhmm so we like being in the mix in in in some of the high quality lifestyle centers or developments around the country mhmm"
Speaker 0,Reporter,is it i mean would you say that is like from your standpoint for your types is it is it plentiful is the real estate plentiful what kind of like or or is it is it a challenge finding these type of sites
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,little of both it's it's plentiful in that there's a tremendous amount of locations so macy's jcpenney sears all these big boxes that are closing present opportunities for us and others the the the fun challenge is to be discriminate and make sure we just pick the right sites so you know we're 16 we'll open 3 to 4 locations in the next 6 8 months so we're always gonna try to stay discriminate we're doing bellevue we're doing seattle but at the right properties there's still some very attractive real estate
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah yeah is it like i mean a lot of operators talk about like either 2nd generation units or i mean to your point you know like converting you know old retail you know closed retail sites but like sometimes those locations are closed for a reason right like there might be either traffic issues or for whatever reason the site doesn't work like how do you know these days that that's
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,"sometimes that's the case sears is an example so some of these large 180,000 square foot sears boxes that that's more a function of sears' demise than where that particular sears might sit you know we just opened an aventura mall in florida the sears sat right between nordstrom's and bloomingdale's in a phenomenal location our san mateo site was an old sears so the the the the fact that some of these large boxes boxes come back is not necessarily a check against them in terms of traffic or sight lines it's more opportunistically the developers are taking back phenomenal real estate where maybe historically these large boxes were paying them below market rent and they could spend some capital and do their magic and add us and some others into the mix mhmm"
Speaker 0,Reporter,alright so what are your plans what is what is the plans for development over the next like 3 to 5 years
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,we're we'll we'll look to open 6 to 8 locations a year over the next 10 15 years white space for us is a 100 150 locations all over the us and then we'll have some fun overseas more of a licensed franchise model in due time but yeah we'll we'll continue to grow at a very controlled but exciting pace mhmm
Speaker 0,Reporter,now you just completed a combination did you not correct so we did
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,i'll i'll use the accounting term lifo last in first out we were the last company to go public december 29th and the first to list on january 2nd so yeah we went public via us back as the vehicle and we've been public for about 3 months now
Speaker 0,Reporter,now why did you choose that route
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,to raise some additional capital to set us up for the next 20 30 years
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,"so myself and our team we're about 2,000 team members now and we wanna do this for quite a while and the awareness these types of podcasts and others that sometimes come from being a being a public company can help with sales mhmm can help with awareness and breaking the stereotype that we talked about a few minutes ago so those are and and and admittedly some of their recruiting benefits now that we're a public company that that helps as well"
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah right so how did the like how did this back process work was it i've generally heard you can correct me if i'm wrong but somebody once told me that every ceo would rather go public via spac than a traditional ipo because it's easier can be that there's pros and cons of both yeah
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,in in our case the ar spac partner banyan was operators so jerry hyman joined our board which is attractive and the i the traditional ipo market was closed last year mhmm arguably it's closed now
Speaker 0,Reporter,it is still closed
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,so it's still closed so that spac vehicle for us was an opportunity for us to make limoncello out of lemons and come out of covid in in an exciting way and access the market when we may not otherwise have been able to
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah yeah the the yeah the ipo market for restaurants is still mostly closed unless you are a certain type of concept uh-huh and i've never quite understood why but for some reason the the ipo window i didn't necessarily bring you on here to rant about the ipo market but i'm going to do it anyway it's just very narrow and like if you you can only get in in a certain and if you can't like if if it and then then it is only open to very certain types of companies i've been doing this for a long time and there's just long stretches without any ipos in the restaurant space the number of publicly traded restaurant companies yeah has shrunk and basically it means that companies like yours you know that have like growth plenty of growth potential have sort of a limited option of capital like that mhmm isn't necessarily available to you as as an option yeah
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,no that's true i mean we had started some s one ipo preparations 3 4 years ago mhmm before covid and even again during covid but to your point the traditional market wasn't open and so we opportunistically pivoted and that's how we that's how we effectuated our spac partnership
Speaker 0,Reporter,alright so probably the last question what what anything keeping you up at night right now anything that's concerning you for the in terms of just generally speaking with your business
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,people i mean as we scale our business the the the balance and challenge for us is we we we wanna continue add locations but we don't want to be a chain so we we we don't wanna lose the special collection of locations we have and the special team members so you need processes you need sops you you need some of the structure that comes with scaling but we don't we we we don't wanna lose that magic sauce so it's a it's a balance right it's a balance
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah yeah it's always always a difficult one yeah gail i really appreciate you joining me this week on the podcast absolutely love it
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,likewise thank you super
