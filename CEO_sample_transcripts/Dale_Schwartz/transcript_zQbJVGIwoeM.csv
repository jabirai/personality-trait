Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,"sure so pit stripes is a unique best in class combination of phenomenal food and entertainment bowling and bocce in our case coupled with private event space so we host a 1,000 events a year each location each year weddings bar mitzvahs birthday parties corporate events had the name pinstripe 33 years ago coined it i was gonna buy a bowling alley in manhattan with a couple friends didn't do it waited about 10 15 years and then 18 years ago i said life's too short let's do it and we've been doing it for the last 18 years"
Speaker 0,Reporter,great now i went to your chicago location had a great time but for those who don't know tell us what makes the pinstripe experience special
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,well our venues are large these are 25 30000 square foot beautiful venues so first the aesthetics and venue design is sophisticated fun upscale the quality of our food scratch kitchen is phenomenal so which is the antithesis to most entertainment concepts the caliber of our food our team the the passion and and culture that we've established is again a unique factor and then finally we're just choreographing all these different pieces bowling and bocce and banquet space and bistro and sunday brunch and live music and celebrations so it's it's it's a magical commingled choreographic event celebration venue
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay now you recently went public on the nyse under the ticker pnst tell us about that experience
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,so to use the accounting term it it was lifo right last in first out so we were the last company in calendar 23 to go public on the new york stock exchange the first to list with our ticker symbol in 2024 we've been exploring accessing the public markets for 5 years now this particular spac vehicle was just an exciting way for for us to go public last year and strike while the iron's hot our business did extraordinarily well through covid and after covid so we're excited for the next 20 30 year stage now that we're a public company
Speaker 0,Reporter,great now i know you're all over the chicago area tell us how many locations you have and where you plan to expand
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,so we currently have 15 in 10 states 4 in chicago minneapolis kansas cleveland george town bethesda fort worth houston san mateo la and then florida we just opened avicura we'll open another 4 locations the next few months orlando 4 miles away we're opening in february gardens day plaza we'll open in a few weeks in jersey and then in april we're opening walnut creek and coral gables and then we'll do jacksonville later this year probably 2 locations in greater seattle later this year and then another 30 40 that are earmarked for call it calendar 25 26 and then we're looking at international sites as well so we're staying busy
Speaker 0,Reporter,what do you look for when you're when you're looking for new locations
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,a we first look for quality markets so a markets with the right demographics and residential population the right business density and then within those markets we look for really attractive strong property lifestyle centers or iconic locations it has to be something special increasingly we look for a very exciting cotenancy whether it's apple eataly anthropologie hermes etcetera we like being near that type of tenant mix which which lends itself to all the foot traffic and quality foot traffic of
Speaker 0,Reporter,customer okay in your mind what are your strengths and how do you differentiate yourself from your competitors
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,so one key strength as i mentioned earlier is food so our f and b is 70% of our sales yeah most of our peers data busters topgolf main event etcetera so key differentiator we're a restaurant venue with entertainment we're not categorically a bowling alley with food so that's a key differentiator number 2 is just the overall ambiance and and quality it's it's quality drinking we don't serve red bull we have a phenomenal wine list phenomenal craft beers but but we want drinking in a quality way and then as i mentioned our locations every location there's an outside oasis element that's a really important part of the equation we felt that before covid and certainly during and after covid outdoor settings people love just the outdoors there's the psychological safe element of it but just something aspirational of looking up at the stars and or seeing a sunset outside
Speaker 0,Reporter,tell us a little bit about your growth strategy
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,we're gonna grow at a controlled pace so as i mentioned we'll look to open a 150 some locations all over the us over the next 15 20 years we'll open 6 to 8 locations a year in the us all company owned we'll certainly never franchise in the us our real estate partners are very helpful in terms of capital and and and and other benefits and then overseas we've already started discussions with a number of partners or potential partners in whether it's mexico city or sydney or dubai or tel aviv or london canada and and there we'll partner with the right landlord or operators that'll bring local expertise training hiring issues and and we'll bring our brand and and kiddeep arts in terms of training
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay last question how do you view the road ahead for the entertainment and dining category
Speaker 1,Dale Schwartz,quality wins the the experiential trends are there they're they're they're they're accelerating they're even more real post covid the amazon effect is not ending so all of the online shopping trends are are are making people need that those social interactions all of the work from home means that people can bump into each other less in the office they need that interaction outside of the office so the trends are there and quality wins there's there's we certainly have plenty of other competitors and others that are playing in the space we're gonna keep playing in it in a elevated way and if we stay true to that we'll win because we'll we'll stay true to terrific quality
