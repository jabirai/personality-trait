Speaker 0,Reporter,"welcome to another episode of the business of biotech summer executive sessions edition i'm matt piller chief editor at bioprocess online and your host for this week's up close and personal conversation with doctor christopher anzalone president ceo and director at arrowhead pharmaceuticals doctor anzalone was an nih supported postdoctoral fellow in reproductive endocrinology at the smithsonian institution's conservation and research center prior to managing private equity for galloway partners and prior to the founding of his own nanobiotechnology private equity firm the bennett group in 2,005 he joined arrowhead which boasts a deep pipeline of therapies developed to silence the genes that cause intractable diseases using rna chemistry back in 2007 today we're going to learn a little bit more about doctor anzalone his company and why they're both committed to taking rna interference beyond the liver doctor anzalone welcome to the show"
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,thanks very much good to be here
Speaker 0,Reporter,did i get all that right did i make any mistakes in your your brief intro there
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,far so good
Speaker 0,Reporter,alright good good so i wanna start at a high level and and learn a little bit about you and kinda what led into the the founding of of arrowhead so i'll start with a very simple question when you made that move what what was the inspiration behind making the move from private equity and taking the reins at arrowhead
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,yeah so so i didn't i didn't start arrowhead arrowhead was was an existing company at the time it was publicly traded
Speaker 0,Reporter,so there's the there's there's my first mistake of many correct me
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,no it's it was it was an existing company there were two things that that intrigued me about that opportunity one was that it was a turnar it was a broken company with a broken business model and i thought that was an interesting challenge it was it was an unfocused company it was a nanotechnology holding company at the time with the idea that that it was providing exposure to these nanotechnology opportunities to the public investor and so it had a number of majority owned subsidiaries underneath it and again that model didn't seem to work to me at least because there were no synergy among those companies and it was gonna be very difficult for any investors to really understand the business right so anyway so it was a it was a it was a turnaround that was interesting to me but second and probably more importantly was that they had a small rnai company called kolando pharmaceuticals as one of its subsidiaries and and and as they as i looked at at what they had that was interesting and i thought that was the future you know if you could harness rna interference and and gosh i think i won the nobel prize in 2006 or thereabouts and so it was it was a brand new technology when i joined yeah but it was it was it was potentially so powerful that that i thought look let's i would be interested in taking the reins here if we could rationalize the business and make it a more traditional biotech company and focus only on that technology and so i told them look you know if you wanna do that i'll do it if you don't that's okay too we can have beers and be friends but but i'm not gonna join the company otherwise and and the board was very generous with respect to to that sort of freedom and so we decided to do it and i i thought i needed a good year of upmarket to to to fix that business because you know it's it's a it was a it was a a a capital intensive business that was not well understood and and so i needed some i thought i needed some some win at my back and i had i got a quarter you know march of 2008 rolls around and and bear stearns goes belly up and and then all hell breaks loose so it took it took longer to rationalize the business than i expected but we were able to do it still
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah and in relatively short order i mean you talk about the you know the recession impacting things you talk about taking a small element of the company and its rnai technology and kind of focusing on that and and like i said within short order by 2011 you your your company really you know put itself out there by acquiring roche's rnai assets and then and just a few years later buying all of novartis' rnai assets which by the way there's a a great story my colleague rob wright the chief editor at life science leader wrote a really great story on your company that kind of walked through those purchases i believe it was in our april 2020 issue of life science leader so check that out but as i said you you you really you know took something small had some headwinds right off the bat but then made some very significant investments kinda stuck the company's neck out to acquire that technology what is it about this technology that makes you so confident and willing to to to make those moves
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,well first of all so so you say short order short order for you in retrospect you know when when we were living it it was long order you know big time you know it was it was a difficult time you know in the in the world much less you know to be at a company that's capital intensive and and trying to fix itself it's funny as a quick aside i remember i was talking to my father you know during this whole period and and and he said he said are you sorry that you made the move you know because because you you've seemed happy at you know at the at the prior job and and now now it's difficult here and i said i said actually i view the whole the whole meltdown as a gift you know because the only way to know how to to you know to dig yourself out of out of the mother of all holes is to dig yourself out of the mother of all of all holes and hopefully i don't have to do that again but but but i learned how to do it so anyway so it it took a while but we got there so to your question you know what you know what drew what what what drew us to to making those bets i think i think that rnai is the best bet in biotech and that sounds like hyperbole but i really i believed it then i believed it now you know it is it's it is it is a a a mechanism with surgical precision you know if you do it right you can you can silence a single gene and that is extraordinarily powerful you know again if you do it right and if you and if you are if you are addressing the right gene there is just nothing with that sort of with that sort of specificity so that that that alone is is extraordinarily powerful for a number of of different disease states second it's non permanent you know people talk about gene therapy this crispr and and and the like and those are you know that's an interesting idea but the permanence of that is frightening at least right now you know there's a long way to go i think for from my perspective between now and and being comfortable with changing somebody's genome for goodness sakes you know the first person that needs to be uncrisparized makes me nervous and so the the the the the lack of permanence of rnai is attractive to me but then you layer on top of that the durability of this it was it's a really amazing combination you know we've got we have some drugs that that that that show you know activity for more than 6 months and so it's a pretty it's a pretty neat idea that you can turn off a single gene you know with a single subcutaneous injection for over 6 months and again if you choose that gene right i think that's gonna change a lot of lives and so so you know those things those things made this an opportunity that we just needed to jump on yeah and we need to continue to you know to to push forward i think
Speaker 0,Reporter,yep yeah and in that in that response you you said you know if it's done right if you choose the gene properly i wanna ask a question about some of those ifs that sort of predates my immersion in the space so forgive me but i i read you know in the earlier days of rnai therapy there were some off target effect and toxicity and delivery method challenges that were were were perhaps difficult to overcome at the time maybe maybe that alludes to some of those ifs can you kinda walk us through how arrowhead has tackled some of those challenges
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,right yeah so the ifs that i talk about there don't relate to that but but but
Speaker 0,Reporter,oh okay
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,but i'll i'll talk about those so first so so you mentioned the you know off target effects toxicity you know that that is a single problem and that problem is delivery that has been the cornerstone the you know the the challenge of this industry from the get go and and it took us in the field you know the whole field over a decade you know to wrestle that to the ground but we i think we finally gotten there you know the the so just to take a step back you know what we are doing is we're introducing a small rna molecule into a certain cell right you know and that rna molecule which is you know a small number of of of all the nucleotides will will initiate this this natural process of of down regulating the expression of a certain gene right so so that small rna molecule is inert it doesn't do anything you know it's not toxic it's it's it's perfectly acceptable that which we put on it or or or or put around it you know can can confer that toxicity and so when we were when the whole field was struggling with how do we deliver these these small fragile molecules we were sticking on on those molecules these toxic things and so it took us a while to understand how to just strip that away and make it a very simple at least at least conceptually process and that process is is a small you know rna molecule that you chemically modify so it's so it's not gonna be degraded if you do that correctly you can do that in a in a reasonably non toxic way and then you you you tether to that a targeted ligand you know some molecule that will naturally bind a certain cell type and be and be absorbed by that cell type if you can do all those things then you can get your molecule into the right cell at the right time and again it took it took a a long time to to to really understand that science but but we're there and you know i think of of innovation in sort of 2 large buckets right there's science and there's and there's engineering science is is is is harder than engineering in my mind because it's unknown engineering is once you have something that works you you optimize it we are absolutely in the engineering phase of rnai at least as it relates to delivery to to deliver cells so so you know so you know that's the those are the challenges around toxicity that you mentioned and such the ifs that i mentioned are really knowable ifs you know these are these are you know if we turn off this target gene what will happen in a lot of in a lot of situations that is a knowable thing you know we talk about about genetically validated targets a lot and and one of the things we mean by that is is is understanding you know genes that are that are that are not expressed in certain humans right and and and and if you can study those people you can understand if there is a negative phenotype associated with the lack of of expression of that one gene so so so you know if you if you do it right and if you and if you if you can find these genetically validated targets you have a good idea about about negative things that could happen if you turn that off and so and so if you if you can get beyond that and say okay you yes if you turn off that gene a good thing will happen and bad things look like will not happen now how do you make sure that you're not knocking down other genes right because you know other genes could have can have similar similar sequences and that is generally a knowable thing as well because the you know the human genome is sequenced and so and so you know we can it is a known unknown if you will you know to to paraphrase don rumsfeld sure and that that's also what's really attractive about this field is that is that the the the the number of of known unknowns is is relatively high and so i think we can go into clinical studies relatively derisked you know a small molecule to know a small molecule is to know a small molecule you don't know you know how it's gonna interact with other cells you don't know how it's gonna interact with with other organ systems and such and so and so you go into clinical studies not knowing a lot and and that's why that's why drugs fail in clinical trials with rna interference i think that you go in knowing heck of a lot more
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah okay the business of biotech is produced by bioprocess online in partnership with cytiva if you're the leader of an early to clinical stage biotech you need to check out the resources that are hand curated for people like you at citivilifesciences.com/emergingbiotech the knowledge center there is chock full of articles webinars videos podcasts and other content that's ultra focused on helping new and emerging biotechs chart the course to the clinic and beyond check it out citivalifesciences.com/emergingbiotech i wanna shift gears here a little bit and and get into the liver your recent focus has been on taking rnai beyond the liver but before we discuss your vision for new indications couple questions let let's talk about where the therapy stands with your initial targets which i believe are the hepatitis b virus and alpha one liver disease and maybe give us a little color on why that was sort of the genesis area for rnai technology
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,right so so first of all and and and let me circle back to to your question but first of all we've got we've got other liver directed drugs we are going to have hepatitis b and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency related liver disease but we have other ones as well that we'll talk about in a second okay so so the reason that the liver was was a good initial organ target was that it's a clearance organ right so so you know it wants us to soak up things from the blood and so it it is it is relatively speaking straightforward to bring in molecules into into not all liver cells but hepatocytes you know you know these because because that's one of their jobs so that's a b the field not just us but the field has identified good targeting ligands you know good good molecules that that are taken up rapidly by hepatocytes and so you you know you combine those two things and and and and hepatocytes are really tailor made for you know for rnai that's a good news the other piece of good news there is that there are an awful lot of good targets you can go after they're you know the liver makes a lot of things and so so there are a lot of opportunities you know to to gen to to develop really powerful medicines if you can only focus on the liver and so that was that was clearly an important space for us but we thought more broadly you know to really you know to really extract all the value from rna interference and to really revolutionize you know medicine you know not to put too fine a point on it we needed to bring rnai outside the liver you know because there are other diseases you know that that that needed to be addressed so so that was that that that that's that was our thinking on this now back to the to to our compounds that are liver focused as you mentioned we have one that's partnered with johnson and johnson against hepatitis b infection that seemed to be an important opportunity for us because because it is a great unmet medical need you know there may be 300 you know to 350 you know 1000000 people on the planet with with chronic hepatitis b infection there's no cure and we thought that we could play there and so far so far you know i think that we've got a you know a powerful medicine that that could lead to functional cures you know we'll see the other one you mentioned was was alpha one antitrypsin deficiency related liver disease this also wasn't was we think a strong unmet medical need it's a much smaller market of course but but the biology of that seemed clear you know we know that that in these patients there is a a protein that that that is produced that can cause liver disease in in a subpopulation of those people and we thought we could turn that off and we're in the process of of showing that right now we think that's important but beyond those 2 you know look we we also have a program a cardiovascular program that we partnered with with amgen against something called lp little a it's a it is a genetically validated target that that appears in some individuals it appears that the elevated levels of this are so are are an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease and so we're excited about their progress there internally we've got 2 cardiometabolic programs one called aro apoc 3 that is a triglyceride lowering drug and we showed recently that we can lower triglycerides by 95 percent in patients you know it's just stunning and there's nothing out there that that can do that we don't i don't think the other one is called aro ang3 that looks like it can lower triglycerides as well as lower ldl or so called bad cholesterol and and will lower that ldl on top of the lowering that you see with statins and and and other modalities again in patients we've seen you know 85% reduction in triglycerides with aro ang3 and 40% reduction of ldl so we think that's a really powerful cardiometabolic medicine as well you then go to to nash you know this is this is you know a disease of of of of increasing focus you know with big pharma and and we have a a genetically validated target that we're going after called called hsd they the drug is is is aro hsd we are treating healthy volunteers and patients right now what am i forgetting i guess so those are our our liver directed medicines right now
Speaker 0,Reporter,yep yep so and before we kinda shift gears into other indications have there been any particular process or manufacturing challenges leading up to your you know your journey into phase 2 that that i guess posed a particular conundrum for you that needed to be overcome
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,yeah that's a good question you know we've spent a lot of time on on on manufacturing internally no we you know we have redundant suppliers and so we also use cmos to to manufacture for us but but we really wanted to you know to be able to control that more than we were in the past and so and so we have the ability now to make gmp grade material and and we'll scale that up you know we a a hallmark of our company has been speed and that was one area that we saw that we could really shave months off off program time schedules by by controlling our own manufacturing at least at least in the early stages
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm yeah good so yeah let's let's move beyond the liver then what indications are you targeting beyond liver disease and what's the scientific rationale behind their prioritization like how did you go about choosing these targets
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,sure so so let let's look at that chronologically i guess we started looking at at solid tumor delivery some time ago years ago for a couple reasons you know first we thought that that could be you know a a a potential next next cell type that we can go after but also we viewed that as a test kitchen right you know we learned an awful lot about how to bring molecules into cells that were not hepatocytes via that program so you know many years later we we we came up with with this platform we think is a franchise unto itself that allows us to to to deliver to solid tumors our first program there is against renal cell carcinoma and we are we are in a phase 1 2 study right now with that i think that that's important because because i i think it's potentially important medicine for renal cell carcinoma and i think will be one of those really uncommon oncology drugs that that doesn't make you sick and so should be mhmm combinable with a number of other of other chemotherapeutics and so we're excited about that but it's also the sharp end of the spear i think once we show that we are knocking down the target gene in this case hif2 alpha in these solid tumors then then then it is proof of concept that we can get into solid tumors and then we can then we can rapidly you know blow out that pipeline and go after other tumor types go after you know other gene targets so so certainly solid tumors is important one but what has moved even faster than that is lung you know we we we started working on delivering to to pulmonary epithelial cells several years ago and we've gotten really good at that we have we have one compound right now called aeroenac in the in the clinic and we'll we'll be dosing patients shortly i believe my hope is that over the next you know month or so we can start dosing patients the initial indication there is cystic fibrosis we are going after a validated target that that big pharma has tried to go after in the past but but could not for various reasons we think rnai is is uniquely suited for this and importantly it's administered via inhalation and so that's a big step forward for us you know we think it's it's a powerful medicine for cystic fibrosis and and you look at that at that landscape and you say okay well vertex has done a great job with cf and they certainly have but there but there are there are there are large pockets of of patients that are not served by by existing drugs and we think that that we can help them quite quickly and then and then we'll see how we expand beyond that so so you know aeroenap or you know the the cf program as with our solid tumor program is we think a powerful medicine for the target population of going after cystic fibrosis patients but we think it's also a good proof of concept once we show you know that that we are that we are doing what we intend to do in the lung we can rapidly expand that pipeline and the lung is a target rich organ you know we have already we said publicly that that we expect to you know to file to begin clinical studies for our next lung program you know by the very end of this year we haven't said what target is we haven't said what the what the gene target is we we have said it it's against copd but but i think that we'll have i think that will will be that's near term and then i think next year we'll have 1 or maybe 2 additional lung drugs in the clinic again i think i think i think that's a very important set of programs for us and for the field because again it's a target rich environment there are an awful lot of indications that we can go after using rnai that that are undruggable by by by other mechanisms so we're excited about that and then we also have said that that we are targeting skeletal muscle i expect that we'll we'll be in the clinic there the first half of of next year we haven't set the target we haven't set the the indication but we view that as also important so you know by the middle of next year we'll be in what hepatocytes lung solid tumor and muscle cells so we with 4 different cell types and then i think next year maybe towards the end of the year there's a reasonable chance that we could be at our next cell type and so i think you know we are we are pushing this technology forward as quickly as we can into as many new areas as we can
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so i i gotta ask you how that affects you as the leader of the organization and how it affects the organization just from a tooling up standpoint from a hiring standpoint an organizational standpoint when you have such a variety of indications and cell types that you're tackling is the with this particular technology is there a bunch of change that has to happen to be able to move into these new indications or or is it you know sort of a one size fits all approach
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,"yeah well so the g forces will kill you you know we're we're probably we're we're moving so quickly yeah but i tell you you know from a from a fluffy standpoint right you know you know not you know from a from a an emotional standpoint this is where you wanna be you know i you know i i think that the people here and i and i certainly speak for myself but i think the other people here at arrowhead you know have have a really good reason to get up in the morning because this is exciting science i think we are pushing medicine quickly and and there will be literally you know 100 of 1,000 and millions of people whose lives will be affected by the work people are doing at aerovet today and and because we because we're so fast people can see this right you know it's you know people can see the movement of of of of of developing new science and then and then how that how that fits into people's lives you know in a pretty short period of time it's it's extraordinarily exciting and i tell you it's a gift that we all we all appreciate you know that it's unique that we get to do this anyway so the fluffy aside the the nuts and bolts are are are complicated it's not one size fits all what we have going for us is that is that they all leverage rna interference and so we can be experts in rna interference and the chemistry of rna interference that that's that and that's scalable and that that's applicable to everything we're going after you know the molecule doesn't care what gene it's knocking down right you know it can be it can be you know a a a epithelial sodium channel cell or sorry a gene in in in pulmonary epithelial cells or it can be an alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency you know target in in in hepatocytes it doesn't matter so so that that's scalable the challenge here is is is scaling our ability you know to get into these new cell types and understanding new targeting ligands and understanding you know pk you know how do you extend how do you expand the pk you know in these new molecules you know to to to have enough interaction with with cell surface receptors in new cell types you know that's all complicated and that's not one size fits all you've gotta be you've gotta be pretty good in other areas so it so that's a challenge and and and having enough biology expertise in these new areas to ask the right questions but i'll tell you and this is gonna sound a little bit any intellectual but i but but bear with me i tell you i think it's i think it is helpful for us not to be deep incumbents in some of the areas we're going after you know if you look at at at at who drives true innovation who drives paradigm shifts it's it's infrequently the deep incumbents because they're they're mired in dogma it is the outsiders who ask who ask dumb questions you know and and who can approach a new area you know with almost childlike naivete right you know to say well wouldn't it be cool if you could do x you know i wonder if we can do y and it is it is very often the newcomers who can ask those those fresh questions and it is my hope that that by by by expanding our reach into these new areas that we can continue to ask those really you know probing innovative questions"
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah well if it weren't for childlike naivete and dumb questions i wouldn't have a job so i appreciate the
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,the the reference there and i i when i say i appreciate it i mean it sticks so how do you you you mentioned the you mentioned these challenges because it's not one size fits all and the fact that you have to have you know very deep expertise in the in the biology for each of these indications how like just just give me some some time on how you go about is is that as simple as you know attracting the people with the intellectual capital to to move those those forward what what's the what's the the key there
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,sure so so so let me start with with we try to make life as easy for ourselves as we can and one of the ways we do that is to focus on well validated targets right so so you know there there there there are more than 2 ways but i think the way i think of it there there are 2 primary ways you can you can you can address these sorts of things one is to is to is to be very deep in the biology of a disease and and and push that disease biology forward and find new ways to address that disease that's that's important and it's good in it but it's hard and and and requires years of experience in a certain disease area the second way is to is to stand on the shoulders of that first group of people and and and go after these these well validated targets and so you're not having to to invent if you will new biology that's where we start you know and so if you if you look at at everything we do we have not we have we have not invented new new gene targets we've gone after those that have been that have been studied for quite some time but have not been able to be addressed in a in a therapeutic manner we view that as a as as a good model for us now at some point you you might run out of those in which case you've gotta you've got to roll up your sleeves and and do more basic biology work but but for now you know we can we can focus on those and i tell you that's important for a few reasons 1 it derisks these these programs and so we go into the clinic i think with a level of of risk that is there's less than than than most small molecules if you will because because we're you know we we have a we have pretty good confidence that rnai is a is a is a reliable process and we also have have have good understanding that the gene targets we're going after are important for a certain disease process so so it it's certainly helpful from that standpoint and also allows us to move a bit more quickly right you know we can we can we can stand on the shoulders of these of these biologists who have done good important work in these areas and then and and and and create these medicines pretty quickly you know what we have shown is is we've gone from from idea to the clinic in 12 to 18 months you know in in many of our at least hepatocyte target programs and that's unheard of in the field it's just unheard of yeah and that's and look it's important for our company clearly but but you know we always think about this from the patient's perspective this is important for patients because you know if you are a patient in need of these medicines every day that they don't have access to these medicines is a bad day for them and so and so you know we we we tell our our our our people that all the time that that those patients are our bosses and think about what they need and that drives us
Speaker 0,Reporter,excellent so i mentioned earlier your acquisition of novartis novartis' rnai assets back in 2015 and as you know this year novartis got back in the rnai game with the medicine company the acquisition of the medicine company and it's rnai heart drug inclisiran did i pronounce that
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,correctly yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so what that makes me curious about your assessment of the competitive landscape in this space the i guess increasing or renewed interest in taking rnai beyond the liver what's what's your take on that
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,sure the the the world has has come around rnai you know it it is it is well accepted now that this is a this is a validated therapeutic modality that can do things that other modalities can't do and and that look it's not the right for for all diseases but there are a lot of indications where where you know this is a powerful modality people get that now you know you talk about about novartis getting back into space and and you know people have asked about that and you know they they say you know do you think novartis feels foolish about this and such and and the answer is absolutely not i think i think that's an example of of our industry working the way it should work you know small biotech companies are just better and faster at innovation than big pharma i think big pharma would even would even accept that yeah and so so the world should rely on us to do that innovation now big pharma is really good at later stage you know large clinical studies and obviously you know quite good at distributors distributing and manufacturing drugs they should focus on those things and this is a good example of that i think it's a good partnership you know alnylam and then medicines company you know push that drug forward and then novartis is gonna do what they do well and and bring it to the masses i think that's it's a really nice case study as how as to how biopharma should work
Speaker 0,Reporter,yep cool yeah that's a refreshing response so we're running short on time doctor anzalone i know you need to get get running but i wanna give you an opportunity to share some concluding thoughts knowing that our audience is comprised of folks who are perhaps first time leaders of new and emerging biopharmas perhaps those who have been around the block a few different times but are working on new indications with new therapeutics and new companies new organizations so whether it's you know i guess directly related to the emergence of rnai or just you know from the perspective of of a successful leader what concluding thoughts would you leave for for this group of people
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,yeah you know i don't know i think this is very exciting time so covid be damned look i think this is a very exciting time in rna interference it is it is it's finally validated and and and and you know i think i think we are now just starting the process of bringing this you know into into into the world for you know for various diseases and i think that we are in the first inning to mix on my metaphors the first inning of this game and i think i think you'll see over the next several years dozens of really powerful medicines that will be coming to to patients i think it's really exciting more broadly look i think it's exciting time to be in biopharma you know there's an awful lot of exciting new new technologies that are that are moving by historical standards quite quickly so you know look i think it's a great time to be in this field and it's and and look i'm proud to be in this field you know we're doing good things and and you know depending upon the the the time of year and what politicians are talking about we can sometimes get a get a bad rap but i think that that people need to stay focused on on what our what our priorities are here and it's it is to make important medicines that will that will affect people's lives and i think we're good at doing that
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah i was just having a conversation with someone a little bit earlier today about the fact that it it seemed like just what 6 8 months ago pharma and biopharma was sort of the favorite you know excuse the the the worn out metaphor but red headed stepchild of of the of the government right and now you know there's an opportunity for for us to be the the the saviors the heroes amen yeah well doctor anzalone keep up the good work congratulations on your success to date and thank you very much for spending some time with us i really appreciate it
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,it's a pleasure thanks very much matt
