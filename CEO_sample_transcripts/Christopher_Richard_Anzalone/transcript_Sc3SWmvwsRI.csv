Speaker 0,Reporter 1,there are certain stocks we get asked about all the time especially speculative biotech names when you really nail one of these wow the gains can be enormous which is why corso often get excited about them take arrowhead pharmaceuticals this is a development stage gene therapy company arrowhead is trying to treat rare genetic disorders by effectively silencing and that's the key term silencing the genes that cause them using what's known as rna interference technology over the past few years this stock has rallied from just $104 to just over $36 that's an 800% gain no wonder we're always getting called about i gave him a blessing to speculate on this one as part of my homework piece a little over a month ago so he said it's up another 20% i like that arrowhead has a bunch of positive catalyst coming including big r and d d day in new york city right here that takes place tomorrow and before they talk to professionals they're visiting us to share their story with you the home gamers so let's check-in with christopher anzalone he's the president and ceo of arrowhead pharmaceuticals learn more about his company and its prospects mister anzalone welcome to man money good to see you sir
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,hey jimmy
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,have a seat good to see you well our viewers are the smartest on tv because they see that you have a lot of prospects and more important that you have great partners big deep pocketed partners that can do terrific things including pay you some giant milestone fees can you walk through what those are and what why they're excited about silencing genes and maybe some new things that are gonna happen that you'll reveal tomorrow
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,sure thanks jim so look we have a partnership with j and j for our hepatitis b drug as well as three new targets they will bring to us that we will build new drugs around we also have a partnership with amgen for a cardiovascular drug that we developed and they are developing that in the clinic and they will commercialize that i think that that what they saw was a really powerful technology that as you say can silence genes that cause disease and it it it is a hyper specific process whereby we can we can silence a single gene and it is now a validated technology so we know it works we know that we can do it in a well tolerated manner and to the extent that we choose the right genes we could have a a a substantial effect on people's lives
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,"now j and j your deal there is humongous what's 250,000,000 begin 3 what more than 3,000,000,000 in milestone payments over time how does that work so our viewers know what to see"
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,sure so so the deal is this is is this it is for our hepatitis b drug that they have now moved into a phase 2 study and it is also for 3 new targets they will bring to us and we we view that as found value these are targets these are gene targets they will bring to us and we'll and we will develop drugs around them they don't come from our pipeline and so as as we push those or as they push those drugs through the clinic and into commercialization they will pay us milestone payments and then after commercialization they will pay us royalties
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,how about the amgen affiliation
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,very similar that's for for a drug against cardiovascular disease again this is a drug that we developed and they came in and and and saw that it it should it should fit well with their portfolio and they will bring it to the clinic and then commercialize it
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,okay so silencing a gene can you silence more than one gene
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,so that's an interesting question so so the short answer until until today really was was not really rna interference as you say is a is a method of silencing a gene and it can be used now therapeutically to treat diseases we viewed 2 big possibilities with the with the technology that we wanted to to to advance 1 was bringing rna interference outside the liver the the field has gotten pretty good at silencing genes within the liver and you know what there are a lot of important medicines that can be developed by silencing liver derived or liver expressed genes but also to your point we viewed a big possibility of of silencing more than one gene and tomorrow we'll talk about that a bit but we have advanced that and so now we can do 2 things that i think are quite important a we can bring rnai interference to new organ systems by the end of this year we'll have our first drug in the clinic that will be targeting solid tumors the middle of next year will be in the lungs for cystic fibrosis the end of the year will be in in muscle cells we'll talk about that a bit and also we'll talk about the ability now to silence more than one gene and that opens up whole host of new diseases i think
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,now i i know from what from vertex cystic fibrosis is really hard and horrible disease how do you know that it might work i mean how do you pick these things these are complex diseases and that's a disease that has been so difficult to be
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,yeah you know it's a great question it's a broader question and i'll tell you why you know biopharma is full of upside you know we all we all can can look at diseases that that are that are that are horrible and there's a lot of value to be created if you can solve those diseases but you know what you really gotta be focused on is risk mitigation because we bathe in risk and to the extent that you can mitigate that risk you can you can you know really build a more stable company and what we do is we focus really only on validated targets and what i mean by that is these are these are our proteins these are gene targets that we know if you turn that off a good thing will happen right and so we know that for cystic fibrosis for the gene we're going after it it is it is it's called epithelial sodium channel we know that if that if that is turned off or turned down in cystic fibrosis patients good things will happen and so so when we look at our at our at our at our risk profile we got 2 risks or 2 two primary risks 1 one is the target risk and we can we can really walk away from that by focusing only on validated targets the second is of course technology risk can you turn something off and i think we've shown now in what over a 110 people that we can do that and so we're excited about the technology we're excited about where we can take it next
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,a 110 peep really so you've got i mean this isn't mice these are people
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,it's not mice we we we've been in a 110 people a 160 some doses we haven't seen any called so called saes or serious adverse events and we've been able to consistently turn down these target genes it's really exciting time to
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,be in our presence well congratulations
Speaker 1,Christopher Richard Anzalone,thank you
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,can't wait to hear get the big deck tomorrow i'm sure right that we all be able to see because you got your big analyst day that's christopher anzalone president and ceo of arrowhead pharmaceuticals thank you to our viewers for bringing this to our attention mad money's back after the break
