Speaker 0,Reporter 1,kitco mining's special coverage of pdac is brought to you by gold mining and uranium energy core
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,b2 gold is going to have to buy some parkers for some of its workforce as the company recently announced that it's gonna buy sabena gold and silver and its back river development project in nunavut in canada to tell us more i'm pleased to be joined here at pdac 2023 by president and ceo clive johnson welcome to kitco clive
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,nice to see you again paul thank you
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,"thank you for joining us now you were hinting for quite a while that b2gold's next move would be to acquire a north american asset but i think your $1,100,000,000 canadian offer for sabina took many people by surprise why sabina why now"
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,well it was a great project 1st and foremost you're right we did want some geographical diversification i think our shareholders wanted to see that as well and you know it's a obviously we've often thought it would be nice to have a purchase in canada and you know 40 odd years ago i was a line cutter and a claim seeker in the yukon when i was a young lad and so we've come full circle now back to the north again but a great project good jurisdiction very good relationships with the the owners of the land the inuit population high grade attractive economics even with the challenges of the north and also it fit well in our wheelhouse because we do have northern experience from building the kupo mine in the 2000 early 2000s in the far north of russia which was very challenging logistically so some of those same construction guys are still with the company we thought it was the right time and sabin has done i must say sabin has done an excellent job in all sorts of things exploration permitting it's into construction now we like what they're we like the construction plan we like the schedule so it's a good mix we gotta work together on this going forward and a good acquisition for us and the one we're very very excited about we did a lot of due diligence work and confirmed that they've done very good quality work it's a very good project
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,"well congratulations on that b 2 gold is already a circa 1,000,000 ounce a year producer backriver is gonna be what 300 350,000 ounce a year so another step towards b 2 becoming recognized or more recognized as a let's say tier 1 major senior gold company"
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,"yeah and it fit very well for the reasons i've said the other thing that was allowed this to happen is our is our financial strength you know we have no debt we have 650,000,000 us in the bank we are have access to capital very $600,000,000 revolving credit facility from a great bunch of banks that's undrawn right now so we have the financial capability to take this on as well and it fits in our our wheelhouse that in that regard as well and the payback it's a very attractive economics so the payback for goose should be something less than 3 years payback of the capital"
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,okay now back river is permitted financed and most of the civil works have been completed which is often the the trickiest part of a build so in some ways it's about as derisked as it could get was that a key factor in this being the moment when you made the bid
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,well i think there was a number of factors one was the fact that sabina was looking to do this on their own and that was making very good progress so i think for bruce mcleod who's done a great job their ceo and their board they were keen on growing realising the value for the shows by growing the asset so it was a time of couple of years of discussion about what would it look like and frankly you know i'm sure a bittersweet decision for them in some ways and i've been there before but they did i think a good deal for the shareholders and our culture is very similar our corporate cultures but the financing was an important thing as well because when you're a single asset company trying to finance a gold mine the financing terms can be challenging or at least it could be relatively expensive whereas for us with our strong balance sheet we are able to come in and and and and basically take over for the rest of the financing responsibility with our cash in hand and our access to to low cost loans from our banks so that was an important timing factor as well before they drew down the rest of their financing as they had planned so
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,i think that's a a a factor that often gets overlooked you know in recent years a lot of mine developments who have buy single asset duties have run into trouble and one of the reasons there has been the financial strength or lack of of their balance sheet and i think i recall you saying during the conference call announcement that bringing b2 gold balance sheet will enable you to advance some things that they would have to put off because of you know their financial limitations you don't have that so you can really sort of build it to its optimum optimum aspect
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,"yeah and then and then good point and then two aspects of that would be 1 we're actually because they they were cash constrained and when you're when you've got financing that's not cheap you're going to try and limit your costs so one of the things they wanted to do was but didn't do delayed was to go underground earlier and get access to good grade material so they could start at they're starting at they were planning 3,000 tonnes a day to start and they always wanted to go to 4,000 in the 1st year but because of our financial strength we're going to spend that money now so we'll start at 4,000 tonnes a day through the plant and the other reason i think where the balance sheet really really helps out is in exploration because we've always been i think as a producer an excellent exploration company that's our history so we're able to explore this really incredible opportunity of the belt so whereas they were constrained in exploration expenditures obviously while you're building a mine we'll probably have a budget of $20,000,000 this year to explore the ultimate potential of back river it's an 80 kilometre belt of incredibly prospective ground and they've had lots of good hits that they weren't able to follow-up on so we think the exploration is about 9,000,000 ounce resource now it has the potential to grow dramatically over time"
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,and as you mentioned clive you've had a history of showing that your exploration is very good and has been able to grow and grow assets were you surprised that there wasn't a competing bid for for the asset from someone like agnico eagle mines which also has other arctic operations or high canadian arctic operations or kimro skull which obviously has operations in alaska it had the kupol operation that you built in in russia until last year and now has a a production gap to fill
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,"i wasn't really surprised i mean there are not that many companies who could take on a project like this in the north with the challenges of it i can't really speak for meeco eagle it's a company i admire and we get along very well their comment to me frankly and they've they publicly they're busy they've got lots going on so they've they congratulated me on the acquisition look forward to working together in the north where we can and and so they they saw it as a positive thing that it was a canadian company carrying on the legacy of that so other companies are busy and in this case we were able to offer the sabina shareholders a significant premium in fact it was a 45% premium above where they've been trading at around the time we announced the deal and some people in the investment community are negative on premiums premium isn't relevant it's the value so we said we would pay 1,100,000,000 canadian to acquire them with our shares and we obviously think there's more upside as business people but therefore i was i wasn't concerned about where the stock was trading or what the premium was the premium is is is inconsequential it's the value of the asset what you're getting it for so at the end of the day because of that very fair offer i think it's a very good offer fair for them i think it probably prevented others from considering coming in over the top so a lot of other companies are busy may not have the northern expertise and the offer was a very fair sound offer it's not closed yet the shareholder vote will be april 19th but all the signals we're hearing from both sets of shareholders is very positive support for the for this deal which seems to make a lot of sense"
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,i i i really like
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,the way you phrase that either value not premium because so many people get fixated on the premium or lack of premium there's a massive deal on the table elsewhere in the gold sector and it seems to be focused on premium or or the lack of the premium there perhaps that's not something to get into another time but you know before we came on air we were chatting about the this deal and you were talking about the opportunities to work with anglo sorry agnico eagle mines in the arctic for the mutual benefit of of both companies and all the various stakeholders there can you tell me tell us a little bit more about that
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,sure i mean we're in the very early stages of course getting this deal closed but the opportunities where clearly in the north are the areas that we can work together are there areas we work together in terms of you know education housing healthcare there's a lot of things that you can do and you've got 2 responsible mining canadian mining companies with the ability to do that and i know eniko has done great programs in their past and we've done it all over the world in terms of of all those all those things you can bring with esg you know education and and support for the local community so i i i think we'll we'll look at what things we can collaborate on and maybe express an interest in that and i and i definitely share that interest
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,okay while we're on the the subject of esg clive a couple of years ago you launched the rhino gold bar to help fund the conservation preservation of the black rhino in namibia polar bears are also endangered species so do we potentially see a a nunavut polar bear gold bar in the future
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,well i'll be we'll be talking to our inuit partners about that so i wouldn't rule out a polar bear bar or maybe a polar bear coin or something like that so yeah that was a it was a really innovative approach to a mining company being conservationists and environmentalists and we're very proud of that and we'll always be looking for innovative ways to to do things like that to also help the people that are working to save the species and thereby save the species as well as participate in that
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,okay thank you now obviously a lot of attention is focusing on sabina and back river at the moment but you also have a much broader portfolio and which is still growing and developing fekola springs to mind there what what else are you trying to do around the world what else is underway around
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,"the world to continue growing b 2 gold well fekola itself we're we're doing 2 phases of expansion of fekola so fekola is producing just under 600,000 ounces a year now which is pretty remarkable because we started up with the idea of 300,000 ounces so we've expanded the mill twice it's been an incredible success but also exploration's been really successful so we now have a 20 kilometer belt there and in the far north the area we call anaconda within the fekola complex has shown some excellent drill results to the point where we're just completing building some roads to truck down some of the soft weathered ore from there down to the fekola mill which will continue to keep the mill topped up at fekola for years to come but in addition to that we're doing a study which will be out in june looking at the economics of building a second mill up in the anaconda area given all these exploration results and new ounces we've got more drilling to and we've got a study happening it'll come out in june we're expecting it to be very economic the concept if it is is to build another mill for maybe $250,000,000 or $300,000,000 then anaconda and that could produce up to 200,000 ounces of gold additional gold production a year so and it should be very attractive because there's a soft material there's no blasting no crushing and there's some good grades so the economics we anticipate will be good as i said we'll come up with that in june that gives another potential of 200,000 ounces to fekola taking it to 800,000 ounces a year so between fekola and goose you have another half a 1000000 ounces of annual production just you know over the next 3 years or so so that's dramatic growth but we're a very focused company when we get into something you won't see us do a lot of m and a from here for a period of time as we digest what we're doing i i think that's very important part of the key of our success is delivery and focus we don't want our construction team to try to do 2 things at the same time so fekola and goose they they work very well in scheduling together to be able to do both over the next 3 years so so we'll continue though exploration worldwide we're a very good exploration company as as you mentioned we're exploring in finland we're looking at doing some things in uzbekistan and we're always looking for opportunities you know we've been very successful in accretive acquisitions and finding more ounces at our at our properties but also new discoveries the cheapest ounces are always the ones you find so we'll be clear on that"
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,"now you're currently about a1000000 ounce a year produced as i mentioned is there an optimal size for b two gold you know a1000000 and a half 2,000,000 ounces is that something you think about"
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,i don't really look at it that way i mean growth is gonna be a growth is what our shareholders want with small cell mining a big dividend and growth and we're delivering clearly we've delivered in the last 12 years from 0 production to a 1000000 ounce a year now and and now we go the next step of growth i'm always reluctant to put a number and a time frame on it because then you've promised something and then you may you know you may feel pressure to do a deal that maybe isn't really the right thing to do so we'll see obviously if you look at the last 10 years 0 to a1000000 may may not be unrealistic to think the next 10 years or less could yield that again so this there are a couple of good pieces in place here and well as these projects develop when we get them in production of course we'll be looking we're always looking there's not that many great projects in the world but we found one here and we'll we'll we'll always keep looking at what's happening out there
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,okay so aside from hopefully closing sabina transaction later this year what else can we expect to see from b2gold in 2023
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,"well you're gonna see that you're gonna see the the expansion of fekola as well this year a lot more drilling we've drilled 40,000 meters so far at the fekola complex not only are we seeing this attractiveness of this weathered material at surface but beneath that we're seeing really good intercepts in drilling up and down this belt showing that there's very good grade in the sulfide which is similar to the fekola deposit so a real focus there ultimately how big can that get and lots of drill results coming out of the goose area the back river area we'll be aggressively exploring goose itself which is open to depth the nearby george deposit which is 2,400,000 ounces which are so far and open and up and down that belt so lots of lots of results to come from us and maybe some good exploration developments in other places like finland etcetera so we'll have a lot of news flow and i do think that we're due for a rerating in the market as we show people we've done the m and a that i was promising and that's always a bit risky to go out as a ceo and say we're going to do m and a because some people might say well i'm not going to buy the stock i'm going to wait till they announce the deal they're doing but i wanted i didn't want don't like surprising our shareholders so i wanted to be transparent and tell them where we're trying to go so i don't think that many people were surprised to see us do something and the support well i've been doing this for a long time this deal has got more support on both sides of shareholders than than any deal i've done before"
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,okay you're at the bmo global metals and mining conference a couple of weeks ago in in florida we're at pdc now let's broaden out that what what's the investor vibe now you know aside from your own shareholders what what's the vibe you're getting from the investment community
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,yeah i think it's i think there's some pretty good support for there's definitely good support for responsible gold producers that have low cost and the ability i would say to grow you know there's definitely a bit of a transition stage there are several gold producers today that don't have a ceo for example so there's a bit of a change happening and and i and i think there's going to be continued focus on m and a and i think that's a good thing for institutions to show for all shareholders we we probably need a little a few less companies but you know the the better run companies hopefully can continue to grow so you know a lot of people are suggesting gold they make a big move here i've at the end of the day i've i've with low cost production we've never been believers that gold has to go higher it's nice to say that we're actually a little bit ambivalent about the gold price obviously we highly leveraged to it but we don't need gold to go higher you know clearly we haven't over the last years to grow our company and be profitable
Speaker 1,Reporter 2,okay well clive johnson i wish you the best of luck in closing the sabina transaction and thank you for joining us today
Speaker 2,Clive T. Johnson,paul always a pleasure thank you
