Speaker 0,Reporter ,alright good afternoon everyone my name is tyler langton i cover the the precious metal stocks here at jpmorgan up next is b2 gold and from the company we have clive johnson the company's president and ceo so thank you for joining us clive greatly appreciate it clive is gonna start with a brief introduction of the company and then we'll sort of hop right into the q and a so with that i'll i'll turn it over to you clive great
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,"thanks tyler thanks for including us in your conference just a very brief overview for those of you that may not be familiar with the gold sector or or bggold bggold is a company that was created just 13 years ago by myself and some of the other management group from a company called bemagold that had been very successful over 20 odd years in moving from exploration to production into interesting places like chile russia south africa etcetera so with the success of bemagold which was taken over by kinross in the 3 and a half $1,000,000,000 transaction 2007 we thought let's see if we can do it again so we created b two gold at 0 and over the last 13 years we've been very highly successful in doing accretive acquisitions of developed projects we're building our gold mines we have a great construction team that is an in house team and we've had really good exploration success around the mines and other places so we've really grown the company from 0 production 12 years ago to a 1000000 ounces of low cost gold production this last year and looking similar this year 1 of the lowest cost gold producers in the world highly profitable we are debt free and we are paying one of the largest dividends in the gold space so we've been able to accomplish a lot over the last 12 years but we've also done it with a real commitment to responsible mining and that's something we're very proud of you know we've been doing a lot of esg type of of projects before there was a fancy title for things like esg and csr so that's that's been a driving force forever wherever we go around the world and i think the corp the corporate culture is worth mentioning because it's it was the same in the days as it is today in the beach and gold days and that is to go around the world treating people with fairness respect and transparency i call it an extension of the canadian culture but i think through that we've done extremely well extraordinarily well including recently during covid when we managed to keep all our people safe and keep working in these countries that currently need our business so highly successful company in in exploration project construction operations we have one of the top safety records in the world in in in our projects once again despite the additional challenges of of covid so so we're very proud of what we what we've been able to do and this is a company unlike many others so it is the the founders of the company are still very involved including myself and others and i think that's one of the reasons i like to think that we've been successful you talk about skin in the game well we founded this company so we're we're looking forward to the future and continue to grow we've got another exciting project so i think with that overview i'll i'll be happy to answer any questions you have connor"
Speaker 0,Reporter ,perfect thanks you know maybe just just starting with the production profile i know sort of you recently had your sort of the annual general meeting where you had a presentation and you know with the profiles or previously you had a little bit of a sort of a dip in production starting in 2022 and now it's kind of you've got some you know sort of you know sort of modest growth from 'twenty one 'twenty two to 'twenty three you know could you maybe just walk through a little bit about sort of what's you know sort of driving you know sort of that improved you know outlook at at the assets specifically i guess you know fekola where you know most of it's probably from
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,"sure the 3 producing mines in the company are the fekola mine which is located in mali west africa and the mojukoda mine which is located in namibia in southern africa and finding the masbate mine which is located in the philippines so those are the 3 mines that made up the vast majority of our 1,000,000 ounce of year profile and then anytime you're you're you're mining and sequencing particularly in open pit mining you'll go through sequences whether you're stripping a little more waste and a little more a little less ore is being trucked to the mill at certain years it's all about mine planning but so we make these mine plans over 5 years and then we do detailed plans so now we've gone back and done more detailed plans for the next 5 years and it's changed quite a bit from last year when we did have a a larger gap but i think that you know we're looking right around a little bit just below for the next 5 years just below that 1,000,000 ounce year level i think we'll i think we'll beat that i think that we there's a slight dip in 2014 if you look at our presentation as you as you've mentioned but we we do not think that will be reality when we get there the fekola mill which is you know our biggest mine produced over 600,000 ounce of gold last year very low cost we expanded that mill last year so we could go from 6,000,000 tonnes a year capacity to 7 a half 1000000 tonnes a year the second time we've expanded that mill because it's such an extraordinary successful project with more and more gold being discovered but in actual fact now we're not at 7,500,000 tonnes a year we're we're somewhere around 8,500,000 tonnes a year so that that capacity loan if that continues will will increase the the production with through the ability to to put more tonnes through the mill therefore produce more ounces of gold we also have a new discovery that's right next door to the difficult deposit called cardinal and so far there's about half a 1000000 ounces there in a resource but it but it's wide open and the drilling shows it's getting bigger but the most important thing there is we're starting to track that ore already to the fekola mill as well so there's further upside there and finally about 20 kilometres to the north of fekola we have an area that we call anaconda which is a couple of licenses that are showing some really good recent drilling over the last few years indicating a significant gold resource there of about 800,000 ounce of gold now one of the two claims there not to get into too much detail but one of the two claims there is called minikoto and it's been in a dispute in terms of the ownership of that and we're we're dealing with the government looking to clear that up we we think under valean law we have a right to an extension of that so but in the meantime though potanko the the the claim just to the north of minikoto hosts significant gold discovery it looks like it's getting a lot bigger we would be looking over the next starting potentially as early as the middle of next year subject to permitting and fill drilling we would be looking to start trucking the soft ore from minnekooto 20 kilometres down to the piccolo mill because it's so soft it can go through the mill very easily and once again add to our throughput so that's not in 2024 not much for cardinals in 2024 so i'm talking about the middle of next year being able to further increase throughput maybe in excess of another 50 or 75,000 ounces a year by using the manorcola ore ultimately we think there might be another fekola sized multi minute deposit in that area at 20 kilometers north and we'll be hitting it hard on on the bentancko claim while we sort out the ownership of minakoto so so there's a lot of growth there in in terms of filling in that gap and then of course we'll talk about gramalote they gave a question on that in colombia which and the other project in burkina faso when when when you get to it"
Speaker 0,Reporter ,yeah no that's that's that's perfect so i guess right and as you mentioned sort of the you know in those slides you did have sort of the dip in 24 i think as you mentioned those didn't include you know the assets from monokoto i guess the underground extension and maybe i guess right you know i know that especially keyaka maybe just you know starting with chiaki i mean i guess can you talk a little bit about like you're in the process of updating the feasibility study there you know sort of how that could potentially sort of contribute and some of you know sort of sort of the issues with in sort of costs that you had in the in the past and you know sort of you know what you're trying to sort of resolve you know at at this point with
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,"that sure i mean kyac is a represents an intriguing opportunity we acquired it several years ago in a friendly takeover of a company called volta resources who had done a good job of exploring and doing a feasibility study but the problem was that it it back several years ago now it needed a higher gold price or or expiration success further exploration success or some other major change in costs to make it economic and that was around we were looking at 13.50 gold i think back in those days etcetera so so we acquired it very very cheaply very cheap acquisition on the belief that we might be able to to do certain things working with the government to to make it more attractive and also of course you know we did some of the believe that gold was cyclical but we we don't tend to pay up for anything that we need a higher gold price or explanation of success in our acquisitions but this acquisition was frankly so cheap that we decided 4,000,000 ounces of burkina faso with some exploration upside we we we went for it so right now we've been updating the feasibility study and there's some interesting opportunities because fuel is very expensive in west africa and the trucking of fuel and taxes are very high in fuel so we've been looking at natural gas alternatives for the plant and of course we are one of the world's leading companies in solar we built a 30 megawatt plant in in the maybe several years ago which was a great success for the otjikoto mine and now we built a 75 megawatt plant and it's just being completed in mali that's really helping reduce our carbon footprint and also lowering cost to the fagola mine just next door in mali so clearly that's an all another alternative for for looking at kia ka those various alternatives so we're we're we're just trying to figure out what the the magnitude of those we wanna talk to the government about perhaps taxation on natural gas because we think there's a great opportunity for the country to see more mines built and the bottom line is this is a 4,000,000 ounce to the gold deposit then you don't see levels in the world that are getting near the development stage bottom line we'll have the feasibility study done they updated study in the q3 and we'll review it to see if it meets our investment criteria if it does we would look to push forward with it either on our own or in partnership potentially if we wouldn't didn't wanna take on the whole capital cost burden remember we're debt free so we can clearly look at doing that if we wanted to maintain a 100% but if it doesn't fit our investment criteria we would look at some kind of a a joint venture or partnering up with someone who could help us make that and maybe we take a smaller percentage of it so we'll see it's an intriguing project and potentially a a good asset but we've got some more work to do to see if it meets the criteria great"
Speaker 0,Reporter ,and then i guess maybe switching to the other larger project with gramalote i know it's sort of your q one earnings you know you you talked about that there was the potential you know to make it a more robust project and you're kind of looking at you know sort of ways you know to optimize it could you just talk a little bit more about you know some of you know the drivers that are out there that could potentially you know sort of support improved economics you know and and just sort of you know your confidence and be able to find those those type of opportunities
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,"yeah is another we think ultimately good project in the good part of the world which is in antiochia and colombia so in and colombia is very pro responsible mining and i think many countries are gonna be more pro responsible mining post covid when they see what responsible mining has been able to do not just ourselves but other other companies for their economies etcetera so i think there's a real positive opportunity to take what we've done and show people how good it can be for their economy with and also how responsible we are in the way we could protect the environment and and and and and social assistance in the program in the countries of countries we are in gramalote is we've been working on it for quite a long time with our our partner anglogold ashanti 5050 joint venture so we completed they completed a pre feasibility study some years ago and we became operator early last year and with our great construction team aj was interested in seeing us the operator taking it forward the idea was to based on our our preliminary economic assessment the economics suggest that we could build a a large open pit gold mine and produce about 350 to 400,000 ounces of gold a year 100% basis and showed some pretty attractive costs and a capital cost of around $900,000,000 the updated feasibility study which we created or completed at the end of the q1 didn't show quite as robust economics there's a few different reasons for that but we but we believe and so we had about a 15% irr internal rate of return at $1500 gold the previous study had had somewhat better economics but we looked at it and we said we think there's work to be done to optimize the feasibility study now people turn that around all the time but at the end of the day there's specific areas here for example if you can lower the capital cost and there's a lot of expensive things that were planned well i think we think they're somewhat expensive in terms of a large tunnel and other things but we think we can cut back the capital cost and continue and still build a very secure and and and and well run mine and appropriate mill and mine so there's that but also the idea that we we have some inferred resources which we can't include in our study because they're inferred they're not indicated so we need more drilling so the potential to add additional ounces so therefore if you take the capital cost and lower the capital cost and divide it by more ounces you're obviously gonna have a more attractive project so we think you know it's not that far off it's it's got positive economic indicators as it sits today but we think there's a number of areas that we can do in terms of lowering the capital cost and increasing the ounces so we're going to work we're drilling right now to to look at doing that and also we'll we're gonna come out now with a revised feasibility study in the q1 of next year we're feeling very confident that we're gonna improve this thing and it's gonna be something we'd wanna build and our partner ega so far has been on the the same page with us we've we've all put a lot of time and money into this over time we're not gonna build it just because of that but we think it's we think it's got a good shot to become an economic project that could ease increase our gold production by a 175 to 200,000 ounces a a year it's a potentially good project"
Speaker 0,Reporter ,and then i guess you know in terms of these i guess type of projects we're starting to see some inflationary pressures you know just for you know various certain materials and consumables doesn't seem as though it's hit labor quite yet but i guess just on the inflation front can you talk about whether you're seeing anything just in the daily operations you know sort of you know at the various assets and then just with you know with developing these projects you know sort of you know how do you think about you know sort of you know sort of derisking or just recognizing you know sort of the you know the higher prices that we've seen for you know steel and and other items as you kind of if you decide to to move forward
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,sure well great debate in the world about how much inflation there there may be some people believe that when there's fears of inflation then the gold price tends to perform well but i i i i'm gonna say we've seen some cost increases labor tends to edge up and and but we haven't seen dramatic higher prices in insect fuel to date we also hedge some of our fuel up to 50% of our fuel to lock in some some some costs when we think it's appropriate to do that so you know i i i think overall the other thing that's key for a company like ours i think would be what we've done over the years and the way we've done it the way we treated contractors and fuel suppliers and and our labor force i think we're a very attractive company to work for is what i hear so our our suppliers are one of the largest caterpillar equipment users in the world great relationship there they say it's a win win relationship over many many years in fact decades so you have those strong relationships so when you come to look to to acquire equipment or you come to look to other things if part of it is your relationships with your suppliers they're not gonna give you a a cost way lower than in the strategies of course but in terms of access to equipment and and and reasonable pricing because of our reputation and our demonstrated ability to be really good clients to have for the for these various contracts so inflation is something to keep an eye on but once again there may very well be a corollary if we see significant inflation in our industry then normally you do see an improved goal price which we don't wanna rely on that but our costs are low so you know if we're looking at around 8.50 $900 an ounce all in sustaining cost which is what we're projecting for the next 3 or 4 years so that may go up a little bit but at the end of the day those are very low costs so that's why we've been able to pay this large dividend and continue to grow the company so we're very cognizant and very disciplined if you look at our history of meeting our budgets and our projections we'll build some inflation into those but i think we're well positioned to to deal with with whatever comes our way in that regard
Speaker 0,Reporter ,okay and then in terms of you know geopolitical risks you know i think we've just sort of in the news recently especially in south america we've seen some you know sort of talks from you know from governments and parties about potentially you know raising taxes you know sort of royalties just kind of share your thoughts you know you know about those risks and then just you know at b two gold specifically just you know as you're looking and how do you manage those risks you know for your own operations and also you know similarly when you're sort of looking looking at projects potentially
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,sure i mean a a couple of points there i think we've had great success going all over the world between beam and b2gold from from russia to south africa which is to for east of russia to south africa which is right in the first two points that you can be a part of the world and many places in between many countries in between so the key to our success i find is part of this culture we talk about the fairness respect and transparency but one of the most important things in avoiding political risk or avoiding governments that are disappointed in you such as potentially higher taxes etcetera is because by delivering on the promises you make so if you sit down with the president of a country or other senior politicians as i have done all over the world and you promise them that you're gonna build a gold mine in two and a half years and you're gonna do it responsibly and you're gonna create all these jobs you're gonna pay all these taxes and it's gonna be great for everybody they believe you partly because you're the ceo of a western company unfortunately too many companies in the past i think it's getting better but too many con companies in the past have gone and made promises and not delivered so you have these politicians and other people in these countries going out and repeating the promises made by the company ceo they repeat them to the constituents so i think that's been the cornerstone of our incredible relationships in every country we've been in being transparent being respectful and delivering on the promises we make when we say we're gonna build a mine by such time for such amount of money we do it we've done it time and time again i think 8 8 8 times now around the world so that's part of that equation but i think the other thing about taxation we're fortunate in the areas that we've been we've got we usually have stable tax regimes in the 3 mines right now that i think colombia won't be the same and burkina faso but but so if you look at fekola for example so mali is a very good place for gold mining it has been for decades randgold now part of barrick and attest to that they have great success for decades ourselves and other countries have been very successful part of the thing that we have in mali you don't have in many other countries in the world is that you actually lock in your tax regime for the life of the project when you start so you sign a mining convention with the government and that means they cannot change your tax regime not every country has that we don't have that in canada and many other countries don't have that that's something people don't realize so when you look at political risk there's a case where yes we have a 2012 code which is higher taxes than the 1991 code was much more i would call reasonable levels of taxation everybody should win here but we're we're we're locked in under the under under those conventions a similar situation would have would be in burkina faso if we built keyaka but if you look at the philippines in fact finding the philippines as an example of what i'm starting to talk about around the world with the fact that the post covid opportunity for for for for industries like mining because everyone now needs foreign investment and everyone now is gonna look back in the philippine government saying who were the good actors during covid who kept working safely who kept paying taxes and who kept supporting the environment and also social programs and we stand out in other companies as real stars in that regard so i and we've already seen the philippines government reduce corporate taxes 5% which you don't see very often and we've also seen them open up to more open pit mining in the country and more more exploration and and then more open pit mining in the country they're moving in that direction so that's an example of what i'm saying worldwide we need to talk to the countries that we're in which you're doing and saying look thanks for your help we did it couldn't have done it without your help governments our employees and ourselves all wanted the same thing keep mining if you can do it safely and responsibly because of our culture i think we built up a lot of social licenses that were great and it's a trust relationship so we're going to those governments that i'm just gonna say well you know obviously we wanna build more global than the imaginary country and our success attracts others always does because we tend to be pioneers in some of these countries so they can't afford to really be cranking up taxes now because if they crank up taxes they're normally the highest grade in any country only the highest grade mines will be built do you want 5 new gold mines built or do you want just the one that has high enough grade and better economics to suffer through higher taxes so it's really important that these countries realize don't at this point in time kill the goose the ladies the gold and egg because there's lots of potential growth in gold mining worldwide and other mining i think governments are getting that message and i think the philippines is an example and i think we'll see more of that so so we do a lot of our homework and a lot of our work when we go all around the world on understanding the cultures and the countries we're in respecting the people 97% of our employees are of the country that we're in we have 34 sorry 43 100 employees around the world now so that's all a big part of that and working so closely with local and federal governments once again fairness respect and transparency goes a long way so i see a positive future for the for the gold mining industry and we're very excited about other opportunities like ex uzbekistan we're drilling there we're doing these affiliate companies doing some drilling in japan we've got a really good project in finland they're quite excited about its exploration but these are big good targets for the future as well
Speaker 0,Reporter ,then i mean we've kind of talked about the sort of the pipeline that that you do have how do you when you think about m and a you know how would you i guess sort of rank that when it comes to sort of you know the own projects you have you know and sort of just the opportunities you know that you're you're seeing right now
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,"yeah i think that we had a great track record of doing accretive acquisitions and then making them even better through exploration we demonstrated that in all 3 of the mines that were currently producing it it but it's getting a little tougher because gold prices have gone up so 5 years ago when we acquired a company called papillon australian company they did an excellent job of drilling off fekola and doing the feasibility study on the first 4,000,000 ounces it's now 8,000,000 ounces with our exploration success on top of that but it was quite remarkable because it was recognized as one of the best gold development projects in the world yet there was no competition when we acquired papillon in a friendly takeover which is remarkable the reason was because the investment community was so turned off gold mining companies attempting to build gold mines because tragically many many companies had had done overpaid for acquisitions done a poor job at construction pissed off the governments or and other things there was no appetite for growth yet we've i've been always been prepared in my career to be contrarian and we said we have a long term plan to keep acquiring and building good quality gold mines and we didn't do it we we we kept doing that during the in namibia and then followed by fekola so no competition for now one of the recognized as a world class gold mine and one of the lowest gold producers in the world that's about being contrarian and being prepared to stick with your strategy but the market didn't like what we were doing at the time but we didn't do we didn't dilute our shareholders to do it we used a sensible amount of debt which has now been fully repaid for you know $600,000,000 to to build to build the fekola mill and facilities we we've already paid that debt back so we didn't dilute our shareholders so we have a long term strategy we spend a lot of time on it and one of the great things of being constrained is if you get it right and we've clearly got it right so now back to your question there's much more competition now for the few development projects that are out there so we're not gonna break our habit of a of a career here for me over 30 years almost 40 years and start overpaying for things because there's competition so we the cheapest ounces are always the ones you find we've had a lot of success there we're gonna continue ground fields around the mines but also some of these new exciting targets worldwide we're open to m and a but it's gonna have to be a situation where frankly we're not gonna win a bidding war because other people need growth because they didn't do what we did while we were growing this company when it was a contrary thing to do in building mines so we did the heavy lifting when no one else very few were doing it so now we'll be looking for special situations so i'll just give you one example so the masbate mine which we acquired in 2013 that was acquired by taking over an australian company cja mining who had done a good job of of drilling and feasibility and actually built the mill they were a single mine company and they they went up for sale and and we successfully did a deal then when the competition wasn't too hot and heavy so we did it when we thought was a fair deal for the shareholders but a good deal for our shareholders and then when the guys first walked in and told me about it it was pretty high operating costs close to $900 an ounce so i said well why would you be interested in this and i said well we think we can bring those costs way down so subsequent to that we added some quarters of both $500 an ounce so we took an asset that many others were looked at and said well philippines you know and also you know this is high cost and and that's how good our guys are not just in building minds but making things better sometimes so there's an example so if an opportunity like that shows up we we're not competing with a bunch of other companies because they don't have the ability to do what we do or see the vision or they're scared off of the location or etcetera we'll look at we'll look at that so those are the kind of things you know i think there'll be more m and a in the sector i'm pleased to see that there's been quite a bit because we need less gold mining companies that are better run better management we're seeing that and i think that's quite positive so we'll pick our spots but if you look at our growth chart over the last 13 years it was pretty dramatic from 0 to a 1000000 ounces who would think given our management team that we're gonna stop there so one way or the other i'm pretty confident we're gonna continue to grow the gold production at b2gold but at the same time maintaining one of the highest dividends in the sector so that's the strategy pay a pay a very good dividend to reward our shareholders at the same time keep some of the cash from operations to continue to grow the company through expiration potential m and a and and other opportunities"
Speaker 0,Reporter ,and then just on your point on sort of the industry needing further consolidation do you think some of it was delayed you know just with covid and sort of the difficulties you know accessing various you know sort of assets and projects and is that something where sort of as countries start to open up we kind of see more and more activity or do you think again like the higher gold prices just make it more difficult
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,"that's a good question i i think that there's some of that i definitely you know covid is a lot of challenges of course normally we would send a full team you know to go and evaluate all of our top people not uc consultants our top in house people who've done all this and we would send them to do extensive due diligence on-site but you know we're in a creative industry and the deals tend to still get done and people are using drones and other things and trying to do the best in evaluating something i think the other important point there is that the regular environment in which we live today which sometimes i think aspects of it are kind of overkill a little bit but overall the fact of the matter is the vast majority of companies are not gonna be trying to pull the wheel over your eyes when they look at their project technically with the with the public information requirements now which i i agree with with all the information needed these you know these in other words you you've gotta check the box and you gotta do the work and due diligence etcetera but i don't think we're seeing as many i don't know whatever people misrepresenting their their project for example because that tends to get exposed even by due diligence done on desktop so at the end of the day i think you'll probably see a pickup in m and a already out of necessity you know all of these companies have to continue to grow we all have to be able to grow and there hasn't been a lot of exploration money spent for the most part probably from 5 years ago to 5 to 10 years before that because the sector was so out of favor so there aren't many i don't know of another fekola around right now there's very few ramalates around there's very few chiakas around there aren't many of these so the competition will get more intense but we've also we've always found a good way to grow without breaking our rules about very disciplined acquisitions also exploration has been a huge part we started twice as exploration companies and look what we've grown into so exploration this year we have a $65,000,000 budget and these are really good brownfields around our mines but also expedition targets we're excited about looking for world class discoveries including north of fekola as i mentioned including uzbekistan finland etcetera so we're very excited about that ability to grow as well"
Speaker 0,Reporter ,right and i think we have about 2 minutes left so maybe just to to finish up in terms of capital allocation obviously you have one of the highest dividends out there you know how do you think about i guess you know allocating capital obviously you want to sort of focus on you know your various growth projects but is it something where you wanna keep sort of growing the dividend is it something you would consider you know ever you know sort of linking to a gold price or anything like that or are you more of just focused on sort of sustainable increases
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,yeah some companies have tied the dividend to a percentage of free cash flow etcetera we haven't done that yet because we've been still been kind of growth mode and evaluating our growth opportunity so looking at our capital requirements going forward but we set a pretty high bar here with the dividend just introducing a year and a half ago and have increased it twice since then but we've got to a level now where we think it's it's a good solid place to be we wanna maintain that and we'll look of course gold prices and other things that do we increase that as we go forward and our capital requirements but we're very comfortable with that level of dividend going forward because as i said the strategy is to pay healthy dividend but continue to have cash available to grow the company and we can tap into debt anytime we want but also have some cash from operations to use for expiration things like that so that's the strategy and i think today most of our i think the vast majority of our shareholders who 75% of our shareholders are voted at our agm last week which is pretty remarkable highly supportive of directors and therefore management of the company i think they wanna see us continue to grow that's one of our hallmarks i tell generous funds you don't need to buy us because we produce gold you buy us because we have a big dividend we're really good at what we do we're we're a very low cost producer and we're good at growing the company so we don't buy us just because you're a gold buck and think gold's going higher i think if gold stays right where it is or is lower we're still gonna be a very profitable company that's gonna continue to grow and and succeed
Speaker 0,Reporter ,great perfect well i think with that we are about out of time so clive again thank you for joining us today i greatly appreciate it and and take care
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,thanks for your time one final point we didn't get stuck with esg our responsible mining report we just got our 5th edition we're very proud of that it's on the website accessible and all of the remarkable things we do around the world in esg and our our social programs we're very proud of those we just won 5 significant awards it's detailed on our website if there's a green mining company i like to think that we're at or we're one of them so we're looking forward to continuing to grow that important part of our industry
Speaker 0,Reporter ,perfect great thanks again
Speaker 1,Clive T. Johnson,great good questions thanks for your time thanks
