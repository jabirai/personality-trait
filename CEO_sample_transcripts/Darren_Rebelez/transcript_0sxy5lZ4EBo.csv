Speaker 0,Reporter,and a first on cnbc interview with kc ceo darren rebelez thank you very much darren for joining us it's good to good to talk to you where do you think the consumer is right now
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,"well thanks sarah and great to be with you again what we're seeing is the consumer has been fairly resilient so far this year we are seeing a little bit of bifurcation between the lower income consumers and everybody else but in our footprint about 3 quarters of our guest base make over $50,000 a year and in our more rural geography that's a that's a pretty substantial income and so those consumers are doing just great and we're we have great momentum in the quarter from a sales perspective we are seeing a little bit of pressure on the lower income consumers but they're not stopping spending what they're doing is shifting around the more affordable options like our prepared foods and like our private label products"
Speaker 0,Reporter,i mentioned the fuel margins that seemed to be the good surprise in the quarter why so much better than expected and and where do we go from here
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,yeah the fuel margins hung in there really well and i i gotta give a shout out to our fuel team because they executed in a in a challenging in somewhat of a challenging environment really well but what i would say is that over the last couple of years fuel margins have been really volatile and there's been a lot of exogenous reasons for that but this quarter was a little bit more ratable from a supply standpoint and so the way we look at fuel margins moving forward is that these margins at more elevated than historic margin levels i think are a reflection of what's going to be happening in the future i think they are more sustainable at these higher levels and a lot of that has to do with the fragmentation of our industry the 2 thirds of the kinesisor industry are operated by chains of 10 stores or less and so when you think about the inflationary environment we've been in through the last couple of years it puts a lot of pressure on those smaller operators and they have to raise fuel prices and extract more margin just simply to survive and so in that environment that works really to our favor and we're seeing that play through on a lot of different fronts in our business so so how would you characterize or describe the pricing strategy going in to q 4 and early next year ex gas well from a pricing standpoint we we look at category by category and our and our merchants spend a lot of time trying to position our pricing relative to our competition based on what that category is so in some categories we wanna be very aggressive and we wanna drive traffic for those categories and so we'll price it accordingly in other categories maybe we don't we don't have that focus and we're more looking to to gain margin and grow gross profit dollars and so we we strike a balance across the assortment and it all blends into pretty good margins for us and and frankly we've got some of the best inside margins in the industry as a result of that approach
Speaker 0,Reporter,so how big can you get you have your stores are mostly right in the middle of the country midwest right ohio indiana illinois how how how big are your ambitions when it comes to expanding
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,"well we can we can grow a lot sarah and you know just a a quick data point we have 25 100 stores in 16 states but 2,000 of those stores are in only 9 states that we operate in so we have a lot of white space just in our existing geography but there are small towns and rural communities across the us obviously and so with only 17 states penetrated at this or 16 states rather penetrated at this point we still have a long long runway for growth"
Speaker 0,Reporter,how discretionary is convenience store spending darren what happens typically in recession because gas you need but you know those extra little treats that people buy i don't know
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,yeah actually sarah you know we perform really well in in recessionary environments and you know one of the things that really helps our business model is that we sell basic needs so 80% of what we sell is consumed within minutes of purchase and really highlighted by our prepared foods business and so when you think of of more discretionary retail it's easy to give up maybe not buying that new television set or that couple $100 pair of jeans but when you're talking about your delicious breakfast pizza and a cup of coffee every morning or your energy drink to get you through the day those are low dollar purchases and really make you feel better at about getting through the day and so we find that the categories we play in are very resilient in recessionary times
