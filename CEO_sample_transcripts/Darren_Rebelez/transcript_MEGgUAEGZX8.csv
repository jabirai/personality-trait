Speaker 0,Reporter 1,look for a moment at why the street is disappointed with these results i mean as a proxy for so many stores like yours tell us about you know looking through the summer into the fall how strong is demand gonna be what kind of workforce do you anticipate you're gonna have what's gonna be going on with pricing pressures can we stay in the sweet spot or not
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,"yeah hey kelly thanks for having me and it's great to be here yeah like like you said we we just wrapped up a a record year for us 18% earnings per share growth year over year as an all time high $729,000,000 in ebitda again another all time high our our comps have great momentum ended the 4th quarter like you said and really would strengthen our prepared foods business so you know i guess what i'd say about today's trading is that it's a great buying opportunity for for investors to pick up our stock at a at at a little moment in time when it's pulling back a little bit but we see a lot of momentum moving forward we've already started the q1 our fiscal q1 off with great momentum as we come out of the pandemic and you know one of the things that's been unique about our business like you mentioned is that we have this big prepared foods business and when the pandemic hit last year that was probably the portion of our business that was most negatively impacted as self serve food was shut down in a lot of municipalities and people weren't commuting as much we're starting to see that unravel now morning traffic is growing we're not all the way back to 2019 levels but we certainly feel much better about where that business has gone our breakfast business is starting to improve our lunch business is starting to improve and so we expect that to continue to improve over the course of this year"
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,i know ceos hate to talk about their stock price on any given day but let let me let me ask you whether you think that the market is misunderstanding something because the numbers you're putting out there sound awfully awfully good so let me get you to answer that one first and while i'm while i got you do you make more money selling gasoline when prices are higher when prices are low
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,well i'll i'll go ahead with with the stock first i think i think you know one of the focus areas on the call this morning was our our outlook on operating expense and it was a little bit higher than i think people were expecting now there's reasons for that we made the 2 largest acquisitions in our company's history about a 150 stores in total and those come online really in q1 and so i don't i don't know that that was fully captured so we we said operating expense would grow mid teens percentage but that was driven off 9% store growth so most of that is just incremental units our actual same store sales run rate on operating expenses very much in line with our historical numbers so i know our team is on sell side calls as we speak and i think we're sorting through all that so i i expect that to be somewhat of a temporary reaction
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,okay so that okay we got that one out of the way how about do you make more money when gas prices are high or when they are low i assume your volumes are up compared with a year ago
Speaker 1,Darren Rebelez,you know our our volumes are up yeah we just wrapped up the the q4 with volumes up about 6 a half percent over prior year so getting better certainly we don't necessarily make more money on gasoline when prices are high versus prices low that margin tends to normalize at a rate it's usually more the the journey that you take when prices are moving up the commodity price tends to move faster than the retail price so that can compress margins in the short term and then on the back side of that curve when cost start to drop retails fall a little slower than the commodity cost so the margins widen but over time those things tend to normalize shepard smith here thanks for watching cnbc on youtube
