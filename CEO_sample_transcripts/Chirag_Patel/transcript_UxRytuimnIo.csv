Speaker,Detected Speaker,Text
Speaker 0,Reporter,first of all i wanna thank mister patel for joining us today and each and every one of you for joining as well very recently we started streaming our calls on clubhouse as well and last i checked there's close to 50 people listening in on there everyone on this webinar thank you so much for joining here as well during the course of this call please feel free to have add any questions you have in the chat or if you are listening from clubhouse just text them to me directly and yeah let's get started so as someone again that's an immigrant to this country myself and plans to work in the biotech industry after graduation there are so many aspects of mister patel's story and areas of expertise that i resonate with and i know so many of the people listening today are inspired as well and ultimately we all wanna learn what can we as students and young people that are still in college do to learn and grow and live our lives you know in the most effective way possible so i kinda wanna start at the beginning i remember one of the first time you spoke you told me the story of arriving to this country with $20 and working at a candy store what was that experience of moving to the us like for you
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,so first of all nitya thank you very much for inviting me i'm very excited to speak with you and the rest of your friends and the students from nyu you guys are the future of this country and the world as a whole so thank you very much and if i can be of any help i'll be glad and i'll be very happy to do that so i came to this country in 1987 when i was age of 15 i i had completed 10th grade in india and i went to high school here in 11th grade and as we you know like most of the immigrant that you come with almost nothing and that was i give credit to my parents because they wanted us to kind of on our way and work hard that was his condition for coming to this country because my father was well-to-do back in india so we kind of came with almost nothing and i started working it was a summertime came around april and my first job was in a candy store in new york with little or no english so that was very exciting but new york city is the best city in the world mhmm and it teaches you things very fast so it was a very great experience came to know a lot of people in candy store you get to meet like so many different people and started talking a little bit english back
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,but it was big people they were very supportive so i i i think my first job is still very close to my heart i made $3 an hour and there was i think the first paycheck was also very humbling and i still remember i would walk 30 blocks because i did not want to spend a dollar on the subway
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,so i used to change stores between you know like old world trade center all the way on the 62nd
Speaker 2,Reporter ,street yeah
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,mississippi subway and then walk back to 42nd street so it was quite a experience so you know different parts of new york city and people from different walks of life and how they were acting and behaving and was trying to copy them but that memories are still with me today's date you know and new york city is my most favorite city in the world
Speaker 0,Reporter,what a story to begin your time in this country at a candy store i remember sharing that with people at our meeting and everybody loved that so in the past few months i've been lucky to again speak to various leaders whether that's narayan amurthy or doctor rhonda and they they all speak to this moment where they realized they had to trust their intuition and take a risk and learning about your background you worked as a pharmacist for 8 years before you jumped into being an entrepreneur and what inspired you to pursue entrepreneurship at that point in your life and had you considered it earlier in life
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,so many of us in 2011 we won the eny entrepreneur of the year award for the pharmaceutical industry myself and my brother and this question was asked that whether leaders are born or you can make a leader right so i think it starts with early age nitya i was a dreamer from my childhood i had big dreams wanted to do something even when i worked at a candy store i remember that's the first time i sat in a mercedes my boss used to have a mercedes and i never had seen mercedes in my life
Speaker 0,Reporter,right
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,you know the first instinct or oh i wish one day i can buy a mercedes so i think at the age of 15 i started having those dreams mhmm but dreams without action has no meaning
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"so i think but you are gonna be realistic also i i just can't see the dreams i you know i was very cognizant about family you know getting married having kids so i had no choice but to go with my education and start making some money so i can start my life and start my family so i think that was my first goal but back on my mind i had that entrepreneurial thing running that wanted to do something i had no clue what i wanted to do right because i had no money so always there was a tech boom in 2000 wanted to do something in technology but i don't nothing about technology so i said that's a wrong idea but what i'm trying to tell is that it's the thought process it's the dream it's just trying to do something so always had that entrepreneurial spirit inside me mhmm that was not satisfied by working and working was very important because i think it gave me the exposure to you know the retail side of the business on on on on you know how the drugs are being dispensed and what are their peer system and all that and most importantly i came closer to my patient and and was able to see what they are feeling what what's what are the unmet need so i think that time i got inspired when i saw the stories on many many patient coming back in 90 6 to 2,002 3 the generic industry was not evolved or developed like the way it is today so health care cost was very very high so even with insurance the generic was only 30% so our senior citizens and other people coming for a prescription had to pay a lot of higher co co co payment right now you go to a store most of the g generics are 0 or $5"
Speaker 0,Reporter,it's covered
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,mhmm so back then it was like $50 $100 because no generics and even the generic scoop even was high but brand was even much higher mhmm so average senior had to spend like 4 $600 just on a co pay every month
Speaker 0,Reporter,that's crazy
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,these people are living paycheck to paycheck so that time i got inspired what can i do to help drugs more accessible and affordable and that's where i thought that if i want to do something let me start out where it has a purpose where i can help people by doing the good things and that's where i decided and of course you know it ultimately then boils down to the family my lovely wife my dad and my parents and then my brother all of us kind of help and support it mhmm and it was a dream and just became dream became into reality with hard work and passion and great people and that's where we are today
Speaker 0,Reporter,so when when you had to first make that meeting of starting the company how did you i guess could you have predicted where this was growing how did you trust what the next or first step was to make
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"so i think the biggest decision is the first one that taking the first step i think for any person who wants to start the business or for the student i think the first one is always the toughest one especially as a pharmacist you know you make $100,000 salary i was you know started as a pharmacist when i was 25 was working my wife was working we were saying you know enough money and and we were like comfortable in our life so for me the biggest thing was i had to do something i got tired of being pharmacist i was not learning anything new and i was lucky to have the support system so first step i did that i cannot do both things i didn't i didn't want to do half like work so i quit my job so i think the important thing was to quit my job and i did not take any salary for 2 years i did not make because i never went to a professional mba school or you know schools like nyu i'm a graduate as a pharmacist i did not have the business background or kind of put lot of analysis i think word analysis is a paralysis so first thing is also keep it simple mhmm so you know once i i felt i wanted to do something i know the role was tough but i had to start something and the biggest thing is i'm a very fast learner"
Speaker 2,Reporter ,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"and you know whatever available resources i thought i had to do it we started our business with less than $200,000 myself and i had 2 other friends mhmm but that time i could not have thought about you know pfizer's of the world or jng or teva their budgets i just had little money and and the kid with no knowledge no background no pharma background but i was so hungry i was so driven i had so much passion and belief and and i knew that i had ability to learn fast so my only thing i was like i need to get to point a to point b doesn't matter if i walk i run i crawl i drive i go by plane i go by c but i will get to point yeah so i think that's what my inner drive was and that's what led me to make that decision that i will do it my lovely wife said go ahead do it no issue i'm here i'm working and i'll support you so i think i had a good i would i would give a lot of credit to my wife and my father for supporting and then my brother joined in 2,005 but initially that first step was only because of the family support"
Speaker 2,Reporter ,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,and i was able to leave my job and focus full time on the dreams that i was having about pharma
Speaker 0,Reporter,"right to give all of you a context of what $200,000 means a typical drug to be released in in the pharmaceutical industry building a plant like that takes 1,000,000 and 1,000,000 of dollars so again $200,000 to us as students seems like you know it's a lifetime worth of earnings but in the pharmaceutical industry that's like pennies on the dollar for for what it takes to really build something and that's really remarkable i wanna go into a little bit about amneal and what the work is done there some of the work that you are doing there so you talked a little bit about you have this tremendous generic business that's saved patients so much money over the years but recently you've kind of transitioned transitioned into dealing with specialty drugs and rare diseases yes and i kind of want i was wondering if you can speak to that transition and because you're taking a big bet you know if pharma is expensive you can bet the preclinical commercial bringing a drug doing research you know that that is a really big investment to make so i'm curious if you can speak to that transition"
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"sure great question nita so first of all amneal is a 3rd largest united company in united states right now we have over 6,000 employees close to 2,000,000,000 plus in revenue and we are a global company and we are a very powerful and strong r and d engine so in 2018 we did a reverse merger and we acquired a company called impax through that acquisition we went public part of that we acquired a specialty division so we got some product in parkinson's disease in movement disorder and then we had another company called gemini we folded that company into part of our specialty division so we have 2 leading assets in specialty you know raichary and unithroid in endocrinology and parkinson's disease but you are absolutely right it takes 1,000,000 what you were saying before 200,000 is not even a a penny for a pharma business so when i started a business people were saying that what are you are you nuts i mean with 200,000 you want you you want a small tablet machine cost cost a half a $1,000,000 so very quick story but what i want to tell the students don't get deterred by all the negative thoughts there are plenty of challenge there is no challenges everybody would be doing so i was told we needed a tablet machine and other machinery and we only had $100,000 mhmm so i'm like no and i don't like i'm like no but i still have to make it happen i do need a tablet press i cannot spend 500,000 because i had no money"
Speaker 0,Reporter,right
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"so we i i went to india with my father-in-law and supported for a tablet machine for $8,000"
Speaker 0,Reporter,oh my god
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,custom custom made that tablet machine we used it for 15 years
Speaker 0,Reporter,oh my god
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"15 years and we made over 1,000,000,000 tablet on that machine i still have that machine as part of my library but that's the kind of story that you have to there is always a way if you put your mind to it there is always a way same way we are very very well centered on generic side we have worth 360 products approved specialty we are making a transition but we are not losing our focus on generics generics we are doing complex generics we have every drug delivery platform in house means just not the tablet capsule but we have liquid transdermal nasal spray inhalation all the injectable products so our engine is pretty set and i have 750 plus doctors and master degrees and scientists working on that plus we have started biosimilars that's part of our genetics also mhmm especially we are not doing the drug discovery yeah so there's 2 segment of drug discovery"
Speaker 0,Reporter,got it
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,ones that like pfizer or j and j's of the world they're looking after new targets new therapy what we are doing in a specialty what we are trying to do not transition we are adding in our vertical growth area
Speaker 0,Reporter,got it
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,is to add in the middle piece which is we are taking existing molecule mhmm and we are repurposing or refurbishing that molecule through the technology platform we have a proprietary technology platform
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"which is got grs oros platform called grande and kronotech okay so using that technology platform we can repurpose older products which has lot of unmet need and has lot of issues from a drug delivery platform and it has a truncated or narrower pathway from the regulatory approval perspective and it costs much less it costs around less than $50,000,000"
Speaker 2,Reporter ,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"the branch site may cost you up to 3 to $500,000,000"
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay so
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,right so that's the difference so we are first going 1st step
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 2,Reporter ,as
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,we build the amniel on generic side we started with vitamins and then we went to you know all the counter prescriptions same thing on a specialty we are doing the first phase it's called 505b2 which is a kind of a narrower path or a shorter path to get to approval because these are already known molecule you are repurposing them for a different indication or with technology platform
Speaker 0,Reporter,right
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,and then we will get to you know little more advanced which is the prodrugs and metabolites and then we go to a new new chemical entity discovery so i just wanted to let you guys know that we are not taking a big big bets on r and d we are being very careful and very methodical approach one step at a time but always goal is to get to the final stage we are here to build the company in the long term
Speaker 0,Reporter,absolutely and thank you so much for sharing that again something to keep learning about the pharmaceutical industry is that investment aspect that comes into play and i kinda wanna ask you that question more from like a business leadership perspective when you first started what do you think you did differently that investors or people that put money into the company took a chance on you because i'm sure you had doubters i'm sure you had people that were wondering you know what what are you gonna do differently in the landscape of pfizer and some of the companies you mentioned and how did you overcome that yourself or convince other people to get on board with you
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"so great question so until 2018 so i started company end of 2,002 until 2018 maybe we're a private company so we did not have the institutional investors or vc or some private equity it was all funded through friends and family so called so initially what happened was in 2005 after my brother joined we had a partner out of from california he was the largest hotelier called tarsilia group and he wanted to diversify and we were we only had a single plant out of paris in new jersey"
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,but when he met us myself and my brother he saw something very unique
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"that these boys has you know ultimately the it starts with honesty and integrity yep most of the businesses failed not because of the business itself but because of partnership issues mhmm the internal problem internal working issues so when our partner out of california who had funded initial $100,000,000 saw that chemistry between himself and us and he backed us and the 1st 2 years we went kind of slowly 2005 to 2007 and then when we were comfortable we became very very close where we had a common goal we were aligned on our priorities we had the good strategy in place and in 2008 he started backing us financially even more and we went and acquired 2 companies that's it gave us the scale and then we grew from there and once you start making money there are plenty of people wants to give you money the problem is when you don't have money no one nobody wants to give money so then once we became ebitda positive and a bigger organization we had we had many many banks and everybody else you know we are s and p moody rating we got the eny audience so then there was plenty of institution available to raise more money"
Speaker 0,Reporter,my favorite thing about this call so far is you keep going back to this thing of you know culture how you treat people a family and i wanna speak to again in in the culture of amneal what are the things that you consider to be the most important and how have you helped those things remain a core part of the company as the company has grown
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"so nitya for you and all the students the number one thing for being any successful business or enterprise is the culture of their organization right strategies comes and goes right we are not robots we are not machines maybe in future it will be different but right now we are humans and we all are connected somehow with each other so and neil we are connected as one big family and even now today we are 6,000 people public company when we are private we haven't lost our core value system which is family our can do attitude our out of box thinking you know leave your egos outside the door work as one thing for common goal you know a common sense and logic keep it simple so we have this value system which we have since inception kept it and kept cultivating and growing our culture so when even though when new people came they understood and they become part of we got it in 1,000,000 because ultimately it's the people that makes difference we are so blessed to a wonderful 6,000 people without them we are nothing and everybody counts so that's another thing we had top to bottom we are not hierarchy like a top corporate like it's only elt members you know we bring everybody together and our entire organization is connected with with each other and we i and my brother we touch everybody top to bottom still today's date and i think culture of that family values and foundation it still carries forward it will always remain with us and without that i don't think we can grow and that's the reason we have grown until 2018 we are growing at about 35 to 40% cagr that's a big big growth and we started and up to 2,005 our revenue was less than 5,000,000 5 to 15 we crossed a $1,000,000,000 then today we are over a 2 over $2,000,000,000 so i think it's only possible because of people and loving and trusting your people and making them part of the dream and we all are together there's there's nothing owner or not owner it's just the team"
Speaker 0,Reporter,i'm inspired already i wanna transition though you originally came from india and you came to the us and like so many of us that have come to the us you came with big dreams and built a business here and recently there's kind of been this renewed interest of business growth back in india we've seen you know some of jeff bezos and facebook stake is the reliant we've also seen a lot of growth of like newer start ups there and kind of getting a sense of you know the understanding of people in india coming onto the internet and what that means for growth there and i'm curious as someone that came to this country to kind of build business that you did what do you think can be done in india to create an environment that's more conducive to entrepreneurship and business as one that exists in the us
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"great question so nitya i don't know if you're familiar we have a huge presence in india also we have about 6 to 7 plants over 4,000 employees okay okay state of the art facilities in india mhmm i i i think governments are changing we had a great experience from ease of doing business there are certain areas still you know the country needs to change fundamentally from the you know certain bureaucracy still existing but over the period of time i think i see a bright future for ease of doing business the greatest part about india is its talent pool you know right now if i see between india and us we have to struggle here to find people"
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"it takes time and in india is the highest number of human population in the world people are getting educated a lot more so i i think the access to talent plus it's going to be a very large consumer market so i you know i totally see why amazon of the world and other people want to go it's a 1.3 to 1,400,000,000 people we are migrating many people out of poverty into middle class so middle class is growing exponentially so i think there is a lot of growth in all sector whether it's a consumer sector it sector pharma i think there's plenty of talent you know government capital access is also becoming a little easier than what it was before the approval process that are getting easier the bureaucracy is less they have special economic zones they have created which gives a lot of incentive from tax perspective so i think there's plenty there that i think india can play a crucial role in balancing the demand of the world from many many items right now especially there is a big issues going on on the supply chain side you know not to have a focus in one particular country so i think india can provide that solution to the world"
Speaker 0,Reporter,absolutely we're already getting a lot of questions sent in but before we go to questions that people listening and have i have a few kind of advice for students that you may have that i kind of wanna touch on i'm currently a senior in college about to graduate and begin my career in the space of biotechnology i'm kind of curious if you were my age what would you choose to work on or what would you maybe have done differently looking back
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,so i'll answer your second question so i don't think i i would do anything differently mhmm because i'm i i'm a firm believer over analysis or paralysis make a decision there is no decision which is a right decision or wrong decision
Speaker 0,Reporter,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,it is a decision right and i don't like to ponder and say whether it was right or not right mhmm we as a human we have to make it into a right decision as much as possible if it doesn't work it doesn't work but so i think i would not change anything i'm blessed with the greatest family greatest employees i think things have worked out as far as advising the student and and the new ideas i think you know pursue pursue your dreams i mean there's plenty of opportunity out there you have to have that passion and that purpose that whatever will make impact in the society you know business with purpose will have long lasting potential so every time it's not the business model and the number and spreadsheet it's up here and in here in your heart and in mind and pursue your dreams and you know work hard be honest the character plays a major role so you have to have the right character and values within you right and and start somewhere just don't think on a sideline and think about what can go wrong think about what can go right and and start it it's a one life to live go out and do it you know the the ai is a very growing field the machine learning people talk about pharma is moving a lot into biologics and stem cell research and other biologics you know we are doing so much research in pharma site that the world population will have excess and plus longevity and maybe cure for many many disease where people you know i i don't think i mean today's baby may live up to 100 years without a doubt so i think we we will we will have a lot of solutions so any of these areas are a growing area so we have to add up to the new digital age so anything you do the technology will play an important role even in a pharma we are adapting you know ai tools and other things to kind of cut down the development time which will bring much faster discovery to the market and and access to patient who requires the drugs so i think i'm i'm a pharma guy and i think there's a lot more potential so i highly analyze biotechnology or you know pharma world you know the new research in those area even the technology that can support the discovery from the it perspective so plenty of choices but most important is what you like to do do it out there if you're passionate purpose you'll figure it out and you'll be very very successful all the students
Speaker 0,Reporter,thank you so much before we move to questions i have one last question for you is i feel like what i've admired most is the mindset that you have it's like continually positive always looking for you know the next opportunity to grow and connect and i'm curious how you developed that or if that was like an innate part of you or that was something that that you work to actively develop every day
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,so it's a continuous process right some comes with the experience but it's a unique part of me i was maybe born with certain qualities right but i think throughout the courses i think it's the character that builds that even more right like i believe in doing things right way and when you do things right way with the right purpose for and and with hard work i believe in divine blessing so i think meditation and spirituality has been a bigger part of it and that gives me that confidence that gives me that drive and and ability to think positively that divine will never let me fail you know push you the divine will will push me to the edge but will never let me fall down because my purpose and intentions are so good so that's been kind of flowing that energy that universal energy is flowing right every day my confidence levels is going up and up and up so i would say practice whatever you believe faith plays a major role i personally believe in our professional and and a personal success both
Speaker 0,Reporter,mister grishtel thank you so much we have a lot of questions and i wanna give students a chance to ask navdeepak i'm gonna unmute you go ahead
Speaker 2,Reporter ,hello can you hear me
Speaker 0,Reporter,yes
Speaker 2,Reporter ,okay so my question thank you so much for doing this talk my question would be how do you build trust in the pharma industry keeping in mind the opioid crisis devastated an entire generation and there is a going movement of not taking the covid vaccine of course science should lead the way but how do you build that broken trust and let the science do magic in the future how would you how would you connect that
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"right so good question so i think again you can see a glass half full or glass half empty right it's all about the perspective what do we hear if i hear one particular news channel its world is coming to end if i listen to some other media outlets but overall i'm very proud of pharma industry special generic industry has given $1,000,000,000,000 worth of savings the opioid crisis is a very serious crisis and it should not have happened but same time those drugs did play a major role in in helping many many patient so i think the there was some greed on some of the company's side and that should never happen but overall even if you look at right now in a covid situation how the world has come together in you know 1 year to discover vaccine is remarkable it's unprecedented task how it it takes usually 5 10 years to come out with something right so i i i i think pharma and and what it's doing on all the research side of course you will always have 1 or 2 bad actors and who has agreed and and goes out of their way and their only focus is to make money out of something but i think overall pharma industry and their intent is good i think sometimes it's the media and the messaging but you know like me many people are driven to just help the patient improve the quality of life of patient as far as the vaccine i think again it's the social media and the wrong messaging these are good vaccines and i personally i recommend everyone to take vaccine and we just don't know what the duration how long the effect would last but right now this is what we got and as a as a world because it's not when you take vaccine you're just not helping yourself as a world citizen you are helping each other it's a highly contagious disease so so when you decide to take or not take don't be self centered or just think about yourself think about the society and the science and what data we have available which clearly shows that even you know especially the new vaccines pfizer and moderna is working and has a 90% efficacy rate and you know trust the fda and other authority that they have done their due diligence and so far knock on wood you know there hasn't been any serious side effects or not so i don't think there is anything to lose there is all the positive stuff take vaccine"
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah we we always come back to mindset and that that's really where it all begins mitch you're next i'm gonna unmute you
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"amazing thank you so much so my question is what makes somebody a fabulous leader first of all connect with your heart only speak from your heart you know people are very smart in my experience of 15 years one thing i realized when i started the business i was the first employee i started by myself right to today to 6,000 people one thing i really realized that at all level whether it's your janitor whether it's your operator or your vice president they all can read your mind and heart so in order to be a good effective leader you have to touch people's heart and for that you have to be genuine you have to walk your talk you need to keep things very simple don't complicate matters i believe in simply simplistic approach so i i i and and and just you know you know lead by an example you have to inspire people where you give them the path you give them the clarity of thoughts you give them clear cut vision and and and and really be there for people i had many many folks who joined us by taking 50% salary back because they believed in the dream and the work we are doing and the purpose we had in our business so i think their genuancehip your character will lead to being the best leader you can possibly can amazing thank you"
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay we have a few questions in the chat as well and then i'll go back to letting people talk the first is from rahat right here it says you mentioned that the talent pool in india allows companies to speed up the process in terms of growth when compared to us and considering that what do you think companies in the us can do to boost that talent pool so that future in the future that's less of an issue
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,well america is being the leader on innovation right so there's 2 types of talent pool one is it's from the service or the kind of manufacturing type of talent pool and one is on the innovation side i think america is still a leader on innovation and we need to continue to advance in research we need to focus a lot more we have lost our manufacturing sector there has been some talks in washington to do these infrastructure bills where we'll you know government is willing to spend so much money to create manufacturing jobs but i think here it's more on research high end still america is leading china and sketching up very fast in india it's more of a service and manufacturing but india also need to kind of innovate and go more towards innovation just being a manufacturing and service provider so i think in america we have to adjust according to you know the cost of living and and others we cannot compete as a america owner manufacturing jobs or some you know low paying jobs so i i i think we need we need to continue to innovate in america find jobs create the education system that makes you know many great scientists may you know many great it people in in many many areas so i i think it's just the it starts with the education system
Speaker 0,Reporter,beautiful i got a question from aman that was listening in earlier he sent it to me he asked me have you ever had a mentor and if so who was that and what was kind of the relationship you had with them
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,you know this question has been asked to me by many many times but unfortunately i never had a mentor i had to learn everything my mentor was my challenges and my the mistakes i was making so everything i learned by facing some issues or challenges it was like i i you know i'm very poor on the finance side of the business i'm i'm more of a product strategy idea type so i think everything i learned was by facing the problem or issues or challenges i never had a mentor who taught me when on a pharma side so it just as i said before i'm a fast learner and i learn i don't read that many books either i i don't think i've read any complete book in my whole life so i think i just my mentor is my divine my universal energy and and through meditation practices and spiritual practices whatever the inspiration i i i get he's been my true mentor
Speaker 0,Reporter,i love that we got another question from rachel right here it says what was a moment where did or did you ever have a moment where after a failure you doubted yourself or how do you deal with failure in your own life
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"again there there was plenty of challenges and failures and and i think number one credit goes to family blessed to have a great family and when the failure happened my wife my parents my brother they all were there to support we were together so i think that the notion of being together joined family helped a lot in in overcoming those failures and challenges and second i had a fantastic people i think without those employees i'm nothing today so i think they could never even see me down or in trouble i have so many heart touching stories that brings tears in our eyes i had people coming in offering $5,000 because in 2,004 i had no money and if i was upset and was not able to make a payroll or paycheck i had people saying don't worry they call me chintu i don't worry don't worry here is $5,000 so this is you know how can i not overcome my failures when i've surrounded myself with one of the most amazing people amazing family so all kudos and credit to those people"
Speaker 0,Reporter,that's a lesson right there is who you surround yourself with is a big part of absolutely how you grow in itself we just got a question from gabriel and then jay i'm gonna get your questions as well gabriel asked what are the most important lessons you've learned when it comes to managing a team
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,managing a team first of all keep very clarity don't give mixed messages mhmm delegate effectively you know over delegation is not good and under delegation is not good so when you want to manage your team put right people in right place give clarity give clear cut agenda and goals and keep list amount of politics when you give common goals and it all starts with you if you are clear and if you are not giving different messages and you don't have any hidden agenda i think your team would definitely unite together and and they pick up from you so it all starts from you mhmm as a leader as a ceo or the owner of the organization you set the tone and if you set the right tone and you give the right message and clarity and clarity of thoughts
Speaker 2,Reporter ,mhmm
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,i i i i think managing the team becomes very very easy easier again i i've never gone to a management school
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,when i started my business my direct report was only 1 my technician wow in the pharmacy store mhmm i had no idea what how to conduct a meeting or how to interview somebody still today's date i don't know and i just it just you know it's everybody has different style you know there is no particular style but do what suits you and what's going to keep the team together and make sure they are cross functionally working together for a common goal
Speaker 0,Reporter,wow i again i'm i'm so continually surprised by where did that trust in yourself is that just innate confidence that came from you know i have to make this happen or because i think what again in speaking to people over the course of doing these interviews there's always that that seems to be such a common thread and i i to every student that listens i'm i always go back to like there's almost this stubbornness of you know i'm gonna make it happen whether i know how to make it happen or not and it's that's the most remarkable thing and hear people talk about their journey every time
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,"you have to be a fighter never give up keep fighting keep working hard doing little little things and always remember there is always a way there is always a way every problem comes with a solution okay that's how you have to think and don't get those negative thoughts i know i need $10,000,000 to start a business no no no you can start with 100,000 okay you can start with 10,000 okay there is nothing written in books so when you keep your mind very clear very simplistic apply common sense and logic everything is possible and purpose is very important because see i always have been driven by purpose i never made a business plan that i would be a million or a billionaire or i'm going to make this much money my goal i wanted to do something i wanted to make my first prescription drugs or over the counter i want to make my first specialty drugs i want to bring the biologics i want to bring the new chemical ntp so i'm driven by what i want to achieve financial success just follows mhmm"
Speaker 0,Reporter,it's always
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,give up never give up
Speaker 0,Reporter,"it's yeah go to india get a $8,000 tablet"
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,yes there's always a way
Speaker 0,Reporter,there's always a way jay i'm getting to your question so the first one that jay asked is do you think the convergence of ai and biotech in the future can bring india and the us into a stronger partnership in the future
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,absolutely jay i think india and us are 2 largest democracy fantastic talent pool available in both countries it you know india is known for its it talent and now a lot more drug discoveries are happening from there so i think the you know whether it's a biotechnology or utilizing the ai tools whatever the technology i think india and us will play a vital role going forward not only on pharma side i've spoken with many many politicians we are natural allies
Speaker 2,Reporter ,and i
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,think many areas beyond pharma whether it's a defense or a consumer side of it many other areas i think india and us will see a lot more closer relation shift going forward whether it's a republican or democrat doesn't matter it is going to happen i've spoken with both sides of the aisle democrat republic unanimously you know they all sometimes you know small issues happens on a some ill informed media messages and they made some statements but the both countries are very close and i see a very very fantastic partnership evolving over the coming years
Speaker 0,Reporter,beautiful and jay had one more question before we turn to we had 1 or 2 from clubhouse as well it said how do you feel hipaa regulations will evolve as biotech becomes more digital
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,hipaa regulations will be made i think the progress is very important for people and and i don't think biotechnology will have any impact on hipaa regulation right we just need to protect the information on internet and it's more before it used to be paper based now it's more everything is out there in cloud i'm not a it guy mhmm but i don't think the biotechnology will have any impact on hipaa regulations
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay so we got a question from justin who actually comes from a family that also is part of a family business and he wanted to ask what was the experience like for you in working but then also being related to family and how have you found you know that process to be in terms of existing and loving and being with family but then you're also running this you know competitive intense business together
Speaker 1,Chirag Patel,well there is nothing like family i'm i'm i'm a big family guy i i i think as i told you justine i was able to start the business because of joint family and and you know it starts with my lovely wife and parents and brother and i and my brother we are 2 ceos and the relationship is even beyond our partner he's like a brother too tushar so i see i i think it's fantastic i think i have many many cousins and extended family also working at it's all about you again i trust people more than they trust themselves right so it's a if i trust and if i don't put them in a some kind of a box or looking at them with some kind of a microscope or doubt people they are doing this or that i think i cannot speak for other families but our family have adjusted well you know i would say at least 20 30 people of my family are working here and in india and so far knock on wood is always well so i think it goes goes down to your family chemistry but i and my brother has complimentary expertise and it's been a perfect set of expertise and you know only few companies as co ceos and not for good we have really have worked well as being a brother and as a co ceo both
Speaker 0,Reporter,beautiful i wanna end we only have a few minutes left and i and i wanna use this time to just ask you what advice do you have for everyone listening today because when i first kind of shared your story with everybody and was talking to them the idea that someone comes into this country works at a candy store and then you know has the ability to from a dream build something so big i think as students that that's what we study for and that's what you know we hope to do ourselves so i'm curious any advice you have to anybody listening today
