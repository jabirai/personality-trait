Speaker 0,Reporter 1,shares of american superconductor have just about doubled so far in 2020 this is a company that services various energy firms as well as the us navy it's gotten some new contracts this year and of course there has also been some interest in renewable energy with an incoming biden administration we're joined now by daniel mcgahn he is the ceo of american superconductor it's good to see you daniel so i i wanna talk to you about that biden transition first of all before we dig down into your business because i'm curious what if anything you think is going to change for you under biden administration and what kind of policy changes you expect that might affect the renewable energy market in the united states
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,hi julie it's great to be back again i think some of the changes ahead you know relating to paris and climate accords and further focus on sustainability that our company really is trying to help enable the super grid of the future to bring more renewables to bear and also to bring more inherent resiliency to that system as that system evolves over time so politically it looks like there's some emerging tailwinds that are coming but i think we still have to figure out where we're gonna be with the senate and what policies are gonna dictate but only a piece of our business is in the us but we're we're looking very optimistically at 2021 and beyond
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,and so then daniel thinking about you know some of those those tailwinds for your business and and thinking more broadly and and you know when your business comes up i think about the trends in esg that we've seen from a from a lot of investors and the way that the investment community now sort of thinks energy is going as you mentioned around the world where a lot of your businesses i mean have you been sensing that in conversations and seeing those trends in your business as well because on the investment side where you know we tend to focus our energy everyone talks a lot about esg and and especially in the e as that part of the equation is that something you're seeing as well in your business
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,yeah i think you know where our challenge is a lot of times esg they're focused on the operation of a company which we certainly are very clean and green in what we do but we're unique in a way where our products are inherently environmental and sustainable i mean we're we're ultimately trying to become you know a resilient company financially delivering resilient products for a sustainable future that's at at the essence what our company is about so i think the more things move in that direction i think the the more people are gonna understand that it's not just the operations of companies but it's the operation of the world and we're hoping at the tip of that
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,and dan you also work with various power companies around as you said around the globe and also around the country you signed a contract with the chicago utility provider where are we in smart grid penetration obviously there's gonna be a lot of focus on municipalities saving money right now because a lot of them are running short especially after the pandemic and how are they to sort of weigh the cost equation right of putting in these smart grid systems which presumably are expensive to put in but then save money in the long run
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,we're really trying to look at it maybe a different way where we're trying to make the grid itself actually more resilient and and more sustainable and more smart we're trying to make it inherently smarter it's really part of our mission we're not trying to work against utilities we're trying to work with them so the way we see the future is we're gonna compete against traditional capital spend the way we bring smarter energy to the grid is by enabling more renewables on be it large scale wind be it residential solar coming to the grid there's a play as well coming with us with electric vehicles both in connection to the grid but also in the mining of the raw materials there are power issues there that we think we can help help mitigate but in every case we look at the utility as our customer base and our advocate we're not gonna try to change the way that the edge of the grid works we wanna change inherently how the the the grid across the entire system works and if we can make that smarter and enable more clean energy i think we're gonna be better off
Speaker 3,Reporter 3,daniel how how or if is your business impacted if a president-elect biden cuts back on military spending compared to the trump administration or is what you're selling essential to to the navy
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,well we've been an essential operation we've been you know open in business here we're very much manufacturing focused so that's really we've tried to to keep product and people moving so that we can deliver high quality products to our customers on time we we do have a ramp in our business already coming with existing contracts for existing ships that have already been procured we just received this summer an order for a 3rd ship so we think you know smarter ships are gonna be part of the future i think thinking also about operating cost and environmental impact of of the operations i think also fit in with we're very well with what we do so we're not trying to to be cutting edge and trying to come up with the next generation ship we're trying to make the current fleet more secure and more safe from harm's way
Speaker 0,Reporter 1,and daniel finally i wanna ask you about profitability because right now you guys are posting losses what does the trajectory look like on that front
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,yeah we've had we've had a a few quarters here where we've been close to positive operating cash flow if we go back past the maybe past 2 years or so we've had a couple quarters we've never guided to we're gonna have positive operating cash flow until this past earnings re report so we actually guided to revenue levels that were within our model that we said we could potentially be operating cash flow and we did indeed guide to be positive operating cash flow for the first time at least over the the last decade or so that the company has been through so i don't wanna say we fully turned the corner but we have a lot of tailwinds behind us revenue has grown we've really focused on our grid our smart grid growth we've been able to grow the past 5 years running we expect to grow as well as this year ends for us at the end of march
