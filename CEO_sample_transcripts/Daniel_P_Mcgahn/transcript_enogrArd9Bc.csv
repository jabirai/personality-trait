Speaker 0,Reporter,joining me right now daniel mcgahn's with us president ceo chairman american superconductor thank you so much for being with us we think about power solutions and and wind and everything on the grid tell me a little bit about the latest and what the company's been working on
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,yeah we're at the center of all that right now there's a lot of tailwinds that we're starting to experience in the business we're about grid resiliency we're about bringing more renewables onto the grid we're also about working with large industrial companies now which is a new new part of our business to be able to make sure they have reliable power for their capacity to be able to make products and that could be from semiconductor to materials processing we think about the energy future it's gonna require a lot of materials and we feel like we're at the center of that
Speaker 0,Reporter,and it's interesting because everybody keeps talking about you know first it was evs and where are we gonna plug all these evs and now it's all about ai and data centers and power and all that i mean that must be a conversation that you're having right
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,yeah that's a deep conversation that we're having with multiple customers what the grid's gonna have to do in the future is something it's never been asked to do before it it becomes a lifeblood of everything we do it has been that way for a period of time but it's just gonna get deeper and broader and what we just felt is that we're in a nice situation right now we've experienced some nice growth we hope that that can continue with these tailwinds that are at the that are at our back right now on the business in multiple fronts from renewables to materials to semiconductor and even our military business is starting to grow
Speaker 0,Reporter,and your systems are protecting and helping the navy's fleet right tell me a little bit about that and that kind of contract and do you expect that partnership to be renewed and if so when that kind of what's the outlook with that
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,we have a long history with the us navy we've developed what is what we call a ship protection system it's basically noise canceling headphones for the ship it it takes the signature away that minefields would see we've been able to now be able to deliver that into the fleet we have 5 contracts with the us navy for that product we have a new product called the mine countermeasure device that the us navy has funded and hopefully that will go into production and we just announced about a week or so ago a major order with the canadian navy the royal canadian navy where they wanna take our technology now and also put that on multiple ships so we see this business starting to expand it's something we've been working on for a number of years and we're now starting to see that work come to fruition
Speaker 0,Reporter,wow congratulations i mean isn't that nice for you you've been working on it for a few years you've had the us navy that you've been working with and now you have the royal canadian navy saying we would like to work with american superconductor as well tell me a little bit about that deal is it does it help the bottom line does it give you more exposure what do you expect from this deal
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,"so if you think about the most recent financials we just start to break through with reporting non gaap net income and positive cash we did that for last year that's the first time in in a long time we've been able to do that if we rebuilt this business but going forward we think that the this canadian order it's a presents about a $75,000,000 contracted opportunity for us to do engineering plus multiple ships it should help transition that part of our business to start to generate margins similar to the rest of the business which certainly will help the bottom line pretty dramatically"
Speaker 0,Reporter,that's pretty exciting when will we see that take place will that be in the back half of this year or next year
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,"the the ramp for canada that's gonna start probably next year in 2025 and that will be a persistent level of revenue that we'll be able to deliver multiple ships at and we already have the 2 us platforms that have ramped up a bit so we're we're seeing probably let's say over the next 4 6 quarters we'll see a ramp of revenue for our ship protection business and then you know we'll hopefully we can continue to add to that backlog with with the us navy we've generated more than 50 $60,000,000 of hardware business to be able to insert in the fleet we've done tens of 1,000,000 of dollars of development the the real sea change here is we're doing production units now to be inserted into the fleet for the us navy and then hopefully i think our first ship system is due for the royal canadian navy in 2026"
Speaker 0,Reporter,and some deals in the world of wind as a power inox wind tell me a little bit some of those orders and what that means for the company maybe an explanation for folks who don't necessarily
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,turbine with our indian partner inox wind they're launching a 3 megawatt wind turbine that uses our control systems we got our first small production orders last year their backlog has doubled nicely over the past couple years here and it's going into a business in india that's projected to double again so we think that we're in a position where we're really literally gonna have the wind at our back in india and it helped drive additional growth in the business
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah i see mkm roth mkm maintaining a buy rating they they raised the target price to $27 you're 24.80 today up from 20 so you're getting some positive comments from the analysts i mean what do you tell them on the calls when they ask about some of the the headwinds let's say for your kind of company and how do you tackle those headwinds
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,yeah i think all of our analysts just raised all their targets for us yeah we we've had a business that had experienced some headwinds in our past i think that's behind us at least for the immediate future it seems like you know all four pieces that move our business are moving us in a very positive direction and we're very poised for growth i don't really have a negative thing to tell you today i wish i could create one i don't want i wanna knock on wood and say you know things are very good now and we think that they're only gonna get better you're here in the relatively near term
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah i see by the way i see oppenheimer craig hallum they raised i see it by ratings but their targets are $23 which is lower than the current stock price and the i
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,think one of them just raised it from 23 to 33 i think that just came out recently alright
Speaker 0,Reporter,so you'll take that right you'll take that tell me a little bit you know when you mentioned the headwinds you said well the 4 things that could be the headwinds all seem to be in line and yeah i don't want you to create any negativity and put that in the yeah good i you know i don't want you to create negativity and put that in the universe i like that things are going your way what are the 4 things that are could be the headwinds that are now in line with what you're hoping for for the next year yeah
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,we clearly don't see any headwinds i don't know if you're confusing tailwinds and headwinds because we've had an economy that has seen a lot of headwinds our business sees a lot of tailwinds we see a lot of positives in renewables and materials and semi conductors as well as the military everything is very well positioned for us right now that we should benefit nicely from the macro events that move our business
Speaker 0,Reporter,and what about the global footprint i mean you mentioned the work you're doing in canada where do we stand globally with this company
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,yeah we do about 3 quarters of our business in in north america obviously we're gonna see some expansion with canada there the other quarter of the business we do globally probably about 10% of our business has been in india hopefully that will continue to grow in the future so we were a number of years ago we were more of a diversified geography we've kinda went back home and built our us market and now we're starting to see expansion globally coming for us for for all our products which is another potential tailwind for us as well
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah daniel mcgahn thank you so much ceo at american superconductor great to
Speaker 1,Daniel P Mcgahn,see you
Speaker 0,Reporter,very much it's great to see you appreciate it
