Speaker 0,Reporter,welcome back and with me david jin the ceo of avalon global care welcome and so many interesting things to talk to you about in this field of health care
Speaker 1,David Jin,yes
Speaker 0,Reporter,there's so much happening let's start with your company
Speaker 1,David Jin,sure
Speaker 0,Reporter,avalon and just kinda tell me what you are doing in this company and then we'll go from there
Speaker 1,David Jin,sure athlon global care is a leading biotechnology company focusing on revolutionary cell based therapeutics and diagnostics
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay and so you were talking about some of your innovative technologies that you're doing right now kind of explain that to me what does that mean for people in the future of health care
Speaker 1,David Jin,sure at this point we are at the junction of a revolution in health care especially in terms of diagnostics which as you might be heard about something called liquid biopsy which is a revolutionary strategy that without using a needle to pick up cancer tissues actually we can use the liquid media in our body like and that
Speaker 0,Reporter,you're talking about blood
Speaker 1,David Jin,and saliva saliva and urine okay and we can make early diagnosis using this noninvasive way for early diagnosis of cancers
Speaker 0,Reporter,so the liquid biopsy so walk me through that if someone is experiencing some symptoms or is this something that would happen during a routine doctor's visit
Speaker 1,David Jin,it can be both okay because this is such an easy access okay to genetic and cellular materials in the liquid phase so we expect a explosion in this area as compared to traditional biopsy for cancer which increases the chance of survival and successful treatments yes you've reduced the risk of infection
Speaker 0,Reporter,that's right so you've reduced the risk of infection that's right so there's a lot
Speaker 1,David Jin,of advantages to
Speaker 0,Reporter,the liquid biopsies exactly okay let's talk about some other cutting edge stem cells
Speaker 1,David Jin,you've done some
Speaker 0,Reporter,work with that what's going on there for cellular therapy such as stem cell therapy
Speaker 1,David Jin,or you know so that we can repair and regenerate damaged tissues so this would be give me a practical application when would someone use
Speaker 0,Reporter,or need regenerative tissues
Speaker 1,David Jin,for example in liquid tumor or leukemia okay after you know serious high dose chemotherapy we can use hematopoietic stem cell or blood forming stem cells to regenerate the blood forming system
Speaker 0,Reporter,i see
Speaker 1,David Jin,so that we can increase the survival of people you know after high dose radiation or chemo and car t therapy yes
Speaker 0,Reporter,so that's got a lot of attention that we've already seen a ton of i mean we've barely gotten into the new year and we've seen major health care mergers already and they're related to car t therapy
Speaker 1,David Jin,yes
Speaker 0,Reporter,explain what car t is and then let's talk about how that might change people's lives
Speaker 1,David Jin,so car t therapy basically we are taking advantage of our native immune system the t cells and reengineer them so that we can now reinfuse back to our body so that fuse back to our body so that these re engineered t cells can attack the tumor so this is a very revolutionary type of cancer treatment modality because instead of like drug therapy you have to give it almost every day or in cycles for car t therapy just give it once because these engineered cells they have a memory they can follow okay the the cancer cells or even the recurrence of cancer cells and obviously this is at a very early stage even at the in the us we have 2 car t already approved but in the future i expect you know more and more you know in this car t you know area you know for both hematologic as well as solid tumors
Speaker 0,Reporter,well well that's what i was gonna ask so are these being used on patients now
Speaker 1,David Jin,yes they are yes there are 2 already fda approved in
Speaker 0,Reporter,the us so they're early but promising and could be expanded to other cancers later that's why immunotherapy is that different than car t
Speaker 1,David Jin,actually immune therapy can have 2 types 1 is using pharmaceutical agents such as you heard about the pd 1 pdl 1 pharmaceuticals and another type is cellular immunotherapy using or taking advantage of our immune cells such as t cells nk cells natural killer cells etcetera
Speaker 0,Reporter,what are the challenges with some of these
Speaker 1,David Jin,so again i think it's all about clinical experience and it is a relatively new strategy in fighting cancers that's why we need you know more clinical trials going on so that we can have a better understanding about the mechanism as well as the efficacy side effect profile of this type of cellular therapies but we're at a very exciting stage this is revolutionary and we are very excited to be part of this you know revolution
Speaker 0,Reporter,it certainly sounds like it a lot of really exciting things going on and thank you for the work that you do it's very important
Speaker 1,David Jin,thank you very much my pleasure
Speaker 0,Reporter,thank you david for joining us and thank you as well for joining us we'll be right back
