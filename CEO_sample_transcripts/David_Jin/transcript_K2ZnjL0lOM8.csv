Speaker 0,David_Jin,"excellent timor thank you so much so good morning everyone my name is david jen the president and ceo of avalon global care it's a great pleasure for me and our cfo luisa ingeciola to join the bensinger healthcare conference today just trying to move it okay as a nasdaq listed company we are in full compliance to sec policies for details of our form k's and q's filings please refer to the official sec website affluent global care is a clinical stage vertically integrated biotechnology company we are dedicated to develop and deliver innovative and transformative cellular technologies and therapeutics in the field of immuno oncology in a nutshell we aim to cure cancer by designing these living drugs called car t cell therapy our company was founded in 2016 as an otcqb company in less than 2 years aplon was successfully uplisted to nasdaq in december 2018 our headquarters is located in freehold township of new jersey currently we have approximately a 120 full time employees including those in our subsidiaries our core technology platform mainly involves reengineering of different types of t cells which are the workhorses of our immune system who generate chimeric antigen receptor or car t cell therapy we are also establishing a flashcar which is an mrna based technology platform for cell therapy against cancer our technology platforms have potential applications in oncology inflammation as well as in regenerative medicine today i will mainly present to you our cellular immuno oncology program at avalon global care we also leverage and extend our technology platforms through strategic partnering and collaboration opportunities with academia and industry as you can see in the yellow box currently we are actively engaging in r and d projects with mit university of pittsburgh medical center ocwen indiana and hydropeptide to complement and diversify our core part 2 therapy platform through our prolific in house research with our scientists together with an active portfolio of academic industry for development projects we are capable to broaden and enrich our upstream r and d pipeline and intellectual profits our strong proprietary technologies and ips address multibillion dollar and net cell and gene therapy markets worldwide 3 months ago we announced the acquisition of sanlam bio which is currently the largest cell therapy company in northern china this acquisition will add 15 cell therapy products to our portfolio most of them already in clinical stage development this acquisition will also add 16,000 square feet of in house gmp state of the art facility with large scale bioprocessing biomanufacturing and qcqa capacities to avalon we are very proud to assemble a senior management team with very high experience and also a stellar board of directors including permanent regulators wall street serial entrepreneurs and legal experts in the health care and biotech sectors including former congressman billy choo thin and kathy troy who is the former deputy director of the united states cleaning tax services professor dao pei lu our scientific founder who is a legend and pioneer in primary transplant and immune cell therapy in patients the lu dao pei hospital founded by doctor lu which is one of the world's largest primary transplant centers and car t treatment centers it's also one of efelon's major clinical bases at the bottom our scientific and clinical advisory board is headed by robert langer of mit most of our eminent advisers have contractual agreement with us and are actively engaging with aethlon to construct a top rated academia industry alliance to accelerate our growth and develop collectively this unique integration of professional assets provide aplon with excellent resources and inroads for efficient implementation and execution of our scientific and clinical programs over the last 10 years car t cell therapy has taken the biotech industry by storm creating hope that it could usher in a new era of cancer treatment the middle figure here illustrates a conventional treatment protocol about rt therapy the t cells from peripheral blood of a patient are isolated then using a disarmed or harmless viral vector to to deliver the car molecule into the 2 cells this car molecule carries a so called molecular gp asset system recognizing the tumor cells as well as the tumor killing activity once it binds to the specific target on cancer cells once we infused back to the body of the patient these car t cells get multiplied and stay in the body as living drugs these car t cells has memory and stay in the body to suppress the recurrence of cancer it's truly a reference solutionary and very powerful tool over the last 10 years car t therapy has revolutionized the treatment of b cell malignancies including b cell all non hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma since the approval of the first party cell therapeutics in 2017 this field has been experiencing widespread research and exponential increase in r and d as well as proliferative m and a and ipo activities this trend has created a robust multibillion dollar party market which is expected to hit 8,500,000,000 us dollars by 2028 with a whopping growth rate of 46% the middle table at the bottom here shows the 5 us fda approved part 2 products available in the market right now you may notice that these are all the autologous products meaning these car t cells therapies are self derived from patients' own t cells they are very expensive to produce as they are manufactured on a patient to patient basis and mostly they are targeting only one antigen which is cd 19 on tumor cells scientists investors and bio developers invariably agree that car t provides a revolutionary and powerful tool for blood cancer treatment however the current generation of car t have faced limitations and challenges as depicted in this slide these include a high risk of adverse effects and toxicities known as cytokine release syndrome as well as neurotoxicity there's also long biomanufacturing time conventionally it takes at least 14 days we call it from vein to vein time and a very high cost there's also limited tumor antigen target as you see from the last slide which is we call the cd 19 for these first generation of approved prostate products the clinical outcome for solid tumor is pretty poor at this point and and again solid tumor is the lion's share in the oncology field the autologous approach is for high cost and manufacturing time and we need to generate allogeneic universal or off the shelf approach in order to offer a larger market potential so for the rest of my talk i will present the strategies to convince you of how aplon is capable to mitigate these challenges and limitation developing next generation of better and safer r t cell therapy on this slide on the left hand side the 19 04 b is one of our lead party candidate with a special design feature of using an mnd promoter to drive the expression of r we have completed the 1st in human trial in a cohort of 36 patients with relapsed and refractory b cell leukemia and it shows an over 90% of complete remission rate and more importantly it shows greatly reduced adverse effects and toxicities of crs and depressed neurotoxicity as compared to the anecdotal clinical data from currently available products we believe we have a very promising candidate here with respect to its superior safety profile on the right hand side ns 7 car is our another lead car 2 therapy candidate targeting cd 7 instead of cd 19 which is in clinical development stage this is also a breakthrough of first in class part 2 to treat b cell malignancies instead of b cells as all the currently available part t's agonizing in our recent first in human clinical trials 8 out of 8 patients are a 100% achieved complete remission within 1 month after receiving one dose of this part t product at aethlon global care we recently established our proprietary flashpar platform which allow us to overcome a significant drawback of currently available part g with this aba 0 11 it takes only 1 to 2 days of manufacturing time as compared to the conventional 14 days of bioprotection time we also put in a safety switch in the mrna construct such that we can shut off the car t cells if the patients start to show any adverse effect or toxicity for our lead candidate in this category that is the aba011 we have completed all the preclinical research work and currently in ind enabling stage to generate the clinical grade mrna based aba011 for our upcoming clinical trials in 2022 the holy grail in car t cancer therapy is to develop a universal or off the shelf approach for the treatment of solid tumors at avalon we have isolated a superior subset of t cells called the gamma delta t cells this is a much better immune cell type to fight against solid tumors as compared to the conventional t cells which are alpha beta subtype we have overcome a technical barrier in expanding these rare gamma delta t cells and now we can culture and expand them more than 5,000 folks in the laboratory reaching the industrial and therapeutic scale of biomanufacturing currently we have generated 10 car gamma w two candidates some of them already in first in human clinical trials against a variety of solid tumors we believe we have a game changing pipeline here to provide a universal or off the shelf approach for novel therapeutic options for solid tumors using our car temoger with t cell this is a summary slide to show you we have leveraged our next generation of car t strategies to overcome those major limitations and challenges of the current generation of traditional car t cell therapies that's really a major differentiating and competitive advantage of avalon over our competitors another level of differentiating factor of avalon is our demonstrated capability to seamlessly integrate the vertical components of cellular medicine namely the upstream r and d the midstream biomanufacturing and the downstream clinical programs and facilities by achieving these goals we position to become future powerhouse in enhancing immunotherapy and cellular medicine this slide shows the timeline of some of our clinical programs of the lead candidates of aba001 and aba011 which is the mrna part that i just showed you with the acquisition of sanlam bio there are more than 300 patients already received one of our 15 party products in clinical trial settings in 13 prestigious hospital covering 9 unmet oncologic indications i'm not gonna go through the details here in this list and please stay tuned with us for more exciting news during the upcoming american society of hematology or ash meeting in december of this year astct or the american society of transplantation accelerated therapy is the world's largest professional organization for the cell tech community efalon is very proud to be one of the 25 selected members of their corporate council since 2019 so at avalon global care we are dedicated to accelerate global development of cellular medicine therefore creating tremendous values for our shareholders now our cfo luisa ingegiola will present the financial highlights of efron yes thank you"
Speaker 1,Reporter 1,"very much thank you very much doctor jin i have to say that we are very uniquely positioned as a company in terms of our balance sheet and our cap table first of all a little bit of history we uplisted to nasdaq in 2018 we then purchased a beautiful headquarters in freehold new jersey we purchased it for cash for $8,000,000 and we also have jefferies as our banker we have a $50,000,000 shelf filing that has been underwritten by jefferies for an atm and then finally we have a $20,000,000 line of credit from our chairman daniel lu the line of credit is not convertible to stock and it is a 5% simple coupon which is deferred for 3 years so the price of all that basically means that unlike other biotech companies that are consistently out there raising large amounts of capital and diluting investors we have not had to do that from 2020 and 2021 we did not go out and do any any capital raises except for through our atm and through our chairman and we're very excited about that in addition to that our cash burn is around $400,000 a month which is extremely low this is prior to our acquisition the reason it's so low is that doctor jin has brilliantly constructed all of our partnerships so that we share in the cost for example with mit and upenn we're all sharing in the cost of bringing forward our technology which drives down our our berm rate so we're very excited about that once we close the sedline acquisition it will include $30,000,000 from a major health care institutional investor and that will be at invested directly into senlang the private company but not into avalon stock it is convertible into avco at a dollar 20 a share however there's blockers in it that they can only do 10% a month so again we're trying to very carefully protect our cap table and that's all the financial highlights that i have for you doctor jin"
Speaker 0,David_Jin,thank you luisa so that conclude our presentation and we welcome any questions from this stage
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,awesome well thank you very much david and luisa a couple maybe here any plans we had a question here from our chat any plans to expand hospital partnerships into 2022
Speaker 0,David_Jin,definitely in fact we are a us company and our first candidate in clinical trial was a v a zero zero one at the lidao pei hospital in china and starting next year q one when our aba 011 is ready we will start a parallel or multinational clinical trials with his mrna car t being tested clinically in the us as well as in china and so as you may see from one of our slide regarding the 15 car t products already you know over 13 hospitals in asia participating in this so we we we believe
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,did we did we lose yeah i think we lost up to jin oh there he is i heard some that's a bummer right at the end there that was a really good question too
Speaker 1,Reporter 1,yeah that was a great question
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,i think he i think he got most of the answer out cool alright i think we're gonna have to we're gonna have to cut david off there unfortunately but louisa thanks a ton for joining this was avalon global care it's ticker avco on the nasdaq thanks so much for joining you too
Speaker 1,Reporter 1,yeah thank you very much we appreciate it
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,thank you alright have a good day
Speaker 1,Reporter 1,everyone thank you bye
