Speaker 0,Reporter,so amazon that was a surprise that peaked our interest why is amazon getting into self driving cars
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well you have to ask them that but but from our perspective it's amazing to have a great partner right this this is a company that is a technology giant and they're a massive logistics company so we're just excited to have them as a partner and you know we'll see if we make them a customer at some point
Speaker 0,Reporter,so how do the conversations play out then from what you can tell us from your side you know how do you see this being integrated into amazon someday perhaps
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well i i guess i you know how i i can't really speak to amazon but let me think about how we think about it so at aurora we're building a driver and that driver we think can move people and ultimately will move goods as well and we look at amazon and see this incredible logistics company and we look at an opportunity to help them with that over time
Speaker 0,Reporter,so potentially self driving amazon cars bringing packages to our doors
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,i think delivering goods for sure yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,so talk to us about where aurora is now because you make hardware you make software you it's in volkswagen it's in hyundai it's a sort of stack
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,that's right
Speaker 0,Reporter,if you will what does that technology do
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so we're building a driver and the idea is you should be able to get in your car and sit back read a book or have a nap and get from a to b we've been at it for about 2 and a about 2 years now and we've got this great group of people who've joined us so we're about 200 people now and it's it's just exciting to see the progress we're making on the software
Speaker 0,Reporter,so for the technology that exists today or is out on the roads today is that driving these cars for them
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so for we're still developing it so we don't have a product that yet we ship to customers but our test team is out on the roads we've got vehicles on the roads in california and pennsylvania as well
Speaker 0,Reporter,so when you say driver this is a fundamentally different approach than for example google has taken or tesla has taken right
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well i think it's it's probably similar the way that google's approaching it so they're building a driver they're integrating that they're they're buying vehicles from people and then doing what they're gonna do with it our model was do the thing we can be best in world at and we think that is building that that driving capability and then we go and work with companies like volkswagen and hyundai and ultimately with other companies in the transportation sector and what we're really excited about though is that we're actually an independent player and so you know people that are are working with us have confidence that we're gonna be supporting them and and their interests
Speaker 0,Reporter,so what do you make of what's happening in the in the sort of broader industry you know of course what's happening at google tesla and you see all these other auto traditional automakers trying to get into self driving yeah cars in some ways it's moved quickly in other ways it's moved you know way more slowly than some might expect like i went in the google self driving car in 2011 yep haven't had a chance to do that again
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,sure no i i think what's what we're seeing is this technology that has this incredible opportunity to save lives and make the roads more efficient and and make it less expensive and more accessible to get around and like anything that's gonna be transformational it takes a while so it's a it's a new technology and it's bridging between 2 industries between the technology industry and the automotive industry and anytime you have that level of complexity you know it takes a while to figure it out
Speaker 0,Reporter,so who do you think the winners are and who do you think the losers are going to be it's not a zero sum game
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well i i think so i think obviously aurora is gonna be one of the winners but we look at it and we see this incredible greenfield right there's this amazing opportunity to go and and take the next step in democratizing transportation and we're gonna be there with our partners and we think there's lots of room for for others to play too
Speaker 0,Reporter,what are the technical challenges that you continue to work through i mean there's some really deeply moral and ethical issues that you have to work through when you're building a self driving car yeah you know which way does it go if you see if it sees you know a person on the road this way or a person on the road that way
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so i i think the heart of it is really anticipating what others are going to drive on the road so our our vehicles today do a good job of seeing other other people whether it's a pedestrian or cyclist or other car and then it's you know what are they about to do next are they about to step in the road is that that vehicle about to make a lane change in front of us and if you can do that well then you become what we talk about as a human you know a defensive driver and then you avoid these kind of catch 22 situations
Speaker 0,Reporter,how can a car know what another car is gonna do if there aren't necessarily signals like maybe they're they didn't use a blinker yeah they did made a last minute decision
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah i i think that's that's part of the challenge there's there are subtle cues so you know as a car is driving along even if it doesn't turn on the turn signal if it starts to drift in the lane it might be about to make a lane change if it's about if you're approaching an intersection it might be that some car wants to make a move over and that's part of the part of the magic i guess of of this technology is getting to the point where we're picking up those subtle cues in the software and then reacting to them safely
Speaker 0,Reporter,so what are the carmakers saying to you these are your partners and potential partners
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well they're recognizing that this is an important technology right they see this as part of their future that that for many of them they're gonna move from being carmakers to people that or companies that provide mobility and the key ingredient to that is is having a driver in their system and that's what aurora brings to them
Speaker 0,Reporter,"so half a $1,000,000,000 is a lot of money how do you plan to spend that yeah"
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,i know we're really excited right that's an incredible vote of confidence for us as a young company and the the folks we have around the table with sequoia and amazon and and t rowe price is great and we're gonna spend it on building great you know hiring great people and bringing it in right this is a big problem and we need lots of people and and that'll be a big part of it
