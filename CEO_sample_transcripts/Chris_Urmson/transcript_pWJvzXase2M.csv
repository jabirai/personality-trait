Speaker,Detected Speaker,Text
Speaker 0,Reporter,welcome to fort knox i am john fort here this time with chris irmsen ceo of aurora and welcome first of all chris second of all if you don't know aurora it's got to do with autonomous driving and it is public went public via spac and it's still around unlike some competitors have been having a a lot of trouble but you have a history with google and i'm really curious first of all today's toughest problem that you're solving for that's how i always start how i'll start with you given the markets given people suddenly skeptical about about all kinds of things what's the toughest problem you're solving for chris
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah well first thanks for having me on really appreciate the chance to chat with you and the audience today when i look at the year ahead of us it's actually incredibly exciting right there's a lot of doom and gloom out there automated vehicles are you know is this actually gonna happen and you know all of this concern about it and honestly 5 years ago the sentiment was it's here tomorrow everybody should be you know is gonna be driving around their jets and mobile it's gonna be magic and the entertaining thing is neither of those were correct right that 5 years ago there's a lot of work to do and today it's more real than ever before and so for us at aurora actually this next year is gonna be a heck of a lot of fun we're taking we're going we're working to get to feature complete which means like the driver does basically everything it needs to by the end of the year we expect to have the driver be ready so honestly it's gonna be a hell of a year a lot of fun and we're we're really looking forward to it
Speaker 0,Reporter,so your approach you're focused on not consumer vehicles but on like semitrucks you're running some tests some pilots in texas this makes a lot of sense to me because i think about where is driver and the driver fatigue and just kinda getting the basics right important and where is your economic value in that i think of that space but you've got test drivers also in these trucks that are running so tell me what's the benefit during this period or is it more just about proving out the utility
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so right now we're very much in learning right we're building the aurora driver this ability for vehicles to drive themselves on the road and so we have operators in the truck today to help make sure we get the feedback we need from the vehicles they because they can understand what's happening in the world around the truck they understand how it should be driving they get that feedback to our engineers and our algorithms to help make it better what we're doing today though is we are actually hauling goods for people on a daily basis we're out there pulling loads if you had a fedex shipment from houston there's a real real good chance that it was on one of our trucks which is which is really exciting right and so today the value is for us to learn from our partners how does the trucks work with their business how do we make it better how do we fit it in seamlessly for them and for us to make that driver more and more competent and capable
Speaker 0,Reporter,what's what's the kind of best case scenario on what happens with this is there eventually no driver in the vehicle is it in its own dedicated lane i mean i see people when i'm on the road i see people do dumb things in front of semi trucks all the time like cut them off and i'm thinking that that thing's a lot bigger than you are that that would not go well so don't do that i imagine you're seeing these things happen on the road now but it it's one thing if you've got somebody in the vehicle dealing with that it's another thing if you don't even if it's not the software's fault you know there would be headlines what's the ideal case scenario of where this goes and what are the kind of conditions barriers you need to set up to make sure that you mitigate headline risk
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,"right so so the intent here is that we're gonna make all traffic safer right that you'll be able to get a car you you know you you've you're tired at the end of the day and you just wanna have a nap on the way home or you know watch a video you'll be able to do that rather than having to kind of hate life for an hour as you're wrestling through traffic on the freeway you know with our goods we're gonna be able to move them more quickly we're gonna be able to move them more safely it's gonna be good for our customers our partners that that are these carriers because they'll be able to use those trucks that have taken a bunch of energy and effort to make and they'll be able to use them more and that's basically gonna you know has the opportunity to double their top line double their revenue per asset and on the bottom line we're gonna address the fact that there's a shortage of truck drivers today we don't have enough people who want to drive trucks we're short tens of thousands of them and by the end of the decade we expect to be short more than a 100,000 of them and so that is a real need that's how the american economy is gonna keep moving forward is because we'll be able to move the stuff people want and need through the world and then we'll make it more fuel efficient we'll make it safer and and yes our our goal is to build vehicles that drive themselves where you don't have to have a dedicated lane because we're we're really realists about this you know if we need to go to congress and have them spend a whole bunch of money on freeways to make a lane for a thing that doesn't exist yet that's just not gonna happen so we have to meet the world where it is now and have it really really work at a a practical way off the road"
Speaker 0,Reporter,how does technology and ideas like remote driving work into this i mean did do you see the potential for automated driving to work along with remote where maybe there's somebody who can see what's happening in the vehicle and take it over if need be or no
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so we don't think remote driving in the sense that somebody sat at home with a steering wheel and you know hoping that they can kinda keep up with what's happening in the road really solves any problem right for for 1 if you have somebody driving the truck they should be in the truck right like we've got a steering wheel in the truck you don't need all this other technology so i'm not clear exactly what that's solving and then practically there's been a ton of work over over decades looking at simulator sickness and kind of the you know teleoperation sickness where people kind of well vomit right because they get nauseous from driving you have and you have the kinda fundamental problem that while we think of data as ubiquitous right that there's cell phone coverage everywhere we've all you know i know there's a part of my house where i go to my cell phone doesn't work and so you know if your truck's driving down the freeway and you end up in one of those dead zones like that's just not gonna that's just not gonna work and so while we do think there's a role for people to play in supporting these vehicles it doesn't look like driving a vehicle we have a part of our product offering is a is a product called beacon which is this ability for a command center or a dispatch center if you will that's able to kind of look at data coming back from the truck is able to give it guidance much the way that they might be coaching a an operator on the road but they're not ever turning the steering wheel they're saying pull to the side of the road there's something you know broken with road down ahead or you know slow down because you're gonna get into some heavy weather or whatever the thing is but they're not actually driving the vehicle
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah that makes sense got a question here and that it's it's a good question so i'll i'll put it up i happen to know the questioner i used to work with her what are your timeline expectations for broad consumer adoption given that your current focus is with commercial
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so so our focus is on commercial and you know at the end of this year we expect to have the driver ready and then we expect in the next year to launch it with trucks and it'll start small right the we're talking small tens of trucks and then growing over time our technology has been designed to work both for trucks and cars in fact today we work with toyota the world's number one car manufacturer and the same hardware that's driving our peterbilt 5 seven nines and working with our volvo partners is also driving our toyota sienna and so that'll follow behind what we're doing with trucking that'll be a few years what's really exciting to see is that in in certain cities in the us whether it's in phoenix or san francisco or starting to be la you can actually see this on the road today right you can go get into a a vehicle that's driven by by some of our compart competitors or maybe partners in developing this technology out there and we'll we'll get to that in a little while so you're starting to see it more and more but it's gonna be it's gonna be a it's gonna unroll over the next decade plus is my expectation
Speaker 0,Reporter,why be a public company at this stage what are the the benefits and and drawbacks that that's bringing to you as you know you you get that real time every trading day weigh in on what's happening
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah well i think part of it is that we see this technology as transformational right this is the the next generation of technology you know after kind of the internal combustion engine if you look at you know over the the history of the human race we we got we walked at some point we tamed animals and rode them you know we invented the wheel we got to the point where we had the steam engine the combustion engine and basically for the last 100 years we've been riding off of that and what we're going forward is this transformation in mobility where where you won't have to drive where you'll be able to get where you wanna get more seamlessly and easily and we wanted to enable public market investors to come along on that journey with us you know it was a path for us to raise capital to build the business it was a path for us to have the the microphone to be able to communicate and tell that story publicly because we think that transparency is really important when you're bringing a technology like what we're bringing to market so there's a collection of reasons why we did we have employees who've been working on this for a long time we'd like them to have the flexibility we hope many of them most of them will hold the stock and you know grow with us but you know we want them to have that flexibility and freedom
Speaker 0,Reporter,makes sense and finally i wonder if there's a reset that needs to happen in expectations around automated driving we've seen it at things like the consumer electronics show and as you mentioned at the beginning there was this talk about hey it's coming in just a couple years just three to 5 years to to the mainstream and i don't think that there's been follow-up communication about that that says something different that's realistic should that happen
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well i think we've been doing our best to try and educate since we founded the company we've worked with an organization called pave which is out there what is it partnership automotive autonomous vehicle education right and we're trying to help explain the benefits and the challenges of the technology we certainly think that certain parts that the ecosystem have maybe got a little ahead of their skis but we've been trying to be straightforward and honest with with our progress we shared i think we're the only company that shared the road map between where we were about a year ago to what it's gonna take to get trucks on the road without people on board and we're we're working against that milestones and we're as we you know each quarter we give an update and share the progress we're making so yep i think it's valuable it's part of the reason why we've been doing it but obviously we can't we can't speak for the other folks in the industry
Speaker 0,Reporter,you mentioned trucks without people on board so let me put this question up i i think it's interesting what's next trucks designed without human drivers hydrogen fuel cells what
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so initially this is gonna come to market with trucks that look very familiar with to to what you see on the road today and there's good reason for that right it's a significant investment to develop a new vehicle platform so we have to work with our partners to make some modifications to those vehicles so they have the appropriate redundancies and interfaces and we're doing that right we have great partners with paccar with volvo trucks these folks make about half the trucks produced for the us market and so those mark those trucks will come to market they'll have the additions we need over time you'll see there'd be an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact and cost of those vehicles because today if you're building a long haul truck you know you have to you have to design it so that it's comfortable for the person to sleep in and so there's a bunch of features that are gonna come into that truck that add cost add complexity that are related to that that we'll be able to strip out now i expect for a very long time there'll be steering wheels in trucks because you know they're big things and if something breaks you need to move it somewhere so it can get to the maintenance room but eventually you'll see vehicles that that are completely different and and broadly in the personal mobility space right moving people through the world like there gonna there's gonna be a renaissance there that the freedom for designers and for design thinking when you are no longer kind of chained to a steering wheel in the front seat right that's gonna be really cool
Speaker 0,Reporter,alright well it's a great overview to start of aurora and i wanna go back to that but now i wanna learn some more about you and i like to start at the very beginning so tell me where were you born tell me about the household parents any siblings
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so i was born in richmond which is a suburb of vancouver canada moved around a lot as a kid i think the longest we lived anywhere was 3 years my parents had immigrated to canada from the uk i've got 2 brothers that have you know that were a little bit younger than me so i'm the oldest in the family yeah it's it's been an exciting adventure
Speaker 0,Reporter,and why'd you guys move around so much
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,"well so my my parents like i said they moved they immigrated to canada from from england after when i think i was 2 they got home sick so we moved back to the uk for 3 years my parents kinda looked around spent some time there and they're like you know what actually there's a really good reason we moved to canada so we moved back my dad got his ged and then went and got his his college degree and that was in education we took a job up in the yukon in northern canada above you know kinda where next to alaska right and we were there for basically a winter and again my parents was like enough of that and so he got a job with the canadian federal prison system where first he was a shop teacher and then he moves through the prison system you know from shop teacher to running shop he actually got the first prison shop in the u or in in the world iso 9,001 certified which is kind of a big deal ended up being a warden he was kind of mister fix it"
Speaker 0,Reporter,what what does that certification mean
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,"it's a quality process so so if you're in manufacturing iso 9,001 means you know what you're building you know how you're building it you know you have a process to improve that process and so if anyone in the manufacturing community will look at and say that's kind of a big deal right it's an important part of your manufacturing credentials and so they made furniture in the prisons in canada and you know he put the process in place for that so that they could be a better better supplier better workplace"
Speaker 0,Reporter,and so what were your processes like at home
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,i don't know we ever thought of them as processes at home so we you know my my mother was a nurse as well and she ended up actually working for the the the the print system as well you know we i i love school you know i was always pretty nerdy i have a picture i can't find any more of me wearing glasses literally with the tape around the bridge you know but i loved all subjects right i i was particularly interested in science but i really liked history i like i like literature and reading and and writing so did that with a with a a cub scout which is like those little versions of boy scouts yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,and you're moving around a lot at the same time so what did that do for you or to you socially
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well it it create an opportunity to reinvent and rediscover yourself right that you know you'd spend somewhere at a time you kinda try on a little bit of a persona like everyone does growing up but but you know given that we have these kind of moves you're like okay well it didn't that didn't kinda work the way i might have hoped and i don't know this was a very conscious thought right but in looking back at it it was pretty clearly what was happening you know and so there was the the super nerdy phase and then i remember one place you know i was wearing hammer pants or parachute pants and you know you know and i was like that didn't quite work out either and ultimately you know we settled in well at least the last place i lived with my my parents was in winnipeg in in canada in central canada
Speaker 0,Reporter,and how old were you when you settled there
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,that was my senior year of high school and so did my senior year of high school met a girl who's now my wife we we didn't start dating till the 1st year of college but ended up switching from my
Speaker 0,Reporter,that's a long time
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah it is it's yeah yeah no this will be i think this year is our yeah it's 23 so this will be our 24th wedding anniversary come august this year
Speaker 0,Reporter,i i mean would you say oh we didn't start you know dating until the next year i mean it's it's just 1 year
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so well well she had a boyfriend right you know and it turns out that well you know i guess that was better so
Speaker 0,Reporter,well you know you got rid of the hammer pants
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so yeah well yeah i'd i'd upgraded from the you know from the parachute pants by the yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,so tell me what you're you're moving around all that time until senior year were you able to hold on to relationships during that time or or no because it was a lot harder than than it is today
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,not particularly right there i think from you know there's a a friend that i had when we'd moved when we were in victoria after we'd moved back down from from the north that you know i've seen a couple of times in the interview good lord 30 years 40 years somewhere in that range there was another friend that i gotta stay in touch with from when we lived in ontario and then there's folks that i stay in touch with from where we you know where i last lived with my parents in in winnipeg but no i i think tried a little bit but like you said you know it wasn't inter instagram or you know or whatsapp it was the canadian postal system and you had to add put the effort into getting a letter and stamp and all that and so you know like i think of them fondly there's you know people i would consider have been good friends from those times but certainly don't really stay in touch like you know i'd be able to today
Speaker 0,Reporter,so what kinda personal question but what was it about your wife after all that moving around senior year in high school yeah
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,and i
Speaker 0,Reporter,take it you went to the same college right i did and it's like your first real opportunity to commit you really commit i mean
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,we we we yeah definitely she is a lovely kind brilliant person right and when i you know i i started senior year and you can imagine right at that point most of the high school relationships are in place and i don't mean the the dating relationships i just mean the interpersonal ones you know and i showed up and i'm still certainly still today a dirty person was then more so and she invited me to sit with her and her friends right and i was just kind and certainly i wasn't planning to date her at that moment but that was a reflection of the kind of person she she is and and you know we kinda got to know each other over over time and ultimately like i said started dating just i think 1st week of college
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay so tell me about college what was your plan
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so so at high school my plan was i'm gonna go to you know a canadian college and then i'll go to a brand name graduate school and then i'll become a professor and you know originally i was intended to go to toronto and i actually got in i didn't even apply to university of manitoba which is where i did my undergraduate in computer engineering but i was a i was a very good student in fact i think the only well i know that the only student at the high school that was better than me was now my wife so you know married the competition and i got into the university of toronto over the summer i actually got to go to to israel a few weeks as part of i was you'll be surprised to know given what i described i was into science fair projects i went to the canadian national science fair part of that was an award to go to the weitzman institute and spend 5 weeks over there for the summer went to that loved it
Speaker 0,Reporter,how did you how did you win that was your wife not into science
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah if she had been doing science projects i'm sure she would've beaten me no i it was a computer program it was simulating artificial life or it was it was artificial life simulating ecosystems and so went away for this this 5 weeks in israel it was amazing right got to see a part of the world i never would have seen otherwise and met some great people and kind of met a girl there that i kind of liked obviously that wasn't gonna work out because she was from somewhere else in the world and now i came back i was like you know what i really like this girl i should see what we can make happen here so i actually went to the engineering department well after the deadline and said hey i know it's late i'm a really good student i'd like to go here can i and they said yes and so it worked out from there
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah i i can imagine that they were pretty excited to have somebody with your background just sort of
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,does that school kid right like you know i'd done some good stuff but it was it was nice of them to let me in definitely appreciate it
Speaker 0,Reporter,why what what took you off of your path of of wanting to be a professor
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so i i got a chance to go to google ultimately so i i kind of i executed the plan right i i got my undergraduate degree actually thanks to who was then my girlfriend my my wife's suggestion i applied to carnegie mellon which is one of the top schools in the you know the world and at the time was the school for robotics and they made a mistake i got in there went there did my phd and actually got a faculty job and and then i'd been part of these competitions called the darpa grand challenges which were these robot races across the desert and through urban environments we did quite well at those and at the time you know as we just wind this down the sergei and larry were thinking about self driving cars at google and i knew sebastian thron who was one of the prana folks who they they'd hired his company and he was one of the competitors we had in in the grand challenges and they were like hey we'd like you to come out and start this thing at google and this was google 2009 so they just acquired android it was a search company and you know my perspective was like i don't know what they think they're doing but that's crazy but you know we my wife and i had been living in pittsburgh for 11 years we loved it but it was like okay this is the moment in our life we can go try living in california for a couple years you know it's we'll go live with the birkenstocks people see what it's like dip our toes in the ocean come back right and and the the deal when i moved out there was very princess bride treadpier roberts you know it was kind of they were very clear upfront that it was 18 months but we'll probably fire you at the end of it right and and so we went out and did it and you know that was you know i was there to help found what's now waymo which is you know one of the prominent companies in the space other than aurora
Speaker 0,Reporter,so i think of that as being kind of phase 2 google right right around the the android period and when those first what are now called other bets were were starting to get taken i mean i imagine if you're getting equity at that time that allows you to bootstrap some things in the future
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah no google google is an incredible place to work i really have nothing but respect and appreciation and admiration for for larry and sergei and yeah i got a chance to work with incredible people i got a chance to work on amazing technology with an incredible set of infrastructure around us and they certainly compensated as well really really very generous of them to do that
Speaker 0,Reporter,what do you think the history will say about technology transfer and and commercialization of those kinds of efforts versus hp labs xerox parc right which other smaller organizations were able to run ahead with some of those innovations that came out of those places famously xerox parc of course the graphical user interface and apple and steve jobs kinda taking that idea and running with it is that generation the sort of mid 2000 google generation of company gonna be looked on differently you think than that other generation that adobe came out of that the gui came out of
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,"i hope so right so i i was there to help found this program you know i led it for many years and as a leader what you hope happens is the thing that you build lives beyond you right and and the folks that i had a chance to work with you know we poured our heart into building that thing and and really created a whole industry that if i i firmly believe that if we hadn't done the work we had at google there wouldn't be you know 1,000,000,000 of dollars being invested in in developing this amazing technology it's gonna save lives and you know move america into the next wave of transportation so i expect it'll be looked on fondly and i certainly hope you know the good folks that are still there keep executing and and they certainly seem to be"
Speaker 0,Reporter,so why aren't you still there
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,well i i ultimately it was time for me to move on right that you know i looked at the way that as a company we engage with the outside world and and as google you have incredible resources incredible competence and so it can be very alluring to solve the whole problem yourself and my belief was that this was so large so complicated and there are so many amazing companies on the outside that there was an opportunity to really partner deeply with those companies where instead of moving into competition we can cooperate with them and kind of raise all boats and so that was you know i tried to you know imbue that philosophy and there's kind of a a you know as i think about decision disagreements in business you know you can try and fix it you can get in line or you can move on right get out of the way and for me i tried to make it happen and ultimately wasn't able to and as the the you know kind of the senior leader if i'm not bought in it's time to get out of the way and so that led you know it wasn't directly lead to aurora i spent a few months trying to figure out what to do right i had this amazing experience worked with great people what do i do now so i spent time exploring possibilities and it became clear that my work here wasn't done right that that automated vehicles mattered that that i had a unique set of experiences relationships and etcetera and that i could in building a new company with great cofounders like sterling anderson and drew bagnell we could actually move the needle here and we could you know set it up with a clean sheet of paper with the right culture the right philosophy well let me i'm being arrogant with right but the one that i believed was going to be successful in in moving this technology forward i mean
Speaker 0,Reporter,you gotta believe it's right because
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,otherwise why are you doing it
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah yeah yeah i'll take that i mean starting a company is some would argue pretty arrogant or audacious in and of itself it's just table stakes so so what is different about the approach was it looking at commercial first was it you know the timeline the the focus the pace of investment
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so there's a few things and and i think it's the sum of of many right so one is we really deeply believe in this partnership model right that that the bad one of the benefits of being an a smaller company is you have to focus and so for us what's the thing we can be best in world at well that is delivering the driving capability i don't wanna have to build vehicles because it turns out that there's been companies that have been doing it for a 100 years they've evolved they're really good at it right if they've survived a 100 years they're good at what they do so let's go work with them right and let's find a way to help them make the leap as this technology comes to market i don't wanna become fedex turns out fedex has been working at what 50 years it's been a complicated business you know they understand how to make that work let's power them let's look at what their pain points are and help eliminate them and make them be a more successful bigger business and that'll rise and grow our business as well and so so that philosophy we've had from day 1 and we work with you know as i look at and it's paid out right if i look at our oem partners right paccar and volvo trucks amazing companies half the us markets in trucks toyota the number one car manufacturer fedex number one carrier by tractor trailer count in the us uber number one ride hailing platform in the world right these are incredible partnerships so that that was one part of it and then technology wise we were able to take kind of our experience and and kind of broad lessons learned and say okay what's gonna matter well what's gonna matter is we can't do just bulk driving on the road we're gonna have to build simulation capability so we can be more efficient right so that we can iterate more quickly so we can become more confident in the safety of it we're gonna have to build a technology that allows us to see far enough down the road so that we can actually drive safely at freeway speeds with big trucks and so that led to our first light technology which is this amazing lidar capability we have on the vehicle on the vehicle and then we wanna bring the most modern update thinking in machine learning and fuse that with all the good algorithmic stuff we already knew about to make the systems work and so we're able to kinda clean sheet that side of the architecture as well so collection of things and then it's really hard to understate that first point of being an independent company means you are literally the bet right you're not the other bet you're not side bet you're the bet and that's valuable for your team it's clear what matters clear where to focus clear how to charge forward
Speaker 0,Reporter,so what does having mobileye in the space now as a public company mean for you because it's also you know arguably the bet that people can make on aspects of autonomous driving or at least some of the tools necessary in in in the visual space and computer vision to enable that how do you view them and your value proposition versus theirs
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah at first i i think it's that's it's an incredible company right if you look at what they've done with computer vision over the decades over a decade plus it's great you can understand why intel bought them and to kind of think of them as a bridge into automotive and you can see why intel's holding on to a massive part of them right moving forward so ton of respect there their business is not ours right they sell parts into oems for driver systems now they're exploring full driving capabilities or autonomous driving but again that's not the bread and butter of their business we'll see where they go amnon the ceo there brilliant guy ton of respect for him but he's got a business and it's selling parts into oems ours is providing drivers for customers to move their stuff through the world if anything the the you know the the interest that he's shown in the space is an endorsement of how we're thinking about it and the value and importance of it so it's great
Speaker 0,Reporter,the the history of doing autonomous and something else or something else mainly and then autonomous you know we saw intel spin off mobileye and uber of course is no longer doing its thing because you're doing uber's thing which is a big bite for you i i believe getting uber's business kinda what tripled the size of your workforce
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah and and again that's it it was it was one of those really kind of opportunistic moments on both sides so you know we we we were at the time about a 600 person company we were making great progress we had really good partnerships but we knew that this was a big problem right this is not a problem you can solve with 50 people it's a problem you solve with a 100 people right to get to a safe system at scale working with amazing oems takes people and so we were looking at how do we continue to focus on that and get the critical mass of people necessary because i'll take our engineers pound for pound over anyone else's engineers but i might not take them pound to 10 pound right so we've gotta kind of be at scale and so when we when i talked to dara about this you know he was very clear that the value at uber is the network right and their ability to to bring people who need to get around with people who are willing to provide them the ability to get around together and support them in their lives and ours was about the driver and so it became very natural to say you know it didn't make sense for them to continue being developing this and it made a ton of sense for us to take what we saw as an amazing pool of talent great technology and a partnership with uber and ultimately a partnership with tote as well out of that deal
Speaker 0,Reporter,so i i always like to ask about an experience that i i call death valley lowest point because i think there's a lot to learn from how one gets through that so along this journey what has that been for you has there been a time a period where you hit a wall and thought maybe this isn't gonna work
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah there there was well i don't know what didn't work but you know i think part of being an entrepreneur is you see the wall and you're like okay we're gonna figure out how to climb over it but that doesn't mean that when you see the wall it's not daunting and you know a little scary right and so i think for us i think it was 2 you know it's probably 3 or 4 years ago now at the time we had a partnership with volkswagen we had a partnership with hyundai and we had just got an investment from amazon and you know our partnership with both of those with both the oems was going well volkswagen was one of the first partners we had we worked with them the engineering teams really meshed well great progress and we got to a point where they wanted to ultimately own this kind of technology we weren't really for sale and so despite this great alignment they ended up making an investment and taking you know 50% ownership or whatever it was in argo one of our competitors and so that was disappointing and then hyundai made a joint venture again things were going well they wanted more ownership they did this joint venture with motional and then amazon you know one of our other competitors was failing and scooped it up for a discount price that was zoox and so in a matter of 6 months we had this kind of sequence of body blows of hey these were partners we valued things were going really well despite that they go and do something else right and so for us we go kind of crap right okay so what are we gonna do about this well we're gonna keep our heads down and keep working we're going to invest in the core technology we're gonna go back to our core values and you know that that underlying sentiment of folks when we do well pick ourselves up and find the partners that that we need and around that time we had just made an acquisition to bring the lidar technology we needed in house that unlocked trucking for us which had been a long term plan for us but we we didn't see how you could do trucking without a sensor like this and nobody had one so we've been focusing other places with this in hand we're able to say okay trucking the the unit economics are better the market is larger the demand is more clear there's less emotion in the purchasing right it's it's a pure tco kind of business we can scale it more quickly so what felt like this insurmountable wall suddenly became okay we we now have this this you know we got the handholds right let's go find the partners we know who we wanna work with we wanna work with companies that are like minded that have major market share that have kind of morals and ethics that align with ours and so that's what we found with volvo and packard trucks we got the technology we're spinning up the lidar stuff it's working and we're off to the races and so it's been and then the uber deal on top of that so it it it was it was very exciting
Speaker 0,Reporter,so were the wandering eye of the partners and the opportunity to do this acquisition and focus in on commercial and trucking were they completely independent of each other or yeah did one lead to the other in any way
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,no they they were independent but as you know so we we were doing the act i think we'd already done the acquisition of the the lidar company and we were kind of integrating that and building the road map for them internally as as some of this went down but it it was kind of like okay well we wanna do peep people moving we wanna work with light vehicles we're you know that's kind of to me that's that's one of the the long term really valuable opportunities but there's as much clearer immediate opportunity to go get get and where we can build the business right one of the knocks on the self driving space is like the unit economics actually work and in trucking the unit economics are 3 times better than they are in ride hailing and so that's a way to get your foot in the door build the business generate margin and revenue profit and then we can take the scaled up technology where you know our our system isn't just software there's really important hardware that's in it well as scale goes up hardware costs come down suddenly you now have the scaled product that allows you to attack a a market go after a market where the unit economics are tighter
Speaker 0,Reporter,but i wonder was this a was this a forced focus moment in a way if if those partners hadn't wandered would you have felt or or have the responsibility to continue serving them in that market with worse unit economics even if you were also now having the opportunity to move into trucking
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,i i think that's right right i i think that it did give us a moment to step back it did kinda clear the playing field a little bit for us to to create space to go okay you know and and that's why you know what it was a dark moment turned into real clarity and and opportunity for us
Speaker 0,Reporter,so in in the worst part of the dark moment what did you think might happen
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,oh we we were of course worried like are we gonna be able to get another partner right that that the news around this becomes the reality right that oh jeez these folks went away and the the company must be broken in some way and and in practice that wasn't the case right you know but unfortunately you have 3 dots it looks like a pattern but we looked at it and said like look these folks wanted to own the technology we didn't wanna be owned like they have to go to the next best alternative you know if you're if you're amazon logistics is such a huge part of your business that it would almost be negligent not to have a play and understand or even even if you're not going in the long term you know actually deploy it being an educated smart customer seems like an a critical thing to do and when you can buy an asset like that for you know for a fraction of what the last funding round was like of course you wanna do that and so you know i i don't begrudge our partners doing what they wanna do what they did but you know we're here we're trucking along and you know excited about like it's just the i i've never been more excited opt optimistic or convinced about the the path we're on
Speaker 0,Reporter,so i i find that often whatever it is that gets you through that death valley experience becomes sort of a a core belief that you can continue to use in your leadership and your management going forward so was there something like that for you a a either leadership practice focus what you said to the team what you got from that experience that continues to be useful for you
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,"yeah i don't know if if something necessarily came out of that but i think the way we handled it was emblematic of a lot of the way you know i like to lead and that that we lead as a company and it's really around kind of transparency and empathy right that you know we have employees and they're gonna read the news too and jeez what does this mean right i joined this little startup and it was kind of risky and boy these partners are moving away and it's like acknowledging that to the team like hey it it kinda sucks in this moment but you should understand this this and this right and this is the plan forward and it doesn't change the value proposition it doesn't change the impact we can have in the world it's just a pump right and and having that and you know as we look at what's happened with the macroeconomic situation today right we're a public company stock price is doing what the stock price is doing but it's not about what we're doing internally right if we keep executing the need for our technology has not decreased the you know the market demand is still clearly there and the opportunity when you think about a in the us transportation is a 2 to $3,000,000,000,000 market trucking in the us is something like an $800,000,000,000 market and when we look at the playing field we're incredibly well positioned we've got amazing people technology partners and so it's like let's keep charging yank and the market will figure it out as we execute"
Speaker 0,Reporter,did you change the way you communicated during that period or did you already have a cadence and and forum for communication with employees that you just used to to talk about what was going on internally and what the strategy was
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,no we we just use the cadence we already have we have regular all hands meetings every couple of weeks you know i'll communicate with company ad hoc when we did change our cadence was during covid right and and that of a you know abrupt transition from in office to work from home there we we recognized that there was a need that people are gonna be dealing with a lot of emotions and fear and you know questions about everything right so we we kind of for a period of time ramped up the touch points and the connectivity between leadership and at our employees to help them you know help them have a touch point right you know i think people underestimate the touch point that there is it's just the ritual of showing up at the office every morning and that how it kind of regularizes regularizes life that you you we suddenly took away from people right because of because again extrinsic conditions and so you know creating some other touch points some other rituals was our tool for helping manage that
Speaker 0,Reporter,you're talking about that in the past tense what's happened now is this kind of post covid semi post covid how how normal is what's happening now
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah well well i i i talk about it as a then because i feel like people are incredibly adaptable and they can deal with almost anything but the transitions are hard right and so that transition to work from home was something we had to manage you know over the the last couple of years we've we've kind of understand more about covid we've understand more about how to operate for us we're bringing people more back to the office we have a policy we call mission first which really means be where you need to be so that your team is most effective right and so for many functions spending time in person is the most effective way for your team to be able to operate right it allows you to learn from peers it allows you to quickly move through ideas in a way that you couldn't you know ad hoc schedule over zoom or google meet or whatever but at the same time there's value to people being able to work from home right that that if they really can be heads down for a day they've got their marching orders go go march maybe they can do that at home effectively you know if they're you know maybe for them shifting their work schedule through the day allows them to better accommodate other constraints in their life so we've tried to be we're certainly more flexible about it today but i i believe that there's an immense amount of value of keeping people together and and and the collaboration and energy that comes from that is high
Speaker 0,Reporter,wanna get to a question as as we transition to talking about the future we got earlier about government's role in all of this what's the progress in communicating with the government the regulations being in place that are gonna be necessary for you to scale beyond a state to state basis
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,yeah so i i think that's a great question so first it's important to understand how the regulatory regime in the us works for automotive so at a kind of course level the federal government regulates the safety of the vehicle the state regulates the safe operation of the vehicle that's why you get a state driver's license on a federal one and then the cities effects effectively acts you know limit access to the roads or curbs or what have you and so in the us to put a vehicle on the road you have to meet the federal motor vehicle safety standard which is this big thick book with a bunch of tests and stuff that you have to pass so turns out that all our vehicles on the road today meet fmvss it's my belief right and so there's nothing in there that says it can't drive itself right the the laws in the us are permissive and so for us we have we we see the regulatory space to operate in the vast majority of states today 40 some of them if we had a vehicle we were confident in the safety of that met fmvss appropriately then we could be on the road operating without a person in the vehicle today now there is variation from state to state because their role in the regulatory regime and we would of course prefer harmonized regulation but this doesn't really prevent us from from operating or deploying over time i expect that there will be more regulation comes into place but i think the federal government has taken a very thoughtful approach here of providing guidelines and guidance but not regulation at a time where the technology is very nascent right if you think about regulations that have come in for seat belts or airbags or any abs right those have all come in after the technology has been understood deployed and they're like okay these are the constraints we now need to put on it and if we put those constraints in earlier we may have prevented the technology from coming to market
Speaker 0,Reporter,so a complicating factor it seems to me is you sort of need a pathway literally of states yeah if you're going to do long haul trucking you can't have one state where you can do without a driver and then another state where you need 1 and then another state where you don't have 1 get people like jumping in and out of the vehicle that doesn't really work so if it's state by state now does it need to be federal at some point
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,again i i so that's above my pay grade but you know the to from our perspective having harmonized regulations having the federal government help provide guidelines much in the same way they do through things like the the federal highway safety administration through dhtsa right these are guidelines that the states then then follow and i should point out since day 1 we have been engaging with both the federal and state and local officials in these regions because again in the spirit of partnership that i talked about earlier around the commercial aspects of our business we look at these these regulatory bodies we look at the the the elected officials as partners right their job is to kind of promote what's best for america to do that safely so let's work with them let's give them the insight and understanding so they can be thoughtful in their in their in their jobs and to to your point around having to have a pathway a literal you know the road that you can travel along we today generally don't see that so as we look across the southern united states the southern freight corridor those states and i think i'm gonna let me say in general but my belief is all of them we could effectively operate on and there's some variation in regulation but not enough that it would prevent our deployment the one challenge is california california was one of the first states to have a rule pass a law around self driving and at the time the legislature made it clear that this was for light vehicles and heavy vehicles the department of motor vehicles decided to bifurcate that between light vehicles and heavy vehicles and created rules and regulations for light vehicles and effectively banned heavy vehicles and so we're working today with government officials to to address that because it's clear the law was clear that they should the dmv was clear that they were going to and and they haven't yet done so so but we know the good folks there are working on that and and we're trying to help them with it as well
Speaker 0,Reporter,finally what's the strategic priority for aurora in 2023 given what the economy is doing but also where we've been in understanding the labor shortages and how those have affected supply chains affected the availability of goods what what does the demand picture look like i i know you're excited but where do you focus in the strategy on making progress this year
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,so it it's execute the road map that when i think when as i talk to investors when i look at our company right the we have these 2 major milestones this year that we're working towards 1st is feature complete and then driver ready a feature complete is a major derisking that if i if i'm an investor looking at this and i say okay your aurora driver can do all the things it needs to to to to deliver our first product then you know it doesn't do them well enough yet but it does them that's a point of derisking and then when i think about aurora driver ready that means we're ready short of having the truck integrated right the ultimate scalable truck platform and so that means from our perspective and i think from an objective perspective the hard the first big hard part is solved right and then the business is then going to go and of course then we're gonna have to deal with scaling and you know you know bringing the cost down and all of that but that fundamental technological barrier is going to be crossed and so for us it's keep your heads down execute get that done right and and at that point you know we'll be off to the races so really excited about the year and and that's the focus
Speaker 0,Reporter,alright well it's it's certainly a technology that done right could lead to all kinds of efficiency hopefully even save some lives look forward to continuing to follow your journey so thank you chris for sharing the aurora story and your own story with me at fort knox
Speaker 1,Chris Urmson,oh really appreciate the chance thank you
