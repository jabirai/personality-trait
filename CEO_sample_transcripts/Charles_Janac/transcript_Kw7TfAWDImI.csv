Speaker 0,Reporter,hi this is luke covey editorial director of new tech press and i'm here with the redoubtable charles janek of arteris and we've just been talking about the fpga world and you have some interesting things to say what's going on with fpgas
Speaker 1,Charles Janac,so first of all arteris makes network on chip type interconnect and inner chip links that communicate between dies and this is a more efficient way of allowing on chip communication so in the fpga world our thesis is that there is a big opportunity for the fpga soc which is a combination of processors other types of ioip serdes programmable logic and also 3 d memories and this places much more pressure on efficient interconnect so that you can actually have one type of interconnect for all three parts so we think that the fpga soc is going to have a good shot at taking out the low end of the asic market as things progress down the deep submicron curve so that you can basically those kinds of structures will be competitive with with asics for some applications okay
Speaker 0,Reporter,what kind of products are we looking at the are these going into
Speaker 1,Charles Janac,"i think these are probably volumes less than 3,000,000 things that don't require low power so things such as base stations potentially even some types of digital televisions some types of set top boxes where system houses that are delivering their value through software will just wanna get very quickly to market and will take it off the shelf part and use use an fpga soc soc where previously they may have used an acp"
Speaker 0,Reporter,excellent well that's gonna be we're gonna be looking forward to seeing that happen
Speaker 1,Charles Janac,okay alright thank thank you
