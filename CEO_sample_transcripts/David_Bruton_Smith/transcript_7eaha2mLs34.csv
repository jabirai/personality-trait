Speaker 0,David Bruton Smith,"well actually we we've recovered amazingly well since the our our low in april and really the biggest story is our echopark stores which we have 10 locations across the country and we have recovered now above our pre covid levels we're actually tracking for an all time record june in those stores both in volume and profit you know we did about a 1,000,000,002 at our echopark stores in 2019 and we have a a plan actually we're gonna be rolling out here pretty soon to talk about increasing that in short order to about 10,000,000,000 in revenue just with our echopark stores and and rolling those out into additional locations across the country"
Speaker 1,Speaker 1,and echopark is an interesting concept as i understand it it's used cars but it is low mileage 4 years or younger never been in an accident and do you use a a fixed price approach there or is it the typical sort of negotiate your best deal
Speaker 0,David Bruton Smith,no we do it's what we call it nearly new and they're all fixed pricing and we are actually our prices are very aggressive and our our customers that's one of the reasons why our customers drive in from all over as much as you know from we've had people come in from alaska actually to buy cars from echopark but that's why our our echopark store on average their the 10 stores do about 10 times the volume of a of a traditional pre owned or franchise dealer store as far as our number of units per store
Speaker 1,Speaker 1,when you say franchise dealers how does that work i'm just curious and don't we don't need to linger on it do those franchises carry either the echopark or the or the sonic name or is it joe williams ford but you are the the the owner of that franchise from the from the ford company what how does it work
Speaker 0,David Bruton Smith,"yeah our our franchise stores have different names all over the country from again from california to florida while our echopark stores are stand alone pre owned stores with the echopark name only and and so really a phenomenon to see whereas you know a traditional franchise dealer might sell 50 or 60 pre owned cars a month in a in a regular franchise store whereas in echopark store we sell on average 600 we have one of our stores sells about 1300 per month and during covid during the pandemic those are the echopark stores were the stores that were the most resilient during the during the whole pandemic so that's really from an investor standpoint that's really what i think is most interesting is to see that growth and taking what now is a combined $20,000,000,000 or i'm sorry $10,010,000,000,000 company to now we're gonna show a path to getting to to 20,000,000,000 in total revenue which again from investor standpoint we think that's what is most important"
Speaker 2,Reporter 2,david let's talk about again some of the near term trends our philip o this morning was tweeting about a dealer who was contemplating shutting down over july 4th this is a new car dealer because demand was so strong and inventory was so light does that resonate or is that you think unique to a few markets this is a ford dealer in the north we northeast and a few types of cars
Speaker 0,David Bruton Smith,well no we've in our in our new vehicle franchise stores we've you know some of the most popular models you know we have a a lighter day supply of those but you know the the shopper out there they know because they can look you know online to see what is out there and they so they can see that there's not a a big day supply so then our gross is our gross profit you know for those new vehicles is higher than it it usually would be but you know they as the manufacturers ramp back up we think it's only a 2 or 3 month delay from getting back to our you know pre covid day supply levels but as far as echopark goes we've been ramping back up and buying inventory you know pre owned inventory through this whole thing and and so that's why we're back up you know far above our pre covid levels so so we had a a all time record 2019 and january to february were tracking to be all time records and then we hit this covid so we've been very excited about how quickly it's bounced back
