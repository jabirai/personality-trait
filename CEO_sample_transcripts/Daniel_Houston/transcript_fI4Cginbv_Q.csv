Speaker 0,Reporter,dan you know these days when people talk about leadership and in particular business leadership their expectations have changed a lot in recent years and dramatically whether it's employees or customers or even the public they they want ceos to do more than just make money for their companies
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,for sure
Speaker 0,Reporter,they want them to do good mhmm what does that mean to you
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,well i think it starts with legacy and we're fortunate we're a nearly a 140 years old and 2019 we will be and we've have a long standing history of giving back to the communities in which we do business we have a global platform we do business in 80 countries and so what we do here in the united states back into the community are those same things we're doing in india we're doing it in chile we're doing it in mexico so that history that heritage of giving back to the community is part of the dna of the organization it's the basic ethos of the company
Speaker 0,Reporter,you mentioned that principal financial is coming up on a 140 years and going back over all those years the company was always focused on helping people with their financial issues but i'm wondering for you as the ceo how are things different today than it was for your predecessors
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,you no longer again have the luxury of having the head of hr send out the memo talking about the good works i have to live it you know you're involved in the habitat for humanity and you're helping build you're helping in the in the poverty stricken areas of cities in which we do business where you're volunteering your time we provide to our employees 8 hours every year of voluntary time off whatever they find it's interesting to them and the tens and nearly 100 of 1000 of hours now that are giving back to the community before you did it through payroll deduction today payroll deduction and through your hands and making sure that the community is benefiting from our involvement in that community
Speaker 0,Reporter,you know we see a lot of ceos or at least many ceos who speak up very vocally on a lot of social problems how much pressure do you feel to address social issues
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,i think it has to be taken seriously because there's some really serious issues and we talk about it in the boardroom that these are matters that principal needs to engage we have committed ourselves to diversity and inclusion not because it became popular in the last 10 years but because it's been part of the organization for the last 50 plus years including people to be part of diversity is just a standard practice we have great diversity among our board members great diversity among our senior management and we also enjoy that same diversity among our employees why because that's what our customers look like they our board our senior management should look like our customer base
Speaker 0,Reporter,do you feel a lot of pressure that principal's success and its ability to hire talented people depends a lot on how the company addresses social problems
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,millennials increasingly higher percentage of sort of job satisfaction from the environmental issues what are our corporate governances how do we treat our employees are we doing good for the communities in what we're doing increasingly they're gonna be the largest percentage of our workforce and so if we're not conscious of that mhmm paying attention and taking concrete steps to embrace that then we'll find ourselves in a very hard a very difficult position to recruit the right talent for the organization
Speaker 0,Reporter,so i wanna ask you a question and you fill in the blank i am making the world better because
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,i'm having a profound impact on the number of people that have retirement savings when they most need it in their old age
