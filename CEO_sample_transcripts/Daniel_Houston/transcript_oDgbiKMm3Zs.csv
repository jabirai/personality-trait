Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,it's a privilege to be here thank you
Speaker 0,Reporter,thank you so this is a health audience so let's just start with some basics tell us what a financial services company does and tell us what you do day to day as ceo president and chief
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"boy the second question could get me in trouble i suppose but you know we're here to serve the needs of all all workers all individuals to help them reach financial success and frankly financial success is really hard and difficult to reach if you don't have a physical health and well-being so we've tried to work very hard in order to strike the appropriate balance through education through advice through guidance to help people understand that the more healthy lifestyle they live today the more they focus on their financial well-being the higher probability they'll enjoy a higher quality life later in life so that's a large part of what we do as you mentioned we manage well in excess of $600,000,000,000 in 90 different countries around the world big operations in both latin america asia and the united states and those 22,000,000 customers are really as diverse as you might expect not only geographically but they're diverse in terms of their ages and their wealth and their income and what i would tell you from the lowest wage earner to the very highest wage earner that is effectively the cohort that's the group of individuals that we serve worldwide"
Speaker 0,Reporter,so it's interesting to hear hear about your clientele because some people would assume that a financial services company is simply serving the well off so tell us more about how you're serving people of all income backgrounds and and more
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"so if i could i'd give you a sort of a typical client if i were just to take a average client of the principal financial group if they're a retirement plan customer or 401 k plan customer in your nomenclature on the university campus it would be 403 b's they would have a 125 employees they would generally have a very broad cross section of industries all the way from janitorial services to investment banking they in large part don't have a personal adviser at all maybe the top 10% out of that 125 might so 10 to 12 people might have an adviser those other 100 employees oftentimes are looking to us for guidance advice and education we do that at the worksite we do that in person at small meetings at the worksite we do it in 1 on 1 meetings at the worksite and some of it's done telephonically through our call centers i i take the and i view it as an honor i do go down to our call center and i'll take a headphone jack and and go into the console because i wanna hear firsthand what people are up against and i have yet to ever do that on a random basis and had a phone call that was was taking place on anybody that was making more than about $50,000 a year so it gives you the sense of the sort of employee who's calling in what are their questions oftentimes the question is am i saving enough am i putting it in a diverse enough portfolio this is sort of my language they may not use that exact nomenclature they're going through a divorce someone's lost a job should i take a loan should i not take a loan should it be a hardship withdrawal those are all the questions that the average american worker needs answers to and we provide those answers"
Speaker 0,Reporter,everyone can relate to those questions
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,they really can yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so tell us more about how you have advanced a culture that helps the health of employees consumers community and or the environment
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,doctor coe one of the things that there's an enormous burden on a ceo we're a 140 year old company and as a 140 years i'm the only 15th person to tell this particular job as the ceo and our commitment to middle america our commitment to middle income wage earners didn't start with me it's been part of our ethos for the last 140 years and so what typically is going to take place as we sort of prioritize our resources is to make sure that we are serving everyone equally that's a that is as you might expect a a big priority but it's in all facets of what we do because we need to make sure that we have a a good health and wealth balance for our employees we have it for our customers and we try to make sure that we strike the right sort of balance for our investors as well
Speaker 0,Reporter,so tell us more about how you came upon this philosophy how how you embrace it it sounds like it's part of your history the history history of the company right
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"so if you went back you know in in in number of books have been written about the company in this regard and i'll give you just maybe a couple of points of of interest and this is one i found fascinating because we just remodeled a building that was built started in 1938 and finished in 1940 and one of the funny stories that came out of it because the superintendent today we'd call that a vice president but that was a construction superintendent at the time they were building the building and they had made their decision on that we were going to use clean fuel to fire the building and it was gonna be oil the alternative to that was coal but there were 2 things we were doing with this building we are putting in larger windows and the windows would be allowed to be open for fresh air it was gonna be the 1st building west of the mississippi that had air conditioning and it would be the 1st building of commercial size that would burn fuel oil well iowa at the time if you go back into the 19 thirties was a net exporter of coal and so it was the coal miners that were picketing across our front door we have pictures of the coal miners picketing because we had the audacity to burn oil and fast forward 75 years and as we modernized the building as you might expect there were major changes made led lighting there were steps that were taken we recycled 95% of the materials that came out of the building every carpet square every ceiling tile every piece of copper every metal and so the company has a long standing history the tie if you will back to the sensitivity around building materials we have a commercial real estate port portfolio greater than $26,000,000,000 a large portion of that is green building and we found out long time ago well in excess of a decade ago that we could build a green building better environmentally for for individuals whether it was all the the toxins that can exist in carpets and ceiling tiles led lighting moving the air through the building more quickly etcetera maybe it adds 10% of the cost of the building their recoup on that is measured in months and and not decades for certain so that sort of gives you a mindset that we've used not only in in our business but then the value that that creates for our customers through enhanced returns and better returns ultimately for shareholders"
Speaker 0,Reporter,so that's a fascinating example because it's on one hand a environmental example but it's also an example that impacts customer customers as you said but also employees right very much do you wanna say how how do the employees react to that sort of investment
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,i i know this i've been with the company now for over 35 years i don't think anybody was as concerned 35 years ago let me restate that no one was concerned about that 35 years ago today if you look at the statistics among millennials it's about 75 percent non millennials all it's about 66% care about the company culture care about your environmental positions care about your carbon footprint care about what you're doing back to your respective communities i was reading an article coming out this morning that my father had sent to me and it was about women in the workforce and boards of directors he was talking about women in middle management but it was also talking about the importance that millennials are pay placing on esg related issues environmental social governance related issues now what i thought most interesting about that is my father's 85 years old and the handwritten note that he put on there dan dan i i i was so proud to see this article it it's in large part what you guys already do keep up the good work mhmm 85 year olds usually don't wanna send their sons you know that sort but that was he even connected all of those dots uh-huh that that was important if you're gonna be a successful business and he gets that
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so there's a theme we're hearing more about that this is of concern for all of us in the present but for future generations with millennials leading the way it's gonna be even more important you feel
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,a third of our workers are millennials and if there's any one thing i i have been overly impressed with regards to the millennials other than the high degree of sensitivity around esg related issues how many baby boomers in the room right how many raised a millennial guess what they're better savers than us they are they save more than the baby boomers and that's really refreshing and they're doing it for the right reasons their footprint is just flat out smaller in term you know in terms of housing in terms of many aspects of their life they put a higher degree of weighting on social issues they put a higher degree of weighting on environmental issues when they look to go to work for an employer there is a bit of an underwriting and if you think about unemployment in this country 3a half 4% maybe a little bit less of that less than that if all of a sudden you're competing and you're there on wage and you're there on opportunity and you're there in terms of the right industry and you start looking at what are the differences i think it's gonna get down to issues like this interesting
Speaker 0,Reporter,so someone with your philosophy has gotta adopt a long term view but you you have a lot of short term pressures to earn profits and keep all your shareholders and stockholders happy so how do you balance all that in your daily work
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,so it it starts with setting the expectation with investors in the very beginning and we have always tried to strike the appropriate balance between great giving great value to the customer giving a employee the right sort of set of benefits whether it's time off to volunteer it's a it's a competitive wage it's a it's a it's an environment that isn't inviting that has if you saw our facilities you'd be i'm certain quite impressed with the the nature in which we've we've reorganized our work to create more collaboration and create more of a sense of community but ultimately if you've informed your investors on what we think our returns are going to be and what our financial performance is going to look like frankly it takes a lot of the pressure off because we're already on the record with what it is we're trying to accomplish there are other firms that might be in our industry that might have some of those metrics that might be more appealing to some investors but that's those are the choices those are the trade offs we make every single day
Speaker 0,Reporter,okay this this is fascinating so you put it all together do you think this gives you a competitive advantage as a business compared to others and do people see it or
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"or not well you made me blush when you made the introduction of the company because that track record of recognition from companies like fortune and forbes and ethisphere we're proud to have earned those and we also know that they could be taken away like that it requires us to constantly nurture it to ensure that a lot of the groundwork that was laid the old proverb chinese proverb when you drink from the well remember the men and women who dug the well right here on this campus a lot of the practices and a lot of the cultures that you have here what makes harvard harvard is because the forefathers had done a good job getting you to this point i have that same pressure my management team has that same pressure so we're always trying to strike that right balance and i'll give you a couple of examples the company has forever back in 1938 again that superintendent had written the message to the board of directors it would be appropriate to have a gymnasium so employees would have the opportunity to have physical fitness throughout the day wow there could be intramural sports i mean it's just when you read it you just think wow that's how they spoke back then mhmm but even our leaders at the time knew that physically fit employees running more oxygen through the brain having more sort of physical activity creating more energy sense of creativity they even knew that then voluntarism has been part of our culture forever we host a seniors golf event the champions principal charity classic champions event last year we raised $3,600,000 just for children's charities just in des moines iowa central iowa to try to make a difference among those 5 children's charities giving back to the community fitness and well-being all of those things that go into the value proposition of working for the working for the principal"
Speaker 0,Reporter,that's very striking these themes run through the history of your company
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,forever yeah yeah
Speaker 0,Reporter,so it's so it's very personal for you but it's part of the culture of your company
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,and the sustainability of that and so again where we started this was the 3rd party validation
Speaker 0,Reporter,right
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,you know at any given time i you know i worry it is culture advances that you tear away at the very fabric and at some point you find you know what you've ripped it now it's no longer something you can put back together so when we look for acquisitions we underwrite in 3 areas we underwrite for strategic fit we underwrite for strategic financial and cultural and most people wanna always jump on the bandwagon bandwagon saying well you pay too much or you you pay too little never heard that one before but my view is this you can get the price wrong you might get the strategy you know slightly wrong maybe it maybe it was just slightly turned off 90 degrees but if you get that cultural piece wrong it's game over you can't make those up in time financial you'll get their strategy you'll kinda get the you know the boat turn right in the right direction but culture matters and we've made 14 acquisitions since the great recession and that's not insignificant and there's a very stringent sort of onboarding but the due diligence process where most companies i think are to some degree interrogating the acquired company for everything about their company i would say that probably 15 to 20% of the sales process is my having a conversation with you to tell you this is what we look like this is our culture it's our dna it's our ethos it's how we think it's how we make decisions it's collaborative it's global and if if that doesn't work for you not gonna be a good fit
Speaker 0,Reporter,so trying to join what we're trying to do here the worlds of the private sector and public health is is not easy in fact no one's quite tried to do this before right
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,and there
Speaker 0,Reporter,are a lot of skeptics out there saying oh the the business ceos aren't really bought into all this so that sort of public perception is one example of a lot of the challenges out there can you just tell us about some of the challenges you faced in in trying to adopt this philosophy and what's helped you address them and even overcome them
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,you can just start with the magnitude of of health care in this country it's about 20% of gdp you could end this conversation right there and say if $1 out of every 5 is around health care then it it matters to all of us for every dollar you spend in retirement that goes to health care is a dollar that doesn't go to other retirement related activities think about that that's a really really big number so if my job is to make sure that americans and people in latin america and people in asia they get decided to retire when they choose 62 63 65 60 7 and the way that i help them the way principal helps them is to put them in a position of having optionality or choices and i can assure you not only will health care have been a big part of their accumulation phase it will be equally and more important as they draw down on their nest egg to offset their living expenses and health care is gonna be single for everyone in this room single largest expenditure going into retirement in our business of financial services we have no choice but to respect and help educate and inform on matters related to health insurance health related expenditures so that's why it's so close to close to us and and it has been it's been part of the company for a very very long time
Speaker 0,Reporter,and you have this fascinating approach where you're based in the us but you have this global reach and i know you travel a lot as as ceo as you as you do this work around the around the world what what are some of the challenges you face in in various countries or various parts of the world
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"it's replicated over and over and over and over just to put it in perspective though because oftentimes we can look at our sort of long term retirement financial affairs in this country on money set aside for retirement this country through the last 50 plus years has amassed roughly $22,000,000,000,000 not an insignificant amount of money of that $22,000,000,000,000 about 15,000,000,000,000 is iras rollover iras 401k 457 403 403b k voluntary contributions in this country $15,000,000,000,000 that other set of that other 7,000,000,000,000 is really defined benefit it's what the employer had accumulated take the defined benefit plan set it aside because most people in this room may not have one or listening the remaining $15,000,000,000,000 is a bigger pile of money than the next 19 developed countries combined so we haven't done it perfect but we've done it pretty well our job is to make sure that around the world we take our technology our digital assets our asset management capabilities our our knowledge and export that to china to india to malaysia to thailand to chile to mexico etcetera and we've done that with a fair amount of success but the issues around health care expenditures are real the generation of of students going through harvard today with their dna and their their lifestyles today they will end up living more years in retirement than the actual number of years that they work they'll have more breaks of service all of those averages they'll live more years in retirement than they will more years in retirement than they will actually work and if you went back to fdr in the you know the onset of social security what was the probability you would you would cash a social security check at age 65 real low less than 10% today pretty high probability you're gonna get there so so the economics are off and so if the private sector doesn't do it it's a problem governments aren't in a position to do it employers really aren't in a position to do it this is really a burden that falls on our on our shoulders so this health care we we want good health and fitness that's why we have you know we reimburse for you know whether it's smoking cessation we reimburse for weight loss we reimburse for gym memberships we have gym facilities in all of our operations we promote taking time off during the day to to get physical fitness and all those different things because as a company we spend about a $160,000,000 a year on health related expenditures that's a lot of coin and so to the degree we can have a healthier population of workers that puts us in a more favorable position to create more value for our employees in other ways okay"
Speaker 0,Reporter,so i'll send comments and discussions about what is health in this day and age have now expanded to really involve mental health and emotional well-being and stress at the workplace actually professor blendon who runs the studio has done some polling work showing that those are critical issues for employees around the country around the world you wanna just talk about stress at the workplace and and well-being emotional well-being at the workplace and how that relates
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,to to your work it's real it's out there you know there's a there's a few issues out there that come to mind and the first one of which is the overreliance on opiates and the impact that's having it it is real if you haven't read the the book dopesick read it it gives you some really sort of inside perspectives on the overprescribing of of of drugs and what that what that means i think there's also an element around mental and nervous and i think all of us have known people who are directly impacted by this someone's gonna have back surgery breaks a leg breaks an arm we put arms around them how can we help you out can we bring some food over take all the time you need all those issues and unfortunately mental and nervous issues are not resolved as issue mental health is increasingly a challenge on a lot of different levels it is one of those industries that continues to grow and i think it continues to evolve and i think you know we're sort of at the beginning stages of that but all of those issues are things that we have to be conscious about as an employer so again how do you create a work environment that doesn't contribute to stress giving people flexible time off you know at the end of the day i'm not keeping track of your hours i'm only interested in one thing the output what's your contribution what did you do to advance the company's mission you had a certain set of tasks to accomplish did you do that how do we create an environment which doesn't create stress that comes into hiring and firing make sure that we have a diverse group of senior leaders make sure that they're inclusive making sure that people don't come to work with with anxiety about just the people they're working with let alone the work that they're doing how do you create an environment where at the end of the day we're doing a social good we're in the insurance business the disability insurance the retirement business the asset management business i'd be hard pressed to say that we have any product that doesn't really do an enormous job of providing great social good around financial well-being and if you have good financial well-being many times you'll that leads to strong physical and health well-being so that's that's sort of easy for me to get my head around it and rob matter of fact i'd i'd tell you a quick story doctor coe that i was reflecting on this only because it was the 1 year anniversary of the gentleman who had hired me his name was chad sims in dallas texas and i had 2 other job offers and you should know that the principal financial group before 1985 its name was the bankers life insurance company so i was interviewing for the job and he'd asked me about these other employers and i'll i'll go ahead and use those names it's it's been over 35 years and i said matter of fact remember kathy johnson was the recruiter from georgia pacific and chad always had a way of sort of getting what he wanted to get done and he said so dan i gotta ask you a question georgia pacific do you do you wanna be in the plywood business the rest of your life mister sims i you know i don't know if that's such a great idea you know and he said this other company the goodyear tire and rubber says you really wanna be in the tire business the rest of your life and i thought gee mister sims i you know i don't know if that's the best answer he says come to the bankers life company and you'll change lives the rest of your life and he was right it's it's been it's been incredibly rewarding to be in an industry where we do a lot of good we can always improve but for the most part we get a lot of things right
Speaker 0,Reporter,k tell tell us more about how you measure success what what is success how do you measure it what what are there metrics you're tracking in in this part of the work that you're doing for the ceo
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"well so that height and weight because i fail on both of those the right weight i'm just 4 inches too short but yeah you know the the metrics for us aren't the ones you might immediately jump to so for example one way you could measure a financial company is the assets under management you could measure for example the operating earnings your return on invested capital your internal rate of return i'm not gonna suggest that those aren't all important but when we really dissect it and say what's gonna make us successful long term the sheer number of clients that we have of all kinds how diverse is our workforce how inclusive is our workforce another big one is how close are you to being on track to replacing 85% of your income at retirement and we measure that so what percent of all of our customers are on track to reach an 85% income replacement ratio at age 65 to do that math real easily if you're making a $100,000 a year today and you were gonna retire have we helped you save enough money that would generate $85,000 a year in income that means we were successful and for any of those who kinda wanna skip the book and kinda get right to the punch line if over the course of a 35 year working career you saved 15% of your income and set it aside in a diversified portfolio didn't take hardship withdrawals didn't take a loan you'll replace 85% of your income so through employer matching contributions through salary deferrals whatever it takes to get there that's the math"
Speaker 0,Reporter,and that financial
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,that's your robo advisor lesson for the day
Speaker 0,Reporter,and that financial security is part of well-being
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"how could it not be yeah i mean you talk to people about stress in their lives mhmm we already stress in lives and stress in marriages what's number 1 it's money it it's it's around income and for the most part one thing that we do need to sort of get in check it's the spending we we we buy a lot of convenience and more discipline should be applied and again you know i mentioned my father earlier but you know one of the big lessons he always gave me was pay yourself first you know set the money aside first pay yourself first get your savings in order first then apply to the other the other areas i i feel compelled to to share this doctor ko because again we we put a lot of energy into all customers and all employees everywhere we do business we have a program in india pune india to be specific where we have roughly 1500 employees on our way to 2,000 it's an amazing group of professionals we have mds some of them would have come right from harvard we have data scientists we have actuaries we have a really professional group of of employees that work and live in pune our give back to that community was to work with an ngo in establishing something called the lighthouse the lighthouse is located right on the fringes of the slums but the idea was to work with the elders within those slums and to identify at risk teenagers those people who have dropped out of formal education but they're kinda coming in on that adulthood age we put together a program that if you looked at the 1 year success rate for every 100 individuals that we're able to work with out of that area and the and the program is roughly 12 weeks of working with those individuals 85% of them after 1 year are in a middle income job middle income is defined in pune india much different than it is defined here but the but the real point is some of those people end up working for principle but one person at a time you know could we influence 85,204,06100 you do what you can but that's that's what we see as our obligation for those people who aren't direct customers our ability to give back to the community has everything to do with helping people get on track to be a middle income wage earner"
Speaker 0,Reporter,so in the last few minutes of this interview tell tell us more about your personal and professional leadership philosophy we we talk a lot about leadership through the series we're in a leadership studio we try to teach this to our students so just reflect on some of your learnings about leadership personally professionally and what you would want others to know
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,this is probably the at risk part of the program for all my direct reports who would say that's a different dan but i'll see if i can get this as as close as i can i i've always subscribed to the notion of servant leadership and if i could just sort of dissect that for just a minute i know that there are some leaders that would say it's kinda my way or the the highway you know you kinda get on board with my thinking my way of doing things do that successfully and you just made the team i discriminate against every single single one of my direct reports every single day but everyone gets treated wanna take on the same sort of notion that we only need 1 dan we only need 1 nora 1 luis 1 tim you know 1 amy and if they take the approach of being a servant leadership i e they're the ones adapting and adjusting their approach to maximize the value creation from each one of their direct reports i think you just get a better result we already know that diverse teams get better answers we also know inclusive teams get better answers we all know that listening versus talking all generally gets you a better outcome but communications honesty integrity trustworthiness all of those things sort of well melded into a servant approach to leadership is from my perspective one of the most at least what appears to be effective ways of maximizing the resources of a of a company
Speaker 0,Reporter,so do you think these themes can apply to companies that are a lot smaller than yours that don't have the resources that you have
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,are
Speaker 0,Reporter,these universal principles or do they have to be tailored somehow
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,"absolutely and it's funny because i think of ourself as being a medium sized company you look at the global playing field that we're up against and we have competitors with a quarter of our main employees our new head of hr that we recruited from a retirement he worked for a company with 280,000 associates he had 60,000 in his division he's got 15,000 with the principal so again i heard him sort of talk about small companies so it's all relative this so our our largest customer base is small to medium sized businesses as i said earlier our average size pension client's a 125 our average size life and disability customer is 44 oftentimes we know one thing's for sure the owner or sole proprietor or the partners they're the chief risk officer they're the chief financial officer they're the chief human resources officer so we need to make sure that we really have the mindset of understanding what small employers need by definition and when we have understanding what small employers need by definition and when we have programs to support them we go into it from a position of strength because we have roughly a 140,000 small to medium sized customers that we interact with every day and the person we're interacting with isn't a ceo of a fortune 500 company it's not the chief human resources officer of a fortune 250 it is someone with very very different skill sets and so for that reason i think much of our leadership that we have and that we our orientations around small to medium size employers is very transferable to a sole proprietor or very small businesses"
Speaker 0,Reporter,so in the final couple of minutes here just share with us any any thoughts you have for people who emulate you or for people who want to work at this intersection between private business and public health and again there are a lot of folks out there who say these two worlds just can't talk to each other and we're trying to do this and having you has been so enlightening but how would you advise both worlds to work better together as we move forward
Speaker 1,Daniel Houston,well i would tell you i like the crossroads of my life of being in in in in the crosshairs of of of these two issues because i think they're both incredibly important that's the first thing i would say one of the one of the luxuries you have in working for a company that supports involvement and outside activities is to be involved with partnership for healthy america and some of the brightest minds i can think about and what we're trying to deal with the issue of childhood obesity and it's a lot of very serious work michelle obama's been heavily involved doctor gavin's been heavily involved but it's a group of professionals it's a it's a not for profit organization that recognizes these food deserts that occur in a lot of these major cities what can we do around making fruits and vegetables more accessible to individuals and you might ask the dan why would you be involved with an organization that's concerned about childhood obesity because they're all my customers sooner or later that is a group of people themselves their parents their grandparents their kids who become dependent on much of the product and services that we provide to the degree that i better understand what those food deserts constitute how we could eradicate it how we could do a better job communicating and and solving some of those social issues the better off we're gonna be as a company but i can assure you this i'm a better person for having been involved in in that organization and and i can say that about most all organizations i've ever been been part of because this has become such a such a large issue public policy doesn't have the luxury of putting things in in silos because it cuts across all demographics it cuts across all lifestyles and business is gonna have to have to be there and there's a there's a quid pro quo either pay it today in some sort of social tax or or pay it off in the future the last comment i would say in terms of just characteristics one of these i value in leaders and all workers is intellectual curiosity it's amazing to me how things that happen in biology or things that happen in chemistry and science think about them for a little bit and you can see how they might impact your business and as we have this digital transformation i i really do believe you know we all read about the industrial revolution and and how ford went about solving those problems we are right in the crosshairs of the digital revolution and it's gonna change every single business and if you don't have intellectual curiosity if you don't understand the impact look at just the announcements this morning between microsoft and walgreens look at the previously announced discussions between amazon and and berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan health health care health expenditures is a big part of all of our lives and if you don't get your arms around it it'll consume us
