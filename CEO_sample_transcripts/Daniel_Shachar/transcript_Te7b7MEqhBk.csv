Speaker 0,Reporter,hello and welcome to the dinesh garda youtube podcast show powered by businessabc.org former openbusinesscouncil.org and ctsabc.com we continue profiling global leaders and professionals that are bringing new ways of looking at technology and business and especially bringing new narratives and i think the narrative is very important especially with everything that happens in in business and technology with the complexity of things around data artificial intelligence becoming i would say more exciting and more complex and more challenging and i think we at the moment are in a fantastic crossroad where we're going to have a lot of breakthroughs but we should not forget the basics and i think one of the things i'm learning as i get more into data ai and technology is that in the other day is what problems you're solving and that we can actually create relationships with leaders that actually can help us saving or bringing new roads and road maps for us so that's the case of my special guest for today podcast show so i'm quite excited to bring to the series shakaar daniel shakaar daniel is a prominent figure in the technology industry known for his role and ceo and cofounder of alaron technologies based out of israel shakar with a career marked by leadership and innovation has been pushing boundaries between business strategy and operational excellence but as well bringing together the areas of technology around data and web born and raised in israel shikhar pursued the his education in industrial engineering earning a bachelor in science degree from the olin institute of technology he later continued his academic journey obtaining his executive mba from the hebrew university in this work and academic he blend the technical expertise and business acumen and lay the foundation for his future work and the endeavors as shaqalyn career trajectory has been working in different cellular roles and industry leadership especially working on projects that have been trying to touch the areas of digital web data and how to put together all these different things
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,here
Speaker 0,Reporter,so alaron technologies is the company that is leading and we're gonna be talking about that and is a company focused on providing innovative solutions for data collection and analysis this company of course is bridging a lot of different things especially in the way you bridge the data the web collection and a lot of things that touches as well increasing artificial intelligence and as a ceo and founder sakal has been instrumental in shaping the company's vision and strategy and driving its growth and expansion into global markets under his leadership the company has developed cutting edge technology including netnut an hybrid proxy network that enables anonymous data collection from public sources from the web and sashar's commitment to the excellence and customer satisfaction has earned him recognition in the leadership around technology sector and as well in pushing the company and the different areas and products around the company and its ecosystem so welcome to our series shekhar
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,thank you very much it's my pleasure thanks for having me
Speaker 0,Reporter,so so you are from a country that is known around technology and of course i would say that it's probably one of the most innovative countries in data and technology in the planet if not probably the top 5 or top even more than that so tell us a bit about your journey into creating your company and being the professional you are today starting a bit by your education and your professional career
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,"okay thank you very much so good my personal journey started as an industrial engineer in elbit systems as a project manager program manager managing complex products in the space of homeland security and security elbit systems is the leading company in israel providing security products and technologies globally all over the world you know israel also known for its security products and we need to defend ourselves so we we have the best companies here in israel then i am going with my journey to another company called logic again as a program manager manage project managers we did the uae a huge homeland security project multidisciplinary including everything technology infrastructures etcetera then i moved to primesense again to be a a kind of program manager meaning to be the point of to contact between customers r and d sales and marketing to manage again multidisciplinary projects in primesense primesense was a huge success story one of the best start up in israel then and they've been acquired by apple in 2014 we developed the three d technology basically that the the iphones today are based the the face recognition technology is based on our technology from primesense and then i moved to alarm and started alarm with 2 other a few other founders the journey in alarm is something that we can have a dedicated pot podcast to discuss tony about this crazy journey i think we can write a great book on this journey because it's it's it's it's it's a kind of a mountain twin of years so we started basically as a cybersecurity company in israel based on a private investment selling developing and selling products in the in the area of cybersecurity in the layer of data security secure vaults secure emails we started to engage with a lot of customers vpla customers banks insurance companies investment houses government offices israeli defense forces the intelligence unit of the israeli army israeli police etcetera etcetera but back then already i think in 2018 i started me and my partners started to understand that the cybersecurity space become more and more crowded it's a huge red ocean full of full of companies from 10 people from from young start ups to giants and you you know the giants of the world like the the the the palo alto the checkpoint the crowdstrike etcetera and due to this some trends are becoming to be very significant one of them it's become very costly it's from hr perspective you need to invest a lot of money basically you need to lose a lot of money till you start to see significant revenues and to be profitable is something that is fantasy in this space it takes years if at all 2nd the competition is is is so challenging that the probability to win a good contract with a high quality customer is become almost mission impossible and 3rd the giants if back then each giant has his own layer of of of vertical in the cyberspace the giant started to understand that they have the power because anyway they are in most of the organizations so kind of become all in one and you know a a firewall company can be also endpoint protection and can be this and can be that so it's not just that you are competing with other players in in your layer you are starting to compete with all the giants of the world which made made the mission to be more and more impossible so and and in parallel by the way which is something that is very important we started our journey at the at the public markets and the public market is not cannot accept it doesn't know by the way how to deal with young startups that are not profitable small revenues and the journey to profitability is something that you cannot project even and due to this when you need to raise money not like in the private market which is a good sign for a company if she can raise money in the public market when you are small and not profitable when you are raising money and basically you dilute you dilute your your shareholders because that that's the nature of raising money it's terrible for the market cap for the share for the share price and it's starting to be it it becomes a very negative trend so due to all of this in 2018 we took a decision that we want to leverage the fact that we're a public company and one of the main advantages of being a public company is the fact that you can do you you you you can do m and a's it's much more easy to do m and a's because you have shares you can exchange shares you have shares that are not basically shares that are trading and we started to think and to strategize how we are going to extend our product portfolio in order to mitigate the risk of the cyberspace that becomes so crowded and challenging and basically to start our way out of the classic the traditional cyber to a space that is less crowded that has a promised future and that we can bring our capabilities skills and knowledge to this space together with the company and the talents that we will acquire and to build something interesting that that that will replace the cyber and once it will go well so that's what we did we acquired netnat which was a very young group of talents data company ip proxy network company but data company in this the space of data collection and we acquired them back then in 2019 and when they started just you know what little bit more than $1,000,000 in revenues we invested a lot of money in this company because we wanted really to grow directly to be one of the leaders in this space we thought that we have the chance to lead this space how many companies small companies can even even the fantasy to lead to lead a space you know the the technology ecosystem is not something that you can say okay i will lead the space in in in few years you can start try to be a significant player but here with port we recognized that we can need the space so we invested in the infrastructure of on the next expanding the network in the technology and i'm happy to you know those that are following us see that netnut today is one of the leaders in the data collection space we are generating more than we we in a run rate of more than $30,000,000 revenues in a year we are profitable even very profitable in this journey over the time as as i mentioned before after we saw and we we understood that we have a superstar in our hands which is netnut business basically we spin out we sold our cybersecurity business we scaled down other business lines that were not so profitable and still were costly and basically today alahum is the model company but our business is netnut so it's it's it's the same company alahum and netnut are the same companies we are experts in the experts in data collection b to b business to business growing and the the the future look promising"
Speaker 0,Reporter,now that's an impressive trajectory so so let let me ask a couple of questions on this so first of all we are a nasdaq company which is a very important thing that that i would like to tell you so tell us the journey to become a nasdaq company and as well from israel to new york and nasdaq and now as a global powerhouse like you said with strong revenues and then i wanna go to the technology but i wanna go first to the constitution of the company and i think it's important for people listening to us as well
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,yes so as mentioned in in in a previous question we started our journey in the in the capital markets as a very small as as a startup company basically startup company that instead of raising money in the private market is raising money and progressing in the capital markets in the public markets we started in the turkish stock exchange in 2016 and then in 2018 we jumped the class we uplisted the company in the nasdaq and since then we are a a dual company trading both here and there in the tel aviv stock exchange and in the nasdaq in in the main list okay so i've i've many you know many conclusions many thoughts you know the world of the to being a public company in in a young age is is is so many upsides but so many downsides and you know entrepreneurs or ceos that wants to take their company to be a public company i think they need to consider it deeply because the upsides of being a public company when you are young back then with very small revenues not profitable is that you can raise money easier than in the private market because you have shares the shares worth something it's not 1 or 0 like in the private market you have a shares that have value so you can raise money in in easier than in the public in the private sector 2nd you need to organize you need to be very organized which might be a burden but basically it makes you to be more professional because you need to have the financials sometime you need to work according to standards you need to be to be very transparent they were transparent sorry so basically it helps you to organize together the company to be faster more mature from the other side as i mentioned before the the the public sector is less let's say less or or or not less i will mention it in a different way the public sector is basically in its nature is for mature companies mature companies even if you're profitable or not it's it's a way of strategy but you need to be more mature than than the public markets the analysts know how to project your revenues where it is your direction etcetera etcetera when you are so young and basically you don't know even what is going to be your next quarter revenues or your next year revenues so the public the public market is not so patient about this patience about these companies and then when you need to raise money basically you are raising money which sometimes can be let's call it a bad money bad money i mean you know it's the same money but the terms of the deal basically in their nature can take your share down and down and down and your market cap down and down and and basically it has an impact on the motivation on the energy on the motivation of the employees because it's transparent everyone can open every day the internet and see what is your market cap what did you do yesterday how is your financials you're totally transparent so it's tough you need to be tough guy in order to be the company's young company or microcap we call it microcap or nano cap companies in the stock exchange sometimes it can be something that will let's say you are less robust less agile you cannot take fast decisions because everything need to be transparent and everything has an impact on your shareholders and you don't know who are your shareholders because it's a public market it's not like in the private sector that you can call your shareholders for for for for the meeting room and discuss let's change strategy let's let's decrease expenses and maybe let's start a new an a a a new product and then it will postpone the revenues but it's still the best way to go in the public market sometimes you need to take decisions according to the image of of the of your company with your shareholders which sometimes might make you take wrong decisions or wrong business decisions so it's it's a it's a it's a it's a tough journey very challenging and you know it's it's exciting journey because you are a public company but and you need to think when what is the best time for your company what is what is your vision if if you think that it's the right time to come to the public markets because if you will come prepared and educated with experience in the public markets then you can make your life easier if you come very young you are not experienced the management is not experienced in leading probably company it it might be very challenging and might damage your business basically
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah it's it's it's a different way and i think in the world that we have like you said the the major global corporations than the the the medium sized companies and then you have as well right now a lot of innovation but as well a lot of disruption around the startups crypto projects and a lot of different things and blockchain so it's a it's a kind of a moving target game so i wanna touch right now so very important thing so you guys are doing quite a lot of technology and a lot of products so you provide so i would like to touch this because it's quite important so as a global provider of internet access and web data collection solutions your solution is based on the world's fastest and most advanced and secure hybrid proxy network they enable companies and and big data companies to collect data anonymously at any scale from the public source over the internet so i would like for you to elaborate on this for people that are more careful i think my audience is quite digital savvy but still i think especially if you could explain how it works to be a small and we had of course in this podcast similar companies and civil from big ones to small ones we have been having people from ibm and different parts but what you guys are doing is critical and i think this work is becoming even more critical with all the iterations of generative ai but let's start first how you guys work and as well your products
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,let's start from the fact everybody understand i guess that data is the lifeblood of everything today you you everything you are doing is according to data i imagine that 30 years ago the internet would not exist so you took many decisions in your in your life not according to data analysis and also in our private life when we want to buy something when we want to go to a vacation we are going to the biggest or the only data source in the world which is the internet in the internet you can find everything so data is the lifeblood of everything it's the lifeblood of organizations each organizations every sorry every ceo in order to get the right business decisions he needs to know everything about his neighborhood the ecosystem the competition the trends in the world the trends according to geographics the trend of the buyers the the the legal the regulation everything is according to data so in order to collect data and to to have the right data the focus data in your hands you cannot do it manually not not as a personnel as as a company you cannot do it manually because the the internet is an ocean of data and sometimes not not it's not sometimes most of the time not all the data is accurate transparent so basically as a ceo let's take an example there's a ceo of a company that need to take a business decision he needs to have all the data in front of them after the data had been analyzed and there are conclusions so from the data you can see what are the conclusions so in order to get it on a permanent basis basically it's all around on the automation and tools and products that will allow everyone to collect data and to get a transparent data real data accurate data and data in scale one more important important comment not like the physical world but the internet or the websites can change their image or their present presentation basically according to demographic attributes because let's let's denise you are in london i'm in tel aviv if if i will come to london and we will go to the the same store we will see the same products we will see the same prices because it's the physical world but imagine yourself that i will come to this store with you but someone would say oh this guy is not from london he's from tel aviv so i'll present him different products or different prices because his flavor is different so this is the internet you can tell you you websites are increasingly change their image according to demographic attributes that basically coming from your ip address ip is your identity card so from one side it's very positive because i want to see something that is interesting for me and you want to see something that is interesting for you but if you are a company and you need to collect data and scale not to be blocked by your competitors you're not to be misled on purpose by your competitors because imagine you serve the t5 i'm a grocery shop and i went to an online store and i want to see the prices in your online store and you know that it's me you will change the prices change the product you will mislead me on purpose so in order to get transparent and accurate data and getting scanned and not to be blocked and basically to be part of the automation set of products you cannot use your own ip your own office you need to have product that knows that basically put you behind mask you and will allow you to get real data transparent data will keep you anonymously anonymously and basically this is the only way today to correct write and sorry accurate real data on time and in scale
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah that's the that is the key element and this is more important than that so so let's get this in parts because i wanna i wanna explain for my audience and this is actually very important especially in a time where data is the new oil but at the same time like you said any company right now there's 2 challenge in one end we have these giants that you mentioned in the beginning that are getting all our data for free of course they give us a lot of great things like we are here on youtube and or even in all the podcast distribution i think this podcast is distributed around 30 different platforms and of course this is great because we have a great reach but of course there's a price we pay with this so if i'm looking at the data from a perspective of a a big giant like the openai they are picking my data they can actually pick this and then put an ai algorithm that will be checking data and take part of my excerpts and you get intelligence and learn with that that's large language models but like you said in internet there's still a lot of work to drive traffic to a website to pick the data for business development a lot of different things so one of the first question i have is bear in mind that you work with a large large amounts of data as well how do you deal with the the settings of of especially the settings of ownership of data all the the gdpr solutions because it's becoming increasingly more difficult and as well you touch of course you are an expert as well in cybersecurity and you have a lot of the things in the security so if you can touch about the a road map around these 3 areas it's quite important i think to share with the audience
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,sure so let's start from the fact that our company and most of the companies we are enabling data collection or collecting data only for publicly available data anything that is behind login is not is not in our space and publicly available data as it as as it sounds it's publicly available data meaning when you dennis and me let's for example we will open we we we will establish a website of news and everyone can hit our website and we will not put credentials or login because we want traffic if we will put credentials and login we will lose traffic so it become publicly available anyone can come in and imagine yourself that i let let's let's let's give a metaphor that i can sit in front of your of of front of this website and write some topics that are interesting right in my notebook and then i can go to my school or i'm a teacher and they tell them okay where do they this this and this basically i scrape the data i collect data i adjust manually but this is is exactly what i did so publicly available data is legal you can collect this data and you can scrape the or or extract this data and nothing more than this anything that behind login is a different game this is the first thing 2nd regarding privacy so the ip proxy network which is the first layer in the stake of data collection and i will touch it in a in a few minutes our in our journey in this state we are blind to the data we are just enabling the http traffic meaning we don't have any privacy regulation because we see nothing even not the domains of our customers if you are my customer i cannot see even not the domain sorry i if if you are going for example to a search engine and you are clicking in the sir you are clicking something in the search line i cannot see it even if i want to see it i cannot see it so i'm totally blind for this privacy topics or private topics so that's why here we don't have to meet gdpr regulation when you are going to the next stage and a lot of companies are there yeah the zoom infos of the world and others and you are collecting the data by yourself you are extracting the data and collecting the data but again anything is from publicly available data but here you need to meet the gdpr regulation and it's i'm not saying that it's easy but you need to meet the standard for example you need to let know you need to let you dennis know that i have some information about you that i collected it from your high school website which is not after login and there it's reading that you dennis i don't know learned in between the years this and this and were the best basketball player in the in in in your in your class so it's publicly it's there anyone can see it so anyway it's not a private information but still if i'm holding it so i need to acknowledge you if i have a way to communicate with you that i can listen dennis i have this information if you have some issues with this let me know and i will delete it so the gdpr basically is is is is something that i think most of the companies that are in this space according to this regular working according to these regulations meeting the standards and trying to and and of course try not to make any foul your third topic that you raised correct me if i'm wrong but you discussed about the ai challenges or something like this
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so out out this data right now because as we gather amounts of data like this in one end it's getting like you said for a specific client and following up the process of of data privacy and regulation and the other thing is how this data can be used for large language models especially generative ai because it becomes more and more important
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,okay so okay ai most of the ai products was nothing without data all their business model or or not the technology is based on data first of all they need to train their model on data and scale all the time you need you know a model of ai needs to be trained otherwise it's not it's it doesn't have the intelligence and then it needs to stay up to date all the time so basically ai products besides of the algorithm that knows how to analyze data it needs to collect data on a permanent basis and need to be up to date again in order to train this model and in order to stay up to date for its clients this is exactly the place this is why we see a growth even a sig even exponential growth in the demand for our products from these data insights that are basically ai companies that using us as their data enabler they are not expert in data collection in order to collect data and scale you need to build a network we have a network that we built over the years of thousands of servers around the world with full global coverage with millions of exit points and in order to collect data and not to be blocked or to be misled they are using yas as the data enabler by the way you know there are starting to to be some articles about this and if we want to project the future we think that it's going to be a kind of i will not say a fight but maybe a fight even between the ai products and the websites because basically when you are asking your ai product that you are using a question an information query inform informative question what was in the us in 1960 how do i do a how do i do kpis for my business for retention in any other space you are getting the answer you know you're getting the answer on this ai product before this ai product you will need to go to the search engine and to hit the website and you are hitting the website here's traffic all the business model of websites are based on traffic because they're advertisers they are more than they they need to monetize their their website in order to to to make money so now these ai products are basically skipping the websites so website websites will try to prevent ai products to come in to collect data they cannot do it from legal perspective because it's legal it's publicly available data anyone can come in it makes the world a better place the internet is making the world a better place because someone from china and someone from the us and someone from israel can go in can educate himself can stay up to date in front of his laptop or his computer and you you cannot block him you can try but you cannot block him from legal perspective so it's going to be a technology fight between the ai products and the websites and here by the way it's increased the value of us for this ai products as data enablers they will not they cannot do it because they're it's not their expertise it's our expertise we are one of the leaders in this space and we see the demand besides of this we as a company as i mentioned initially we started in the ip proxy network as i mentioned it's the way to come into the website next stage in the data stake in the in in in the data industry stake is the scrappers collectors meaning you're coming in and now you need to start and collect the data by by by a product so we are now getting into this stage we developed some of great products here and our biggest next product will be ai scraper i can elaborate if you want and then our next stage basically it's planned to 2025 is to close the circle and to provide also data insights by using technology and of course ai technology for this we established a special committee with industry experts to explore what is in in the focus that we want to be in this data insights vertical so we will be in the data insights as a provider of data but as a data enabler for other ai tools that that basically needs us
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah so so can you elaborate you you launch in in february this year 2024 the ai data collector which is precisely the scrapper so can you i know there is an important milestone on the netnut's roadmap so explain how it works and you touched a bit on this but to go a bit deeper and i think this is quite important that i have some questions related with this
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,what is data collector or data scraper basically it's a product that you instruct him go to this website i want to see to get this and this parameters and basically make it from unstructured data to structured data in a json file that then it can go directly to my automation other products that can analyze it in csv in excel whatever now this this this product the scraper he needs to learn the structure of the website because according to this structure it can go and collect the it it it can it can get in and and start to collect the data now imagine yourself that there are millions of websites and millions of structures and till today the competition is basically using professional services meaning human hours that are educating the product this is the structure of this website and now you can start and collect automatically 2nd even after you educate your product the website is revise themselves changing the structure of the website changing the structure of the landing page then you need to hold and to reeducate your product we are developing a product with a algorithm inside that will learn by himself the structure will learn by himself even when a page or a website is changing its structure and then we don't we need almost 0 human hours almost 0 professional service one of our goals is to me auto fully automated in everything in sales and marketing and of course in our product and by this we can provide a very fast response to our customers we can be agile as a generic as a generic scraper for every website and we can be also very fast response when a website is changing its structure because our ai algorithm will learn it by himself and very fast will recover and will will keep will not stop the business we we don't have any issues with business continuity of our customers
Speaker 0,Reporter,i'm sure that a company like yours at the moment you are in a golden moment that anything that touches data and ai can grow very scale and very strong so just tell us of so what what's your journey right now towards the present stage and like you mentioned you are in a strong situation right now i've been checking your stock it had been growing for the last 1 year congratulations on that and so it's been a a good cycle of growth so how do you wanna take this web scraper and phrases relate because a lot of companies right now are working large language models but one of the things that i think is more important is medium sized models and creating generative models around that how do you see that part first of all and that integration and the potential areas that you want of course whatever you can now spell like i know that if as a public company you have to be careful about you you mentioned but just probably from a top level that we can yeah
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,yeah we i have some limitations but i can talk in high level about about about our journey so i think and and and you know by the way one of the most important as a ceo one of the more most important things is is that you need to be agile yes and you need to adapt yourself and not to stick to a plan that you planned 1 year ago because this is the plan no you need to be agile you need to we we investigate all the time we check all the time your plans so everything is according to today and not only today but but to to this period and what we see in this period and what our is our future is that we have hundreds of satisfied customers in the ip proxy network product that we are providing and we have a demand from our customers that are telling to us we are so satisfied for your ip proxy network why not we want to use you as one vendor for all of the stake not only the ip proxy network provide me also the scraper the collector the datasets and then the data insights so we have already the the awareness we have the customers we have the knowledge and this is our journey now we in 2023 met our goals released our first scraper in 2024 we released our major product which is called webandblocker which it's it's the enabler of these scrapers and ip proxy network we will release by the end of the year our ai scraper and then we will have the ip proxy network and the scraping and collecting capabilities to upsell and cross sell our customers and of course to bring more and more new customers the next big thing of our company and i think it's going to it's it's a huge thing for our company is to close the loop and to investigate well and that's exactly what we are doing in these days we established a real committee that we are meeting twice in a week we have homework we are educating ourselves we are learning everything everybody's talking about ai but ai is just starting and we we need to investigate well what is the space of data insights that we want to come in it it can be huge it's huge you can provide insights in almost each and every space you know today we are agnostic our customers are coming from all over ecommerce and cybersecurity companies and pricing intelligence companies and ai companies because our product is agnostic for data collection but when you are diving into the data insight you cannot be agnostic anymore you need to to find the place that you will be specialized and then you will be industry focused ecommerce pricing retail cyber governments so many options on the table we brought really experts from this space some of them are former venture capitals for example and we're about to find the best direction for us it can be by internal development it can be by an acquisition it can be by a combination and of course from you mentioned regarding the performance of the company and according to this the performance of the share of the company so we are performing in the next in the last 2 years very well you can go to our you know we are public companies so we have financials that are public we have corporate presentation you can see the growth from revenues perspective great gross margins we are profitable we have positive and great ebitda we are generating cash we have net profit and we want to keep it to keep this growth because we see a huge demand to invest some of our profits in the company or most of them in the company in order to accelerate growth in order to improve our product to extend our network and of course to stay innovative you know it's all about innovation ai scraper data insights all about technology and innovation in order to open ourselves to more and more spaces more and more industries and to be one of the leading data companies
Speaker 0,Reporter,in the world fantastic and that's a that's a a a very strong and nothing special the continuous innovation is the key element on this so you one of the things i was looking at some of your prs and different parts that you have is that you have a lot of verticals you mentioned retail but you have a lot of fintech and a lot of other companies so i wanna it's a broader question but i think it's particularly important for your knowledge as well in terms of the internet so as we go i think at the moment we have a very broken internet because in one end we have of course the web 2 the web 3 and there's of course all the ai and special computing integrating so that means a lot of the data that we're scraping and that companies like yours are scraping the internet are becoming more and more important but it's the qualification of this data that is the most important thing right now so from your experience working with different clients and of course you have from fintech clients to retail ecommerce in different parts what would be the the advice and your vision as this kind of variation of the internet and as well especially the directions to go because of course i think companies like yours are cutting edge in the sense that you are a step ahead but at the same time you learn with like you said with the mistakes but as well with the experience working with clients and as well understanding first i was talking with a big corporation and they said something that made a lot of sense for me but i never thought that that way we would we sometimes if we are in digital or in tech like you and me we think okay everything is very fast very fast but in the other day most of the companies they change computers each 3 years sometimes even more and if it's data center sometimes it's for 5 10 years and then they said one thing that made me crazy i didn't thought about it is that if it's a for us a manufacturing company or a big industrial company sometimes it's each 10 years so this is there's all these legacy systems and has all the things like us that we are every month we have to keep updating so i would see this kind of looking at the legacy and looking at the innovation and the acceleration the disruption coming especially from ai and special computing especially anything related with the things like the the apple vision pro that is creating new levels of data and new levels of interactive data it's a big question but i wanna hear
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,it wow your question by the way i i i i will i will answer in very high level you know you mentioned the the world the tech world is progressing like crazy every day a lot of changes and and and of course you know the the big players of the world every change doing it as a main impact on thousands of companies and and applications and vendors and providers etcetera and not only them but you know the regulation and the and and and you know and and and it's a world of integration you are not doing you are doing almost nothing by yourself as we mentioned you have ai you need data you need data you need the the other websites you need cybersecurity products to protect you so it's a world of cooperation and integration but it's a competitive world and everybody wants to take bigger piece and to stop you in order that they can do more money more revenues etcetera etcetera my recommendation for me and for other companies is try and be focused on your expertise and anything else even if think even if you think that it's a small issue don't do it internally use 30 use third party products i'm doing it also in my company use the experts don't try to protect your entity use cybersecurity companies don't try to collect data by yourself use data companies don't try to do many other things by yourself because first of all it's the focus and second you will never be in the same level of these companies because i am as the ceo of a data company i am waking up every morning getting articles about data staying up to date about the regulation trying to be innovative learn what will be trying to project what what will be their next developments what is going to be in the internet etcetera you will never be in the same level because you are ceo of a semiconductor's company or a cybersecurity company or many many many other spaces so the world is become very complex even if sometimes you know some core my colleagues sometimes think that they can you know they can save money because they don't need to take this 3rd party vendor and do it internally you have a great engineer he knows how to do it no no he doesn't know how to do it it it it you you will lose money for this so try to build a business plan and to allocate budgets for this in order not not to be surprised and then go in your expertise and use third party experts products companies that it's their expertise appreciate it appreciate it and know how to value it because you will never be in their level not because you know sometimes it's an ego issues i'm smart enough no no you are smart enough maybe you are smarter than them but you have only 24 hours a day and that's your expertise and stick to this expertise and stay focused
Speaker 0,Reporter,"i like that and the focus and and as well build these parts of the ecosystem can save a lot of headache especially if you build a good ecosystem so one one of the last questions i want is is i one of the things i like a lot in your market overview you have a section for data collection and i think this is a great one so when i look at data collection you you have in your document for market drivers data backed decisions of course the critical for ai and we touch that the social media which of course the monitoring and understanding of social media it becomes more than the buyer trends so on these four areas i think i would say that of course right now critical for ai it's it's probably the most at least trendy because there's bills and bills integrated into ai and the numbers that keep growing and then there's the buyer trends and i think one of the things that i always like to do is okay process in the case of data collection the numbers we're talking about just late data collection labeling according to your own research is around 17,100,000,000 and there's a lot of work on that there that needs a lot so tell us a bit about this part of the data collection especially from these different market drivers"
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,"social media you know internet you you can differentiate there is the internet and there is the social media it can be a second internet because it's an ocean of data you can learn almost everything from the social media almost everything not only from the big social media platforms you know you have the boutique platforms you have social media for capital markets social media for gaming you know like the discord and others you have the stock tweets and and and the reddit and by the way reddit went public yesterday the reddit and and the robinhood for the capital markets etcetera etcetera etcetera so social media is an ocean of data that you as a business owner can learn almost everything from these platforms first of all let's start a very very simple topic you want to hire an employee imagine yourself that you or me maybe the younger for sure if i will have your data from all the social media platforms let's start again it's not publicly available data it's a different game it's publicly but it's after your game so it's a different game but just just just as a concept if i will know what are your area there of interest whether who are your friends where are you spending your time from the linkedin linkedin i can see your background from the instagram i can see this from the twitter i can see maybe your political and directions etcetera etcetera so if i can get a summarized document about you from all social media i think it will make the hiring process to be with a higher probability to be a successful and i will not be surprised one day after you come to work and i will find out that you are this this and this but let's take it to other trends everybody is talking today in this country about this flavor so if if i am a a a a a a food company so i know that everybody now in london are talking about this food so okay so i will i will i i i will release for this market okay something in the taste of this food it's it's connected also to buyer trends so think from political and geopolitical you can learn a lot about the trend and if something is going on with the citizens of this of this of this country if you are if you want to run of course in the you know the political world the social media you remember what happened in the us elections few years ago so all of this is around data social media yes platforms are huge drivers for data needs because everything is there and data make decisions by the way southeast is based on social media and the competition etcetera and the ai is all is everything it needs sometimes from the social media sometimes from other websites but all of these trends are taking this market to its exponential growth of in cagr of almost 30% in the next 5 or 6 years to reach $17,000,000,000 it could be 18 in other research 19 but but it's huge numbers if you ask me i think it would be higher"
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah and that's i agree completely it's going to be higher and as well the challenge right now is that we put the these parts of social media with ai and all the things together and as well our companies can use this in a way that is useful because it's increasingly more difficult to touch data from social media unless you pay big amounts especially to meta or to tweet or x right now and a lot of the others okay well it's been a pleasure like you said that especially on the ai i might want to do a second podcast with you on the ai and data i think there's a couple of things so one last question and i will ask the team to put the graphic but i would like to touch 1 i like a lot the way you put this graphic on your own kind of report in the data collection landscape on page 7 you have the data collections landscape but you have the ippn solutions the data collections and labeling data sets and data insights and then you have your products and the current solutions and future growth solutions i don't know if you can elaborate a bit on that
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,ippn is basically you are knocking on the door of the website and the website will open the door and you will see the real and transparent data in this room you came in this is one product it's called the ippn now you need to start and collect stuff but you need to do it very fast in automatic way and you need to have only few parameters you don't want everything from from the stuff imagine that it's a storage so the collector or the scraper will do it automatically we'll go only to nike shoes and then and adidas shoes and the this is the size this is the version this is the price and you will get it in a structured data it can be csv file it can be json file because you need to file it for your analyzer or data insights product then it's datasets meaning if i'm already i i have the capabilities to extract data so i will extract the data i will pack it and i will send it to you as a ready to as a dataset you will ask i want this and this and this okay get it and then i can send it again and again by the way it's it can be a very profitable product because it's the same data that i will say to dennis i can send to someone else because he needs the same data again all is publicly a very good data next step is i think i discussed a lot about it is you came into the room you collect the data but now you need to have conclusions okay i want wait now i want okay i have the data but now let's let's go for the pricing word i want to price my product in my online store so i collect the data from all the online stores around i know all the prices every second but then i need an engine an ai engine that will optimize the price because i don't want to sell in the lowest price okay it's not a smart way to manage the business you need to sell in the optimum price so this data insights product is also we will will also analyze and then basically and we are closing the circle you get into the room you collect the relevant data you analyze it and you provide insights for the customers and this is our journey this is the place that we want to be and this is the place that
Speaker 0,Reporter,we will be fantastic well that like like we discussed there's a lot of things here that i still wanna touch more on the ai side but we'll probably i definitely wanna do a second podcast so i wanna thank you for this for people listening to us of course the you are a public company so there's a role of regulatory parts but we'll put all the information about the company about the stock about the links the websites and the different information any last things you wanna touch with the audience advice about how to deal with data nowadays and we touch a lot of important things but i think it's always important and as well about your company where they can find information about it
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,the most important thing i mentioned it few times but remember everybody needs to remember the internet is not the physical world doesn't have to be the real let's say the real product the real price because it's it's it's technology i can adapt and change the image that shaha will see and the image that dennis will see because i know who you are you have your ip address i know where you're coming from so if you want to get a reliable and transparent and accurate data not as a personal okay i'm talking more as a as a business
Speaker 0,Reporter,yeah of course
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,"and not trust like the conclusion that we said before don't trust your own domain don't trust your own product use not not us okay i'm not just advertising my company use experts in data collection because the data the damage from collecting non accurate data or being blocked can be huge and sometimes you and your business or take your decisions to a place that you don't want to be and focus on your business take the right decisions learn about your competition learn about everything all the time use data without data you owe us nothing every decision that you will take in our world today because it's so dynamic without an accurate on time and transparent data might make you a damage of 1,000,000,000 so invest few 1,000 in order to prevent yourself from doing a damage of 1,000,000,000 or sometimes can basically kill your business that's my advice"
Speaker 0,Reporter,very good advice it's been a pleasure sasaj i wish you congratulations and that your stock keeps growing faster and as well that a lot of products keep coming and a lot of innovation because that's what we need and we need more than ever
Speaker 1,Daniel Shachar,thank thank you so much very much it was a great discussion appreciate it thank you my pleasure
