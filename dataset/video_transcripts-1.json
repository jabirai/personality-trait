    "text": "great to see you thanks for spending the time thank you for comingwell we've been executing with ai for a long time right it's at the you're wearing a watch it's at the root of the watch i mean you think about things like crash detection fault detection things like afib and all of this kind of stuff is machine learning at the end of the day and so but what has captured people's imagination is generative ai and we see it as the opportunity to for an a whole new curve of technology and and providing and doing more things for people providing an assistant for people things that really improve people's lives so that's how we see it there's obviously it's not without downside and so we approach it very thoughtfullyand and as as you heard we we have always been focused on privacy and so privacy is a very key tenet of our thrust into ai rightin the beginning and throughout almost everything that we always do we always talk about the benefit to the user mhmm and so the benefit to the user is crash detection and fall detection not the technology behind the feature sure and so we still we we still view it like that but it became clear that people wanted to know our views on on generative ai in particular yeah and and so we decided to embrace it and called it apple intelligenceit was fun she's fantastichow dogender grip ai was never off the table okay it was always about pursuing it in a thoughtful kind thoughtful kind of way and and so that that's what we've done and we've implemented it in ways that are less likely to create issues how so how so will things that you if you think about the kinds of things that we talked about we talked about personal contextand we talked about privacy and so we're not waiting for a comprehensive privacy legislation regulation to come into effect we already view privacy as a fundamental human right and so that's the lens that we see it at and given that we're doing those things personal context and privacy we wanted to integrate it at a deep level so you're not having to think oh well now i want to do something that uses intelligence we put it in the apps that you're already using right and integrated it deeplywell there's private cloud compute and then there's the arrangement with openai these two things are different okay and so if you look at private cloud compute we're utilizing the same silicon or not the same silicon but the same basic architecture as the silicon that's in right the well that's in the iphone 15such a way that we've done it in device and so we've really we've really worked on this a a a lot and put a lot of wood behind that arrow to to assure that if you're if you're working on something that requires world knowledge so you're out of the the domain of personal context and so forth then you you may want to go and use one of the large language models that are on the market and we we selected what we feel is the best one with openai and chat gpt but you'll make a conscious decision to do thatthat's right you decidei think it's a possibility and a significant possibility i mean for us we've never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices our our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed our model is one that where we want to empower you to to be able to do things you couldn't do otherwise we wanna give you a tool so you can do incredible things that you couldn't do without the tool that that's what motivates us and and so we you know we come out with things like screen time etcetera so it's a bit in your face as to how much you're using your device true we come out with we count your notifications and so forth so that you can go in and say do i really want this many notifications and and we have focus kinds of states where you can silence the the phone etcetera and so i i do believe that as things get smarter and smarter with apple intelligence that you can even take the things that were taking more time will take less time nowand and so i do think that opportunity exists interesting yeahit is it it is and a and i think a really i'm really optimistic about ityeah marques i don't think about it okay and so to to me a legacy is something that is defined by other people looking at you not something that you define yourself very fair and and so and i typically i'm always focused on the forward not the rear view mirror mhmm and that's that is a characteristic of apple in general is we're very focused on the forward you you won't find a museum here and yet we would have lots of things that you might like to see and and reminisce about but we just don't it's just not a part of our culture yeah and and so i feel the same way personally at some point there will be another ceo and and and my whole focus in life will will be on making them successfulit's alrightoh okay and this is your rankingthe numbers this is a tough one because it is a tough one it's like asking you your favorite kids or nephews or niecesi think it's the most popular in the world and that moment of taking it out of the folder established a characteristic about that device that lives today the the first one it wasn't about how many people would buy it yeah it was about establishing the foundationthat was of any line yeah you might have been i believe so yes okay i believe so and so i'm gonna fail miserably at giving you a ranking but it was a huge moment yeah a huge moment for the company the ipad oh wow you know tablets had been in the market for a long time mhmm well our objective is never to be first mhmm our objective is to be bestand there were many rumors leading up to it and and people thought many things that weren't too nice about it in the in the beginning including the name mhmm and and yet i couldn't live without my ipad today yeah and and and so another huge moment for the for the companythe magic mouse it was also an incredible moment people don't think of that as much as they would the macbook air and the ipad and whatever else you're going to name probably mhmm but the getting the ergonomics well done in whiskey with magic mouseit changed the worldit changed the world and the the simplicity of defining the three things yeah that were that were the on the phone was brilliant to get people to think about it like thatand of course opening up this isn't talked about as much but initially you'll remember that there was not an app storethe app store came a year later and that changed everything in the developer community because now now i meet with students every wwdc and they give me such great inspiration there were no students in the developer community at that particular point in time mhmm now they're the developer population's very diverse from an age point of view and everything else and it it it just fundamentally it it became an economic miracle for people and and got well outside of just doing it for a hobby it it was or you look at all the businesses that that came out of itoh i i i love visionpro i was just using it last night to look at the screening yeahwhat they use it for i use it for the entertainment mhmm value i use it when i want to do multitasking because i find the multiple windows really effective in in doing this of course i'm reviewing lots of apps on it right now and some of those are enterprise apps some some people's proprietary apps that they wanna share with us and and i'm seeing an extraordinary number and variety of things coming out of the enterprise area far earlier than we would have predicted interesting because businesses generally move slow to adopt yeah and and what we're seeing is that half of the fortune 100 is now buying visionpro for some project or the other or exploring it it interesting and and so i i'm i'm looking at several of those and yeah i i i find that it's still an emotional experience to look at your photos and with visionos 2 being able to take your old photos yeah and make them 3 d i think is a big big thing yeah and you know i lost both of my parents and before visionpro came out and being able to go back and look at those photos differently isis something that you know it's it's an experience you can't replicateyeah it was great fun thank you for coming thanks man"
