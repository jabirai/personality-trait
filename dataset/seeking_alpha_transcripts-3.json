    "text": "It's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.I think AI, Generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks. I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. And we think that we're well-positioned.Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently added Vision Pro to that. And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as a economist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.Sure. We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.I can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.Sure. The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decreased channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe. So that's not unusual. And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.Yes, the great thing is, I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top, right now. The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to healthcare related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. And so the -- it commands control centers. And so it's an enormous number of different verticals. And you know our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged. And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. And so we're off to a good start, I think, with the enterprise."
