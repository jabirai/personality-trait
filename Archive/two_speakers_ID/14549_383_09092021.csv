383.0,Provider,Okay. And is that something that you're working on and your therapy just kind of talking about your childhood.
14549.0,Patient,"Yes, a little bit, and then I get distracted and start focusing on problems current. Problems of my data later like which i'm sure are caused by my job. We have to get to the root of things, but I tend to veer off a lot that's one of my problems."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for sharing that with me um any learning problems when you were growing up, did you have any special needs in school."
14549.0,Patient,"I can't I want to say something to do with like short term and short term memory problems really to be very honest if i'm not interested in something I i'm just not focused on it at all it's just a very it's it's very, very hard for me to focus on something that. doesn't interest me and I have tried to like force myself. And it's like I think to myself i'm like Am I like bratty do I just not want to do it, but I just cannot like I can't explain it it's just like I can't put my mind to it, unless I want. To do or i'm interested in it."
383.0,Provider,"Right right did you have any diagnosis, when you were young."
14549.0,Patient,"No, no, my mom she hates medications, and so I don't I think. I never really got the proper help. So I think the only reason I got out of high school was because I was just over it, and I didn't want to deal with going to school anymore, I wanted to start working and start just progressing and that like halted so."
383.0,Provider,"I see any past substance use on your part, alcohol or any any substances."
14549.0,Patient,"I smoked weed i'm. Here and there I actually started fairly early I was 14, I think, so I smoked it like on and off till I was like 16. And then. I haven't smoked it since it wasn't important to me, so it didn't really it honestly gave me anxiety. or just made me. right kind of out of it and I didn't like that."

14549.0,Patient,"Only I have to be honest, only when I get close to my period every month like there's times, where agents, not to snap but i've never actually snapped. I wanted to scream with someone yesterday, like it's my hormones I just need to calm down. The only thing, but never no never anger."
383.0,Provider,Okay um any thoughts of suicide or history of suicidal attempts or plan. No okay. that's good any non suicidal self injury. Cutting or anything like that. Good okay. Any psychiatric hospitalizations. any financial or legal problems that you're worrying about.
14549.0,Patient,"i'm a financial. I mean I am it's not it's not worrying me sick, but I would like to be able to work, and you know. That but not wearing me sick but. My ex husband, I mean it's every other week gets courts being threatened and you know. I. He pays child support and he doesn't want to be doing that and it's constant harassment about that, I mean, I think the last time he actually came to my car I video we're allowed to video record any future. conversations between us and this was just last Friday, he came to my car to get our youngest daughter out ship fall asleep and. He started talking to me in front of her about the support and how much of it, do I get and. Just questioning me around things along those lines and he's actually. threaten my life over money before, so it kind of. With the link with the legal stuff I mean I don't know if that's what you meant by legal but."
383.0,Provider,I don't.
14549.0,Patient,"The core you know him threatening the Court always and he never wins but it's still you know you still have to go. You have to sit in front of a judge like that's time and money to an attorney it it's just it and then on top of that all like it does affect our children, it does. When you come to my car talking to me about these things in front of the kids you know and in and i'm sure that those things are talked about in front of them, not in front of me so it's like that's very that's all. is very stressful."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
14549.0,Patient,"that's tad We actually had two trials, last year I won them both but it doesn't he he's a he's a narcissist very, very bad and I think he I don't I mean I didn't have to diagnose him, he was diagnosed in America marital therapy in front of me. And he was discharged from the military for. narcissistic traits psychotic tendencies and antisocial personality disorder. He was very strange who's a weird one."
383.0,Provider,"Well, that means a lot for you to still have to deal with very stressful."
14549.0,Patient,"i've tried and tried and tried to get the girls away from him and. Get met as minimal of contact as possible, like supervised visitation it got to that point but there's just something about him when we go to court. That our mediator she's just overlooking and I don't know if it's because he's so charming like I don't know what it is, but he's still that's visitation. kids. our youngest not our oldest she. She sees the people to she's kind of like me she's a people pleaser so she goes with dad because she knows he'll throw fit if she says she doesn't want to go in our youngest she's very hard headed she says, I don't want to go. with him. and show like she used to kick and scream she does she's older now so she doesn't do that but."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Well, I got like a complicated situation with a lot of layers so it's really good, you have a therapist that you're working with you know regularly to talk out some of this is that some of what you work on in therapy."
14549.0,Patient,"I like I said, it should be, it should be, but I get to like my weekly stressors or you know things that come up like just any little thing like. Our dog drives me crazy and that's kind of what I talked to last about my therapist she keeps. she thinks i'm ADHD. So she tries to keep me on track as much as possible, but I just be are awful lot. Those things. The layers."
383.0,Provider,Leave with regards to these legal issues you're having with your your ex husband and the at the impact on your kids I think would be a really good thing to work on in your individual therapy. and talking about that kind of an exploring. You know how your kids are doing and maybe what you can do to help them.
14549.0,Patient,"We did a little bit today talk about that my youngest she's very. I know filter. she's amateur for her age, she actually was held back because of that."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so I just wanted, I need to get through a few other things, so I just want to make sure I do that with regards to your medical. Your health status, are there any other medical issues that you've had to deal with other than the code. In history of any other medical problems or chronic pain."
14549.0,Patient,"No, no okay."

14549.0,Patient,"There, and I have usually like wants to go to the bathroom but i'm only up for like 2030 minutes that's going to the bathroom getting a drink of water and then going back to sleep."

But I have, I have been eating a little more than usual. In the last couple."
383.0,Provider,"i'm imagining that you're are you exercising right now, or or not because of the shortness of breath okay."
14549.0,Patient,"I got told I went to my doctor's yesterday, and he told me. To start walking a little more and to start because I have a gym membership and I don't I don't have active coven so he's he told me to start doing. Like light cart light Cardio so that's been an issue to the eating and not being able to exert or work any of it off because that was my. Prior. Okay."

Gradually, you know do a little bit more walking and you know that you're at being seen medically and follow that's a good thing. yeah yeah um do you feel like you've got a group of friends and community of people in your life that are supportive and there for you."
