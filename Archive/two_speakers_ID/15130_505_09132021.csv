Right um so it's it's just chemical it's not. Yours there's no euphoria to it, what so ever you are probably going to need a quite a low dose a low ish dose.

15130.0,Patient,it's only thing i've ever seen was orange.
505.0,Provider,"Okay let's actually i'll go with tablets you've seen those before this is how it's gonna work okay you're probably leader pretty low dose, so I am going to prescribe these but I need for you to cut them in half okay. So your first dose we don't want you to go into precipitated withdrawals, you know what that is. No that's it when you take a medicine too soon and you're not in full withdrawal in your body kind of. goes goes into withdrawal fast I don't think that's going to happen with you, however, I want you to split this pill and take half of it when you pick it up okay. you're done with work for today correct. Yes, okay very good I think they are going to feel better pretty soon, and then in the morning, my suggestion is that you take half a tablet in the morning. And then have her tablet in the evening. This part so important Tony, this is not a pill like percocet. You cannot swallow this pill, if you swallow it, it is. not effective, you have to kind of put it under your tongue. Like to basically and let it absorb, so we need you to put out under there and don't smoke don't eat don't drink water just let it absorb. Okay, you might have a headache you might have a little bit of a stomach ache, especially at first that's just the medicine being absorbed do you have any questions about that part."
15130.0,Patient,How long does it take to dissolve usually.
505.0,Provider,"You know, it takes, I would say, less than 10 minutes, but I want you to give it a solid 20 so that it absorbs completely and you're able to get all the medicine Okay, do you smoke."
15130.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
505.0,Provider,"Okay, how much he's smoke can now."
15130.0,Patient,Pack a day.
505.0,Provider,"Okay, just don't smoke when this is in your mouth. go, because that will interfere with getting the full effect of it. Go okay um I would love for you to take your first dose tonight is your wife home with you."

We don't know my dose most people who come to me take a whole lot more than you take, so I don't know what to protect them says, but we'll work together we'll figure it out. And then, if you want to go off it. will cut down. Okay. Do you have any questions Tony."
15130.0,Patient,No.
