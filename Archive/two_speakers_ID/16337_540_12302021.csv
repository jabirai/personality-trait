540.0,Provider,"So tell me how the holiday went how did your wife, like her present."
16337.0,Patient,"She actually cried so yeah so it was good. We figured we were going to start it next year, like you know new beginnings type thing. So we're gonna. figure it out, you know at least once or twice a month, where they we can do, one of those things with you know, like. and make sure that if it's one of those ones where you have to find a babysitter or kind of have that in advance. yeah so Thankfully it was it went well and then I bought a little camera to little polaroid camera. So you guys can take pictures yeah So hopefully hopefully that'll be good."
540.0,Provider,"And, did you guys talk about taking some time for yourself to be able to."
16337.0,Patient,"I kind of brought it up. But nothing really has been set in stone, especially because of you know, like the holidays and and all of that, and then we go up to mount shasta Presidents day weekend. So I mean for me that's always. You know. Just to be a nature it's always good. But yeah I mean other than that it's. it's been Okay, a little stressful you know with finances and stuff but. Just because I wasn't working for a while and then add hasn't gotten back to me, which is annoying."
540.0,Provider,"Oh, they happen."
16337.0,Patient,But you know it's okay that's you know we always tend to figure it out.
540.0,Provider,"And I mean so with work right now were you able to talk to work about your intentions of wanting to. Do something more. Or, I know you said that there's only so much you can do, but."
16337.0,Patient,"um you know, so we had the holiday party thing and. It just it felt right, you know, like it felt good it felt like it was like a family. The person that I was going to be replacing her and her husband came and you know everyone everyone was just like super super Nice and chill we all laughed we did like painting and stuff. So it was pretty cool I mean. So I guess like it kind of outweighs some of that you know not. Getting the surgeries and stuff. But I did I was able to talk to the doctor and. And we, you know this year he's really pushing to do more surgeries which is. Which is good because he he knows that. You know i'm like i'm top notch when it comes to surgery and. So you want someone who's already experienced and has had it, you know, in the past."
540.0,Provider,I mean you could be like that perfect motivator for him.
16337.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean he was pretty amazed of like when we had the conversation about going into surgery. And just my knowledge of instruments, and you know procedures and things like that so. He kind of he was left in all so I told him I was like you know, this is what i've done this is my passion, so you know, to push you in the right direction, I think we can make a good team so. Thankfully, that worked out. yeah. um. I wasn't able to see my grandparents, though, for the holidays, which kind of kind of sucks my grandma was. battling cancer, and so we all as a family my like here with the kids. We all got sick. So, even though we were coven negative we didn't want to you know because their immune system was low. We didn't want to. You know, put her in jeopardy or at risk, so we didn't go see them, but we did go see my mom. The next day so Christmas Day and then Christmas Eve, we spent with my wife's family, which is you know it was cool. But now for new year's you know I don't know what we're gonna do because we have to take the dogs I didn't want to leave them outside and my youngest Luna she'll tear out the entire House, if we ever for unattended for more than like an hour or two. So new years we don't know what we're gonna do just yet. Just because it's it's like pouring here."
540.0,Provider,"Well, what do you guys usually do for new years."
16337.0,Patient,"We go to each other's families, and then we just kind of like rotate back and forth, so I think last year, we did we we actually did the whole new year. at her house or at her mom's house, so I think next year we're going to switch it where we're going to go to her house first and then we'll go into the new year, and my mom's or my grandparents okay. So yeah. How was your holidays."
540.0,Provider,that's good.
16337.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"yeah the kids there are more I mean they're older a little bit older now that they finally somewhat got like the Santa thing, but like they understood, a little bit of the concept not really. yeah they're excited to see the now understand the gifts, though, like why they're in the living room but."
16337.0,Patient,"ya know my. So when we left for Christmas Eve, you know, we had the presence kind of scattered in in the closet and stuff and so before we left. My wife ran back inside to kind of put everything underneath this tree that when we got home my youngest would be like oh my God and I came and it was funny. But yeah I mean. that's been about it, I mean. I do feel more tired I don't know if it's because I started taking well, I was off the naltrexone for a couple days, and so, when I finally got my prescription and I got back on and i've been like today, for example, today I slept until. 12 yesterday I slept until one you know, so it makes me extremely tired. So i'm."
540.0,Provider,"ended, I mean you were on it before did it make you tired before."
16337.0,Patient,"You know I wasn't I didn't really notice it because I was, I had to wake up early for work and stuff. And then, of course, you know, a ton of coffee in the morning. And that would get me through the day and then by the time I got home, I was just hanging out with the kids or you know, taking a dogs on a run or something, and you know, by the time I lay down of by then i'm like oh yeah i'm tired i'm exhausted. I mean."
540.0,Provider,So you do not have work yesterday and today.
16337.0,Patient,Oh yeah no i'm off this entire week.
540.0,Provider,"So maybe there's also that aspect where your body is like Okay, I can sleep."
16337.0,Patient,"In yeah but see that's the thing I both my wife and I we just find it. it's. it's kind of scary that I sleep this much because i'm i'm an early bird and i've always been an early bird like you know I can go to sleep at 123 in the morning and still get up at six and start doing whatever I need to do around the House. But now for the life of me I can't get up. You know, like I woke up, I think I woke up like I release eight and. You know, I was I woke up because my wife's alarm was going off and she needed to go a while she needed to clock in and stuff, and so I woke her up, but then as soon as I woke her up and she was on ready, you know to to work or whatever I like knocked back out."
540.0,Provider,"Well, and I mean, so you had, I mean you had a high amount of stress the past I mean through the holidays ads on the stress the financial stress. You had the prescription to yeah some changes happened that your body may also just trying to be working through yeah I can see how many hours is that total so how how like wondering when have you been going to bed."
16337.0,Patient,"So, for example, last night I think I went I did go to sleep kind of late, I went to sleep, I was catching up on my shows. So I think I went to sleep, maybe like midnight. And then I woke up like nearly one yeah yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Do you guys have I mean have you were you trying to get up though so did you have any type of alarms going on, do you have."
16337.0,Patient,"It was just it was just my wife's alarm. And I know she needed to get up to you know for work and stuff so I kind of woke her up. And then I was like okay i'm gonna get i'm gonna start getting ready to you know I just got a ton of wood. So I gotta like chop it up and smaller pieces, so I was like okay i'm I get up and I started doing that, so I can have the rest of the day to kind of just chill. And then it's like 32 degrees right now or in the morning when we get up, so I was like okay i'm just gonna you know kind of roll in bed for a little longer to try to warm up and then I just knocked out. So that's I think that's what's kind of. I guess like in the back of my mind is kind of like scaring me because I don't want to be overly sleeping you know, or like to do too much with the sleep, even those probably the best thing i've gotten in 30 almost 32 years so."
540.0,Provider,"I think, giving yourself a little bit more credit to, though, because you only have these few days off every so often. And you've been go go go and you've been trying to make sure that everything is all squared away that. it's okay to also have like that self care and sometimes it's sleeping in and sometimes it's getting too much sleep. And there's plenty of days that you don't get enough sleep."
16337.0,Patient,"yeah and it's I mean it's funny because I was telling my wife, today I was like I started a new show. That my wife was just like constantly begging me to watch and I was like I don't know and then, finally I got into it, and she you know it's called Vikings."
540.0,Provider,Vikings yeah.
16337.0,Patient,"yeah and she was like it's so gruesome I don't even know why even you know started watching this with you and i'm like well now i'm like in the fourth episode and i'm like i'm sorry i'm i've been watching this all day so. yeah so you know today was kind of like my lazy day and. I told her, I was like dang I feel weird because I. Like I haven't done anything I gotta get this oh for our Christmas party we did like white elephants. And I ended up getting this like weighted blanket but it's like a snuggies so it has a hood and then it's got yeah so it's like i've just been i've been wearing that. And then I started a fire and so like we just been just been watching TV all day and then. Right now, my wife was just like whoa I don't feel like cooking so let's just grab something to eat and so yeah we went we got some chick fil a and then. yeah that was that was it our dinner, and as soon as i'm done here i'll probably go fold some laundry and or at least help because she doesn't like the way I fold so. yeah and then just continue watching TV I guess till I fall asleep."
540.0,Provider,"So I think what I should say is enjoy the slow time Jose just enjoy this how many days you have off and, obviously, if it became a habit, where you are missing work and you weren't getting up for work and the sleep start impacting your life. By next few days, if you're able to get that sleep in that rest your body your mind probably needs it. Okay, a little bit more credit, though it may be so careful but it's it's just sleep it's also it probably means."
16337.0,Patient,"yeah no, I know I in you know. it's just it's it's for me it's still kind of hard to wrap my mind around that. Because like you said i'm always go go go when. I don't you know, like I don't remember the last time I ever really slept in so that's why I was like oh crap like Is it the medication or is their mind taking it wrong or am I taking too much you know. And that's."
540.0,Provider,kind of like dang dang dang. or something and sometimes it's just it's also as we get older and we do need more sleep too so. we're not always going to be able to go go go oh.
16337.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah I think that yeah so I mean.
540.0,Provider,"Well, and the kids I mean aren't they office school this week, too."
16337.0,Patient,"yeah so you know oh yeah I mean, even with the kids like these past few days, even though we've we've all woken up kind of late. You know i've been taking I take my daughter to target and then you know we just go and do stuff just get out of the House just because it's raining so we can't really do much. But then we went and got like a bunch of painting stuff and then. Yesterday I painted a Mickey Mouse. Which my wife made fun of but. um yeah so like the kids you know they they all picked out their own thing and we I covered the whole dining room table with. Like that painters plastic tape. And we just you know we just tired yeah went out and just did her own thing and then. yeah so trying to keep them. entertained, I guess, and not on the electronics all day has been has been kind of tough to."
540.0,Provider,"Once yes parenthood's a lot of work, especially and you never know like until like they're not at school and then you're their home full time you're like okay."
16337.0,Patient,"Exactly i'm like. You know I tell the kids hey. let's play a board game, or all you know what actually I gotta. have to run the target. I found a new game is called. Is it, I think it's called what the meme."
540.0,Provider,i've heard of what I mean yeah.
16337.0,Patient,"yeah so it's not. it's not like vulgar or anything you know, like there's some like a the game called a new phone who's this."
540.0,Provider,I don't know that.
16337.0,Patient,"OK, that one. it's like in you get an inbox and then you know you read out the inbox. And it's supposed to be like a text message, and you have a bunch of responses. So some of them are a little like I had to go through all of them, because they talk about like sex and and like boobs, and all this other stuff so. I had to go and remove all that but playing that with the kids now I wanted to try what the mean because you know it just it looks hilarious."
540.0,Provider,i've heard good things about what to me. Okay yeah. But i've heard good things.
16337.0,Patient,Okay yeah so I want to try to get that because it's I think it's still going to be raining for the next couple days yeah so just trying to play something with the kids.
540.0,Provider,i'm glad that you guys are enjoying time like together and with the kids.
16337.0,Patient,"Oh, we def I mean we definitely need to get away from that. Right now, you know it's yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Absolutely. So when are you guys supposed to be going so President say you're supposed to be going as adjust you guys, or is the."
16337.0,Patient,"kids know it's the kids and we try to do a big family thing. And it's kind of like a little tradition, we go up to blass in national park. And so we just you know, we take the dogs and we rent like an airbnb. close by, and then we do like a full day of snow and like skiing and. You know just sledding and stuff let the dogs run around. And then we kind of go sightseeing we voted, like the waterfalls and stuff. But it's a whole family thing, so we. I guess the adults, not the adults, but like yeah I would say, like the older adults stay in 111 house and then like the cousins and the younger adults saying another house. And so we kind of go and do our own thing. But that's usually the time where I like. Since i'm so close I can just you know when the kids are eating, or something like that I can just kind of walk out. And just go for like a 20 minute hike just by myself."
540.0,Provider,And how long do you guys usually stay.
16337.0,Patient,i'm usually we go Friday through Monday. So a couple days. And it's you know it's pretty fun so it's good for the kids to kind of get out in nature and stuff. But I don't know how it's going to be this year since it's gonna be so packed with snow. um it's gonna be weird yeah.
540.0,Provider,It doesn't usually have snow like.
16337.0,Patient,"As, though. Like i'm were reading I don't know if you know we're reading is. No okay. Well it's like North northern California. So reading is like a little city right before shasta mountain. and So it's like a good maybe hour before you get up to the mountain."
540.0,Provider,"And then I mean, so you guys. Stay so you guys stay at the mountain right. yeah okay."
16337.0,Patient,"So yeah and then, when we stay there. yeah like I said we just kind of do our own thing and we go up to like the actual mountain. For like a day and it's like the entire family would take a family picture. And so we have a bunch of them from the previous years and stuff so we always keep one for every year and then. And then the next like couple days like we just do our own thing everyone kind of or every little family that's in the entire big family does their own thing. yeah."
540.0,Provider,"it's nice traditions, to have. You know I. don't see a lot of people do traditions anymore."
