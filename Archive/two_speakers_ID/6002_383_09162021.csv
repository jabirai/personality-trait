6002.0,Patient,"Good how was um I wasn't sure if I was meeting up with you today or tomorrow, so I was like I checked in with the right heart health people and yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, yes I didn't see your email till this morning i'm generally not in on Wednesdays so. If you ever emailed me on a Wednesday probably won't get a response right."
6002.0,Patient,"I feel like I should just have this on my reminder because it happens, like every time like oh like I know it's on Thursday and i'm like. yeah it's more saw myself."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, how things been going you're still at your department i'm seeing that you're."
6002.0,Patient,"The same place i've just been looking around for. I think last time we talked I wasn't sure about like studio or living with people but yeah. i'm gonna i'm. i'm looking at i've been looking like crazy for studios I found a few places that I possibly like. that's like crazy because there's like I was thinking about today there's like one I saw that was. 1650, but they were offering one month for free and it lowered it down to like 1512. And now, at first, this is what I was originally looking there's like one of the like the first apartment I looked at, because it was too in there, and this was like a one bedroom I originally went there for like a studio and it was 1450 and I was like no I look. There was two hours like Nick facing a wall and i'll say this is awful like no I got it I got my standard a little bit. And then they're like Oh, we have a one bedroom two it's 1650 and was like okay i'll just look at it just to look at it. And it was just nicer House like on the fourth floor like overlooking it's like on the like nob hill area think overlooking it's on the Hill, but like it was pretty nice post sale at 1650 it's a little bit of my price range. They also offer one month for free like you just do it and they're like Okay, with the whole thing came out to like 1512 but now that i'm. This was like I think like two weeks ago was like right when I finished talking with you like, I was like just started looking at stuff like actually going. And now, like that's more or less the rate and i'm not sure if I can say, but I just was thinking about today i'm like Fuck that guy. Like I should have took that one like you know it's I guess that's like one thing i've just been having issues with is like like that's like so much money you know i'm paying 1125 here but it's for its three other people, but there's one be by myself. And I guess like that's what i've been having a little bit of issue with is it's it's going to be closer to school and everything but it's like like it's like 400 400 something maybe a per month extra you know, please. yeah."
383.0,Provider,um are you weighing the pros and cons of having your own place versus sharing a place again.
6002.0,Patient,"Well, and that's. that's why, like, I feel like that's like something i'm swallowing still but if you're like just digesting it there's a kind of a God it's it's a lot of money, but I do see the pros and. The pros of living alone like I pretty much was running this full fucking building like people call the landlord calling me being in charge of Baba Baba you know and also other people. Like before. yeah. yeah."
383.0,Provider,See you feel like you can afford the additional. cost.
6002.0,Patient,"Yet like now that i'm working as a waiter and, like, I made the budget from our my like financial projections, or whatever you know, because the waiters like. It goes up and down, depending on how it is, but more or less yeah like I would be for months, like working three days like for four hours a day like Wednesday, Thursday. Saturday i'd make more or less like around $2,000 a month just in that like with tips and everything more or less like 800 and $100 for sure, at least, just like wages and then tips more or less around there. I can afford it, I guess it's just like more so myself like I don't know why, like i've had this thought like. The fact that like saying this to my family like told me because I was told anyone i'm moving is kind of like I feel like it's like. The back of my head like are you spending the money correctly, because I also am thinking of selling my car I don't really use my car, especially like over there, like. it's like really close to stuff and I guess just more of a hassle with parking over here it's like two week parking over there it's a hassle just to find parking and then you have to move it every week, you know it's like something else, like."
383.0,Provider,"Right so you're thinking about selling your car i'm. Okay, now, what is the dilemma about tell me a little bit more about what you're saying with regards to what you're going to tell your parents."
6002.0,Patient,"What I feel like. I guess it's like more so with myself too it's like the spending money correctly like I kind of see as an investment being closer. That we can go home more like like over here that's pretty far like on bike like pretty like hustling it's like 2530 minutes, maybe, but that's like and just show up like kind of sweating so that's like my thing is like I kind of want to start dressing up nicer you know, like. Big right. you're wearing like like. I guess like a more professional wrath and like I would I would wear like cycling clothes, or whatever like workout clothes, to get to school and then change in the parking lot. Like into like dress clothes and then going in school and then coming out genuine workout clothes and then going back like it's like."
383.0,Provider,Right right right.
6002.0,Patient,Oh.
383.0,Provider,yeah so it sounds to me like you know it's important in this next year for you to have a more efficient. Work home living situation.
6002.0,Patient,exactly like. Last year I was like I just need to get in San Francisco and like cheap rent like it's coven. But I feel like now it's like a different stage it's like okay well codes kind of chilling out a little bit it looks like stuffs opening up there's gonna be on campus more and like so yeah like efficiencies like definitely a thing.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm spending the money. That extra money for the tour will need to do for rent then there's this other part of you, it sounds like that is kind of has a flavor of your family, maybe thought processes as well, of kind of asking or looking at you know, are you living economically, are you."
6002.0,Patient,"exactly like Am I. Drinking the Kool aid kind of thing like Camilo you live like in sanford I guess it's like more so. Like right here i'm I don't want say far but it's like not close enough like it's far enough. You know, to me it's like significant enough for I can feel it where I live, if I go back home like it's a bitch to come once I leave like go to downtown like financial district that area where my schools that I i'm not I don't do two trips usually in a day."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. It makes perfect sense to me why you want to live closer to your school. And it seems like that's what what. The thrust of your need is there and your you know your desire to have a more efficient back and forth from your home to. Your school. So. that's a decision that you, you need to sort of plant your feet on and say that's my decision that's what i'm choosing from my life, and this is my money, and I can do, what I want with my money. You know."
6002.0,Patient,"I guess it's also like the places i've been looking at to like their studios like the one place, I was like leaning towards a lot like it's it's pretty close to like Union square it's like two blocks from Union square like it's pretty close. Like the financial district, and like that area like nob hill. And like it's not like the most up to date, but it's like what I mean it's I lowered it down to 1550 and it comes with like the the Murphy bed thing. Like you know, like it has like a somewhat good layout and it's on the fourth floor or something. But. I guess it's like kind of accepting to like this is what I can afford right now, you know what I mean like. Like I feel like this apartments nicer than the one I have over there, but that's like the pros and cons of being in that area of like those those apartments I mean unless you pay some good. Like that's more or less what you're going to get besides the one I saw. I was seriously just thinking I just randomly thought about that one today, I was like fucking like kicking myself in the foot, I was like God damn I should just fucking bit the bullet for that, when I was 1650 with the free months like. i'm. being too i'm just having a tough choice with his are tough like decision is like when I saw this place, when I was coming to San Francisco when I was barely been Davis, remember that whole transition, oh no."
383.0,Provider,I mean.
6002.0,Patient,"When I saw this place, I was like Okay, this is the one boom i'll fucking front to like I don't even have roommates and I just. jumped on it, and like bit and then like swallowed it Okay, this is it the thing is like I haven't really found anything, yet that. That i'm like oh my God, there was like one that was 1350 and it was an exit chinatown like in China town like upstairs of a supermarket and I was like okay like this one's pretty all right, but. I don't know I feel like. In terms of like wow, this is the one like the one that was 1650. well. The one I felt the most excited on. But I was a. Budget like this was like when I started looking, but then I was like but I gotta up my money like I can't spend fuckin 1300 dollars on the student like i'm not going to get anything night like tender line, maybe. You know right."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, you may not be completely thrilled about it it's you know or. feel like it's worth the extra money. rents are expensive in San Francisco now they're getting that way outside of San Francisco too, but. it's temporary I mean this is a you know you can think of it as this is meeting my needs for the efficiency of being closer to school it's palatable enough and. Therefore i'm going to go for it, it may not be a total like yes yay like this is awesome moment you know."
6002.0,Patient,"Well, I guess that's it."
383.0,Provider,"will be good enough, you know, sometimes things are good enough they're not they're not."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, that that and that's why i've been like having like such a tough time like I feel like i've been down on on like just like. it's a transitional period, like it's going to be a different thing like and i'm just like kind of. I don't know like it lights, the fire and he's my ass like Okay, this is all I can afford right now but it's also kind of like it's like a double edged sword i'm like Okay, this is all I can afford right now kind of thing. And that's why i'm kind of just like. Okay, like Am I putting my time correctly like with this race coming up, you know what I mean like I guess they made me think of like. Am I doing the right things like to financially set myself up like spiritually like I feel like i'm on like a pretty you know, like easy going and everything like optimistic and everything. In terms of financial of it Okay, is my finances in check that's what made me like think a lot more where i'm not like I don't want to I don't like this feeling of kind of having to do so much fucking research and like kind of like living with like. With strings it's it's weird because that's a the race coming up in October 2."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6002.0,Patient,"I don't know I feel like physically i'm like more or less there but mentally i'm like okay. i'll fucking i'll put strings on my feet, if my ankles break or something I mean like kind of all prepare myself ready like i'm ready to keep going till I get disqualified if I don't make it or whatever."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6002.0,Patient,"Finances i'm a little bit more like Okay, I need to put more research into that like you know I could my energy into that I feel like that's like the one thing that made me realize with living by myself. If that does that make sense."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so what i'm hearing you say i'll just repeat it back to you and you tell me if this is accurate. i'm hearing you say is that, in certain domains of your life you feel like you're doing well, your for yourself, for your own satisfaction and in the domain of finances, you would like to be doing better. You like to be to be able to afford more it a place that you really wouldn't be excited to be it at and that it wouldn't strap you financially so financially you'd like your. Financial life to be healthier and and and a little more robust. And so you're wondering, am I, putting enough energy into making that happen. You know i'm putting a lot of energy into making this marathon happen i'm putting a lot of energy into other things you know and i've got a lot of motivation and drive but do I have, am I, putting attention enough attention into maybe your career or or you know your financial ambitions."
6002.0,Patient,"Exactly that's that's seriously what i've been like just sitting with like it's kind of like okay. Like let's kind of way 11 so it's just like to like let's say like another waiter like a part time job like to another way to job because i'm like Okay, I have to be gone October 2. So, like if they asked if I would say start another job, and then I already asked for a Saturday off like a whole weekend off like it's kinda like Okay, whereas right now. I can ask one of my co workers and help cover me, so I guess that's like The thing is, they kind of."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think. If you don't mind me saying I think your awareness of this topic and you're kind of chewing on, it is a good thing. And I think that maybe you can give yourself okay well i've signed up for this marathon so let me just go ahead and do it, and you know get that accomplished when I get back i'm going to really like kind of really start. honing in you know, on this on this other side of my life on this other domain, you know which is my financial my. Health and my you know what is that robust enough for me well."
6002.0,Patient,"Oh, I guess i'm. Hearing you say that it kind of made me think about like the let's say like that number I don't have it up yet, because I haven't put it up from Europe. But that little that little paper that has like okay run five miles run six miles run 20 miles Saturday, you know, like as like the list like kind of like that. pretty good at doing that for like workouts and stuff but in terms of finances and like like financial like that type of stuff like I want a career, I have like one thing for. Like the certification programs being I was going to do in December, but I just decided not to do it because didn't seem like worthwhile, but I guess doing something similar to that like I it kind of made me shine light on my okay. Like how i'm doing this for working out I can shine the light and then do this for something else to you know I mean not so much don't work out but do this somewhere else to."
383.0,Provider,"Now, have calls."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah exactly goals in different areas, because I feel like by now are working on like oh yeah frickin boom run a marathon right now and i'll do it. with other stuff i'm like. Like I might really bitching about like another hundred dollars a month or like $200 a month that's what made me think like in the Grand scheme of things like it's not that much incorrect in terms of like. The value i'll get with like a nicer place where i'm more comfortable have more space where i'm not like fucking cluster because I saw places i'm like Oh, I can make this work i'm like dude it's a fucking closet like it. Has like that I like a good thing, like, I told Sophie because I was almost like oh Fuck yeah like as a living room area and, like a walk in bathroom like separated. With like, and I can put the bed in the closet and she was like isn't it going to be dark and the window is claustrophobic. And for me, I was like oh yeah like it's it'll be okay, but as I sat there like no that's fucking right like what the Fuck like. I don't know it's kind of like made me realize like my standards for myself might do I don't want to live in a plucking closet like it's not so much like she's like Camilo like don't do that it's like more so I was telling myself like Camilo what the Fuck like no. But if I like and I was all about it, but then I sat with it a little bit I was like no this. kind of video with the fucking like walls all over you know."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, and. Oh, my gosh I have been in. rooms like that. And it's kind of like I remember, I went to Barcelona to visit a friend and she put me on her guest room, you know which, which was like a tiny little room and then the window that existed, you know there's apartments in Europe, where you have a window but it's to this like long you know. Like the bathrooms all have."
6002.0,Patient,dessert or.
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah the. court or in the apartment so so okay well it's basically a window into like. An empty, and it was and I thought to myself, you know also assessing Okay, when I have a home when I have a place, I, and I have guests, you know I really would like them to actually go into a room that's rather pleasant to you know. Where they're not wishing in between, you know yeah so that's kind of like this sort of self assessment of like, how do you want to. sketch out your life, you know and and and how do you want to be living day to day, because those will be day to day experiences, you know when you wake up in the morning you're going to be. You know, do you have a window just just even small small is good but it's like does it have some aesthetics that are uplifting. well."
6002.0,Patient,"that's what made me really because, like a huge thing with the studio is unlike I still want to even i'm going to go myself. it's not like i'm pushing people away it's like I still want to have people over like i'm still gonna have people think you know, like having a kitchen. Like enough space to have people over and like oh let's have a dinner party at my place not too fucking people, but you know, like five or something you know, like my close friends. that's like a huge thing that i'm just like kind of swallowing i'm like still kind of like Okay, I want to do this, I mean they have to have a bigger place Okay, so I have to put more money in there, you know it kind of made me just. I don't know it just like you're hitting it spot on reassessing like what are my priorities what am I, my standards like before you really go fucking. Like sleep wherever like my family it's like kind of like oh it's a fucking you know cheap cheap as possible, no matter what. i'm like i'm like bro i'm i'm always gonna have to fucking masters in business, you know I mean i'm not saying like kind of the chickens before they hatch but i'm like. it's kind of like. I don't know like if you have a higher standard for yourself, you find a way to make the rent and like for other stuff you know I mean it's not so much like pretentious but it's like kind of having a standard for yourself like clean it might have a clean place a place that."
383.0,Provider,"Right and that standard has a you know there's a point where it gets sort of out of it's sort of excessive like but there's also a point where it's really about feeling a sense of brightness you know when you wake. up, and you know feeling kind of good you know when you're moving through your living space, you know."
6002.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah like yeah like is this is kind of like that it's not so much like Oh, I need fucking Granite countertops and brand new for it, you know not that it's like more so, just like the split like the vibe like you know, like. yeah let's let's years you've been on my mind like this BAT like sense of Europe like since I started looking places that's like. So I feel like i've been up and down kind of like all this place like it's like you said it's like the traditional ways like once I find the place, I know it's gonna be good but i'm. just keep going that's that's like my mentality was just a lot of stuff going on and i'm just like."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah looking for housing is. Is. there's just this aspect of the unknown, you know you don't have control like Okay, this is this is what's available, let me just go and look and. And then there's. These other variables of like putting in your application before someone else and how is it going to it's sort of like a cosmic gambling thing you know."
6002.0,Patient,"So, as long as you're in the game, as long as you're."
383.0,Provider,"In it, you know going looking assessing and then jumping on something when you see it, you know. Then it'll work out."
6002.0,Patient,"Well, I remember talking less than like if you feel like you like it bite the bullet like get it and that's why I literally today, when I was thinking I would meet up with you, I just ran it just ran the cable my thought like fucking like that one that was 1650 like God damn it like. It i'm not much of a guy like Oh, I should have done this and that, but today, this morning I was late for like an hour I was like damn I could have saved me so much trouble I could have been chillin she was ready to go looking boom."
383.0,Provider,"Now i'm just like right. Right so that's a lesson, maybe to kind of. Keep in your back pocket that. You know when it seems like the opportunity is there and it's looking good you know do your assessment and then and then go after it kind of thing. And the next thing that will come toward you, you will take that you won't take that opportunity."
6002.0,Patient,"Exactly, I still like i'm here until like the first I mean I prefer to leave before you know, like the like three days or so, because I have to leave for the race like it's like that one those like. Three four days. And then school starts with that Monday so it's like as a move out to the fucking race school starts, like all in four days."
383.0,Provider,"yeah So what are you doing to prepare now for your move because you know you need to move, and so, in terms of like are you boxing things up, I mean you can start to do prep stuff so you can make that that time easier on yourself."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I should start boxing stuff up to yeah because I was looking at my books like yes yesterday, two days ago say oh I should probably start. You know, getting stuff ready so it's like kind of easy yeah i'm not gonna wait until the day. Like the day before, and then get the U haul and everything I even thought about getting that you already too, but it's that like I said it's a cosmic thing, where I have to make sure it's ready my apartments ready."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so. But, like in the evenings I mean if you spent a couple days, looking at places in the evenings when you can come home, I mean even the act of going and getting good boxes is. A step, you know I mean I just moved, so I, and I did it I did it all, I mean, I made the arrange you know I just did every single step of it. And one of the important steps was getting good boxes and those ones that have like can't. It makes your life so much easier and they only they don't cost that much home depot whatever you can get boxes that have those handles so they're not just like cardboard box that you lift from the bottom, but they have actually little handles in them it's a game changer."
6002.0,Patient,where'd you go to home depot.
383.0,Provider,"home depot or lowes, but if you you just when you're looking at the boxes I don't know how to describe it to you, but."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah they do have handles like built in, I think, on the side."
383.0,Provider,"yeah they just have like a little cut opening you know and and and then like you know small, medium and if you need to probably not large but. Men just but just getting those that have that the handles you know and just getting a been grabbing five of them, bringing them home and start boxing a PR stuff labeling it labeling is so excellent for efficiency. Get get a good black marker and you know right on it books, you know, so we do yeah. spices."
6002.0,Patient,spices.
383.0,Provider,Your own spices and yeah.
6002.0,Patient,yeah I mean that's the fucking thing right now it's kind of just like the rain and i'm like I know as soon as I get my place like it's gonna be like. it's good I mean that's just the booking process it's like kind of same as before last time we talked was like okay I didn't it's it's the uphill area right now right now it's just like kind of. Definitely.
383.0,Provider,"Right yeah yeah yeah the unknown. I mean, I remember going out and just driving up and down a couple of areas where I had seen apartments and you just you know going in and asking the questions and making the phone calls and and then a doorway opens you know. But there's sometimes some days when it's like. Nothing is about all okay just tomorrow i'll be back at that."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah what would help like the I guess like mentally with like the transitional piece like when you were like kind of like oh like I can't find anything, or you know I mean like what kind of kept you optimistic I guess."
383.0,Provider,"um. Well, for me, you know I kind of my faith is really helps me a lot but also like translating that to just staying calm in the moment you know breathing. and staying close to your supports to like if you have. You know, a friend your girlfriend you know meeting up with them at the end of the day, maybe having a bite to eat or you know. treat treating yourself well in the process like one I remember one day I was like in this moving. phase, and I think i'd gone out to get something and I was like you know I really want like this ice cream like there's a certain kind of ice cream, I was like craving. It was like what i'm going to stop and i'm going to get those. i'm going to get that treat you know and i'm going to get three and then have a treat in the middle of all this kind of chaos. and uncertainty so sometimes you know that could be an act of self care, too, because sometimes we forget to eat we're forgetting to drink where. we're just like so wrapped up in this pivotal moment where you know it is, it is pretty stressful. You know, moving is is it's not fun, you know carrying boxes is not fun packing. boxes, putting them in. Containers you all, I mean all of it is it's work, you know it's a lot of work. I don't know did that answer your question."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah no yeah like I feel like i've been like talking to Sophie a lot more like hanging out we've been seeing each other, a lot more, just like kind of the i've been reaching out saying was like my friend, oh no they're good friends i'm gonna talk to them. Probably today after work and same with my other friend like asking like hey man does it feel like it was like last year, the same time. When I broke up with my girlfriend time and, like I had this was going on and i'm like kind of i'm going to extend my hand and I hey man like Can we just talk, can I just like. run some things to you, and like I don't know it just helps get I get out your your mind a little bit kind of just like."
383.0,Provider,"and take taking a friend with you to look at apartments is also very could be a really nice way to get another sense of it and get that helpfulness you know I went with a friend to look at a place and. She was just like Oh, you know, this is really nice, and I mean, I had a lot of other situation of some really reluctance and not wanting to move and. yeah just seeing a nice place and also this person saying yeah this is. This is night here, you know helped boost. My mood so maybe it sounds like you're doing that, with your girlfriend bringing your girlfriend along."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah she she went to see the first one, and she really liked it the first was like wow it's pretty Nice."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6002.0,Patient,"I know that's something like I feel like i'm being such a fucking down or sometimes i'm just like oh no it doesn't have this it doesn't kind of like oh. You know kind of like do like a fucking like bitch like i'm like that's the thing like I feel like i'm having trouble like swallowing it kind of. usually go yeah that's like stick with something, but I feel like i'm having like kind of like we're like to see like boom that's the motherfucker like that's that's the one."
383.0,Provider,"You don't Thank you, you feel like you haven't. found a place that you like."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah like I mean the first time, the first one, the 1651 That was when I was like Okay, but the price. Right, I was only thing. I was like yeah it's on the Hill, I mean that's kind of a little bit of issue, but nothing crazy. But there's a price and but now that i'm realizing i'm like okay now I gotta I gotta fucking up my price a little bit of my my range before it was like fucking told hundreds of 1400 Am I am I gonna get shit with. You know 15 something ish. yeah yeah."
383.0,Provider,"So you've got your price up a little bit, and I mean some like we were saying before you walk into some places and it's like I don't like this i'm not. I mean, I did that, as well, and I was like had a conversation with my with a with a God saying you know, please, this is a no like i'm not you know you're not putting me in this kind of place no."
6002.0,Patient,"yeah. Where you're facing a fucking wall and you're like man i'm gonna be depressed this bucket in this book in place like i'm gonna live by myself with a fucking wally you know it's just like no man, no.
