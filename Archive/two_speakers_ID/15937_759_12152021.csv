759.0,Provider,Good afternoon.
15937.0,Patient,How are you.
759.0,Provider,hey. how's things been going.
15937.0,Patient,"There Okay, I think I figured out. Why lash out what."
759.0,Provider,Oh. What.
15937.0,Patient,"I don't have the capability of stopping when somebody says or said something rude makes me feel on heard or tries to blame me for something that I didn't actually do. I don't. pretty sure that stems from childhood I just can't remember where or why. I don't remember a lot of my life sucks. So that's great, but the problem is is I don't I don't have the ability to step back in the moment, which is what keeps getting in trouble making you lose. Job relationships like I said I don't pick up on social cues very well so like stuff that I can be completely joking about something and not pick up that it's inappropriate. And I don't know it's just and I know that my responses aren't always appropriate but one I don't like I don't like feeling like I can't speak my mind. yeah way that I want to because they're uncomfortable with it, so I understand that me speaking, the way that I do makes people uncomfortable which is fine that's their problem, not mine. But I still need to figure out how to not do that, so I don't lose jobs and stuff like that."
759.0,Provider,So that's what you figure out you do it because you feel unheard and you feel as though people are not listening to you. Or you feel not. yeah.
15937.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,Go ahead.
15937.0,Patient,"i'm pretty sure that stems from my childhood because, like my family purposely misunderstands least. One Thank God for technology, because that's how I started realizing that they actually are very, very manipulative because they take a lot of advantage of the memory issues that I have. And I started really noticing it when I actually started texting them and not talking to them in person or over the phone because they always have made me feel like i'm crazy. But. Now, because of technology and everything's like through text, I can actually read back on the conversation and it's always them that starts it, and then they do stuff they know I mean they're my family they know exactly how to trigger me. that's what they do, and then they make me feel like i'm the bad guy on the crazy one, because of course i'm reactive. And I couldn't for the longest figure out why I react to what I feel like is stupid stupid stuff the way that I do with these huge big ginormous emotions and I guess catching them in their manipulation kind of help me figure all that out."
759.0,Provider,No it's okay.
15937.0,Patient,"So that's how I feel anyway and they've told me i'm paranoid my whole life, so I feel like this is how things are, but at the same time, I doubt myself a lot too so i'm like Am I paranoid is, am I, making all of this up, do I just not remember things correctly. So that's where i'm at today."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. So just kind of like. You know, going back to thinking of Why do I tend to lash out why do you know my family members can push my brothers and sisters in a way, and i'm reactive and wanting to change your anger responses, you know, like you believe that you can change the anger responses or responses and people."
15937.0,Patient,"Yes, because i've had friendships and relationships, where there's never been any like arguing or. yelling or anything like that, so I know that I am perfectly capable of having normal relationships, where we can discuss things and nobody else and argues because i've had that before."
759.0,Provider,Good but.
15937.0,Patient,"For some reasons, from the time that I lost my kids up until these last couple of years that i've been on this this healing journey, I have been the total opposite of that been nothing but toxic relationships. losing jobs. Being homeless and just you know going through how losing my kids is just the worst it's it's a complete opposite of. How it was before I lost my kids. mm hmm it's like that that abusive relationship just completely. changed, who I am altogether if that makes."
759.0,Provider,sense yeah.
15937.0,Patient,"Like everything just got worse from that point from there, maybe. My kids yeah so. I know i'm capable of having a normal non argumentative relationships. and normal and holding jobs and stuff like that, but. Also, at the same time I change so much that whenever people trigger me I lash out really bad like that i've always done that, but now I noticed that I do what I didn't notice that i've done it before."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15937.0,Patient,"No, I noticed that I do it. And i'm not I don't know I got a lot going on here today."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you know this, that you do, but it's not enough to just know this that's what you're saying."
15937.0,Patient,"yeah it's like I have no brakes went in the mom like I said in the moment I was watching I watched this how to ADHD channel to help me understand my ADHD better. She said that the ADHD anger comes with not having breaks. and makes total sense it's like once because most of the time, I want to say 80% of the time. The conversations don't start out or the situation's don't start out in me lashing out it normally starts out me being very polite about it and asserting my boundaries and then my boundaries getting completely stepped on and then deny lash out. So it's a build up it's not like I just flat out start lashing out it's always a build up to it. But once I get mad I can't stop myself I can't take myself out of that situation and that's what gets me into trouble. And i'm not sure if it's just. People utilizing my reactive responses to make me feel like shit about myself. You know, like if I just do I just keep putting myself in shitty situations like with this company. From the day that I was brought on to that company people were highly disrespectful to me in the chat i've just been letting it go letting it go let it go and then, when I finally started responding. In the rude way back that's when all of a sudden, it became a problem and I got kicked out of that that company. it's just very confusing for me. Danny like Is this really a behavior that I have, or is this a behavior that I have when people are. This way or make me feel this way and I know i'm responsible for my own emotions. But also, I also know that I have a hard time controlling it, especially when i've already been polite. meant like it's like it's like when people ask you why are you mad when you're not mad and they just keep asking why you're mad until you eventually get so irritated that you flip out that's what it feels like. sense."
759.0,Provider,"process before you get mad you know, realizing if someone is not going to respect the boundary are not going to you know, keep on can she can see you know, like you know yourself, and you know these companies and what they do. and return to you know you respond in a way, like this, the one example you gave me of them, you know kind of like keeping contacting you are saying things into you explode it like you stop it before you get to that point."
15937.0,Patient,"we'll see I tried that I like specifically with this company I reported it several times. And they would kick these people out or whatever, but then it would happen with a new person and a new person it's mainly just dickhead guys who think that they're better than women those kind of guys, you know. And then it got to the point where I would start again started responding rudely back because. People. choose their own medicine yeah but, before you get to that point where you start to respond back."
759.0,Provider,"Pulling away and just ending you know the contract or just saying to yourself, this is not worth my time before you get that point."
15937.0,Patient,"I can start trying to do that, but."
759.0,Provider,"I know it's hard wanting to win the situation also, I believe stems from childhood because, like, I honestly."
15937.0,Patient,"The reason that i'm single and live by myself don't have friends, because I can't stand to argue I don't like."
759.0,Provider,People are.
15937.0,Patient,"yelling at what to do, or like they think certain things about me or weird and they try to like i'm just like I would rather not it's not to me it's not worth the energy because I always feel like shit afterwards and tired, especially if I, and I always cry. Every time. Because I cannot stand to argue, even with my daughter I tell her like I don't want to do this if we're going to argue, then you don't we don't need to be in the same space at this moment, because it's I can't fucking stand it. And then. I don't know there's so many things and I just I don't want to continue to not be around people because I don't like when people irritate me, I want to be able to deal with being irritated and not come off like a jerk. Even when i'm not trying to be a jerk. and You know, understand social cues because I were thinking about getting a job, but I am scared to because I don't want to like I really need to have some kind of stable income, so I don't want to. lash out at a real customer, I think I would be a lot more control over myself in in like a company setting than working for myself because online everybody's rude. it's a little different like not every customer is where you might get the random one route customer or something. Every so often, so I just. I think i'm going to try to do that it might help me to."
759.0,Provider,Have like stable income and and apply for that one job that. it's not working for yourself.
15937.0,Patient,"you're not going to continue to work for myself, but i'm going to take the stress off of myself financially because. working for myself allows me a lot of the freedoms that I need with the ADHD but it doesn't allow stability part that I issue with the ADHD and I think going back into some kind of regular work environment will also help me get back to be more professional maybe not lashing out. What they go F themselves anytime they say something rude."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15937.0,Patient,But I haven't worked at regular times. Where they're at.
759.0,Provider,yeah well you know do what's comfortable.
15937.0,Patient,going to feel comfortable is right for you.
759.0,Provider,"And you know, in a moment, like you feel I still like having stable income is more important than. You know, like. Being having your flexibility or you know it's more important than you know, having ADHD symptoms, from time to time, and you. want to have more stable, you know stable ability in your life, you know do what's right for you and what feels right, you know. And I think that will go a long way just learning to trust yourself and decisions that you're making."
15937.0,Patient,"it's hard 10 years is a long time to be trapped in like. I don't even know what. ptsd. Whatever the hell mindset that was it was terrible. It was like I couldn't take care of myself it's like I lost all ability to take care of myself for some reason. mm hmm and now i'm getting back to not necessarily how it was before all of that happen, but back into the the stable mindset that and I want to get back into the stable financial life that I had before all that happened. So. Also, I want to be able to make enough money to hire an attorney so I can see the living shit out of everybody that was involved in the CPS case in. My babies that are emotional trauma which i'm pretty sure that i'm allowed to because of again here doing this, instead of living a normal normal."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15937.0,Patient,"Well, positive at all when I just need to get I need to make the money to do so, somehow, I think that I don't necessarily know if that will. Give me the revenge that i'm seeking because, like I said I don't find it fair that they're just out walking around like they didn't do anything and totally suck up several people's lives. But if I could take them for everything that they have it might feel a little bit better."
759.0,Provider,"Am I making you feel a little bit better and while you get there when you get there in terms of having you know money available to sue you know them, or whatever you want to do you know never makes you feel like it could give you some. me know that he can't give you too much peace, but hopefully can give you, you know, like sorry about that and. give you some um what's the word. can give you some satisfaction or can you know, like you can feel as though by you know I did this, and I feel a little bit better I don't know if you feel better when you see someone, but your least key back. Someone Terry or you know. something you know from that."
15937.0,Patient,I just want to prove that.
759.0,Provider,They happen.
15937.0,Patient,"That yeah they're they're, the reason I take my kids and people should have stayed in jail for the rest of their life or what they did to him and the CPS is the reason that all of that happened to them, because they place them with him after I beg to them not to. mm hmm so. that's a lot man like the more that I think about it, what i've gone through the more that i've like it's it was an impossible situation from get go."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15937.0,Patient,And I have to try to be a little less hard on myself about.
759.0,Provider,"Yes, she do a little less hard on yourself about it. yeah so this week the kind of reflection has been how do I stop my anger responses and basically you also been playing around with the idea of. working full time for someone else. As well as. primarily been on your mind."
15937.0,Patient,part time not for.
759.0,Provider,Not for not full time part time.
15937.0,Patient,"or part time will be enough, because I don't have the normal bills, like everybody else does because I live in an rv so I don't have like bridge stuff like that part time would give me more than enough money to maintain the lifestyle that I may take now it's just. i'm running out of savings now I need something more stable just because I live in an older rv like to be prepared, you know, plus my daughter always."
759.0,Provider,"Does it always needs money yeah yeah but give her some money as well yeah Okay, so I think you have a good plan for yourself in terms of working part time for someone else, and you know, like. Being able to take to kind of work on your anger responses and your response time is going to take some work, you know it's not something that's going to happen overnight. And maybe we need to dive back into your childhood and figure out what happened, or what transpired, you know, and in order for you to to be the way that you are now in terms of like. How you respond. and react. But sometimes it just sounds like you just get really angry, because people are being really rude to you. it's not necessarily you know my immediate your immediate responses to washout it's like they keep on pushing buttons or someone pushes your buttons or they keep on. These people are escalating and and to the point where you kind of you know, one last show, so it just seemed like this, like it's an automatic response. is just that it went progressed. enough to, to the point that you reach that kind of like. You know. halt you know in our line in the sand you cross it because you know you feel a certain type of way about diet makes you angry or frustrated. yeah my you know, like. One could say something to you right now you're not then you're me as sponsors not going to be last two last child. But to kind of like be nice and polite as much as you can until you reach your breaking point."
15937.0,Patient,That. sucks.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so, as you know, like yeah you can figure out ways to kind of control that reaction also just to recognize this and give yourself a little self compassion that you're trying your best and when it comes to that. You know you're not really trying to be rude you know it's just when you reach your breaking point when someone is attacking you. You know that's when you want to lash out, you know it's not that you're a real person are. That. You know, like you have. All this anger you inside if you died comes out on people it's just that, when you reach your break."
15937.0,Patient,yeah and I think I think it has a lot to do with my childhood and my family and how they are towards but again there's a lot of stuff that I can't remember.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15937.0,Patient,"And, like, I know that I have, I have no impulse control issues badly that took a long time to fix."
759.0,Provider,To yeah.
15937.0,Patient,"And, like the whole. My family's always is always treat you like shit they blame it on like I stole some stuff when I was a teenager from the House like vcr and some tapes and stuff like I was dating it very much older guy and very much in love and just I was like 1617 years old, I was a kid. Anyway, it was stupid, it was literally, the only wrong thing I had ever done my entire childhood. And still to this day, they breaking for it still to this day, and every since I stopped responding to that now it's really up to shift, because you lost your kids. Even though I lost my kids because I was a domestic violence victim, not because it wasn't like cold weather or a druggie or how politics, because I wasn't db victim. yeah so they weaponize that trauma and then the whole situation like I said it was completely just. Nobody should have gone through what I went through and it just it wasn't a normal case by any means, so it was just like one thing after the other one. And that's how they are that's always i'm the pieces should especially if I call them out for anything that they do. At all that they always flip it around so it's like an entire family of Narcissus. Those are all habits that I want to unlearn any manipulation tactics I learned she survived, I want to because I don't feel like i'm in a survival state of mind I feel like i'm. A survivor state of mind and i'm ready to walk with my life."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15937.0,Patient,"And that's that's just from everything that I can remember again i'm still struggling with Am I just making these things up, but I possibly not be remembering it the right way. And i'll probably you know that as we go on with that script by right now. Remember full love my life and that's. Either a really good thing or if it happens to start coming up and might be a really, really. scary to think about it scary to think that I don't remember like over half my life that's. kind of shitty."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah this probably a very uncomfortable feeling, knowing that you don't remember you can't remember certain aspects about your life that might be important enough to remember, but also might be traumatizing as well, and also, it could be that, as you know, like. The fact that you know. Things can be are. You didn't remember certain things for a reason because they're traumatized."
15937.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15937.0,Patient,that's that's that's all I had today.
759.0,Provider,"Okay well we'll continue into you know, like think of ways, how did you do the drawing you know."
15937.0,Patient,"Right, I thought about it, but it didn't write it now. My journaling yes."
759.0,Provider,How you doing Steve going outside engaging with the world a little bit.
15937.0,Patient,"um I went on a couple walks I walk my dog and I walked to the gas station, but I was talking to this girl at the gas station and she still works there. Today, so that's just really awkward because I don't. Talk to her, I just ignore her. because she turned out to be super toxic. Thank. God, I listened to my guts and didn't get into like a situation ship and I was just like i'm just gonna stay single you see really toxic. This is which i'm very proud of myself for, but then like shortly after she died or her the same color as mine, so it's just really creepy and awkward bell. yeah um, but I wanted an ice cream sandwich and I didn't want to go to the store so. trying to get out. At least once a week right now."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good I like once a week yeah."
15937.0,Patient,But if I go ahead and apply for this job that I don't be three days a week.
759.0,Provider,Three days a week kicking out yeah. Are you packing your rv by the beach. yep.

759.0,Provider,To morning wow.
15937.0,Patient,But now.
759.0,Provider,i've moved to clock in the morning that's crazy.
15937.0,Patient,"They want it to be inconvenient because they don't really want anybody living here but. Because technically the coast guard is the one who run it they can't really do anything about it, so they just tried to make it as convenient but. I don't sleep that much anyway so it's no big deal for me I just set an alarm and I get up for the two hours if they don't come and go back to sleep if they come and I moved across the street. So i'm going to buy land that's going to save up and buy land so."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, I don't."
15937.0,Patient,"have to deal with any of this eventually i'm going to buy land, but my goal was to get the engine in here all fixed up and now it's fixed up, and now I need a job, so I could. replace my funds i'll probably work for like a year and then move to a different city to work there, and I just want to travel and work, and then by land."
759.0,Provider,"Has sounds good. Okay well can continue to do like you're coping skills engaging with the world journaling if you can, and I really want you to. You know just. Keep like a mood a little bit of a mood you know tracker like how you're feeling from day to day OK."
15937.0,Patient,Now go.
759.0,Provider,"A little bit attractive, we can discuss that and therapy yeah."
15937.0,Patient,"OK OK OK, and then just a question I, I have to keep taking these drugs surveys and I don't understand why."
759.0,Provider,Do you have to keep on taking the drug surveys and it's actually if you're a compliant with for medication stuff like that.
