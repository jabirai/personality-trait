740.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely I think that, I mean, of course, on an attorney I mean it shouldn't be no more discussions, because since there's already. tension. And you know, is, I mean you shouldn't be any more discussions about the House, it should be now since December January is almost here."
13743.0,Patient,He stubbornness how he's stubborn as hell and.

It is gonna either you know you need to you need mediation between the two of you guys so If not you won't end up being frustrated going to be no se and then God knows what happens you just go ahead and just get you an attorney."
13743.0,Patient,"And lydia I have to do it through a side of the House. About a couple weeks ago I think three weeks, so I think I was emotional you guys he came home drunk through us all out to me and my fucking sense to get the Fuck out and come to go Fuck myself living beyond our control. How to go to a motel. My you know my the concert set of should call the police, but it's like I don't call cups i'd never been the one that called COPs i've never been that way, so I just left. And my other son had to go to work that night because he works graveyards he had to leave and my other son that with me left with me and my dog we all went to a motel hotel $244 $75 for dog. Know it's like it was it was really pricey so he paid me the money but it just the point is that this is just the beginning. This is just to begin I don't want to deal with it. I told my neighbor you know I can't handle this i'm falling apart, little by little i'm just. can do."
740.0,Provider,"You know, Tony. that's all i'm gonna say because when you try that when there's when there has been intention and a marriage and we you realize that you to marry the wrong person and. that's why I tell people all the time, so for a long time to live with a mistake that's why you got to make sure in the beginning."
13743.0,Patient,"I think what it was, I was always with gang Members and I always had nice cars and never had houses, this is my third house, I have a beautiful home brand new home and it's like i've had it for 17 years it was built from the ground up. Like I hadn't much in my life I have a lot, but not happiness i've been really sad for many, many, many years more than. 17 years, I must say, because. No sex no touch no emotion, no nothing and I told him I told him every year every three months and it continued to be the same nothing. Nothing nothing and now he's saying you just told me about this one gentleman Center bullshit I told you a long time ago. um it's like he's in denial and i'm really fed up with it and it's like I don't talk to them you don't talk to me, but when he talks it's really negative really bad. And you know I I don't need this shit I don't need to be putting up this shit yeah it's been really hard on me."
740.0,Provider,"So, when you say you spoke with him and endorsing him not wanting to be physical, what does he say."
13743.0,Patient,"He just says i'm not leaving nowhere i'm staying here, where, am I going to go. And like a tone that half of the House is mine really 5050 If anything has, you know that we accumulated together, you know I still work for Boeing aircraft both of us that's where I met them and I made big money. And it's like. When they moved to Seattle, you know we bought this House hat it's 5050 it's been we've been here for a long time, everything should be done split down the middle pensions everything, but he doesn't want to do it he's putting really stubborn with me and it's like. I can do it no more I just can't do this Mayra day wake up i'm sad it to my daughter, I can do this, not everybody, but a lot of my family's got me them to the Lord heavy they figure when you're in a marriage, you stay within it, whether it's good or bad. huh but not me I had to tell myself when i'm done i'm you know when you're lonely for so many years. Right, you know, and my first husband was 11 my life, he died, he was a heroin addict and he was good and tasted using him and that's my my daughter's father. And then. I think everything fell apart because of him because he so long story I can't like take 30 minutes, but then you, and then I had a son was another gang Member. and Then I got with this guy which I jumped like a Tomo the concert jump in our relationship, instead of waiting to see you know get to know this guy. Get the number, they are and i've always got screwed by meeting the wrong ones and. it's just been i've changed a lot drugs were involved in the beginning, and every relationship i've been in but i'm. At the alcohol and with him just been I felt he's my best friend that's all he is as a friend here in the House. And i'm lonely. very lonely I just I want out, I told him that he doesn't listen to me. And he's arguing me and like I told my neighbor you know she's she's going to help me out with the lawyer i'm a huge hurdle over is going to cost more money, because I have so much invested in this place. So i'm gonna make him pay for it, I figured if he doesn't want to divorce, you can fulfill our fees. I don't know I don't know how it goes I figured that's how it goes."
740.0,Provider,"Well, actually i'll be separate yagi separate attorneys."
13743.0,Patient,"Okay, well then i'm."
740.0,Provider,"going to have to get your own, and he has to get his own."
13743.0,Patient,"Okay. I don't think you'll get one I think she'll give up once I get one. I guess that's what my next route, then. yeah the Lord is something that you should do."
740.0,Provider,yeah yeah don't don't share the turns you just everyone gets the wrong.
13743.0,Patient,"Okay i've never been in divorce, where I had a lot of property and stuff."

I just had my daughter with him and then my second relationship was just had a son. lived with him for a while it's like i've been to a lot a lot in my life, a lot, especially with kids both hundreds lost their children. At verse so it's like i've been to London my daughter was dying so many times, just like she got shot before I mean i've been through a lot of stress in my life, a lot of stress. A lot of stuff."

Because he's a male or a female point of view and. that's why I wanted you I wanted you from the get go it just."
740.0,Provider,"You know, mobile in it, you can."
13743.0,Patient,Do. The other thing.
740.0,Provider,To do is.

They were at my when I mean we're tight. When it comes to my own race I don't get along my own race. I don't know why it's always been like that, with me I don't know why."
740.0,Provider,"One thing I will say this is Nancy is because of the fact that I mean i'm not. i'm not we don't need self affirmations right now, because there's really nothing to how can you affirm something before you fix it. Okay, and sometimes we try to fix things by affirming. But that's. We have to get to the root of the problem Okay, and the root of the problem is trying to figure out why. Your picker is off and why you continue to engage in these unhealthy me."
13743.0,Patient,"Right, he told me that, last night, too, so I talked to him, I said same thing."
740.0,Provider,"yeah i'm not i'm not ready here you go come on back in believe I believe I can fly. No. No i'm not doing it because the end of the day, yeah better come down the road, maybe, but at no point in trying to affirm something that i've been fixed."

13743.0,Patient,I know exactly anything.
740.0,Provider,"I, like him, he knows you longer than I have. Yes, yeah so he made. He so you may be at the point with him to where you do need affirmations and I understand why he gave him to you because you're in such a dark place. And so it's just a means to be able to it's just a means to be able to cope. and not to basically run yourself insane."
13743.0,Patient,by continuing to.
740.0,Provider,"Speak affirmations over yourself, so that you don't end up in this black hole and can't get out understand why he gave it to you."
13743.0,Patient,"that's why I wanted you because I told myself, I need a female point of view."
740.0,Provider,But from my side.
13743.0,Patient,Okay let's hear it.

Within my first husband they call them brain, we only knew each other, a month and we got married and we stayed together 15 years but not really 15 we split up we divorced. After 15 years but we stayed together, only eight years, but he was a gang member that was just crazy went to prison for crazy stuff and it's like. I think it has to do with wanting somebody in my legs, my father was so distant towards us there was 10 of US there's 10 of US i'm the oldest at 10. Over and I was the lead of the family, like, I had to be the tough one, to protect them a little sisters and brothers, my father and mother Peter acids with belts. You know.
