705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14409.0,Patient,"But I think that's pretty much it for the weekend. Okay, I think that's fine but yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I want to check into did you happen to buy yourself, I think you said you were going to buy new guitar strings."
14409.0,Patient,I had some so I just re strung one of my tears.
705.0,Provider,Oh.
14409.0,Patient,"I already had some. I didn't even know I had him, but I look, just in case and I did have some."
705.0,Provider,And now that the guitar has the proper strings are you playing.
14409.0,Patient,mm hmm. I played a good part about two hours that and. fingers are sore today.
705.0,Provider,When you're playing where do you go in your head when you're playing guitar.
14409.0,Patient,and not really much of anywhere i'm really it just kind of makes me feel better. Just overall generally. physically better.
705.0,Provider,For you it's like a sense of mindfulness.
14409.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. Eckert told luck.
705.0,Provider,"Well, I think it's great that you're doing things like that that you're enjoying and that you're finding pleasure and again and."
14409.0,Patient,"Remember, we talked about. How much money I would save. on smoking drinking."
705.0,Provider,well.
14409.0,Patient,"I actually went and physically like did an audit of my bank account in my credit card. from June. To August 17th the day I stopped it was over $800 that I act actually spent on it. yeah so it's been two months, I can assume you know that's what I have saved. Right that's a good chunk of money yeah."
705.0,Provider,That is a good chunk of money.
14409.0,Patient,So I thought that was yeah it was. kind of depressing to see the actual number. And how often I was actually going to the store. But um it also was enlightening.
705.0,Provider,"It can be and that's I wanted to check him with that too, because I can be when you realize and you're like oh I shouldn't have done that, and guilt can set in and it's okay to give yourself one more reason. To not want to use again because it's going to cost you."
14409.0,Patient,physically to that doesn't that's just the money part you know.
705.0,Provider,yeah. Absolutely.
14409.0,Patient,yeah cigarettes are just yeah they're bad and they're expensive.
705.0,Provider,Is it at a place that Joe that you can take this like overall and see I made the changes I need to make and where it shifts from being maybe guilty about. The past and using that money to i'm not doing it today and that's what counts.
14409.0,Patient,yeah. I said lifesaver really. It has saved me. yeah it's good to look at it that way.
705.0,Provider,"anymore thought too, because that has a significant amount of what maybe you're saving up for the reward."
14409.0,Patient,"I don't know my car's paid off, I mean. I could probably buy a 12 string guitar or a. cutaway acoustic I could use one of those. So yeah there's things I could do to treatments. That would probably be somewhere in that range to. me. they're they're definitely think we're good. that's nice I think it's something I started meditating again but very lightweight like five minutes and not every night so but it's starting to come back a little bit."
705.0,Provider,Via meditation it's just everything seems to be more in sync and in balance.
14409.0,Patient,"that's what i'm trying to get to. What there's still times when I feel like. Why am I here what am I doing because there's like nothing going on and it's just me. Until I you know i'll go visit them pretty much every day Linda and my son jake and the dog, of course, bones. yeah all the time, so I was just over there for lunch."
705.0,Provider,Oh really okay. that's good I was going to ask to what the meditation what type of meditation are you doing.
14409.0,Patient,"Nothing really I do it like in the dark, with one or one or two little those little tea light candles. I do in the dark at night, what is quiet and I just try to focus on breathing. Or, or like listening or concentrating on if anything in my body is bugging me anything like that anything that focus on that isn't a worry or concern in life. Sometimes i'll just try to just breathe and listen to myself or try to hear my heartbeat. stuff like that I don't do like guided. meditation waterfalls running or anything like that. I haven't tried that. This time around, I should."
705.0,Provider,"All what you're describing though the body scans the breathing all that is just so good, you know and again to to get you to continue being in balance and building that connection."
14409.0,Patient,"Yes, much better, much better. And I can be there more for other people to if i'm. You know okay with myself. Instead of being the one who calls and our texts and i'm the one with the problems you know. I can actually be there for other people when they need me too."
705.0,Provider,"I know you said that you're going and visiting and your son and getting out a little bit more is that something that you're doing like each week, not just staying at home."
14409.0,Patient,"I try to get out every day for a little bit, at least for half hour so. I went to when we went to dinner last week we actually went out to walk in now I love that place so good. But, and we went there last last Friday. Last Friday. Now is nice but yeah out in public, as far as public going like to restaurants or sports clubs or anything like that or I don't do that a whole lot. there's like a family birthday, or something going on, like."
705.0,Provider,"you're saying like though show that you're mixing it up, or if if someone want you to maybe go then maybe you would but you prefer to kind of. get out of the House and do something not like going to a restaurant."
14409.0,Patient,"Right yeah I just want here, whatever or even just going over to linda's hasn't playing with the dog."
705.0,Provider,House how are you.

14409.0,Patient,"It goes straight his toy Ben he has a toy gun and like tug of war stuff and all that and he'll grab one and bring it to me and then we'll start playing. or he'll grab a tennis ball, because he has a he has a ball a box, full of tennis balls and another one full of like toys so pending on what he feels like dang he'll go and grab something. yeah he's a funny guy in Canada."
705.0,Provider,"That in itself to have just playing with Mr bones, and you know, throwing the ball can also just be meditation in a way."
14409.0,Patient,"A he will he will not stop until I stopped so it's not like he's going to ever like say i'm done he does. Right yeah he's always sticks. So you know, maybe when he's 10 or 11 have you like. they're not doing the tweeting."
705.0,Provider,Now he's like on it.
14409.0,Patient,he's like yes.
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah. Oh that's good so you have you know you're getting out of the House, and I think that that's great that you're taking a look at that and I think it was was it's your learning sweetest."
14409.0,Patient,"read it. yeah i'm doing a little bit every day so that's that's going well i'll tell you. I got frustrated with it yesterday because they. there's different rules for different pronunciations depending on what follows our proceeds a certain letter. And I was getting all of them wrong because they're like said. But they won't leave you know they won't pronounce the words for you and you could read it and. try to get the voice recognition and I was like messing it up every time. So I just did the silent approach and just did it without the recognition. Just to try and get an idea so but it's yeah it's it's hard. To tell you I chatted with my with her cat my ex wife's cousins know in Sweden. No that's that was last week okay. Okay yeah they're in a horrible Sweden and they called me on messenger to face thing, so I was able to actually. communicate without using Google translate the whole time there was actually some basic senses that I knew what they said, is it feels good it's good."
705.0,Provider,God is incredible you're a skills have already advanced where you're having a conversation.
14409.0,Patient,"You will not really, but I can recognize some of the things they say you know but yeah so it's good it's really good."
705.0,Provider,Oh.

705.0,Provider,mm hmm.

705.0,Provider,"that's a great when when. mm hmm okay. It increases to that circle, for you, where you're having you know more people that you're engaging with and trying something new."
14409.0,Patient,"yeah that was nice with them, so I am. We spent a half an hour last week on the phone."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14409.0,Patient,"They get kind of buzzed. There you kind of buzz and when it's like you know, three or 4234 in the afternoon over there it's there like nine hours ahead. So it'll be one in the morning they'll be kind of drinking the wine and getting buzz but there's still a lot of fun to try to try to talk to so it's really good."
705.0,Provider,"Does it then Joe and it's like if it's fun for you and it's just like yeah they do their thing is there any cravings then for you, if you're seeing that are hearing that and."
14409.0,Patient,"None at all, I actually talked to. Dr stats about that too. Because the naltrexone she had me on naltrexone and it was given me a joint pains. In here and here here and my knees, especially so I asked her If I could just stop and she said it was okay. To try a couple of days we're just taking half of it and see if it gets better and. I took half for two days and I don't have any cravings so i've been. I haven't taken any for maybe a week almost no. With no cravings and my joints are better yeah so I can play guitar now without it hurting because it was hurting was taking them."
705.0,Provider,"And it's making progress where you know, Joe you you've already done all these other things, to help that the Kenya coping skills were. Probably that need to you know cravens already starting to lift."
14409.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's good it's pretty much you almost got any you know, sometimes when a UFC fights I don't want to have beer, but it's nothing like that doesn't pass by the way."
705.0,Provider,What do you think early.
14409.0,Patient,what's on.
705.0,Provider,What do you have instead.
14409.0,Patient,"I think of my sign and watching it. On. How he would not want me to see want to see me the way I was on that last day. And things like that. That how much better, I feel tomorrow and I like that. If i'm not. drunk and sick."

705.0,Provider,"yeah and sometimes too I wouldn't is much show if he if you don't if you don't feel like that that would be good for you, because sometimes it's not it's just like decaffeinated. Coffee there's still a little bit of alcohol in it. Right, so I was a tiny. yeah there is, and you know I mean maybe in some cases, it may trigger it, but more of trying to see if there's if, if needed, like if you're watching the game and that craving keeps coming is to have something more like like I don't know if you tried to hit. waters that they have a touch of fruit in there, but it's more natural sugar."
14409.0,Patient,Oh no I haven't I haven't tried that yet.
705.0,Provider,yeah it's different things like that that if it can satisfy you where you're doing something outside of having your your Pepsi but it's something that's still healthy for you and can be special.
14409.0,Patient,"yeah I do I do a lot of grilling during the fight so that's i'll usually have a ribeye or New York, because those are my favorite to cut. So sometimes i'll do another I did 133 weeks ago a grill outside it's getting kind of cool for that, but. Still, not that bad out there."

That i'm thinking of moving to so I don't really want to get more stuff to move."
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah and those little propane girls, they can do a good state."
14409.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah I get the Marks and everything so much and I don't really kick it very long anyway, maybe. Maybe eight minutes at the most, I like it kind of rare."

14409.0,Patient,"I actually ordered chicken last week, and they were out of chicken like what are you kidding me. They had at the next time I ordered them, which was, I think, yesterday, the day before."
705.0,Provider,"Good steak and things like that is also nice like you've had a long, hard week, and when you want to reward yourself it's like yeah the steak you can already smell it, you know already faced it, you know. yeah it can definitely be you know that replacement sometimes people will associate into the week with maybe popping the top on a beer and it's like no you're going to grill a steak."
14409.0,Patient,And that's the data being better exactly real la la.
705.0,Provider,Less money and all that.
14409.0,Patient,"I get a really good steak like 10 bucks or whatever you know and. 12 Pack is 10 bucks but what's better, for me, you know much better."

Twice yeah I had a one time, I gave myself a fat lip another time I fell and hurt my sadek here all the way down for her for almost two weeks yeah yeah so yeah I tend to. Not a rather."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and those are good wake up calls that when you start to injure yourself physically, because sometimes people question do they have a problem it's like if you've harmed yourself physically. I would say that, yes, this alcohol has."

Had have been together like 20 years or something, and he has never had serious problems with that call, but about three or four months ago he got so wasted. He fell on the pool deck and knock a couple of his teeth out and just damaged the whole side of his face and he's now sober for like three or four months since it happened.

14409.0,Patient,"Is it. they're trying to get him. Going is really worried about him because he's not working, and he spends a lot of time alone in his room. So we're a little concerned but we're not sure what to do that so. He got a job at albertsons and quit after week."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm you know.
14409.0,Patient,So we'll see we'll see what happens.

705.0,Provider,"yeah he could have two churches that. Were he was there for everyone, because of everyone's morning and what happened and maybe he's reflecting on it, or for 20 year old I heard a lot of people that are that age filling like almost like what was said to chicken little where the sky is falling, because of the pandemic. is giving him, then an outlet where hopefully he can find some resources or if he's comfortable you know going and talking to someone."
14409.0,Patient,"He went with me to therapy once. And he did talk is he's upset about our divorce, he left he actually he said he wasn't upset because we just thought anyway. So good now TIM Harris, how are you doing on time, but he let some of that, so I think it'd be better he just maybe talk to somebody alone, we can be free to talk about. me and his mom and whatever else is. bugging him is his brother and a whole bunch of stuff but he as of now he's just not willing to do it yeah. So hopefully hopefully he'll come around to that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and knowing to it's it's helpful, even by you going and talking and it's showing that role modeling that like mentor because sometimes those messages come into play and it's like no, we need to talk and we need to be able to sometimes have an outlet."
14409.0,Patient,"yeah it's. it's helped me and it's helping me yeah. I just had a myth that I needed to help and go get it, you know. I do a group I did a group thing once a week with Sharon. aaron's group and then this I have every other week so it's our three times, whatever it is, every other week practice yeah I was thinking our plan was at 8pm tonight and I don't know why I thought, like wait a minute. i'm glad I checked out a Mr."

What a lot of people are doing that and November. Is scheduling any to, if you like, like it can be the fifth and the 12th or the fifth and the 19th so basically on Fridays, we have the fifth the 12th and the 19th."
14409.0,Patient,Can we do the fifth and the 19th that'd be perfect.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, let me. Look at the calendar there so you're wanting the fifth and the 19th and preferably we'll look at 3pm to see. it's just joking to take me one quick minute to pull up the calendar. And then we'll look at those dates. So when we go into November 5. I do have a three o'clock on the fifth, would you like me to go ahead and schedule out one. Okay, so we'll do that one, and then we talked about the 19th. And the same thing, I have three o'clock available is that okay."
14409.0,Patient,"yep that works perfect, is a good time."

14409.0,Patient,"yeah they're funny they're they're very nice very nice people. Never i've never met them in person that we've talked on the facetime type messenger thing. it's last time we were. supposed to go out there was for somebody's wedding and it turned out that I couldn't get the time off of work. Because I had already taken. Two weeks to go to cooperstown for jake's baseball team. to New York. And I couldn't get an additional two weeks to go to Sweden, so I was kind of bummed about that, but obviously i'm going to pick checks baseball thing over over Sweden. That time. And that was like July of 2014. And when we get out there, one of these years."
705.0,Provider,Exactly and if you're saving over 18 and what was it 800.

Because a lot of the time, I would like this there's a cigarette shop right over here I just go and I give the girl 20 bucks and she giving feedback cigarettes I didn't even count those times so it's actually probably higher it's probably closer to 900,000. yeah. It was."
705.0,Provider,"And now, with this adjustment, if you wanted to you have more choices to in the long run, move wherever you want because you're saving $100 every couple of months, if not more. yeah I could go towards something else."
14409.0,Patient,yeah I could actually just stop working and just go somewhere and probably be fine. But I probably I probably get bored. Because I yeah I work as a good chef of the day now and it helps like distract me. So yeah I wouldn't want to stop working out but I I if I really wanted to I probably could. I think about that because I could sell this. place and buy another place and i'm honest. Right have a very small mortgage. When you see things are doable right. yeah. options.
705.0,Provider,"You do. Your chair to earlier uh Joe where it's like who who even knows in a couple of years if that will still be like on your radar and things like.
