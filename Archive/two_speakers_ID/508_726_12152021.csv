508.0,Patient,"They did give us a day of 10 days for him to come home, but then he declined and now they're worried about his oxygen and him getting a little bit more dialysis before they send them home they want to, I guess wake him up a little bit more oxygen."

I guess i've been just take one day at a time and what he was going to icu was a little bit more hectic for me, but now you know I feel a little bit better but i'm still like you know why can't he come home, you know, and then I was an SG amp a for 13 years and. it's like he is in a nursing home that's just the mindset I get when I go to where he's at and I."
726.0,Provider,"Well, it must be hard to to see him because when you're thinking like I don't know like you live, your whole life and you don't think about like your parents ever ending up like in at that stage in their life, so it is it's really hard to see that."
508.0,Patient,"It didn't it's like he's not trying hard enough either I don't want to say he's not trying hard enough maybe he is really weak, but I feel like a push to get out of there to you know, try to walk like he can't walk anymore."
726.0,Provider,Oh. I think he's giving up like who in my getting better. yeah.
508.0,Patient,"He has physical therapy and stuff but for a person that was supervisor, you know working at University Hospital walking every day and stuff to just sit down."
726.0,Provider,"I don't know yeah. Maybe maybe just some I don't know if he feels that way, having asked him, maybe Would he be willing to talk to you about stuff like that or is he, like the kind of parents that just won't talk about things."
