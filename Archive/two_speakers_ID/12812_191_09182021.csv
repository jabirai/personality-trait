191.0,Provider,yeah okay well what's the last time you saw your therapist have you been seeing her. him uh huh.
12812.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, I saw her it's Tara and I saw her, I was here on Friday, but she was out on Friday. Okay, but I saw word two weeks prior to that."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and the reason i'm asking is that your care intensity says excessive no shows must be seen three times a week or recommend a high level of care so i'm just trying to one, because I know we see you doing, I would say, mostly your groups."
12812.0,Patient,"yeah well last week i'm not last week, but the week before my daughter, and my mom both had covered and I missed our group, and while I missed. I missed the appointment for you, that day. And then I miss group that day, so I missed like the whole week of everything, but if I left that room. You can only have one person in their day and myself in there, I had a regular phone you know, obviously in there, but I didn't have like a cell phone device or anything to actually do a facetime thing. yeah so it kind of messed me up on them weeks or two weeks ago but whenever I called the care navigator they connected me to like a nurse or whatever. Okay, and I talked to her, but we've got all my appointments and all that stuff lined up and i've got all my appointments made up well. You make i'm making them up, as we."
191.0,Provider,"get going i'm up here, I know you care intensity is showing you're supposed to be have an individual I know your individual is twice a month and it saying group appointment frequency three times a month and I think it must have kicked it up because of. Because what ends up happening, if you miss several appointments, then the recommendation is for increased group appointments."
12812.0,Patient,"Yes, I have. individually or I have, I think I get to see Tara one more time. Maybe next Thursday, I think, maybe I don't have the calendar in front of me, but I know I get to see her at least one more time. before she leaves and then. I also have another appointment scheduled. Like the following week as well, too, so I could get that one made up."
191.0,Provider,"However, oh. So this is independent of that let's see what your which group, are you attended your attendance is it."
12812.0,Patient,On Tuesday.

12812.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean I was, I had a mess up two weeks ago I have any meds for like three days which that's no excuse it's all my fault, you know I done it I got it own up to it, I regret it, I I feel bad, I just want to beat myself up but I got to learn to move on from that. I wish it was that easy but it's really not. Yes, very disappointed in myself disappointed my mom. But i'm moving forward and I haven't messed up a bit since then so i'm keeping that I."

You know there's nothing that i'm seeing here that makes me like just shocked or mad or anything that's urgent Okay, but these are things that you can see, under some some common conditions are right.

And you had a little protein in your urine and a little ketone we see that in many of our diabetics Okay, we see that in diabetics and so. That. We want to keep keep watching that okay.
