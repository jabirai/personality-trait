480.0,Provider,Oh man. I can't imagine having to clean a house as big as yours in worry about a bar.
4351.0,Patient,"No, no, it would be awful yeah i've got a lot of work to do in the spring that's for sure."
480.0,Provider,So how's your week been.
4351.0,Patient,"pretty good it's been good, I had a lot of time off, so I caught up with some stuff at home and then. I sold a goat one of my baby goats went today that I had a lady put a deposit down on it, and she came and picked it up today so it's been a good week my husband went back to work so that's really good."
480.0,Provider,Is he feeling better like almost back to normal.
4351.0,Patient,yeah yeah everything's been going really good he's healing nicely.
480.0,Provider,"that's awesome. And we have not talked about your kids in a while so what's going on with them, are they having issues in school this year."
4351.0,Patient,um no actually the things are going really good at school step my son had some minor issues where he'll get to where he. He gets to like not like a certain teacher and then he has a real hard time getting over that.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4351.0,Patient,"And usually causes issues but he's he's moved past that I think he's grown up a little bit. Good realizes you know not liking somebody isn't going to help him very much so, he hasn't complained about her in a while it's been going pretty good and my daughters are both doing really good in school Emily wasn't doing good for a while she was failing a couple classes."
480.0,Provider,With the anxiety issues right.
4351.0,Patient,"No haley has anxiety my oldest but Emily diagnosed with like severe depression, a couple months back. And they put they put her on. They we had taken her off the zoloft or like a year ago, and she was doing good for a while and then I guess her depression got really bad again so they put her on. I think it's I think it's Prozac so she's doing good on that. When she went back to the counselor. She had scored 20 and then she went back a couple weeks later, and she scored I think it was a six on the scale so. A lot better."
480.0,Provider,that's really good.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah big difference and she said she feels better. she's been drawn more and doing more art she's been coming down and. hanging out more and not staying in her bedroom all the time, so I can tell that she's done a lot better."
480.0,Provider,that's awesome.
4351.0,Patient,"he's actually doing really well for anxiety she still has anxiety, but I got her that anxiety and colby a workbook off of Amazon. mm hmm and that just came a couple days ago and she's been working through that and she's actually doing pretty good with everything he's got both of them have several friends this year which. they're usually pretty quiet and keep to themselves, so the fact that they're you know hanging out with people and talking to people is a big deal."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's huge.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah definitely doing a lot better there's a science fair coming up and I guess both the girls can do it together, even though they're in two different grades. So they're doing and science project together with one of haley's friends. be kind of cool. they've decided what they're doing yeah they're gonna do. Like petri dishes with bacteria in from and they're going to get it from dogs the dogs mouse cats mouth and then we're going to do chickens and the goats and the horses and see what different types of bacteria grow."
480.0,Provider,that's interesting I don't know if they want to know the results of that I have dogs that I let me.
4351.0,Patient,"Know right yeah exactly. They say that I don't know I think they should also do people, though, because they say dog files are cleaner than people's about so it'd be an interesting test."
480.0,Provider,"I have heard that i've actually heard because well and, if you think about it, animals clean themselves by licking so there must be something in either their saliva or their tongue that's almost like a natural sanitizer I don't know."
4351.0,Patient,Well yeah cuz they lick their wounds and they clean their own.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4351.0,Patient,"And that keeps them from you know from a pig getting worse, so there's gotta be something to it."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's interesting.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah and I even told her I said, I think you guys should take a sample from one of the chicken eggs to. be bad and then see what the difference between the egg and the mouth of the chicken is chicken they carried some nasty bacteria."
480.0,Provider,yeah well and not so it would be interesting because they think birds overall tend to be higher bacteria all of that risk and chickens technically a bird so.
4351.0,Patient,Now they definitely they definitely carry salmonella toxicity and all kinds of stuff. yucky stuff so it'd be.
480.0,Provider,Easier kids ever gotten some of the love from.
4351.0,Patient,"The animals, no none of us have ever gotten it from any of our animals, thank goodness. keep our fingers crossed that doesn't happen great."
480.0,Provider,"That was my only er trip. With my oldest for the longest time and then he, like split his head open, but he got salmonella because he had a bearded dragon. And he was probably four or five at the time, and like, even though I told him, you can't touch it like I have to be watching you because I have to make sure you wash your hands. yeah so he doesn't know so he had the lizard had actually it died a few days later, so the lizard sick with some sort of bacteria that killed the lizard but then ended up giving my son salmonella just from touching it and then not washing his hands right away."
4351.0,Patient,Oh wow.
480.0,Provider,I know it's crazy.
4351.0,Patient,yeah how long did he have the lizard core because they live up to 10 years.
480.0,Provider,He was only it was like less than a year he was so sad when it died.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah my actually that's what through Emily ended I think what threw her into depression of several years back, was her lizard died, and she had a bearded dragon we had it for like two years and it was it was so healthy and happy and and we used to let it come out. hang out on our shoulder and he was really cool lizard and and woke up one day and had died, and I, the day before I had went to the went to the pet store and bought some of those big fat green worms they're like."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4351.0,Patient,"I don't know what they are there some sort of caterpillar thing but they're big fat Greek they're full of gel so gross, but it was it eight those and I don't know whether it choked on it, or if maybe one of them was bad and. And it killed it, but the. And we had also lost power and. So we had to keep like we had to keep her heated. And I didn't think she got that cold because she was still active and everything seemed like she was fine, but I don't know whether it was because the temperature dipped and then. When power came back on things went back to normal too fast and shock your system, but she was really upset when that lizard died really upset."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I can imagine they get attached and lizards are actually like I was very hesitant, but there they've been one of the favorite pets that we've had. Yes, they will hang out on your shoulder most of them are nice enough let you like. pettitte and walk around with it."
4351.0,Patient,"yeah yeah they that's one that we had it never bit or anything, she was actually pretty sweet."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. i've had more than just that one, but none of them have lasted very long."
4351.0,Patient,"yeah So when I first bought. emily's lizard I think like six months later, and had you know grown from a baby lizard into a big lizard and then we got another baby one. brought it home from the pet store. And the kids put it into the tank with the big lizard and like literally live for five minutes, the lizard just jumped on it as a little one of the kids like."
480.0,Provider,Is.
4351.0,Patient,"It kind of was hilarious, but it would certainly all the gifts were freaking out of."
480.0,Provider,The time for sure.
4351.0,Patient,They do you know lizards you can't put them in together when they're that different size they're going to eat the ever run it looks like a snack.
480.0,Provider,So awful.
4351.0,Patient,"It was it was really kind of funny, but it was awful."
480.0,Provider,"uh huh. yeah really had some funny pet death stories for sure. Sometimes you just have to laugh because we've had. I think we have a shareable hamster with with toddlers those are never good ideas, because they open the cage and they get out and then it's like next thing you know Oh, the dog got it."
4351.0,Patient,"Oh yeah also might yeah that happened my my daughter's cat. got into one of her tanks and guns for the hamsters only live like the little ones only live three years anyway. And the cat had you know thought it was a Fries and brought it to hayley hayley woke up in bed, the next morning and her hamsters dead right next to her and the casual can add or like. Free I did something good and haley mortified it was so funny, though."
480.0,Provider,"traumatizing for Kim, though."
4351.0,Patient,"yeah it really was, but it was really funny."
480.0,Provider,No one idea issues g.
4351.0,Patient,Account was just doing what it's supposed to do you.
480.0,Provider,"Know that's the worst is when cat spring presence my cat likes to bring birds to me. Especially when we're Florida, that was the big thing is because we had one of those like pools, with the screen and closure. So it gets stuck the cat gets the bird. That was the big thing is there were probably. Over the course of four years of living there at least 10 birds that she brought to me and. wow I was just like whoa this is."
4351.0,Patient,A good hunter I want one of those cats.
480.0,Provider,"she's good yeah and she would always catch lizards and bring lizards and. Little tiny ones that climb around the yard, you know."
4351.0,Patient,"yeah I use the word goes on my ears, I used to. Because if you squeeze them they'll open their mouth and then, when you let go they shut their mouths I used to hang on my ears and people at school, like. I thought it was so funny."
480.0,Provider,"that's really funny. Oh man Okay, so how has your. Time management. stuff thing going for you."
4351.0,Patient,how's what.
480.0,Provider,Time management stuff.
4351.0,Patient,"Better better definitely better. I just have cleared stuff out of my schedule and and I did get a bunch of stuff done like I. paperwork stuff that was piling up and then I have to deal with the tax audit guy and I got all that dealt with and I got all the paperwork into the lender that we're working with by the arm, so I all that's off my back right now pretty much."
480.0,Provider,that's awesome.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah thanks. She didn't lower my dose on my medication, I was surprised, so I got a reminder next time that. That i'm supposed to go down to Alabama she forgot."
480.0,Provider,i'm for the suboxone yeah.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah she loves it the same, and I know she's got a lot going on with her grandbaby and being sick and everything yeah. So she left at the same and I thought we were going to go down so i'll have to remind your next time."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to go down."
4351.0,Patient,yeah because.
480.0,Provider,"When you've talked to her about it in the past, like here's The thing is, nobody cares about the suboxone what people care about is the anxiety meds like that's, especially in maine it's highly controlled the anxiety meds. So I don't think you necessarily have to go down on suboxone if you don't want to, but if you think that you're ready, then we can remind her for sure I didn't know if you thought that you had to because of the other myth, but."
4351.0,Patient,"Well, I didn't think I necessarily had to I just thought that it might. make it easier for her to continue to prescribe that medication without so much. You know so many people waking out because people have made it without about that."
480.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, so yeah if you want to go down, then yeah we'll just remind her. Next week, at grew. yeah I think I really didn't have a problem, getting it filled. You didn't have a problem, getting it filled right."
4351.0,Patient,"No, no, not at all, no. And I think i'll probably just go down to eight and stay there for a while and and and then it will just be wanted it'll be easier. Rather than opening to and having a break it up i'll just go down. So."
480.0,Provider,"That makes sense, and you can always revisit if you feel like you're more agitated or having increased stress or cravings we can always go back up to."
4351.0,Patient,yeah yeah I definitely let somebody know if I feel like that.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so give me a couple goals you want to work on until next time we talk. So time management thing getting better because you've been saying no to things that aren't crucial and you've been prioritizing doing the paperwork and stuff."
4351.0,Patient,What.
480.0,Provider,else do you think would help as far as staying on top of the whole time management situation.
4351.0,Patient,"As well still that stuff I mean, I still want to. Work on the time management, because I have a class i'm taking now on Tuesdays and Thursdays and, and so I mean it's it's a lot, but I have to do that for the for the purchase of the farm, the class gives me a credit, so that I can go through the farm service agency so. Okay, so the time management thing I still want to keep working on that. I also. think that I would like to work on my health a little bit more, I need to make sure like I haven't I still haven't gone back for my second shot, I need to get that done. And I have to get that done on a monthly basis so. I need to get a vehicle and that's why I finished up with the tax the tax audit guys, so I released get that sent off and hopefully get back to back so I can buy a car, so I don't have to stress about that. And there was something else that I was thinking about now I can't remember what I was gonna say. I guess still just. My husband and I his biggest argument is is my kids me not saying no to my children and not like he's much more strict with kids than I am. So I definitely and he's not wrong I should I need to work on it for and make sure that they're you know, following through with what they say they're going to do. And you know they they help with feeding animals and doing stuff like that, but they they can also help with more than just that there's other things they can do. My oldest daughter she does her own laundry and she claims she cleans her side of the room and cleans the cat boxes, but the other two. don't really do extra things unless they're asked like my son sometimes he'll have to roll out hey or take out the trash but he doesn't do a whole lot so. And then, does he fight you on it when you ask because it's so rare yeah. And that's not good like that needs to stop. If I tell you to do something you need to do it, I don't ask me to do that much so. Do what i'm asking you to do without arguing, and my son's the worst my. My daughter's don't so much argue with me about it they'll just do it. But my son, he will, are you until the cows come home and he's like."
480.0,Provider,"that's how my middle is and it's frustrating, because his brothers get so annoyed by him, arguing that they'll just do it for him."
4351.0,Patient,And i'm like what happens with.
480.0,Provider,makes it so much worse when you guys do it for him. Yes.
4351.0,Patient,"I keep saying to my kids i'm like don't just do it, so that you don't have to listen to me arguing just leave that room or something because. you're just making it worse and you're not helping your brother at all by doing things for him. He needs to know how to take care of themselves so he doesn't grow up and get stuck with some woman, because he needs, you know somebody that knows how to cook and clean, you need to know how to do that stuff. Exactly yeah."
480.0,Provider,"So yeah i'm right there with you, holding boundaries with kids. hard."
4351.0,Patient,It is really hard.
480.0,Provider,"very hard. that's a big big one, so I think okay so something that helps a lot of people and I recently did this and. it's definitely helped overall, I still struggle with him, specifically, but with the others it definitely helped. Was I made. Like a house rules. thing I have not had to do that in years I don't like doing that, but we had gotten, to the point where like I was doing everything, and I was just stretched so thin so i'm like this is what has to happen before you guys can get on electronics. And so it's like hanging in the thing, so what it what it made it easier for me was they know that's expected so. When they don't do it. it's not as much of a fight to say, well, you can't have your vr until you did this this."
4351.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that's not a bad idea and we just recently got the the Google. they're like these, Google pods, and so I can shut individual. Oh Nice. Which is really."
480.0,Provider,that's helpful.
4351.0,Patient,"yeah so that's definitely been helpful my husband's been utilizing that and i'm like oh that's Nice, so that not everybody gets you know read over the person that's doing their own stuff so. yeah that's definitely going to be a helpful tool so and that's a good idea i've done the same thing gone back to writing down, you know TOR TOR lists and stopping and then it falls by the wayside and back to the. Where when I go again so. I need to stick to my guns."
480.0,Provider,"I know, but it's hard, I mean we talked about this in group when you're just. exhausted, and you just want to get it done it's so much easier to just do it yourself."
4351.0,Patient,"Yes, that's exactly why I brought it up and group because it was like hey I know i'm not the only parent that feels this way but it's so true. And I know it's and I know it's horrible and i'm not helping them out at all by doing that, so I get mad at myself but. In the moment i'm just like Oh, I just want to get it over with and done."
480.0,Provider,"yeah for sure I totally did that at break today I cleaned up the kitchen for the kids. Because I was like I have time, I want to do it, I don't want to fight them, and it was nice outside it hasn't been nice out for a while and so. I justified it in my head and now well great that's gonna make tonight even harder, because now. they're on expect that i'm going to clean up after them tonight to."
4351.0,Patient,"Exactly yep yep that sounds exactly like the justification, I do."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, so it's human and it's normal it's just. not benefiting ourselves at all."
4351.0,Patient,"No, no, and my husband's like really worried about the kids when they you know grow up and move out he's like. How are they even going to operate and i'm like. i'm like well they're not going to be this bad forever and he's like well times ticking away, I mean, are you sure about that i'm like no i'm not sure about that i'm just praying to God that works."
480.0,Provider,"Oh gosh. Okay, I don't know if we have any other appointments scheduled to me like."
4351.0,Patient,"I think we do, but i'm not positive."
480.0,Provider,"Carry I feel like we did too, but i'm not seeing, let me look in the computer that's a little easier."
4351.0,Patient,If you can I can check my.
480.0,Provider,Now it'll be on the bright heart computer it. Sometimes my paper calendar is easier to find things sometimes it's not so. Days where it's just not seeing what I need to see.
4351.0,Patient,"i'm pretty quiet at work tonight's been nice usually. yeah usually it's just crazy crazy, but thanks been Nice."
480.0,Provider,Did you get more employees.
4351.0,Patient,yeah he hired God for new people. And so that's been like a huge help for sure.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, we don't have any more therapy scheduled."
4351.0,Patient,Oh okay.
480.0,Provider,So um. You know your schedule yet for next week.
4351.0,Patient,"Well, I know that i'm going to be having Tuesday and Thursdays off because of that class for the next few weeks so. I don't know if you have any of those."
480.0,Provider,Perfect so we can't do.
4351.0,Patient,The classes and until 6pm my time.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, good so i'm going to put you down for Thursday the third at 130 and Thursday the 17th at 130."
