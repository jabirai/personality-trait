386.0,Provider,"Okay, so I don't know when it transferred over because, when I look when I look at your profile Christine. it's marketing, you know shows, I can see, I mean, I see the consistency of it being like every other week for you like you're checking in every other week so that's a consistent um but what they're doing. Is they're mark. But what they're doing is they're marking you and no show went in that interim so you have tons of no shows. And Robbie boys yeah tons like i'm all the way back in May. So it looks like. It looks like March, April on you were doing the once weekly and then as of May it looks like group was marked out isn't that was your first one that was marked as a no show and then mark down as a no show again and in June and then. Another no show in June."
3126.0,Patient,Although I fix all that.
386.0,Provider,"So what i'm going to do is i'm gonna send a message over to your care navigator that's been assigned to your case. For case management, for your care intensity recommendations to be reviewed i'll also tag Isaiah so if they're In fact the prescription recommend. Not the prescription recommendation, but if, in fact, the group recommendation I frequency for the appointment is supposed to be every other week bi monthly, then I i'll have ice go in and adjust that accordingly."
3126.0,Patient,To every week I just.
386.0,Provider,"No yeah and so in regards to the no show appointments what i'll do is I will send a message over to the care navigator for him to review that, because what i'm seeing here is. That they're marking it as a no show versus getting it. Like every other week so he would be able to go back and alter those no show appointments, if need be. So I will send the message over to them, you can always log in to the care navigation or complaints vc to get that situated as well if you don't hear anything back in terms of. I would just keep following up on those no show say hey. I talked to Jay and prescription services, she told me this is what the recommendation was, I have been on a bi monthly schedule, since this time. And she told me I have tons of no shows now, what do I need to do to get this corrected and they can help they can help you out there, I just don't have any available I don't have any capabilities. To be able to work in the scheduling team thing like I can't get in there, so um I would definitely reach out, I will definitely reach out to the care navigator to just make sure that it gets adjusted accordingly. and reviewed, it looks like here you completed the compliance video the BAM seven the pH Q nine, let me double check so right now the prescription recommendation because of the missed appointment yesterday. Or the first excuse me as because time flies when you're having fun because of the Miss appointment for group on the first what what we'll do is the prescription has been reduced to a four day supply, with an additional."
3126.0,Patient,we're not getting along.
386.0,Provider,yeah.
3126.0,Patient,I don't have a car. To go get him.
386.0,Provider,yeah.
3126.0,Patient,If I did.
386.0,Provider,"I I honestly I have no control over the prescription recommendation Christine I wish I did, and I can definitely. I can, if you don't want me to get the medication out I can definitely like and you want Isaiah to send it in, and it be sent over to him, it would be up to his discretion on how long to prescribe for. But what the recommendation that I have to review and what I have to abide by is what's been given to me as a four day supply with prescription renewals to get you taken care of until your next meeting."
3126.0,Patient,That I guess. yeah get all that shit. I can't be running the board if it's out of town.
386.0,Provider,Get on i'm sorry.
3126.0,Patient,Oh he's a runaround.
386.0,Provider,"CVs pharmacy is the correct pharmacy for you said. i'm gonna leave audio for just a second here when I go over to CVs for you get the prescription going for you OK. OK, and then don't disconnect until I let you know who I speak West okay. Okay we'll be right back."
3126.0,Patient,bench.
386.0,Provider,"Alright, Christine, this is what I did I spoke with not over at CVs pharmacy. I when I was calling in the medication I kind of reviewed, a little bit of the chart in terms of like your previous like inquiries and making sure that, like messaging wise. Everything was aligned, and so I actually ran across an inquiry that was for your care intensity adjustment, so what it looks as what has happened is that natalie had put you on a twice monthly group appointments when you were seeing nataline. Austin yeah and then, when you transition to Isaiah I think that Karen tend to just automatically just like reset, so I think that what. That is what happened, and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to send a message over to Isaiah on on top of. for him to be able to go over that care intensity of recommendation that was previously done and that's why there's so many no shows accumulated at this point, this should have been caught a long time ago, so i'm really, really sorry. I call the medication in for a six day supply for quantity of 12 just to get you over to your next Wednesday appointment okay. So, so you won't have to go back because I seen that inquiry and how that cure intensity has been and. It all makes sense to me in terms of what is the possibility of what has happened, I would just for all fault, I would recommend you following up with ice is saying hey I. had to call in our services, this is what happened, I have all these no shows, but back on march 3 of 2021 when I was still seeing natalie the prescription recommendation and the cure intensity recommendation for me was at bi monthly group of planets. OK OK, I will also send a message just that way, we are collaborating here, but I did want to let you know that I did see that. I will definitely put a message over to the prescribing physician and the care navigator to get into adjusted for you, if they they just have to review it first I can't make that."
3126.0,Patient,Determination right.
386.0,Provider,But I did send in the MED for 16th for you.
3126.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, thank you."
386.0,Provider,"you're absolutely welcome is there anything else i'm able to assist with today. You got it, let me know, let us know if there's anything else that we can do, but I spoke with Scott of CVs and they should be getting it prepared for you."
3126.0,Patient,"Okay, all right, thank you very much."
386.0,Provider,"you're absolutely welcome um quick question for you, you you, you said there's no relapse and no withdraw and you were out of medication correct. Correct perfect and we're good to go. you're good okay Thank you so much."
