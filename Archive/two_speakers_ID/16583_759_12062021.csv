16583.0,Patient,"I met, I met someone and I got her relationship super young. And I moved out to live with him because he also took care of me. mm hmm, and so I wasn't a runaway child or. Like a bad kid I just did that, because it was easier to get to school because he would drop me off and pick me up and yeah just more so of like I was already on my own while living at home, because my mom was really there, so I I just left home."

759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16583.0,Patient,"and I wish I. Had that the childhood that I. I don't want to say, like I deserve but, like a better childhood. Okay, I know, leaving was probably like the best decision. And then I just had to grow up so fast. yeah yeah. Can I didn't get to enjoy my. My teenage years. Because. When I moved out and I live with my my boyfriend that time he was still with his family and his mom like expected a lot. mm hmm so like just leaving the House was was a lot. I had to go and check in with her and. I don't know. But. I just feel that it took away from. My teenage years where I should have had time to be with my friends or just kind of experience that and to be a kid you know. And then. Which is fine, I mean I. get everything I had to do like I knew I had to go to school, I knew I had to go to college I knew that I knew the steps to my life."
759.0,Provider,yeah that she had to take for. yeah yeah. that's understandable.
16583.0,Patient,"So I was with that person for 10 years and, like nothing, nothing like I didn't get married. Like I had hoped to I didn't. I didn't have any kids. And so. After 10 years we went our separate ways. He actually dated someone for. A month and and got her pregnant and so he was. Having a baby on the way, and soon after that, like he got married you know, and so I know at that time, like that really hurt me because that was essentially what I was aiming for the entire time that I was in that relationship, and unfortunately it didn't happen."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16583.0,Patient,"So. I don't know that made me sad like i'm over it now, but at that time you know it was it was sad. yeah."
759.0,Provider,It was sad to to you know have ended that relationship and not got what you wanted from out their relationship. yeah yeah.
16583.0,Patient,"And then. I got a little break and then I met my most recent my last boyfriend which we're no longer together in it's the same day, like. i've been with him for 10 years. And I wanted to have a kid. So it's almost kind of like the same cycle, but. And I got into my last relationship at 27 and I didn't know how to be stern and approach things in a way that if I knew that it wasn't going to work out. That I could cut it off, and so I just like let things go. You know. yeah and so i'm single now I recently single and I think this is where everything is surfacing all my problems. How I feel are the changes that's happening in my life. i'm a lot."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so a lot is coming up for you, you know now having a time where you have time to think about everything that has happened in your life and. You know, after a breakup, especially since it's been 10 years I can imagine a lot of things are coming up for you, you know, like. i'm processing, you know what has happened in the past what's going on right now, been able to you know regulate your emotions, you know everything that is coming up for you right now."
16583.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. So we'll dive into that more you know, like in our sessions, what do you hope to gain from our guarantee is, Sir, and you see certain type of clarity or reassurance or anything of that nature that you're hoping to gain from therapy."
16583.0,Patient,"What I was hoping to gain from there was like more of an understanding of my emotions and my feelings, because I think I went into this wanting to learn more about myself. Okay um because then I get attached really easily."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
16583.0,Patient,"And, and I want. I think that's like call. Something emotional attachment."
759.0,Provider,yeah I.
16583.0,Patient,think that has something.
759.0,Provider,Like Derek up me during you know. from childhood attachment house okay.
16583.0,Patient,"Because i'm if I can let you in on one piece of information that really led me here was after my my separation from my last relationship, I met someone and. I. went. 100% like wanting to start like a new relationship and in it was a lot of like negative like a rejection."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16583.0,Patient,"How I view myself what in a negative way. mm hmm I think. meeting that person. Open up my eyes to a lot of things that I probably need to work on and also, at the same time understanding why i'm the way I am because when I met him I was like attached like I was like okay. You know, so I wouldn't say moving from one relationship to the next, because my last relationship we kind of separated like a year ago, and we did our own things so. yeah. That got me in a big depression and far out of control, was the very last person that I I."
759.0,Provider,Thought yeah because of the rejection and just feeding yourself like a two way. yeah so after that you went to drew like a spiral. hmm Arlene down okay.
16583.0,Patient,Like major depression like mental breakdown. that's why i'm here.
759.0,Provider,"yeah that's understandable. yeah to go through something like that you know, like in yeah like you like, you said you want to learn more about your emotions and your feelings and of why you, you know feel certain way, you know and to understand yourself a little bit better. yeah yeah, which is something we can definitely work on. All right, well, we have reached the end of questions for me, do you have any questions. yeah in the questions I have for you do you have any questions for me."
16583.0,Patient,"No, I just i'm just unsure if it would be you that i'm going to be continuing my therapy session with. Yes, yeah."
759.0,Provider,"yeah we will be doing our one on one. And we see it, for twice a month."
16583.0,Patient,I think I had another appointment for December 13 but i'm not sure I just saw that in my email but that's like.
759.0,Provider,8pm 8pm that's weird.

759.0,Provider,that's next Monday. So. Let me see if we have weekly sessions hold on. But it shouldn't be at 8pm it should be at 8am so i'm gonna have to change that for you. If that works if this time works well for you.
16583.0,Patient,um do you have another time for me.
759.0,Provider,"um let me see so it looks like we're supposed to be meeting twice a month. So twice a month not weekly. i'm wondering why they had to know that's for Mary appointment with Mary. but either way you like to change that right i'll just have them change it, and we can be.
