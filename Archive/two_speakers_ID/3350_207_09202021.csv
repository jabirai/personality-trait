207.0,Provider,How are you.
3350.0,Patient,"i'm doing okay. I got real good sleep last night. Nice. Real good night. see him get tired now so. It Ray she likes to be walked around in a circle around in the kitchen to help or go to sleep so i'm getting ready to do that i'm like well mommy's give a start a meeting, but she even went straight to her stroller and said, be upbeat."
207.0,Provider,And you're not be happy.
3350.0,Patient,yeah. yeah mommy said the lights also they're not Nice. How you been today.
207.0,Provider,pretty good thanks for asking how was everything with you and. All the things going on at home.
3350.0,Patient,Well Greg a one two COR. So you got one more step to getting it done over was the end.
207.0,Provider,What do you mean.
3350.0,Patient,To get like because evie went after him to visit n. and Like fancy Elizabeth but the children service worker blab to abby and said. That Greg letting her real dad this whole time she's out Greg was a real dad.
207.0,Provider,What do you mean.
3350.0,Patient,"cuz. abby is not greg's biological child. Now, and he's took care of her like see it, this whole time he's took care of. And I forgot to give you, your above i'm sorry i'm horrible that. The. The tone, the tone services lady that and they told abby. So I have you seen seen almost 17 just now finding out that Greg is not her real dad because the tone services lady blab it to her. Integrity crazy."
207.0,Provider,wow so what so what made them tell her that.
3350.0,Patient,"He was in the courtroom like the one before that the judge in Dutch told Greg he didn't have to show for that, but he had to get a lawyer so someone's there present for him and. And I guess it somehow came up in core I can't remember i'm trying to think it came up in court, and the Court room that day and instead of telling heavy excuse me out of the courtroom they just by the way or another."
207.0,Provider,"Also, so the mom never told her so she does she realized that she."
3350.0,Patient,"may know her real time i'm not at all. I don't think Greg knows I think Greg things it's like a she cheated on him, one of the times that he was on the road, because there's together about a year and a half. Before abby was born, so I think she and he says he thinks she cheated on him and somehow got pregnant. I don't know if he knows who it is. But. This whole time he's been taking care of her why would you do that, to a 16 year old child that's already going through mental health issues. So Greg. went to the next court date, I think that was on the 14th and he waited until then to say anything to the children services woman he waited till they got in front of the judge that way That was my first reaction was what the judging. Okay, I only told three people, and I know the two other ones, then stay where do. I need to other people that are only knew it was me and his mom. But no, no, no. No Shannon and those are not."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so when she found out that he was a real bad what was."
3350.0,Patient,"I guess she broke down crying and. Because this whole time she's like thinking greg's your biological real father, I see this, I guess, he started crying she the judge said she did kind of get. emotional and kind of mad in a way that said 10 a whole bunch of emotion."
207.0,Provider,A lot of emotions experience.
3350.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So I mean and that's something that you'll have to take up or hurt her mom I mean, most of them, because it shows his commitment to her and his love."
3350.0,Patient,For her that I want to do all.
207.0,Provider,"But at the same time it's some level of this. Honesty that she never knew that he. He knew it was she she wasn't his job. So it's a lot of a lot of emotions, the process and to deal with, but that's definitely something she would have to take up with her mom because i'm sure her mom knew. rob and I think you know if she is she does have a counselor now she would that you know that's something to process with her counselor as well. You know. In the same so, what was the the outcome of. But, but even if you're a real brother, because they share the same mother."
3350.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. My name is Elizabeth St related to her at all."
207.0,Provider,So um so she said that she tried to she petitioned the Court. To be able to stand up and.
3350.0,Patient,"And the lawyers only trying to get great contempt of court because he knows he said no, so what he told them is i'll ask him and i'll think about it and he's like but it better be supervised and. The job services, ladies, not to leave the room, does it say leaves the room for one second and. One of them could say another lie, have you can say another life I know involved in on it, because she's very good."
207.0,Provider,"But, but I think that this. could possibly change a lot of things for her. Because now you're coming head to head with this person who let's just go to the narratives like you know she is has been lying on him and saying all of these things that are not inaccurate because she wants to see her mom. This changes the perspective for her, because now you're finding out that this man is not your father. And Ryan has been taken care of you, and have been doing all these things for you now, you could you go with you know he is the liar and whatever it is that you want to go. Or you could go with I can't believe that i've done. All of these things to this man who has remained committed to me for the last 16 years while my mom lives her life and did her thing, so it just really depends on in. direction, so you know she may try to poison in or she may it may be something different, because now coming like you said it's a lot of emotion that she was."
3350.0,Patient,Is I couldn't imagine limb for 16 years living with somebody I felt was my real dad and one day as i'm almost an adult I find out that he's not.
207.0,Provider,"it's a sticky situation is the hardest a sticky situation i've worked with someone that was like that, where. The person was completely committed to the child from day one new new the whole time I mean he it wasn't it wasn't necessarily a cheating, but it was just so the child, and I remember being told me being pulled that the child did not know. Right and so, and they don't want the child to know now again that's a choice, why Why did he he or the mother never make her aware what was the reason why they never make her aware."
3350.0,Patient,well.
207.0,Provider,that's a discussion that. When she's ready for that conversation to be had and maybe seeking counseling for them. Through that process.
3350.0,Patient,But.
207.0,Provider,"She could just look at it and just you know you lied to me all my life or she can look at it. That way, and just said, you know I appreciate that you've done all that you've done for me throughout the years."
3350.0,Patient,yeah right right right right.
207.0,Provider,"So, but where are you in terms of. In terms of everything moving forward for you personally outside of the kids I have them."
3350.0,Patient,"Well i'm i'm gonna be signing up for online ged classes. I just gotta find my computer because I just my computer to my mom's and it's in a room that has not only my stuff in it, but my brother's like stuff that after he passed mom got and it's like so I gotta go through a ton of stuff to see what bags. Are which bag I just got to try and find my suitcase because I think I threw it in one of my suitcases that's there. And I gotta find my laptop so that way, if you get signed up work."
207.0,Provider,Are you going to just continue trying to work through the relationship until.
3350.0,Patient,yeah cuz I was like if I do anything about that now. i'll be. i'll be like running into a brick wall.
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3350.0,Patient,"And I know I won't get nowhere, you know I mean."
207.0,Provider,So it basically. staying where you are where you are.

207.0,Provider,And then try to work.
3350.0,Patient,"yeah because she's pretty young and I don't want to one time, I see loves handmade products her part to. deal with you know what I mean."

207.0,Provider,"fun not fun I think that's an effective plan um did in find out that. When he found out about the biological Peter, how did he take that."
3350.0,Patient,"I don't know because I wasn't the one who told him I think I don't even know Greg said anything to him about it or not, I don't think so nothing cuz. it's not my place to."
207.0,Provider,hmm. Maybe that's something that he needs it's it's a consideration to have that conversation with and because you don't want her to drop that moment in.
3350.0,Patient,My life.
207.0,Provider,"Because, then it will be what will be her motive behind dropping a bomb."
3350.0,Patient,"Right right. I know, sometimes I just. Trying to go, but my place to. say something when it's not it's kind of hard, especially when. it's like not something i'm really dealing with headfirst he has to deal with it, you know, and I mean. God i'm trying to do to help him through it support them. And I don't know, sometimes I probably get out the wrong answer. founder sign a look out for everyone. we've been doing pretty good like that. It so that way I can get my boy good birthday, to now, I have to house all decorated and I love to decorate, especially for like birthdays and stuff like that I love it great. i'm just trying to like i'm just going to try and lighten the mood with the airport, you know what I mean."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm I.
3350.0,Patient,"don't know what else to do. No, no, I. don't know what I need to get for his cake yet either i've been trying to think of that."
207.0,Provider,"I mean, so when do you hope to start doing your own."
3350.0,Patient,"Well, what i'm planning on doing is going over there, and instead of me just looking have like mom or dad help me look too so it's just. Not one person going to find the because i'm for sure they going to send my Green suitcase it's just moving the bags that are on top of it to get to the green suitcase the and my laptop out. So i'm going to do that soon as I get that laptop because other than that we don't have nothing because I don't know if I can get it done all of it done through my phone think that's enough. What do you call it. enough space to work with on your phone trying to do papers and stuff you know what I mean."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3350.0,Patient,Well you'd go to to get it. You took it out there with you.
207.0,Provider,"Okay sounds like a plan um. I think one of the things we talked about in our last session is knowing the pros and cons of you know what you want to do, moving forward and did you, you had your time to think about that next."
3350.0,Patient,"yeah. But i'm not very good on. You say i'm not very good i'm guessing which ones. Like some of them are hard to decide for work on. Especially when I. When I think about Elizabeth with that. don't care, I can get through it, but her feelings only have one ban it at a time, you know what I mean. mm hmm I see love them to death. So i'm trying to. As soon as I get the DVD and then get a job i'm trying to think I know a lot of places are hiring because of covert unknowns wanting to go back to work, but. Trying to think of what i'm wanting to do once I get through it and and get to God I don't know if that's called a diploma or certificate I don't know what."
207.0,Provider,Is in lieu of. A high school diploma.
3350.0,Patient,"Right right. Because I haven't gone back to where I started I quit pretty much grade wise in the ninth grade, and then I physically quit and, like the 10th grade."
207.0,Provider,"I think it's you know you're you're you're at a good place, I think. you're at a. Good place in terms of. You know what it is that you, you want to do."
3350.0,Patient,yeah i'm not so emotional.
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. I think a lot of that a lot of that came, but you were feeling that time it was a lot of the stress of. You know what was going on. yeah and the feeling of. rejection or just not getting the attention."
3350.0,Patient,Like right.
207.0,Provider,So. It sounds to me like you're in a pretty good place.
3350.0,Patient,Time to kind of process all of it. Do my wusa. is about out. take a long time. Okay. yeah we have another appointment it's on the 28th at 12.

3350.0,Patient,"As I thought I had to meet they told me, I had to meet with you twice a month."
207.0,Provider,yeah I don't but we didn't we meet twice this is our second meeting the room.
3350.0,Patient,"Well, I think I. was a no so on the last one, because I just Greg was leaving that day and I was trying to get him ready and. get him going on the road, so I like getting like it wasn't his clothes and packing his dad he because he's usually while he's home since he's been quite busy well he's home. I try and make sure all those clothes and stuff for clean and daddies pack, and as the whole time he's been home he's been working on is chuck. is on the road, he had two tires blow up on this last run and it wasn't Jesus climbing he wants to Louisiana on this last one. So I don't like to get I helped him because he's busting butt on a semi on Have you ever tried it lives it semi it's over it's not very like."
207.0,Provider,"yeah no I see it, I see I see. And I think you had a few minutes group so okay all right so then i'll check back in with you, and then you know I. I would, I would like to do is even though it's going to be a week out, I still want you to you know we put you just talked about the you know the progress you're working towards getting your your your ged so you put that plan and play. In motion go get the get go try to get the computer up and running and see how you can go about this when you having a start date and then we'll once you have a start date then we'll work on a plan of how you're going to work on it diligently. To achieve it and if ultimately your end goal. is to. If your end goal is to transition on your own then it's to work on that are in or it's not what is it. What created. What you. Feed your mind. What caused you to. Okay. Okay, so but think about it, because I know it sounds to me that the time that we've been working together, you do get you know you become like. How would say when it comes on to Greg and everything else that's going on with him and the kids you become hyper focused on that, and then you want. To the sound like you do. You stop it and you just push that to the side, and I want you to realize that you've pushed it to the side, then you get overwhelmed emotionally and then it's back on I need to focus on Lisa and what Lisa one and then step into that focus on doing what. I want, then something happens to Greg and the kids or whatever is going on with Greg and then Lisa so it's kind of like it's the same thing you're going with this. And I want you to this week really just continue on them that that trend of. trying to get your ged, but if you feel between now and next week, when we meet you feel like you know what i'm having a change your hardest I think i'm really going to unless talk about that what what is causing okay. All right, then so i'll see you on Thursday."
