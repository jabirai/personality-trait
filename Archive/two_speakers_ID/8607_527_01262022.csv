527.0,Provider,"hi this is Andrea, this is an individual session for me oh Connie. hi Jay how are you."
8607.0,Patient,i'm well.
527.0,Provider,i'm doing okay thanks. yeah well. how's things been going on. what's up with school fill me in.
8607.0,Patient,"i'm still on leave of absence, Mr."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, all right well fill me in your camera's not on."
8607.0,Patient,that's weird.
527.0,Provider,yeah we'll fill me in on what's going on school.
8607.0,Patient,"Well, for now i'm just studying from home because, while i'm on leave, I have to remain at home until you know unclear to go back."
527.0,Provider,"So, what are you thinking as far as timeframe. Or what are they thinking as far as timeframe."
8607.0,Patient,"That depended on us like with me presenting that. i'm good to go. With the proof for my doctor and. I did give them a letter of some kind, and they said it would be later on April that I should be able to return."
527.0,Provider,How are you feeling about that that's not too much further out.
8607.0,Patient,"And it gives me time to study, work to make a little extra income. Okay, so, in the meantime and trying to look for remote work but i'm considering just managing with my last job of employment. I just have to make a quick phone call to find out if i'm still in their systems because it took me a while to finish my training."
527.0,Provider,What kind of work were you doing before.
8607.0,Patient,Its service and involves me serving people who are affected by the fires.
527.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully you're still in the system, and they can that can be an easy transition. Here mm hmm. yeah. yeah how are you feeling do you feel like going back in April you're going to be in a in a good space to tackle school again and stay on top of things."
8607.0,Patient,"Or, aside from just relaxing i'm also going to be working on myself personally. talked about before my goals are focus and goal achievement. i'm just trying to get myself. mentally physically. As well as spiritually healthy. So that lane. When things come up, I remember my goal graduation when people want to try to discourage me don't even give them the time of day. And what I have to work with people who I don't like just be firm and say listen, I understand that you might feel a certain way with working with me and I don't fully understand what's going on with you personally, unless you feel comfortable sharing that with me. This is a job, we have to do. We have to do it well because we're being graded on how well we do are not only assignments, but coming into class and respecting our fellow students. So if you can adhere to that, then we're going to be fine, but if you can't hear to those type of. commitments, then I have no problem talking to the teacher and requesting that we can work with other people. But I don't want to. Talk to that. Because the teacher wants us to resolve our own issues."
527.0,Provider,"or so. which makes sense, definitely trying to use your conflict resolution skills, with one another."
8607.0,Patient,And if you don't mind me asking is your question okay.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I had coven last week ej so i'm I was off work a couple days and i'm yeah i'm still recovering so but i'm back i'm back this week so yeah so I yeah I probably sound a little funny still."
8607.0,Patient,so well. anything. Usually serves I thought oh did she have a sore throat or something.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i'm i'm still recovering this week so, but much better than last week."
8607.0,Patient,Okay i'll be praying for you.
527.0,Provider,And thanks ej yeah each days each day is getting better so that's good. yeah.
8607.0,Patient,that's good.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, good well So how are you doing as far as progress on your goals your personal goals."
8607.0,Patient,"With you i've been kind of just resting or you haven't started working at so in terms of increasing my income haven't been doing a lot much of that as of yet. I keep my goals in electronic files, as well as a notebook. So I can. review them, and I find that. When you keep things in mind, they stay in place and it's almost like magic kind of I don't believe in magic, but things just become aware. That things that can do things that can say. Things and implement but i'm honestly i'm still working on that because I haven't done that, as frequently as I did before, when I was in. previous positions I guess part of is because for the first time in a while I just feel like i'm just working. And i'm not thriving where even if i'm not where I want to be, I have joy because i'm making progress. i'm being looked to for. For motivation for an example. So I guess. i'm just trying to encourage myself and to no longer just be motivated but be driven that. Even if I don't feel like doing something i'm going to discipline myself to do it anyway so. You could almost call it to the Vegas."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm so what what motivates the drive for you. Like, how do you how do you move from that place. From encouraged encouraging to jerk to more driven."
8607.0,Patient,"When I see some type of end in mind. I feel motivated like. I could live a life, where. Finances aren't an issue. When i'm utilizing my gifts and talents. Whether it be for problem solving or taking ideas in mind and making making them a true reality. Like being able to get into the fine arts, one day, but I figured doing something in the heart, science, or something that can guarantee or almost guaranteed money. put that in savings and then, once i'm a little bit more settled, then they can start devoting time and that led to things that may not make money right away, but the skills develop. The opportunities will present themselves I guess. Does that make sense."
527.0,Provider,It does yeah yeah.
8607.0,Patient,"So long story short, I guess the motivation, I have is keeping the right vision, when you have the right vision in mind. You find you're motivated because. You care about that vision. You want to see it come to pass."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. sure. how's your family as far. As supporting you with all of this to ej and.
8607.0,Patient,"My family wants me to finish my nursing program well. known capable they see that I have the ability to do it, I just have to. be consistent. In all honesty, being on this program made me really look back on previous opportunities and if I got a second chance, I would have gone back and just done, that well like if I really knew a year now. man. cool and just. focus on engineering or focus on right right, and then I could focus on engineering, but no I focused on mathematics. Certainly, for. doing the equations and not here to look back on the past, unless something good I remind myself hey be grateful, you got an you got an opportunity that not everyone gets. you've been acknowledged by not just one, but two colleges, you make connections with people. So I guess i'm just hoping that. The same goals, I have when I was a kid I still are relevant. and I guess what motivates me is the idea that I can create my own lifestyle. Where i'm not going to be limited simply because the phones are low, for now, or it's easy to look at someone else and saying man this guy's doing really well but. i'm really thankful for. My group for the group I mean she tells group because. i'm hearing, where people are in life. Like one trying to be a physician's assistant and other people they're successful have a successful marriage and going on and i'm like man i'm happy for them, but now I have for myself to."
527.0,Provider,Share yeah so has your vision what's your the difference between your vision board when you were little and now you're in your vision board now any any changes.
8607.0,Patient,"Well, I didn't expect to have a vision board, I would just take a notebook write down. Everything I want to achieve in life and just keep looking over it."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8607.0,Patient,So. How young were you when.
527.0,Provider,You started that.
8607.0,Patient,Probably grade school. To begin to right.
527.0,Provider,uh huh yeah. hmm.
8607.0,Patient,"I haven't looked at that notebook in a while. If it goes. not exactly specific because I didn't put a deadline in front of it. Sure um. But. I guess you could say I wrote my journal goals in a style where it seems impossible, but the goal is to keep it firmly in line and to teach your mind that this is possible. It might not. feel it possible now, but it is possible and then within time you're going to figure out the how. The how comes after the what. More importantly. Or why, but why do I want to achieve everything i'm motivated by the love of God i'm motivated by serving other people, but most of all i'm motivated because I haven't heard go. Create type of reality that people only came about because they think dreams are just for fantasy they're not going to do anything and I did disagree, because i've experienced enough life people that say why didn't you give up why even alive today I say, because I have a purpose."
527.0,Provider,And i'm not gonna let tragedy.
8607.0,Patient,Disappointment or even.
527.0,Provider,us.
8607.0,Patient,Oh.
527.0,Provider,"Oh, I lost you there for a second ej."
8607.0,Patient,OK.
527.0,Provider,"I can hear you now. I still can't see you, but I can hear you."
8607.0,Patient,You can see. Hello.
527.0,Provider,yeah I can I can hear ya I can't see you though.
8607.0,Patient,Oh you're frozen and hear everything that you said.
527.0,Provider,yeah we must be having some connection issues. yeah I hope.
8607.0,Patient,She got a working again.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I know you keep disappearing, I was like. There you are."
8607.0,Patient,yeah I just change wi fi guys.
527.0,Provider,"There you go. yeah. we'll get so we were talking about your just your vision, when you were little and and what keeps you going when people question like what keeps you going so. that you have a purpose that's that's a big statement, a lot of people can't say that you know they struggle with finding their purpose."
8607.0,Patient,"And for me, I wanted my purpose to sort of evolved that serve simple that my purpose is to serve God and others and to bring honor to him and his name. And my faith is that whatever it is that he purposed for me it it's going to be something that's worth the sacrifice it'll be something that. will allow me to have fun it's just going to be full of so much life that I don't have to worry, because we know that there's an awesome end game."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. Good good motivator for others to I think that helps you know you were mentioned, you know hearing others in your in your group, but I think it's also you do a good job of sharing and and I think motivating others in the group to."
8607.0,Patient,Thank you. I had practice.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. Well i'm glad you're taking some time for yourself and kind of sorting things out and figuring out where school fits in and what you need to do to feel. You know, good about returning and and what you can you know setting yourself up for successes, when you go back and so i'm glad to glad to hear you're looking at all of that, for yourself."
8607.0,Patient,Thanks.
527.0,Provider,yeah. yeah what all do you have to have done before you return in April.
8607.0,Patient,"They didn't technically assign me anything but if this opportunity, it gives me a chance to get ahead. You know kind of the textbooks study material. But this is very this material ahead of time i'll be ahead of the game."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8607.0,Patient,"Which is what I really wanted so. Sure, it could be a blessing in disguise."
527.0,Provider,yeah definitely yeah.
8607.0,Patient,"And I already declared to my teacher, though, to be the top student, which I could have kept it to myself. And said i'd. be able to do it for sure. I just didn't aim for at least."
527.0,Provider,I get.
8607.0,Patient,The ambitious nature in me that wants to achieve great things tend to sometimes let other people know.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah you let the cat out the bag.
8607.0,Patient,"i'm learning. As he goes to share i'm still a kid at heart that's still can't help, but when I talk about a good thing when he hears it. ensures or with others, I guess."
527.0,Provider,Share definitely how's your sister doing in the Program.
8607.0,Patient,"she's still in it so. pressing forward. it's just. that some of my classmates name may have changed their behavior because I was around back then, so they knew that if they stay did or try anything on my sister, then I would know about it. But now that i'm not there i'm hearing people say. You happy that you just chillin at home. Just these sideways comments that's like wow. i'm glad I didn't tell them anything because. If they don't really know my situation and act like that I can only imagine what they would say and do when I when they didn't know what was going on."
527.0,Provider,Right yeah.
8607.0,Patient,"And besides, I find it interesting that they care, all of a sudden that i'm not there but they didn't really show much appreciation, when I was there."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8607.0,Patient,"But again i'm not trying to critique another person is saying I, I can see a shallow person from a mile away. Because you can see genuineness when usually in a person."
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah yeah yeah I think it's you know, and when you have those personal problems arise it's okay to have those boundaries for yourself and. And not share any information if you don't want to you know, and especially if you're not sure how it's going to be, you know used is it going to be used in a supportive way, or is it going to like you said you know kind of you know sideways comments or you know. made to you know put you down because that's not the intention of this time for yourself."
8607.0,Patient,"yeah. that's fine, I have a feeling part of is because people are secretly jealous and I was going to said it was someone else who's actually familiar with this program. And they're like. jealous because of the age that myself and my sister are and maturity level, we have, and they didn't do the same thing when they were our age, so they have a way of just looking down on the site. you're this old and you're this mature and you didn't have to make any of the mistakes, I made and the lessons that I had to learn, because a lot of classmates we have our parents or old enough to be parents so. Maybe they look a little bit different from a single folk who are so making their way in the world."
527.0,Provider,"shy shy but shouldn't have to be penalized because of that either you're all in this together, like, how can we support one another through this program versus you know, cutting each other down."
8607.0,Patient,"True, but with you, being in your current position. i'm sure. Some people made you feel like feel bad for being the smart woman in the room yeah I mean."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well and I was, I was the older person in the school in the classroom you know when other others were just fresh out of college too so yeah i've been in that role of the older students as well."
8607.0,Patient,"Well, you don't come across it so whatever you do."
527.0,Provider,don't look old to you ej.
8607.0,Patient,"you're one of us, because, like you have a way of relating with people, which is a great quality I when you're in this field, so thank you for."
527.0,Provider,"That I appreciate that Thank you yeah. Well, good well i'm glad to hear things are going well and you're feeling much more stable and rested and feel like you got a clear direction for yourself."
8607.0,Patient,"You know yeah I just gotta ask did you ever have those lumps seasons, where you just find this easy not to do anything. That you rather. just sit back. And that's usually not your personality, but all of a sudden, you kind of feel that way."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, I think, just use like it like you're kind of doing right now using this time to evaluate things like where where Am I at with myself where Am I at in life. My goals, like in do they need to shift and change at all, am I am I in the path that I feel driven you know and motivated to keep moving in, or is there something else that's maybe pushing me in a different direction. And it's sometimes you know, sometimes hard to sit in that space and in really do like a self inventory with yourself, and you know. Evaluating where where i'm at emotionally, like all the areas that you're looking at spiritually emotionally financially, you know just kind of evaluating each of those areas."
8607.0,Patient,Okay. Thank you.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And sometimes it is you know i've i've definitely taken a different career path, at times, you know and tried, something you know, I was like you know, maybe I need to try this for a while. And so I you know I did some different things in my career just to have new experiences or different experiences and trying to figure things out like where where are the areas that I feel most successful in and and more passionate about. mm hmm. But I also, but I also need to make money because I have to, I have to support myself so. You know so some of those you have to have to weigh a lot of things like pros and cons and. How will, how will this help me in my next step of where I want to go or where I went to be."
8607.0,Patient,"actually got into YouTube as a potential side hustle. i've been motivated multiple times and I was told that I have a nice voice that people want to listen to and. Ironically enough, I was all for it. But I waited because I wanted to make my videos really good. I was trying to balance quality and quantity, should I just put myself out there. And just hope for the best. or stress sort of ease into it and making sure I put my best foot forward in each video. Because i've seen youtubers do both but. Right I wasn't sure how I would fit."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8607.0,Patient,So I guess the struggle is overthinking. And just. Being caroline's and then just going by the seat of your pants and not really thinking with what you post and obviously I know don't do something that's going to ruin your reputation because. People would really trust me when they when they talk and. They know i'm not the type of person to mislead. i've been misled before through social media so.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah yeah I think again it's it's weighing the risk and the benefits of that free you know when you're thinking. And trying not to overthink it but also looking at what are the risks and the benefits here if I if I put this out. Just kind of on the fly like what's the risk and benefits of that you know if I put some thought into it and structure it and really take my time, what are the risks and the benefits of that as well."
8607.0,Patient,Right.
527.0,Provider,And what feels what feels more comfortable to you i'm guessing you probably want to i'm guessing you're the type of person that probably wants to put a little more structure and a little more time into it and present it well versus just kind of something on the fly.
8607.0,Patient,"yeah. But I think a happy meter that since you put it that way is give myself a limit, no matter what, and after you've reached that limit just send a video out just because. You don't want to over analysis over analyze at the same time, you went to get used to finding out what is it going to take to get what you need done."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm sure I like that.
8607.0,Patient,Thank you.
527.0,Provider,So what do you want to put out on YouTube what are you what are you. motivating people on are speaking to people on.
8607.0,Patient,I think i'm going to follow the example of a youtuber named Mohammed even she's this amazing law student who she seems to have it all. she's smart she has beauty she just seems like this capable person I really like to model after and yeah I even hope one day I might be able to connect with her on social media or something. She seems pretty cool.
527.0,Provider,cool.
8607.0,Patient,yeah. we'll see how it goes.
527.0,Provider,"Sir well good you've got a wide range of opportunities out there for you, it sounds like to explore and and look at for yourself."
8607.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm which sometimes can feel a little overwhelming, but sometimes it's good to know that i'm, not just in one little box here, I can i've got lots of ventures, I can explore for myself."
8607.0,Patient,"yeah but because of my family. i'm motivated that I have to do well, I say I don't like seeing people suffer. let alone myself suffering when I can avoid it."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8607.0,Patient,"I guess you could say that's what gave me a sense of justice. But I saw people I care about suffering. And even myself just. In humbling situations can motivated me to want more not necessarily because I deserve it, but it's because. Oh sorry not that i'm entitled like oh I better get this by justin sorry it's more like. This is what I want in life. I know I can go after it, and I know I don't have to step on those to get it. I can simply just help others along the way to my journey to success."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm exactly. I like that yeah.
8607.0,Patient,yeah. Thanks.
527.0,Provider,got a good foundation started here ej that you keep building on so good for you.
8607.0,Patient,"Thanks. I just have to. Make sure I have something concrete to present Besides that, I have an agenda book and a journal."
527.0,Provider,"Well, that you got to have a starting point, though."
8607.0,Patient,what's that old saying. Rome wasn't built in a day.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yes. So you've got your tooth you've got your foundation, so now we're gonna what's The next step to add to that agenda and journal."

8607.0,Patient,"there's tasks into games. and When you are consistent with those Games you level up. high, and when you don't you start to level down."
