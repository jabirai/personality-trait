298.0,Provider,hi Tara.
11612.0,Patient,So sorry that I got the time is wrong and that I am a freak and a psychopath but i'm. i'm very sorry of. At least i'm here now.
298.0,Provider,"Yes, you are and don't use the words like that, because you're not those things. Okay um. So let's talk about your medicine and and how are you feeling and sleeping."
11612.0,Patient,yeah and I just also want to apologize because last time I saw you I supposed to meet you at my sisters and then she wouldn't pick up the phone that that's why I had to go to the cheesecake factory near her and use their wi fi and that's why everything was so chaotic last time.
298.0,Provider,"Yes, that's Okay, I remember."
11612.0,Patient,"So yeah um I have okay I I threw out all my weed last night, because now, when I smoke it it really just makes me tired and that was even before the medication. i'm feeling a little bit drowsy and sleepy throughout the day I don't know if this I did just have my period and that that can sometimes make me feel really tired, too, but um. The anxiety. Is there I. But I think overall i'm getting better like I was able to like think about learning some new drinks and and trying to be a bartender and like trying to. take steps to. You know just feel better in my life, like, I feel like I maybe I have you know I probably have just too much time on my hands and I, you know I need to like get into the world and, like, I feel like i'm a part of something."
298.0,Provider,I don't know good good i'm glad this is the first time i've ever heard you say anything about being a bartender.
11612.0,Patient,"I mean they were just looking for bartenders at this place called the soho house and I just think it's such a fabulous place so I just figured. Why not apply me I probably won't get it, but just like I haven't even been wanting or thinking that. I should do that because of because of you know, because of sex work that I do I think like well really after to get another job on top of that, but the truth is, I don't want to I don't want to do this i'm like I really want to change my circumstances."
298.0,Provider,"Not just take time to get through it, but."
11612.0,Patient,"I do need it, like, I can tell, but I don't know if it's all the correct stuff because, like I said I I get so tired I don't know what it is. And then I told you about the tinnitus which i've been having on and off with the meds and that's I think even started, maybe the first week I I remember that, from a long time ago, when I took Prozac. But."
298.0,Provider,"yeah well we looked it up and Sure enough, you were right um I my Boston I see looked it up and contacted the auditory something or other, and it is a rare side effect of Prozac any ssri can have that effect, we learned. So kudos to you that you figured it out."
11612.0,Patient,"I looked at side effects, and I saw that Prozac can sometimes exaggerate your tonight as if you already have it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so um are you did or did you cut yourself down Where are you at with it taking it."
11612.0,Patient,"No i'm I am totally deferring to you i'm still at the 40 milligrams I feel like you wanted to take me up I I don't know I think about 300 milligrams on the wellbutrin i'm still at 20 milligrams on the pro panel, but I know the. Pro panel, I was reading about this too i'm like trying to figure things out and they were saying that if you had anxiety and not anxiety, if you have. drowsiness or whatever from her panel all that, like doesn't go away after like a week let your doctor know so like i'm letting you know I hope it's. I don't know, maybe it's depression, maybe it's this or that but I do overall i'm definitely feeling way better than I was like two months ago."
298.0,Provider,To go wake up crying.
11612.0,Patient,"Things are hard things are hard but i'm. i'm taking steps to. try to get better, I think, what do you think I should do."
298.0,Provider,"The Prozac if you can endure the tinnitus the Prozac is doing a lot for you, when it comes to. A sadness and anxiety. But if you really want to give up the Prozac. See, I have to be careful with any serotonin replacement medication what your brain is neediness serotonin So how are we going to get serotonin in there when you get tinnitus that's so. that's my struggle is if we don't do this, what if we were to go down is that less tinnitus on the Prozac is it less do you hear it last."
11612.0,Patient,"Of course, right now, what I want I need to hear it, I don't hear it, but."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
11612.0,Patient,"I couldn't hear it, like last night, when I was trying to go to sleep, and so I put on some music and it really does come and go. I don't know if it would be less i'm not sure, maybe us."
298.0,Provider,"So I mean I don't want to keep you on antidepressants forever, but I want to be able to heal your brain and right now Prozac is starting to heal your brain So if you can endure it then any chance you can do to keep going while we're still getting. More serotonin built up in your head, the better. that's my thoughts on that and, as far as propranolol. It very well could be that you just had your period and that's what's causing it. I don't want to change it, because it's working right now, but if it continues, if you tell me again in two weeks, you still have the lethargy, then we should look at something else to control your anxiety okay. i'm a do, are you do, you have enough medication, right now, or do. What."
11612.0,Patient,we're good on that 300 milligrams that's good.
298.0,Provider,"I I see you doing things that you weren't doing before, so I feel like 300 is OK, if you feel like you still want more motivation and drive and energy that's why we would go up to the next level. what's the next level for 50."
11612.0,Patient,But you think i'm okay right well.
298.0,Provider,I do.
11612.0,Patient,"want that counteract that sleepiness maybe but we're not sure, yet we need to maybe."
298.0,Provider,"It would yeah, we need to wait, but it definitely would counteract the sleepiness."
11612.0,Patient,"Do you mind just letting me run to the bathroom and grab my medication, so I can see how much I love, thank you. Okay, I have. Okay, I have very few panels left i've got like maybe 10 left of the pro panel i've got. i've got like maybe 15 left of the world view trends and then I got of the Prozac I probably have like looks like I maybe have like 1520."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and when will you be back in California."
11612.0,Patient,i'm going back tomorrow.
298.0,Provider,Okay um. So.
11612.0,Patient,I spend most of my time in La I just come out to New York every once in a while like to be by coastal but.
298.0,Provider,"My kind of in La. Okay, well, I think we should refill your propranolol which i'm doing right now and. you're well Beatrice and let's just wait a week to see if your energy levels come back if they don't let me know and we'll go up to the next level on your trend. And the the Prozac um you let let's wait, just a few more days to see if you can handle it if not let's go back down to 20 milligrams."
11612.0,Patient,"Okay, so i'm pro panel, let me just say that, so I remember you're gonna do i'm gonna stay on these two and then maybe I just email you after like."
298.0,Provider,"A few days, if we need to change anything yeah."
11612.0,Patient,"Okay, but stay on the panel or twice a day. Yes, Okay, and when you were bringing up the La thing Are you concerned about coverage is that what you asked. yeah yeah what. What do you want to tell me about that."
298.0,Provider,"Is that I don't have a New York license, and so I wanted you to be able to get your medicine and if what when I have patients who are by coastal sometimes i'll have people they know pick up their medicine and put it in the mail and send it to them. yeah yeah if that, if that were to happen."
11612.0,Patient,I picked it up myself last time from the. guys yeah sometimes okay yeah okay.
