9355.0,Patient,"It was anywhere from the ladies, to see the percocet tends to the. The roxy code on 30s."
499.0,Provider,"and during that time, when you were. Using the opiates were there any type of triggers for you are you depressed anxious when you actually have in pain issues that led to that family issues or was it just solely recreational."
9355.0,Patient,And I actually most prescribed it for pain to begin with. And then i'd be dead.
499.0,Provider,And how long have you been on suboxone.

9355.0,Patient,All the above.
499.0,Provider,"Okay okay. And after they stopped being where you prescribe them the entire Tyler at some point where you just getting them from friends and people that have them Okay, yes. And before you got on the suboxone did you have a periods, where you would start taking the opiates."

9355.0,Patient,"Oh, my God i'm cramping nausea. All everything is awful sweating. yawning everything."
499.0,Provider,Any thing else that you can think of that would be helpful for me to know for this assessment.
9355.0,Patient,I can't think of anything I just I know that just like Dr Jackson is. I had the reason I do not the reason that she wanted to see you as because I could I have missed I missed a lot of appointments I have is. And I can't remember anything and then just this the time was the suboxone it versus like making me night.
499.0,Provider,"i'll try to make it, you can like little brain fog or something."
9355.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Good so I don't know what it is, it might be just a boxing could be part of it, I don't know."
499.0,Provider,"Do you have any information on the rate limit, you were take."
9355.0,Patient,"I think I do know that it was the redland was the 1010 milligram. per share with the team, I was is yellow and. And I know that when I took it after I took it for a while it actually I got my system, I could tell the difference in my. My my thinking and. uh huh and getting things done and home during the day, and my schoolwork was actually I could then on time and and. And I don't i've never wanted to take my son like that, because I don't believe that things like that make you better always thinks, you can do it on your own you don't need medicine to do it so. I think that that it actually did help the end adderall to help to except for the fact that he had some side effects to it so."
499.0,Provider,"Okay, but you did not. As far as you could tail you did not experience. Any. Side effects, with the riddle."
9355.0,Patient,"No, I didn't."
499.0,Provider,"So I will like you've been on the medication before so probably most of what i'm about to tell you. You probably heard. Before but I don't know really what your status was at the time when you. When you first two kids so My only concern is that you are currently experiencing some anxiety and lack of sleep, so of course you know cuz he said the adderall did that to you made you further not be able to sleep, so I just want you to be very I guess aware. Of that of those two issues that because Ritalin is a stimulant that it can cause you to. have further insomnia. And to become increasingly. Interesting so so I guess. I would like to see if you have some kind of I guess plan or what's your thoughts on how. What have you tried in the past to improve your improve your sleep."
9355.0,Patient,"um i've tried to. Actually, like get on a schedule."
499.0,Provider,And like if I.
9355.0,Patient,"If I plan my day out. I can. Say okay i'll go to bed at the time and actually try to lay down and. relax at a certain time because it takes me a lot of goes like once I lay down so finally down in trying to relax and then try to go to sleep by certain time that sometimes it helps me and. And then I have to make sure, and just make sure that i'm going to. A quiet place where you know because I like of every little thing, like me, so I just try to make sure that i'm in a good place to sleep and state, so I can stay asleep, and at least get I can get like six hours six hours sleeping i'll get i'll be fine okay."
499.0,Provider,um what time do you currently get up and start your day.
9355.0,Patient,"Nine o'clock. Okay, I tried to."
499.0,Provider,get him back on.
9355.0,Patient,mm hmm.
499.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and so your first activity of the day is that what Tom."
9355.0,Patient,"Well, if i'm we have you know getting on, but if I get it if I don't sleep i'm usually up around five or six maybe eight years, some says saving It is this sporadic."
499.0,Provider,So you have a set schedule that you work on your schoolwork.
9355.0,Patient,"Yes, I tried to like do it in the evening town, but I found out that it's better to touch it in the morning time because my thinking well I my thinking process is a little bit better. And first thing so. yeah I they're trying to get it on the schedule like and and then sometimes i'll do in the morning and in the evening."
499.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you just want to make sure that you i'm with you, having issues with sleeping that you do take it like right when you, you know first get up. So it can have a you know good enough time to kind of start you know, leaving out of your your system in the evening, so that it won't cause you to wake up and i'm Am I correct in. The statement that you are relating your anxiety primarily to your relationship with your mother."
9355.0,Patient,Mostly is.
499.0,Provider,Are there other things that's triggering your anxiety as well.
9355.0,Patient,"I don't know if this suboxone Desi I think it does sometimes I think it and I think that the suboxone sometimes my blood pressure, go up a little bit. Out of us, I think it might be a combination of those two. Those two things."
499.0,Provider,"Do you think starting on a stimulant um I know you really won't know until we put you back on it, do you begin to kind of be manageable."
9355.0,Patient,"I think so because now that i've I don't know, I have to say i've had it and then i've done without it, and then i've had them without it, so I think I can. Now manage it a little better."
499.0,Provider,Do you feel like when you took it before that everything that everything was more manageable yes okay. And so common side effects of stimulants including rid of land with the nervousness like we've already you know talked about trouble sleeping as we've already talked about um stimulants who also make people lose their appetite did you have that issue when you took it the first time.
9355.0,Patient,"No Actually, I think that I, I think I think I ate a little better on it, for some reason."
499.0,Provider,"Okay, it can call some dizziness nausea vomiting and stimulants and also kind of calls kinase so Those are some of the things that you're going to want to definitely look out for. When when you initiate you know the riddle and so, in your chart It shows that possibly your last dosage might have been 20 milligrams."
9355.0,Patient,"Oh OK, I can."
499.0,Provider,"Well that's what i'm saying in your that's what i'm seeing in your in your in your in your chart, but we would definitely start you out going on, like 10 milligrams and then kind of go from there, so what. what's your. routine with right heart health currently what type of are you in therapy, what type of groups are you."
