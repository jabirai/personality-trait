706.0,Provider,"hello, Michelle."
14535.0,Patient,Hello.
706.0,Provider,How are you.
14535.0,Patient,"i'm alright, how are you."
706.0,Provider,"pretty good. All right, so what's been going on since the last time we talked."
14535.0,Patient,"um. And I honestly don't really remember it super well, I think I was still kind of in the detox see parts. But I mean the last week or so. I guess should yesterday asked to get on a little bit higher dose I was kind of being stubborn about I don't know just I was thinking about getting it off getting off through blah blah, so I just jump back on four milligrams a day on suboxone and. yeah I don't know I kind of just felt like I was losing my mind, a little bit, and I also have had a lot of free time which is not a good combination. I did just start working again, which is good um. But yeah it was a very restless kind of I just felt like I was. I was I don't know, I was ready to kind of just check out but I didn't really have the energy to. It was, I guess, a good thing, but. started on a little bit better serve eight milligrams yesterday so also starting week that law work again this week so. yeah hopefully that occupies my brain a little bit more."
706.0,Provider,uh huh so you don't so the medication that you are on wasn't a high enough dose you think that's why you were feeling that way.
14535.0,Patient,um well in conjunction with having a ton of free time it was just a really yeah it was uh. yeah I don't know I mean it definitely wasn't the medications full I don't think but um.
706.0,Provider,"Well, you have to hit your black dose, so to say, for it to actually plug those receptors completely."
14535.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And so, if you haven't had trip lactose then they're not going to be plugged completely you'll still have some of those kind of breakthrough cravings thoughts. Okay withdrawal symptoms stuff like that."
14535.0,Patient,"it's sweaty. I mean i'm kind of a sweaty person, but like that's something where i've been."
706.0,Provider,gap cold sweat enos nazia stomach cramping.
14535.0,Patient,"nausea and stomach cramping yeah I thought that. was actually from the covert shot, the last couple weeks I didn't even really correlate that either."
706.0,Provider,"yeah. let's draw sometimes. You know, having using dreams, I mean there's there's a lot of. A lot of restlessness like you want to crawl out of your skin."
14535.0,Patient,yeah That was the biggest yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So it might have been you just weren't on the right dose and so it's I mean that's good that you communicated that and that you've increased your dose because hopefully that will make a huge difference. yeah but you're you're definitely right having something to do to focus your time on is going to be very beneficial in your recovery journey because it's kind of like the old saying goes, you know. idle hands idle mind is the devil's playground, you have much too much time on your hands and that's what most. Most people that are in recovery will report is like when they went from living. The using lifestyle, to the recovery lifestyle, the one thing that changed is when you are using. you're busy all the time, because you got to figure out where you're going to get to drive higher and pay for your drugs who's going to get them for you. You know all of those things, how are you going to you know manipulate people or by two people, so they don't know that you're doing it, you know all of those things so you're busy all the time, your mind is constantly busy."
14535.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And then you start taking this pill once a day and you don't have to worry about that all day, what do you do with your time."
14535.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know. And if you're not on the right dose you're going to hyper focus on the fact that you're not using anymore and Oh, but I kind of want to because I still don't feel right So what if I just use again, so I can feel better you know and that's constantly."
14535.0,Patient,"yeah and that's kind of where I was hanging is that weird i'm like I really don't actually want to get high, but I just the the feeling of just kind of it's almost like a numbness. yeah I. mean it's yeah it's not a good place to be. So yeah i'm. A little more positive this week. Which is good and."
706.0,Provider,And you didn't have a relapse or anything you were able to stay through it or.
14535.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean, I think that initial day I think I told you, I had, I know, taking biking in that day. yeah yeah. which, in turn, ended up with a nice the suboxone was I had to wait a little bit too for that so. yeah I definitely see why that is not necessarily a band aid. So. yeah lastly yeah so that was kind of good get out of my head at least I mean it did it helped, but the after effect was not. worth it. i'm just a lot that so. um yeah so using doesn't sound fun anymore, which is you know kind of like a weird disappointment in itself, I guess you know. yeah well now what like just the least having. Having something be able to like think about something to get excited about something. And I think that's what I mean I was driving around for this one got coffee and. I was just like thinking about how I was like Oh, I want to go go hang out like making the hood and I was like you know bright sunny day and i'm like why will. It I used to I kind of was trying to like break it down was like, why does that sound comfortable like, why is that i'd like I don't really want to hang out with these people like. I mean there's some comfort there there's a little weird way but. yeah so yeah i'm glad this meeting was good timing."
706.0,Provider,yeah well and I think that's normal so like I said when people go from that using lifestyle to that recovery lifestyle and I know you're very new into the recovery lifestyle what you're feeling all the things are really normal almost like grieving.
14535.0,Patient,The old lifestyle. You like to generate.
706.0,Provider,excitement and the chase and they felt something to look forward to.
14535.0,Patient,"yeah yeah what's weird is I late, I don't know I guess I. there's i've only used like went back to that area like twice over the past year, so I guess it doesn't feel I don't know why it's still feel so maybe it's because it I don't know yeah anyways. it's."
706.0,Provider,"I think it's okay to say that when you are using you do. You have probably some like not so great memories of how life was but there's probably at certain times that things were fine, you know that you were just like partying it up having a good time. You know, like being with people and sometimes you attach those memories to certain areas or certain songs or certain things like that."
14535.0,Patient,"Okay yeah yeah. it's weird I know all this, but sometimes it's like hear it for the first time again, or something. In just. yeah they're all familiar things, which is why i'm like yeah yeah yeah i'm not like. yeah are you i'm just like. Okay, you know but."
706.0,Provider,"Sometimes you just need to kind of hear it have those reminders over and over until it sticks. Because part of the your journey of recovery is when you're using you change the chemistry of your brain you change the pathways of your brain your brain doesn't think the way that it used to. Prior to using So then, when you go into recovery, you have to recreate those pathways in your brain to think in a different way. And that just and that takes repetition, and that takes reminders and that takes a lot of effort to stop and think and process before you make a decision. Because before it was always this is how this happened, or this is how I feel so i'm just going to use it wasn't even like a question, it was like a one way path to the drug. yeah now you have to divert from that path and go down a different path and say okay well what am I feeling, why do I feel this way, how can I fix this situation. Do I really want this kind of all the things that you went through when you're like I want to go hang out in the hood and you're like but Do I really. You know and That just shows that you're changing those pathways of your brain you're changing those thinking patterns. And the reason that you're able to do that is because the medication that you're on are plugging those receptors in your brain that are craving the opiates. And so, as long as those are plugged it allows you to reform those pathways of the brain, because you can focus on, you know rebuilding that thinking process rather than focusing on how do I not get SEC."
14535.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah there's kind of three difference, even just between yesterday I didn't i'm getting my prescription until pretty late. start to make sure I got that first, before I started but yeah it's definitely don't I just feel a little less on edge already today so that's good see that a little bit different stuff."
706.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so I mean and and that's a good thing when that you can identify what's getting a little bit better because, even just a little progress is still progress."
14535.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah. it's such doing your sit in the same spot for two weeks, yes, but yeah yeah."
706.0,Provider,"So, and the best way to kind of get through, like those beginning phases of that like weird feeling of like limbo don't feel quite right, but don't feel bad. Just kind of like that uneasy feeling that you've been feeling is to literally structure your day very structured by i'm going to do this at this time, this at this time, this at this time. even down to the smallest things like you're going to get up at this time maker benefits time eat breakfast at this time and literally have like a. kind of like what they do in preschool like where they have like storytime and nap time and, like all of that so so it's, and that is so, the kids know what's coming. And it's good for you like you can look at it and say okay at this time I do this and then at this time i'm going to do this and you really hyper focus on that schedule, because you want to follow it. And what happens as you follow each one of those activities of daily living all day long and then you're at the end of the day. And once you're at the end of the day, that's one more day under your belt that you have in recovery and then you get up the next day, and you do it again. Because it's really a day by day process in the beginning, sometimes hour by hour and that's why, if you specifically schedule your day. On to do things at very specific times that's where your focus will be hugely Okay, well, I have to eat lunch at this time and I have to. You know, do some self care right read a book or whatever at this time and and you just know exactly how your day is going to go yeah worry about anything else in between, and you know, once you get through your whole schedule for the day that day is over. You know so and that really helps in the beginning, because otherwise your mind can hyper focus on other things so working is an excellent distraction because. While you're at work, obviously you're not going to leave work to go use, you know so it's going to keep you focused on a task and that, in addition, with structure to your day structuring your sleep structuring your meals."
14535.0,Patient,is going to be really.
706.0,Provider,Will to you for your body to get back to normal.
14535.0,Patient,"yeah I got to work on the diet, two things something not now like diet, I mean like my meals and food habits are terrible."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
14535.0,Patient,yeah and i'm sure that's not. at all.
706.0,Provider,"No, but it's not uncommon either because. You know when you're using when you need before. You know, and I don't eat if you're hungry, but you just eat what you want, and then you're fine whatever but. Now that you're in recovery, you want to make sure you get you have good sleep hygiene, which means that you get enough sleep that you're getting good sleep, you know, good quality sleep. And that also you know you're having good food hygiene, which is the same thing, just like. Good quality food, because you really have to read you're rebuilding your your health again you're rebuilding your body again because anybody who is in that using lifestyle isn't thinking about their health and are helpful really tank."
14535.0,Patient,You know yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And so now you have a chance to build it back up and the easiest way to do that, I always tell people is, if you have a crock pot Google a crock pot recipes."
14535.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And you can just throw stuff in a crock pot let it let it cook all day super easy and it's done when you come home from work or whatever, and you eat. And it's a well balanced good meal like you throw some. meats and veggies whatever you can make lasagna and those things now that you can do all kinds of stuff. And so there's so many different recipes and so you know that's that's always a fun thing to do is be able to try like new things, and you know, instead of passing crackpots are my favorite thing on the planet, because i'm so busy I need to be able to throw. Something and what it this machine cook it for me and then."
14535.0,Patient,I don't know like.
706.0,Provider,i'm not one of those like stay at home moms like spend three hours cooking dinner that's that's that's not me I don't have.
14535.0,Patient,to know. Low oh.
706.0,Provider,"um so yeah I just you want to be, you know cognizant of your time and then also cognizant of the nutrition. And then another option which is kind of cool and and if you've ever tried it and I don't know what your financial situation is, but those meals that come in the mail that you come like."
14535.0,Patient,"I did that, for a while they are great. I loved it um yeah once I get back in that little get some money back in the bank that's definitely a good thing. Because the other thing that I fight with fighting or i'm sorry I don't know I just said what I fight with cooking. Is I don't like I like the actual cooking process but have being single now I like living alone it's become like. More of this like thing that I really like inside where I like I just like claps when I see when i'm like packing up my topper where's for like myself. Like I it's like i'm looking at like my life from like the outside, for two seconds and i'm like this angle, like one was like that has one too many cats in our apartment and like to too many like i'm just like a little, and you know."
706.0,Provider,The old cat lady is how.
14535.0,Patient,"You have become that person in my neighborhood unfortunately yeah my cat had kittens and. I already had to but then she one of them have like she has a little heart murmur so i've been trying to be like get rid of her on that contingent, but nobody wants broken kitten so these like now here and i'm like yeah it's it's a lot but."
706.0,Provider,Well pets are good therapy so.
14535.0,Patient,"yeah around you, you know. You can't hear you. I can't hear you. Oh there now I can."

14535.0,Patient,Oh there it is. oh nine what's going on that's weird.
706.0,Provider,So yeah I mean having your pets that I think is is there is healthy and therapeutic.
14535.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
706.0,Provider,"You know, because of the better because I mean think about this, if you didn't have your animals you'd be alone that'd be even worse."
14535.0,Patient,Oh yeah it's not good. yeah my dog in particular uh huh my buddy.
706.0,Provider,see your dogs and your cats get along.
14535.0,Patient,"yeah they like it's the ones that adore him he's a little little more like kind of like less trusting of. As they come up they want he's scared of their little needle fingers you. know so the ones I want to be affectionate he usually like doesn't play as much with, but the one that is like old and kind of on the grumpier side, he likes mess with. yeah."

706.0,Provider,"But he's like probably 4040 pounds and he's not really grown that much so, I think this is probably his full size but. Oh, my God she's energy. yeah. I mean, I know much energy."
14535.0,Patient,"How do you do, you have like a yardley so you can let them run in or something."
706.0,Provider,"No, I haven't we have a yard, but. I live in iowa so the duration show hit last year, have you heard about that it was like a land hurricane that hit iowa. Nearly 140 mile an hour winds. And that lasted like an hour, so it was like a hurricane, but on land and it's called a Drake show came out at the middle of nowhere, it took out like I think they said, like 70% of the trees in the area were gone. So a tree fell and hit the side of my house and my deck and it took out the fence and i'm still waiting to get the fence replaced, because there was so many places that last fences groups. I ever like you can't find anybody to do it yeah you just get put on a list there's so many friends does that have to be replaced be is literally hundred and 40 mile an hour winds for an hour, and I mean."
14535.0,Patient,we're talking.
706.0,Provider,"Houses you know we're like rips were taken off and flipped over and trees were down we didn't have power for like 10 days. yeah. It was it was really crazy and I was home because I worked from home and I had my kids here, because it was last August and oh my gosh it was so scary."

706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah we have a lot of tornadoes and stuff but. yeah it was a tornado but it lasted almost an hour, and so a tornado comes and goes. And so I mean it was. It was scary yeah if you're ever bored look up the iowa ratio because it's the pictures and stuff that you see, I mean trees giant huge trees that have been there for 100 years. Out of the ground roots and all and just laying on their side with like all of the earth still attached to them."
14535.0,Patient,"that's insane I can't live in that I guess, I was kind of getting high a little bit still. Like. For instance, the world."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely yeah look it up look it up. yeah it had hard rapids iowa area got slammed they're still doing, I mean people are still rebuilding people still don't have rugs. yeah yeah."
14535.0,Patient,"i'll have to send tell so my Michigan contract your friends Tom up there, I don't think. yeah seriously I do know, I mean we do travel out."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I mean seriously because there's there's definitely a lack there's a lot of lot of construction that still needs to be done, but."
14535.0,Patient,yeah we hear about the forest fires right now and backing literally I haven't heard of people that Michigan know for the crazy.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so guess we do a fenced in yard, but no it's not fenced because no one can put it up."
14535.0,Patient,list so that's good.
706.0,Provider,"But no we've got he's got one of those collars on like you push the thing in the go like beep and then it will like vibrate and then, if they still aren't listening, you can like shock i'm like to kind of."
14535.0,Patient,Get and.
706.0,Provider,So he has that and typically We just have to like use the sound be.
14535.0,Patient,unhealthy right like.
706.0,Provider,i'll come back. yeah but you know he likes to chase.
14535.0,Patient,rabbits and birds like he's fast.
706.0,Provider,"So, if he. If he goes he goes, and so we need to have that, or he likes to chase jogger. yeah and he but he's jogging down the road. Once the run up and like jump up and give them kisses and they're like oh my God, what is this strange dog doing jumping on me so."
14535.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. yeah crazy man. Like I said on shepherd and husky mix. So it was that same she was smaller, though, like that, but do the hunting and the energy yeah shepherd to man that's uh."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well, I know, and he rips everything apart, like any toy that I get him he just ripped it apart and then they're stuffing everywhere. yeah so now i've gotten, to the point where I ordered like the column the bully boxes, they come once a month with. toys that you can't destroy and so we're trying that because yeah he's he's something else and he's super sweet, but she is so high energy."
14535.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
706.0,Provider,So that's all i've got two boys i've got a two year old and a 13 year old so they.
14535.0,Patient,Oh Nice. Do you say two year old.
706.0,Provider,"yep I have a two year old and I heard yeah. Oh, and I started I started over."
14535.0,Patient,What is a crazy combo. I know that one though he's old enough to. Help the older one.
706.0,Provider,"Well, the only yeah the only bad thing is i've got one in the terrible twos and one that's in the teenagers, and so the combination of the two crazy sometimes."
14535.0,Patient,that's what I imagined.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
14535.0,Patient,"yeah it was me and my sisters age gap, so I saw what how insane my parents, they completely lost period."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah definitely keeps you busy so um and that's what you need to do now is like.
14535.0,Patient,You grew up.
706.0,Provider,"wanting to do to stay busy, and you have you have the gift of time now so look at it that way, as your time was all taken up by something really negative and toxic. And now you have the opportunity to fill that toxic space with positive space to improve your quality of life. So you can get a job, you can join a gym you can join some clubs, you can volunteer you can. You know, go out and socialize you can you know, whatever it is that you like, where your interests are now, you can focus on that and building your quality of life, rather than focusing on how am I gonna get high today."
14535.0,Patient,"It is a little bit easier in ways. I don't know why it's a. it's still I mean I spent time sober before like sobers and I don't it's not like riding a bike necessarily in any way. uh huh the cmc come back in and it gets a little bit more of uh. huh I don't know a little more beat up maybe or something. Get back get my head. fully back in the game, but yeah."
706.0,Provider,"yeah and you do you really have to kind of get that focus back and and know what you want, and that's why. You know, doing my kind of structured day is really important, because you know what to expect, and you know when your day is over that's one more day you have a recovery. But then also making short term and long term goals, so like your short term goal, for instance, could be get a job well you've accomplished that so now what's going to be the goal after that."
14535.0,Patient,"Do something I need to be social. Okay, get out and like that's something i've really been missing, I think I was part of phase. Two I actually. Had it in me to maybe go see people stuff that I haven't wanted to the last couple of months or whatever, but. Too much anxiety, or whatever, so that seems doable."
706.0,Provider,"yeah just remind yourself number one that anxiety is normal number two that nobody has a right to judge you so if they do, then those people are the people you don't want in your life you don't want toxic people to make you feel bad about yourself."
14535.0,Patient,And this.
706.0,Provider,"And then the third one is you know, make sure that whoever you decide to surround yourself with it's very positive that's going to help motivate you through this recovery process. And is not going to you know, bring you down or you know send you back into the using lifestyle those types of things so. places I always recommend like where you can meet people that it's going to probably be a healthy situation is like a gym I go to a zoom but class, if you like, to dance or something zoom was awesome. You know they have, like all these different classes, that you can take typically at gems those are good."
14535.0,Patient,Or you.
706.0,Provider,"find a church in your area that maybe you can get involved with you can find a lot of people there that can be really helpful and supportive or support groups. You know, or like you have a dog go to a dog park."
14535.0,Patient,you're going to find some.
706.0,Provider,Some pretty healthy people there because typically you don't find a bunch of junkies and the dog park.
14535.0,Patient,know you find a lot of single people that's what I found out a couple summers ago.
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14535.0,Patient,We it was yeah anyways yeah we had a little dog network and it just turned into a big like high school yeah it was funny guard adults and all.
706.0,Provider,yeah no.
14535.0,Patient,it's fun though it's great to have a common.
706.0,Provider,"Having some kind of well you know you already have that common factor, or, if you like, to. play basketball joining a. volleyball team, you know just you know, like a coed volleyball team like we have like in the summer, we have like cool and volleyball teams here and like different leagues and. I mean, because then you know it already in something and then somebody else's in it, you already have that common interest."
14535.0,Patient,To kind of go.
706.0,Provider,And kind of break the ice soda side.
14535.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, or, if you like, to read like there's book clubs and you know there's just so many different things, and now you just look at this look at this. At the time, and the energy and the desire to like explore like who are you because. yeah you have to kind of figure out you kind of like reborn after you come into recovery from a using lifestyle because you're a different person so like who do you want this person to be. You know who am I going to be what am I going to do what are my goals."
14535.0,Patient,yep.
706.0,Provider,So I mean that if focusing on those things too is definitely going to help you to not get kind of stuck in that place of that weird limbo feeling.
14535.0,Patient,yeah yeah. I was never good at limbo anyways.
706.0,Provider,So um so yeah I mean just look at this is a really positive thing and get excited about life. You know. You know life can be really great you know ever just want to exist.
14535.0,Patient,And that's how I feel.
706.0,Provider,"When they're using they're just existing going through the motions, now that you're not there anymore and you're coming into the recovery phase, you know get excited find. Other things to be excited about about it's going to bring you natural euphoria. You know the things that used to make you excited before you started using maybe look back and say Okay, what did I do before I started using because you haven't used since you were born, so what were the things you enjoy prior to that first time you used to maybe go."
14535.0,Patient,here.
706.0,Provider,"And you know, look at getting you know involved in that and stuff."
14535.0,Patient,So. I mean it's.
706.0,Provider,"it's a process. But it's definitely something that people can do and it's definitely going to make you a very strong person because recovery is not easy and. Has relapses part of recovery, you know there's going to be some relapse and only thing that with relapse is kind of with you, like you had your small relapse so, then you just got right back right back on your path of okay nope that's not what I want, I want to do this. yeah and as long as you can maintain that."
14535.0,Patient,Even if you have.
706.0,Provider,A relapse and you can get right back on that path you know you're still you still have that recovery it doesn't go away.
14535.0,Patient,yeah that is super true.
706.0,Provider,"You know, nobody can take that from. You when you have two days in recovery two months or two years at time is yours, and even if you relapse nobody can take it back from you and say Oh well, you don't deserve this anymore. No, you deserve every minute of it, then you had a bump in the road and now you're going to continue on with that recovery."
14535.0,Patient,"And things change, you know, especially you know I don't know like you're in recovery and stuff and like but it's like yeah you change outside life changes it all your the people around you they start to change and grow to. It definitely. yeah there's always I always learned something about myself. When I those relationships start to change around me and arnie mean."
706.0,Provider,"When they start to change and then also some of the relationships, you were in that you thought were maybe good or okay. Now that you're using you look you look at them are like."
14535.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Really, healthy and it's kind of a toxic relationship I probably."
14535.0,Patient,Exactly yeah.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so just because it's like somebody said shines a light on it it's like you know, and then you realize that. Because yeah you kind of live in a fog for so long that things don't bother you because you're just numb like you don't care you're just going through the motions. yeah you can actually feel again and realize things again then you're like oh yeah that's not good, I don't like how that person talks to me or treats me. yeah So how have I dealt with that for so long, you know."
14535.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You will find that relationships break up that people start you know, but people part ways I mean just because you can't because you're not the same person and you would have to grow together or grow apart."
14535.0,Patient,"yep I definitely had there's one friend who we've rounded back, thankfully, but for a minute there I choose comfortable being this the stable one and me being like. The foster child kind of is like her and her husband like joke about and I know that they mean it in the most loving way they're like. Like our little deep dark we got to make sure you know she doesn't like kill herself, you know i'm like you know but it's like. Once that intense phase is over, and then I start getting kind of getting a little bit of footing Sometimes I feel like there's a little bit of like. Sometimes I feel like I feel like kind of knocked me down a little bit and I don't know really what the maybe I do need to be checked with sometimes it feels like there's maybe like. I don't know so I had to talk to her about it, like, I mean neither was really acknowledge it, but we just noticed that there was like a weird dynamic and. Thankfully, you know she's you know in recovering stuff to or whatever, and so she knows that you know. anyways were kind of growing back together after a few months, which was. Nice and yeah we're just kind of where we were at that time. When I was thinking."
706.0,Provider,"So so and the big thing is is just because everything is kind of new, so to say, because you are living in recovery now rather than a using atmosphere. Just the big thing is because it's so new and so unknown to you just making sure that communication, because you might interpret things differently than they're meant to be and they said to you. yeah your brain is reacts in a different way now and."
14535.0,Patient,Community yeah. I can definitely get a little overzealous get a little sensitive and those yeah yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So just that communication of hey I hear you saying this, you know, like it's not what you mind because that's how i'm hearing you say it. Either they'll pay."
14535.0,Patient,gap.
706.0,Provider,that's what I said or no that's not what I said.
14535.0,Patient,"yeah that's absolutely I i'm glad that habit did get instilled when I was in rehab when I was younger and all that stuff is that that dynamic, this is how I feel. You know what like the the full day yeah so i'm glad I can talk to people about that I it's funny when you do that with someone like I mean someone newer. at work or something. We start having something i'll take that approach, some people are not in recovery don't really know how to respond to that sometimes."
706.0,Provider,yeah they're like.
14535.0,Patient,"Like why. Do we, why are we talking about our feelings like. yeah you know what i'm like oh. Okay, all right we're fine."
706.0,Provider,"yeah you know and it's and it's and it's hard, especially if you don't practice, like all the time, I mean, obviously I practice a lot because of my job, but I mean in. My personal life, sometimes I have to stop myself, I remind myself hey, this is what I need to do like I need to talk to my husband and be like I heard you say this, that really hurt me is that what you meant to say you know, rather than automatically assume well you you meant to say."
14535.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, but but, even though this is my job, I still in my personal life because you wear different hats have to remind myself. That it's not something that just comes naturally you just have to practice it."
14535.0,Patient,"yeah that is the nice part about. Being in which you're like. I don't know I did like we you know I got to the point where, as a sponsor but, having that kind of dynamic, it does help kind of look at your own. Life a little bit yeah. i'm far from that but yeah."
706.0,Provider,yeah I mean.
14535.0,Patient,"In general, is always good."
706.0,Provider,"yeah you know so um how are you feeling like mental health wise, I mean, are you having any like suicidal ideations are you how are you on that front."
14535.0,Patient,"um no I mean, even in the last you know, like week or two, I mean when I was like detoxing I definitely was a you know a lot darker spot, but since I got like regularly back on suboxone and even though I was feeling not great, I wasn't really so I wasn't suicidal I just. Was I just wanted to feel something. huh oh um. yeah so I was good, I mean I there were points in that, where I started looking at like. I don't know I there was like couple I talked to a couple different doctors or something and like bipolar just came up in general. Like and part of me was like wondering if they're trying to like wink at me and it's take a look at that. Maybe being a. Possibility or something and I know that, like when I initially got on. Diana depressing on as it method i'm on now it's one that if I was because, like whatever pre test, they give you I was kind of like on that Gray area where it could I could potentially have some bipolar I don't know exactly how we articulate it. So the main case i'm on was one that one throw me off until I got a manic state or anything but I did start looking at like my impulsivity and. It was something I thought about i'm gonna definitely stay on like a regular medication dosage before I but yeah That was the only thing, where I definitely question at one point that I might yeah. But. I think we're all too soon, right now, maybe."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and you definitely want to make sure that your chemicals become stable in your body again after using. That yeah whatever medications you're on you have you get to the right dose and you maintain it for a minute to make sure that it works, the way it's supposed to. And then reassess that's why doctors see you back, like every three months because they want to reassess to make sure the doses right and how is it working and all of those things. are sure um you know and the doctors here with the suboxone they like to see everybody monthly to make sure you know everything's still Okay, because that's. a really important piece, you know the therapy and the group therapy is really, really important, but we also want to make sure that your medication piece is you know at the right level to. You so um. So yeah I mean that makes sense, and if you do have some Bible or tendencies having an Anti depressant anti anxiety is definitely going to make you feel better should give you more energy should stabilize your moods make you less impulsive make you less snappy like. yeah you like that snap feeling should kind of you know, go away."
14535.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you, thank God, yes."
706.0,Provider,"yeah and sometimes you know when your anxieties really high, like you, you do the reaction away and then later on you're like."
14535.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh like right out my crazy."
706.0,Provider,"Why am I, why do I feel like I just want to like rip somebody's head off."
14535.0,Patient,Just great reaction. yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"you're you know you're reacting right that, rather than being proactive and so the proactive pieces, you know, taking your medication to prevent those feelings from happening."
14535.0,Patient,yeah and then.
706.0,Provider,"Lots of have to do some behavior modification, along with that, so that once you're not so impulsive you can stop, and you can say. I need to walk away, I need to take a break, I need to take some time you know I need to. Do a quick little meditation or something before I address this, because you can feel yourself to that point of blowing whereas without the medication you just blow yeah. So um, so I think I think that's going to be really helpful for you to, and I think that you know once everything just levels out and stabilizes you're going to feel amazing."
14535.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
706.0,Provider,"there's really exciting life ahead of you and and that you can get excited about and meet new people, and you know just look at it, as as a do over."
14535.0,Patient,You can just start yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know so that's and that's an exciting thing you can do anything you want, I mean you're super young like you can do whatever you want to do now, you know. Whatever interested, is that you have follow it."
14535.0,Patient,For sure.
706.0,Provider,"So, but i'm glad that you haven't really had a lot of suicidal ideations and obviously no plans, no it's so I mean that's really that's really positive. it's real path. Because on some of the testing that you did you came up as a high suicide risk, and so we always want to follow up on that to make sure that you're safe, you know and that there's nothing going on, you get that needs to be addressed immediately so."
14535.0,Patient,gotcha okay.
706.0,Provider,"I very much like when people tell me no I haven't had that lately so i'm like Oh, then I can see, you know that people are getting better because. You know what I mean like your medications are starting to work and you're starting to think in different ways and. But by all means, if you do have suicidal ideations or plans or attempts or anything definitely communicate that, because then we have to look at something like something something's not jiving. So we need to look at you know what's going on. But you definitely look better today than when I saw you, the first time. Like up to. You just look better you look you've got appear to have more energy, so I think you're definitely moving in the right direction."
14535.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
706.0,Provider,"So um alright, well, we are good for our time today, do you have another appointment, set up in a couple weeks."

14535.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's super cool.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so when you call in to the virtual clinic to make an appointment That way, you can kind of know you know what time you can ask for and and I don't they usually try and not booked out further than a couple of weeks. And then, when you make that one, then you can make another one so usually you can make two at a time. So you shouldn't have any problem getting on the schedule in a couple weeks."
