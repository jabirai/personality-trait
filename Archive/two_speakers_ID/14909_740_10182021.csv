14909.0,Patient,"that's things like it right now it's really a bad time you know because, like half the countries have level for travel advisories and my wife works in the hospital, so they don't really like it when you travel to places to have low for travel advisories. Some but like where we live right now is that we have the lowest covered rates in the nation. hmm so that's good."
740.0,Provider,"That is really good yeah the the travel thing is is real because we, I think, going as flight was delayed. A little it was delayed a few minutes because. Basically, their show staff people don't want to be mandated to take back fame so. that's people are walking off job."
14909.0,Patient,"that's stupid. No, sorry no offense to whoever is doesn't want to get a vaccine but that's stupid."
740.0,Provider,yeah I mean you know it's not about getting it it's about you taking away my freedom to choose and.
14909.0,Patient,"Because, but that seems like. elementary school. You had to get all kinds of vaccines and nobody was bitching about your right to choose, then. And most jobs require you to be vaccinated."
740.0,Provider,"Well, now actually i'm not even most job is Mosul mult more so government, I mean bottom mandated government so anybody that in people that you never know you never knew they working for the airlines was was affiliated with the government, but it is."
14909.0,Patient,"But it's worked for an airline do you have to have a measles vaccine, you have to have a mumps vaccine yet. A whole bunch of different vaccines in order to work with people in general, this is no different."
740.0,Provider,"I know, but it is, it is a movie AG, because what they may advancing aiming the measles vaccine and isn't that into month big thing and things like that."
14909.0,Patient,"yeah but it's been worked on for several years, like they were they were working on a vaccine basically four stars. And that's where they started with this one, and so they had most of the work done already, and it's all of the. world's top scientists that are doing this and usually scientists and like medical professionals are not in their field to try to screw you, you know they're trying to help people and if all of them say it's a good idea that's enough for me, you know, like the doctors. it's just the government that's one thing, but the men. will say it's okay. yeah i'm no fan of the government don't know."
740.0,Provider,"I like I like the government i'm with you, but then you got some doctors who don't who don't hold up I think it's kind of a split because you have some dogs with my patients. You have a like even with the nurse, did you might even with Labor and delivery, you have nurses walking off the job because they don't want to take it, you have doctors and physicians some boxes i'm not taking it and they have they have to quit."
14909.0,Patient,it's it's 1%. of medical professionals.
740.0,Provider,way less than 1%.
14909.0,Patient,But the secret is the split a little bit in favor of vaccine.
740.0,Provider,know I know I listen to each his own I work from home.
14909.0,Patient,yeah right yeah you.
740.0,Provider,know.
14909.0,Patient,But but. yeah somebody somebody has to work on a enclosed cockpit of an airplane they can't be getting coven and given to. US and saying no i'm saying.
740.0,Provider,"But that's I mean that's when this was the shortages something in regards to. The shortage in regards to the travel, so I can understand where your wife works, you know they don't want her to be exposed to that kind of stuff that I mean I leave at least they're looking at for their own, and so this is very important, so i'm glad she works in a place like this. yeah bad so. Other than day what has been going on, Andrew any stress and anxiety any any depression anything of that nature. Any stress at all."
14909.0,Patient,Particularly.
740.0,Provider,"Because of the nature, the best easy breezy plan that I got."
14909.0,Patient,"yeah I don't say I don't usually let I don't hang on to things for very long, so if there's something that does bother me it's usually done within a couple of minutes and I just forget about it."
740.0,Provider,hmm.
14909.0,Patient,"See. i'm some photos for. For a friend of mine, I took some photos now i'm editing them and he's not paying me but he's also really uptight about when I deliver these photos. it's not really it's not really a stressor it's. Just like bro leave me alone, unless you got to give me money like this isn't my number one priority. right but it's left that off that's fine."
740.0,Provider,"haha so send me how you called me is doing, have you been able to kind of cope with everything it seems like you have really big hope and fear, so what are some of the what are some way some. Significant topics here that you found to be useful for you to be able to overcome the stressors that you encounter."

740.0,Provider,Okay.
14909.0,Patient,wasn't really That was really the issue.
740.0,Provider,"Now, if I mean stresses, I mean I know you use recreation, because this is, I mean you just bought a recreation i'm just talking about just because. What causes people to start using initially won't be the reason won't be the reason that they use again, so there are different factors they comes into place in regards to use to the left is the real essence of like that. However, i'm just asking, because I know that the medicine is working for you very, very well. But outside of the medicine like what are other coping mechanisms that you're using you know to kind of keep yourself leveled. me it out."
14909.0,Patient,"let's see again my my life right now isn't that stressful yeah just working the jobs, I feel like working and not working, the ones I don't I don't have any work stress. yeah you know i'm. Coping skills. Sometimes i'll go over to have a garage across town where people out of motorcycles so Sometimes I feel like you know just getting out for a little bit i'll go right over there and work on a bike or something."
740.0,Provider,And that's.
14909.0,Patient,"that's pretty relaxing. joy that. I know i'll put some thought into it, oh i'll be more consciousness week i'll have of if I come across the stress, or what I did a deal with it."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and it's just it's just more so it's not like triggering I just don't like me, you know today, I just wanted to, I want you, I want you to be able to identify some of the competencies that you actually use to get through your day. Because I mean we're all exposed to some kind of something it doesn't have to stress, you out, it can be. It can be habits, you know new habits that you're starting to develop for yourself, you know what are they. You know, things of that nature, so we just been able to identify if I don't want to look at it, as to you know, things are stressed me out of what I do. I mean yeah that's one thing, but more so, of what new habits, you know the you find yourself developing for yourself will coping skills are using using your day to day life, you know to be able to make it a productive day. To make sure that you're not regressing but progress and stuff like this."
14909.0,Patient,Okay yeah I put some time to. To.
740.0,Provider,"A note, have you been to be based in Spain in any mysterious have no great."

740.0,Provider,Though you think you're doing the minimum what does that mean.
14909.0,Patient,Like i'm succeeding at the most basic level.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm. Just let me. But it's feeding at the most basic level i've never heard that one before. yeah I never heard that one before it out.

740.0,Provider,"Now so okay so okay so outside of school and life right now. They feeding just at the basic level. Is there any strive to do better, so any any kind of drive to do this in based in your personal development, or you just Okay, we."
14909.0,Patient,"Just didn't know if I if I need more money by. Being outstanding, it would have to be a lot more mind, but you could pay me to be outstanding but otherwise no no i'm not doing that, why would I do that."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and. it's in the reason why am I mean you have different types of people right, you have people because, like like you say you're you're a contract there, and you contract with company what basically with their marketing them right. yeah right so eventually I mean do you ever have a desire to own your own business."
14909.0,Patient,"Well, I do, I do have another business, I have a photography and videography. Business that does fine I don't take any money out of it, but I do contribute to it. All right, but at same time. Again, if it's completely proportional on on like i'll do the extra work if it's compensated with money. But if it's not i'm not going to. Okay, I don't want to be exceptional for exceptional sake i'd rather just be you know i'd rather have time off. Unless you're gonna buy my time off."
740.0,Provider,"But what about the What about personal development, just getting better in your craft."
14909.0,Patient,"uh yeah I mean there's some of that a lot of that just comes with the territory, I mean the more you work, the more the better you get at it, the more you understand. um you know there's classes, you have to. Take with Google to you know. to learn, these new products. But i'm not going to go out into it when i'm not on contract."
740.0,Provider,huh no. yeah.
14909.0,Patient,It doesn't really sound good to me.
740.0,Provider,So basically Andrew unless you are paid to strive. yeah better. yeah and i'll be better.
14909.0,Patient,"No, why would I. I don't I don't I don't understand anybody who would take it anywhere any differently, I don't get it."
740.0,Provider,"I don't know, I guess, because every submission. Since I have to deal with people's lives."
14909.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"Then, of course, I have to invest in my personal development, why because i'm I am I am the middleman between somebody succeeding or somebody regressing. Because I do what I do i'm in the life changing business, what I do every day, so if I say basic and I pour into you, you know that means i'm going to give you basically treated and."
14909.0,Patient,"Not necessarily. you're subscribing to something that says, I must practice how I preach but you don't have to you know the right thing to do, you don't have to do it if you don't want."
740.0,Provider,I don't want to be I don't want to be a hypocrite either I don't live i'll be a walking contradiction Mina.
14909.0,Patient,"Okay, they don't want you don't want to is what you said. You don't say I have to."
740.0,Provider,"No, no, no, no, you know no it's not it's, not even in your boss, that what you have to do, yes, and because anybody can do whatever they want to do in order to be able to develop you just have to change what you want to do. And so either you saying what you want to do, or you don't."
14909.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"But I know in the 48 and every profession is different right, and so, in your profession, you know i'm saying. You know you're Okay, because you're still getting you're still getting client tail so therefore you know i'm saying it's not you know is that really pushing us to have to change what you're doing because you're still getting you know the clients and the money that you need. it's not a fan of i've actually gotten that I just never heard. never heard about it before."
14909.0,Patient,it's it's it's a good saying and it's fine like I got no problem with it it's it's it works.
740.0,Provider,"yeah I trust me I completely understand I completely understand and. You know, it just one of those thing. So where. Does your photographer right."

14909.0,Patient,"yeah and The thing is, when I get a new job that requires me to get new skills i'll do them. right but i'm not gonna do it now nobody's paying me to do it now."
740.0,Provider,i'm listening and reading when you put it like that I completely sure.
14909.0,Patient,"it's like my my wife and he goes back to school to get a Masters several years ago. And I said wait until you have a job, where somebody will pay you to go get your masters. And now, yes, someone is paying her to go get a masters."

740.0,Provider,"He won't do. Something all right after you want to miss more. She doesn't it doesn't make a lot of sense it does it makes a whole lot of sense to be. able to you know, and you know. Because I mean if now you've you spoke with people like me who else going on. Because a lot of a lot of programs. In my profession, they don't pay, you have to get a masters in order to work, you know to be a counselor there's no such thing as being an accountant before you get a mass."
14909.0,Patient,yeah you're right.
740.0,Provider,"So, so I mean you have to be licensed to get to be a counselor and you can be life and without a Masters and. All they do, they just had those but in her profession, you do have those patients to where they will pay, and I think that they will there be perfect day by day."
14909.0,Patient,"And it's working out nicely she starts on the 26th, which is in a few days."

You know, and what are you doing for self care that's a thing of will self care is very, very important because, being busy is one thing, but after wow being busy won't be good enough, and so you have to be able to have some type of balance. They are excuse me in regards to being productive on the words by but then making sure that you are still maintaining your self care and what you're doing to maintain bit."
