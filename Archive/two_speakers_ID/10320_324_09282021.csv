324.0,Provider,morning. How does it feel to you.
10320.0,Patient,yeah it feels really in. Such a relief to to not have to worry about that test anymore.
324.0,Provider,Your mini. message. And suddenly get. Past it.
10320.0,Patient,is really cool having. You and many reading for me.
324.0,Provider,He was like so excited he's like guess what. Our boy.
10320.0,Patient,"yeah That was really helpful. talking with many yeah before the test, I was. pleasantly surprised that I wasn't like too nervous going into the."
324.0,Provider,test oh.
10320.0,Patient,"prepared and the strategies that many gave me to manage my anxiety a lot. yeah so that was nice. And then during the test, I was 10 and doubting myself a little bit, but I was trying to take it slow and really read the questions I finished in at three questions. I had a lot of select all that apply. And then, once I finished it, I really didn't know how to feel it, I think it could have gone either way."
324.0,Provider,Going at the same. time I think every time the minimum 75. I don't live in Ohio. But. It looks like if you stop is 75 of his life. He did really well in. The mall and they're going to just cut you off at them and then you don't have to I remember my numbers are number one or five. That was kind of like.
10320.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,"Like Okay, where what does that mean that's kind of."
10320.0,Patient,kind of an odd number.
324.0,Provider,"Okay. You know, so I remember walking out of here, I think I was in tears, because I did oh. yeah you know. So they don't I thought five years for me, but. They don't tell you. You have to wait to find out."
10320.0,Patient,"yeah yeah they don't tell you right away. there's a trick. That you can do to like you reregistered to take the. test, and if it says like you've already registered to take this test we can't reregister you at this time and that's a good indicator that you pass. But if it let's see reregister to take the test it accepts here $200. And that's a bad sign yeah. However, I didn't do that I didn't want to look right away cuz I wasn't that confident that I passed. I waited. Two days for my unofficial results. And so once I did that and I found a past, I was really excited is yeah I was really relieved, I was calling up on my friends and telling them. yeah."
324.0,Provider,"I used to have like the toll free number to call, I think. One of our time. Here, but the waiting is a killer."
10320.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah i'm glad I didn't have to wait too long, two days wasn't too bad. I know some people who are taking different board exams they gotta wait like closer to a month for the chiropractic. yeah I can imagine that."
324.0,Provider,"So, however."
10320.0,Patient,"i'm pretty good. yeah I mean. let's see yeah my mood has been good. And i've been sleeping well lately. i've been doing better about. going to sleep a little bit earlier.

324.0,Provider,Either work. Or what area.
10320.0,Patient,"yeah. Right now, from edsurge telly. yeah. So. I know, last time we talked about. Maybe switching. bipolar medications. I looked at the two you suggesting, I think the lamictal. looks like it might be good for me."
324.0,Provider,As far as like what the hair long. or.
10320.0,Patient,"It hasn't gotten any better taking a vitamin I don't think so. yeah i'd like to switch. If it's not going to be too big, of a problem."
324.0,Provider,"One of the biggest. thrashing finger. In like people they were stealing Johnson central this is. Rare, but it can happen, it can happen with any medication, but. it's one of those that. Definitely happened look look, though."

In the sun, like every now and then, I guess, I could make sure to wear a lot of sunscreen but. If it's gonna make me prone to sunburns. I won't be good. And then on here, it also says alopecia, which is what i'm trying to avoid with stopping depakote. I don't know if that's common. one. It looks like a lot of these medications have similar side effects. yeah."
324.0,Provider,This point.
10320.0,Patient,"Think. I think we can do the lamictal i'll just. Try to look out for. Any severe side effects. Or, if anything, bothers me, maybe. we'll just have to try something else. Because it seems like some of this stuff is inevitable."
