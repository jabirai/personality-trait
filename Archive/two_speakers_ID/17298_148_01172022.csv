148.0,Provider,"Okay okay. um. Tell me about your story with substances like when were you first exposed, how did it progress and when was it the worst for you."
17298.0,Patient,"um I was first exposed when I was 22 years old um and. So it's been a very long time. and i've been using ever since. i've been a functioning person recency but I haven't really been. In a situation where I have to steal or anything like that I just I use because it gets me through the day and it's become a habit for me. Where. I mean, but now that I am on my medication it's so much better because I don't even pray that anymore. But. yeah so it's it's my at my worst I don't know if i've ever had, I mean if I could ever say it, it was at my first but. Because I use every day, so I mean i'm not sure if there was any other any other day is different than than any other day, I mean just use every day, so I don't know if I could even. pinpoint a worse point. You know what I mean like I just I started to use it, I use every day, and then I just kept on I kept on with my life."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm and, what is your primary drug of choice. math math Okay, and do you use any other substance. No okay okay um and how do you use it do."

148.0,Provider,"Okay okay and you've you have used every day, since you were 22."
17298.0,Patient,"One point I did start, because actually I could say there was a workflow in my life because there was a point where I wanted to stop but I felt like I couldn't stop. And so I checked myself into the hospital because I knew that I needed to stop but I couldn't so I went to the emergency room. And I told him what was going on and they I feel like they tricked me because they asked me a question about death and. They asked me have ever have ever thought about death, and I said yes, but I think they interpreted that with me trying to kill myself or something so the 5150 me. And I couldn't leave and but that wasn't that wasn't how I that wasn't what I was trying to say I guess it was more like when they asked me, I said well yeah everybody thinks about that, I mean. everybody thinks about that, but I don't ever think about killing myself that's not what I was trying to say, but she didn't the woman didn't you know, accept that as an answer so, but it was actually a blessing in disguise, because I was held there and I was taken to. detox. And I was put into rehab so it was it was a good thing, though, that that they held me there, so it ended up helping me out."
148.0,Provider,"And how long ago was that. That was in 2017 2017 okay. yeah i'm. let's see have you been to any other treatments, besides rehab that one time and 20. So that was your. Only time and we have a where did you go."

148.0,Provider,"Okay, so you did one month you complete it, one month about patient."
17298.0,Patient,"yeah and then I couldn't. And then, without the medication I wasn't able to stay sober so it didn't work out."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then you went back to using and um, how do you have any other treatment in the past, health or anything else, no just."
17298.0,Patient,"Mental health, I will I have, I was diagnosed with depression before that. But then I overcame that. and dealt with that I was taking. What is it antidepressant medication. But. That was a very low time in my life, it was a long time ago, probably in 2012 13. But I overcame that and I think a lot of it had to do with my job, I was being I was being overworked. And so it was very taking a toll on my my mental health. And so I took some time off. And and regained regathered myself and get on some medication and I got better it took me about 30 days, and then I got off the meds and it was better."
