5734.0,Patient,"Can. you hear me or no. yeah No, sorry i'm trying to I can turn off for a second, you need and i'm trying to fix my hot water heater right now, because we hadn't break on us yesterday so. i'm trying to. yeah it's a French fry stop so. i'm trying to I have a buddy of mine over here, helping me do it so i'm trying to hurry on his time and because that and ended up breaking on his last night."
177.0,Provider,"A water leak last month, and it was ridiculous, I still have like what."
5734.0,Patient,"He comes in and out so. hot water elites and everything are like there, those are terrible. Thankfully ours just stopped up producing hot water Sorry, I guess, to keep in my pocket so. So it's a it just stopped producing hot water and what sucks because I think right yes um. she's again there we go um it was weird because what I mean we had it on over you know, we had it set too high overnight and finally. Well shit i'm finally like got some hot water I guess i'm overnight, but half of the House gets it the other half doesn't so like I don't I don't understand so we're trying to. fix it all together French I stopped. No boy."
177.0,Provider,what's going on with them what's the current state of your relationship.
5734.0,Patient,"um. I really don't know so it's a. tricky to say the least, so I had an issue that I found out that. I had like. $7,000 go missing, and the only two people that knew about it, with my wife and her brother. Right. So. The issue with. mom and then. I didn't you know the, the only two that nobody were them and. They. They both are swearing up and down that neither one of them took it. But. You know I sure as hell didn't move it because part of that was supposed to go and fix my truck part of it was supposed to go to my mortgage part of it was supposed to be. Just my emergency money and then part of it was. I had collected over like eight years a bunch of $2 bills ones fives 10s 20s and 50s that were. Like really, really like i'm talking like really old fashioned that like get destroyed they don't because they're too easy to counterfeit. ones like that and I had like $3,000 and matt and I was in my safe and now it's gone."
177.0,Provider,You.
5734.0,Patient,"know this was a one was in my safe one one envelope, it was a money bag from bank one of them was in the safe and then the other one was it was out, but it was sitting on a pile in a pile of major pile of junk on my nightstand so. You know wasn't it wasn't very visible by just looking at it, you would have to know is there, and you have to dig for it a little bit, but. But both of them just ended up disappearing and the one in the safe was definitely hidden pretty well so that was. you'd only be able to you know if you knew was there that's, the only way you're going to know that it was there in hand, they are the only two other than me that knew it and that's the issue at hand is that we have no idea where it went. My wife is set on that I just misplaced it and I moved it and i'm like no because I needed it and get it to actually use it that's when it disappeared and. I just have to admit to her that. visions that she has it or had it. One of the two. will show me her bank account that there was no transactions deposits or anything of the sort. That it is still hidden somewhere in cash. Oh south."
177.0,Provider,repeat that last sentence now.
5734.0,Patient,But things between us go south. yeah.
177.0,Provider,"This is a big deal. In conjunction with the other papers going on now, this. what's the update or outcome from the discussion that we had last."
5734.0,Patient,"Week been any. No, there hasn't been anything new I didn't really get to talk to her about any of that because that the all the other stuff came up and me see if it's enough to say. Oh, you know that was the. frustrating part. But. said to her that I wanted to do therapy and. are good between us that's when she's more likely to want to do it."
177.0,Provider,She said that when things are good for you that's when she'll be more likely to do it. you're going in and out speaking I can't hear.
5734.0,Patient,That is trash I don't know why my Internet is so terrible.
177.0,Provider,"I heard that come in, so what did she say about the therapy."
5734.0,Patient,things get then she's more willing.
177.0,Provider,The purpose. Is avoidance okay. Can you hear me okay.
5734.0,Patient,hear me now.
177.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5734.0,Patient,"Okay i'll say, less because my headset turned off. it's. Not connecting back to my headset. This piece of shit right now."
177.0,Provider,"that's for you, but I kind of hear you."
5734.0,Patient,you're watching gap. Okay now. yeah okay. I don't know why it was. Wanting to work there for a second.
177.0,Provider,"there's some what's going on. To say that even though. This is out of it actually yeah a very hard time within your relationship. And once it's more clear, please."
5734.0,Patient,hold on last my headset again I don't know why. This is a pain in the butt.
177.0,Provider,You can hear me I can't hear you.
5734.0,Patient,"to talk to you this way like there's a stupid speaker phone because my headsets not working. No it's fully charged it's just I don't know like I took it off the wi fi and that might be why so. I might have to put it back to the wi fi. On allowing me to take it off the video so that way, it will have. Their can you hear me okay. yeah Okay, let me try I put it back to my headset. Are you there just hear me. Okay, so I had a put it back take it off. My bluetooth so."
177.0,Provider,"What is going on. what's going on your your relationship, right now, this is be idle time to seek out the rp."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah i'm are at least I would think so, but apparently not you know occurs and Stephen things basically. So yeah you can."
177.0,Provider,ongoing violation.
5734.0,Patient,"um yeah me too, but it's. I really don't I really don't know what to do, it's kind of. Basically I need to deal with it. And that's frustrating. But. I don't know I really don't know."
177.0,Provider,"Alternatives to just deal with it and that coming up with more effective ways to set those boundaries that before prior to this situation, the boundaries were inconsistent. Not following through and maybe there are more expectations than actual agreement with me. So I can be assumption about certain things because, like it's a marriage, you guys have known each other for so long. that it makes sense that sometimes they'll be more expectations grab agreements, and if they now, and this, they were a new relationship. There needs to be more of a push on those agreements and then really following through with the consequences of not having those agreements men. And it's not necessarily ultimatums, but there are consequences to actions and consequences, also be to you practicing self care, so the consequence of you continuously exploring relationships outside of our marriage is I will get a divorce."
5734.0,Patient,Oh that's what I told her last time I mean I told her if she speaks to him again we're done getting an award there's no if ands or buts about it. But now i'm having to play the game basically be nice and bite my tongue until I get reinstated on that account to look deeper into it so i'm kind of forced to play nice so. frustrating.
177.0,Provider,"When you're in place up you were it's, this is what I think makes it very. confusing for me to witness is that it seems that the offender in the relationship and the one that needs to take steps towards repair is the person that's my and instead the person that has been offended is the one position to execute work yeah."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah, but if you ask or bring that up to her it's denied it saying no that's not the case, you know that's you know that's not the truth or something like that it's not a terrible."
177.0,Provider,"War, so why it's important for an individual to be able to hear both sides at the same time to get those perspectives and then help bring attention to areas for compromise and repair. And the fact that she is not open to That to me is a sign of maybe a willingness. to want to repair."
5734.0,Patient,yeah um.
177.0,Provider,And maybe a new up a founder he needs to be set up about that as well. or not.
5734.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's that or you know something's being hidden so. So I mean, I still feel like. there's plenty being done, but like I said until. I get re granted certain access, I can say or do anything I have to. bite my tongue and play nice so."
177.0,Provider,"I think there's other ways to get the validation of some of your thoughts. it's not coming from a place of being combative but it's just put a you will a position. Where you don't have to compromise values and things that you feel could give you the piece that you need in this relationship. and allow for voice quality and the relationship, and I think if the sole dependence is wanting to get the proof from the cell phone providing when there's other alternatives right, so if you've offered another alternative of well let's go to therapy. And she's in mind that. Then, maybe reintroducing the conversation with some boundaries we've had these interference within our relationship and. I think we need to do therapy and what I encourage that we do there be, or else there's other things that I need to consider you know I think relying solely dependent on her relinquishing access to you goes back to that power play. And so it's like our control or power over or power lives, and it seems that you're in this position of being empowered lives and so she will lose some pounds to you."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah there's also another factor into this that. As right now, because i'm not barbering i'm doing construction work with like what the saw and stuff and what i'm not making anywhere near enough to support anything. So that's my other issue i'm trying right now to get back into a barbershop I have to I need to call i'm going to be calling them tomorrow um but as of right now I can't support or do anything I make if i'm lucky 200 bucks after taxes, a week. And that's nothing so."
177.0,Provider,You.
5734.0,Patient,"Know yeah I can't again I wouldn't be able to support anything. i'm even myself out like a apartment like they couldn't do that because of my issue with the kids trying to get them trying to balance them and then the timeframes that I have like it's I don't I, and I just I would have to be paid over 30 bucks an hour. That part time or even 35 and our part time to make what I would need to cover and I don't I don't get that not not doing i'm doing so I get a third of that so. that's my other issue is right now she's the breadwinner and I need to get back under control, some way, shape or form. You know that plays Another major issue."
177.0,Provider,"yeah that's a big part it sounds like you're in survival mode. Playing your position, so you can find you know situation."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah That was the other issue, why it was such a big major thing when all that money disappeared, because I was like well Fuck am I supposed to do. So. But. yeah very. I guess the only good news I got was the motorcycle I bought wasn't stolen. yeah but. yeah. Oh. So what. i'm almost done, but I got some mom she is go babe it's already 523 you got to go. Stop. Okay sorry I love you forever well sorry I was hoping note. I said 523 he said five it down and why he said 553. back for because she's gotta leave right now so. Well, for that for. This year. Okay. stood up on the bench. juggle things. Do you want fruit or no. Sorry. You want anything else from in here. Yes, and one second. hold on you guys and then yes i'll get you lunchables can you wait about five minutes. You guys want to set the table now. hi guys I love. Cheese on my side the bad. thing get over here quickly give her a kiss you guys she's running late Harry Harry Harry. shut the door behind you i'm gonna go back in the garage. i'll take it district. of you. I know. Right it's a lot easier because now she's reading, so I don't worry about her carry me."
177.0,Provider,I think. will be of importance is create a list of things that are within your power to create the outcome that you want. and Then also see the areas where you may be helped to create outcome that you want.
5734.0,Patient,yeah.
177.0,Provider,"And the areas that you may need to you know, make a request from other people to get the outcome, you want."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah that's like one of the bigger things i've run into is I don't have much help or assistance from anybody because there's not really many people around. um, but I understand you're saying, and then the other thing I would have to focus on is I mean I could do that write things down that I want to talk to you about because that's another Another thing I run into a big issue is that um. If I don't talk about it right away, and then i'll forget about it and then i'll just write it off and i'll just like you know, whatever i'll just deal with it and um. You know it'll kind of come back again, then it gets brought up again but there's plenty of times like if i'm trying to argue with you about something if. it's not done at a certain time certain way all forget whatever are my thought is and then it just like most of it doesn't get said so it's seen as I forget so it's trying to just move past it ideal and that's the frustrating thing so."
177.0,Provider,"Just you know, want to remind you, something that message that I echo for wow this might default to that power with state where you do nothing. And then just hope that things work themselves out or that other parties will change so that you can get the outcome, you desire right so whatever parts and I understand and neither. Does he need financial security. make changes having financial stability. Is big with finding resources to cope, and to manage and you don't have it you're coping skills evolved over time, so I get back. But you know you look at it from other angles any areas where you can explore that you have the power to create the outcome, you want, you know, and that that does that to. You know, lead to some extreme action, but it can be the outcome that I want to speak, you know how would you get that Nice."
5734.0,Patient,"Well, I know. I mean my mom had a you know, a way of telling me that she was like you know you came back up from worse, you know share like i've i've lost a lot of shit like i've been i've been to jail and back like i've had nothing and rebuilt everything and then it's just. You know, a pain in the ass process to go through it, but that's i'm gonna have to do is just I have to just rebuild like I mean mine is dawn I have no choice but to deal with it so. Unless. mysteriously it appears, but I highly doubt that. But. I mean, like, for example, because it's a pigsty now from when fears, making a statement of. You know, you need to look through everything and she was like no like thoroughly so she started like ripping everything off the shelves and throwing it out in the hallway like me to the bedroom and she was like see that's how you look i'm like I could see past all that, like. I know it's not there, but like if you were to. See if it'll let me flip it so like you have to go this way in here go away in here in that far dark deep corner that's my safe. it's not just some random oh."
177.0,Provider,Look there it is yeah yeah.
5734.0,Patient,"You have to go for it. And, before I had. I had a foam in front of it, too, so like it. It wasn't like oh someone's going to mysteriously stumble upon that. It was someone who was there and went for it and took it. And then I mean like I said because she did what she did is a major is fixed it but that's like the nightstand style because it was turned sideways going this way it was in the corner slot covered by most of all this, and in the side there but. it's you know that that was gone too so i'm like. So. Like I said, both of them that disappeared. or because somebody new they're there and I don't have anybody around the House and she's the only one that's here, and so is her brother. So. Pretty serious situation. yeah. Which is kind of funny because we have cameras everywhere in this House, except for like our room and I was thinking about like hiding one in here without her knowing to see if I would like come up with some stuff but then I was like. Like I suppose the process of getting it and then maintaining it then sounds like I don't know it just kind of lost interest in that quickly."
177.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it'd be you know kind of like. we've got that level is there is a discovery on on your part, you know, on her part yeah. If it's."
5734.0,Patient,"covered from covered by her. You know, then my ass is grass type deal. And if I discover something oh that's perfectly fine with me i'll talk it."
177.0,Provider,Over.
5734.0,Patient,"So, like it's. done but like I said as of right now, I have to play Nice and. And you know play the play the game which is. irritating."
177.0,Provider,"emphasize when me. that's that's not an ideal situation to be in, especially the remnants of mistrust and now you have this new layer"
5734.0,Patient,"is more than just like remnants of it, I mean there's like several layers of it. And then it's which is like weird because. She like you know. tells our kids and like stresses, to our kids like our our son brought up randomly about step parents. And he was all like yeah you guys are my step parents are like no or not like, and I had to explain to him I haven't said that. And then she was like yeah like you know that's only going to happen if we only ever get divorce, which is never going to happen. So i'm like hey it's you know I guess happy no but you know we're at the same time that she's like trying to force that understanding on them. And how the understanding of you need to always protect your brother and always love your brother your posing of your best friend like how her and her brothers are but. You know I mean I have on my own accord told my brothers to Fuck off because they're not really supported me, and you know me choosing to stay with her. Because I chose not to divorce her when I first filed for because I don't want to put my kids through what I went through and worse up what's next and it's just. frustrating and irritating in so many different ways."
177.0,Provider,"And the ultimate goal is not necessarily we won't get the. ultimate goal should be, we have a healthy marriage. One thing I say. We won't get the wars, because she is living up to that she's refusing to leave she's refusing to the grand two grand surplus. So. To me hearing that is it actually during it just still goes back to that power. You know."
5734.0,Patient,"I know for the longest time when she was like in school, we first were together like I held all the power like she didn't have any work she didn't have any money. All of her friends and her parents both holder to Fuck off like she didn't have anybody around so it was like me and me only. And I was on that made the money and so she always had asked me, she did modeling every now and then so she got some money, but I was the one who had all the money. So now as of right now the tables have turned she's the one with all the money so i'm just trying to find ways to get that back towards either equal ground or ongoing money. or these I have more money or she does so, as long as I can get back into certain businesses certain locations, I can get that to happen it's just I need to get back out that ball rolling as just as a very tough ball to get rolling again so."
177.0,Provider,"The most ideal situation would be that both of the position where you can support each other that even if someone is without the financial. stability that both of you are in your authentic versions, for both of you have power right the power doesn't necessarily have to equate to who's the breadwinner it can equate to do just having healthy partnership and being relational with each other. yeah because you know if what I overheard you know of the I love us before I leave. you're going to work when we make sure you have you know snacks and that you're. Well, when you go to work if that was the day to day and the authentic version of everything that your relationship has been it wouldn't matter, because the breadwinner because that person knows well i'm still supported. I still loved so I know that sometimes for men that that carries a little different. Value like being able to say that the breadwinner but ideally in the sake of relationship or mobile knows gender roles really shouldn't matter who's in position because. At that point, when you have the breadwinner she still felt supported and if this at this point if she's the Bible you still got supported it could still meant to a marriage, that is successful and we're both partners feel that they have power."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah that's not the case in the slightest like and I don't feel that way at all there's still issues that we have, and you know bill has to be taken care of and it's. frustrating so it's. it's nothing like that so."
177.0,Provider,"was dedicated to that place but i'm concerned because it doesn't seem as though there's actual intentional steps right both parties aren't really you're willing, but there's a way in summary."
5734.0,Patient,"and it's more. it's more like. I mean, she is Am I willing, and she was willing to put in some effort, but only if it benefits or or only if it's like what like so. If there's 10 things to show the pro you know they says 10 things of evidence she's only going to show five of them because five them show that she's guilty five says that she's innocent. she's only going to show those innocent ones and say that's it but as of right now, I have to trust that, because I have no access so but that's The thing that she doesn't know is I already know that that's a lie so she's not aware of that, I have that internal knowledge, though, so. that's the frustrating part because I know she's deliberately lying to me yeah. And that's not okay so i'm not doing it her. But yes she's doing it yeah."
177.0,Provider,"Would there be a willingness that if there was full transparency and, for example, there was hey yes, there was an infidelity please forgive me. If that were the case, would you be willing to work on a relationship."
5734.0,Patient,yeah but.
177.0,Provider,to her. In this day.
5734.0,Patient,I don't know because nothing like to that level has ever been brought up.
177.0,Provider,So. you're working from survival mode and i'm learning she's working from a fear. Fear of it don't want to get divorce and she is.
5734.0,Patient,"But at the same time. she's driving a steak into it, because of the action she's taking. yeah so she realizes that that she's doing she's actually doing things are counterproductive."
177.0,Provider,That.
5734.0,Patient,"She may be working from a fear, but the action she's taking is actually causing a wedge."
177.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5734.0,Patient,And so.
177.0,Provider,"When people identify as the victim of situations Dayton tend to continuously have been from that different state and feel justified were vindicated by their decisions so. i'm just adding an extra layer of maybe context to the situation if you're working from survival mode and the undertone is. I don't want to be in this relationship right now I don't have the financial security to be out of it so i'm just going to take the book and made my way through it. And it first stances i'm afraid that my mishaps is going to lead to my marriage lava and my family, do you know what i'm going to try to clean up. Every evidence that good clarity that this actually happened and i'm going to use avoided fact is, I don't want to be called down on myself. Right yeah. So there's just an example it's not saying that that's the reality of the situation, but when you look at it from those two sides of the spectrum. Both parties are working from a victim state with the outcome of i'm still in my marriage right, so your survival state is i'm still in this marriage, I still have a roof over my head. yeah her outcome is i'm still in this marriage, I still have the father of my kids in this. it's not a healthy way to manage conflict at all. But until both of you guys come to that awareness of establishing what those boundaries are what those expectations are you both will continue to work from this state of the States. You will continuously each other."
5734.0,Patient,"On phone please after a month for this record please go riker don't make me take it away, please. record there is based on this laptop and tablet so it will not fit remember, we had a delete other games now please go sit and watch go play. Go play. Go play, please. Go play Thank you. yeah the other frustrating part about that is that i'm like let's see if I can remember my train of thought, because each."
177.0,Provider,"state's talking about victim state your survival for fear of losing the marriage and I think my last statement was she's thinking i'm in this marriage to fire my kids to school in this household. it's not effective ways of managing your own ship, but if you will continue to work from that state of offending you will continue to operate in this pattern of offending each other."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah I know that Hers is continuous. What was me and it's not me, and you know pity me. All that shit so I already know that's that's there so. You know it's kind of like whatever because I already know where it's gonna go."
177.0,Provider,"You know, holding accountable to elevate out of that state of victims is what is going to help her to progress because supporting the victim state by saying well i'll just be powerless and whatever i'll just comply. That supports her victim state, and that makes her feel vindicated and justified and the actions that she does. You give in and almost say yes, you are the victim, I am the offender then she feels vindicated. She feel. hey what's a low you know starting here and there, and victim."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah that's like. Her making the statement you know. I didn't take the money this and that I can prove it to you, but the only way i'll prove it to you is, if you admit that you have suspicions that I did it like. No. Like I want to see but. i'm not okay with admitting to her that I think it was her just so that we should be because. If for some ungodly reason like I said she didn't deposit because she's back for me happens I don't know but. like that, then obviously won't show, but then that brings up a whole new can of issues because. You know she makes mountains out of molehills so it's like."
177.0,Provider,"manipulation and for sure you continue to fall into the trap. Images i'm gonna just call it like it is OK, because if the relationship was the next state. of trust. Then, if money went missing your first thought would not be my wife, for her brother sold. $7,000 for me that's very telling right. There So the first thing was I can prove to you. If you would just tell me that you think it's me. We call them around only yes, I have a suspicion, given the situation and the current dynamics of our relationship. Trust has been jeopardize. money that has been in a location that's place that's only known to the individuals that this in this household is gone so My suspicion is, you may have knowledge about where this money is, but if you have evidence to discredit this please show me because I want to be wrong."
5734.0,Patient,"Yes, if I remember that I would have been better, but it's also already been like a week now, so I can't really backtrack to that. When."
177.0,Provider,"You i'm challenging you that you can remember these things in the moment, if you don't default to the powerless and give it into her manipulation."
5734.0,Patient,yeah.
177.0,Provider,"it's been very effective in this marriage for her to her benefit to use these things, and she may not even have the awareness of death and manipulation Maybe she does. But if we want to go to the least pet pathological explanation, she does not have an awareness that she's operating from this frequency. And she can use the accountability to pull her out of this city that's the least half a logical explanation right you hold her accountable by the next time she she makes this play it, the truth is, you have suspicions that she took a feller. But then also our way. But I don't want to. Believe it's you I want you to prove me wrong."
5734.0,Patient,yeah.
177.0,Provider,"Even with. With the pumping. I want. To be proven. That what you showed me is all there is to this. Give me that opportunity, prove me wrong, I never wanted to be more wrong in my life right now. Because I truly believe you want to be wrong, you want this marriage to work."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah. So far, history is dictating i'm not. Reading."
177.0,Provider,"yeah because she's practicing of waiting and she's recording information. solely based on her reasons for survival. mechanisms are not going to benefit the. What what's your take on this conversation, because I know you have other things that you gotta get done but."
5734.0,Patient,Not to give into her so basically to remember that. not playing to her victim card.
177.0,Provider,"and hold you accountable, when I feel that you may be partaking in that role to be both of you guys I played the victim state for a while and now it's it's a rolling in the relationship and and those unhealthy. attributes are. Becoming dismal now well. I figured visible for a while, but both of you have take turns of practicing avoidance."
5734.0,Patient,"know you guys sit and watch the movies you're not going outside cuz it's raining it's muddy out there, and you guys aren't dressed. So no you're not going outside. Do you guys understand me. Look at me you're not going outside. No, I just told you why. Stop."
