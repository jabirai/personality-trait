298.0,Provider,up just a second yeah i'm recording okay what I was doing was getting our topic for today and i'll have it in just a second. it's it's a doozy.
7902.0,Patient,My whole day is a doozy.
298.0,Provider,And why is that.
7902.0,Patient,"I went and mourned the death of my daughter's mom at the beach and. You know kind of like gave her a final parting CREST letter that I beg to the ocean, which was a really scary total experience to tell you about but. I have started the grieving process. So yeah."
298.0,Provider,progress.
7902.0,Patient,"yeah. I went down there and I do a heart and Sam and I was like 20 feet out right and there's like a little hole in the middle of the heart, I put my letter there that I wrote. A home and we put gasoline I smudge down the area, and I have my instance going I let it. wash your burn it a little bit sage in it and then next to the her, I am a you and then for the letter for the number four and. Then I think the science so forever. As I finished a infinity sign I sit back and the tide has rolled in super hard, all the way. To the way, like. Right, when I finish. So let me know that the message was sent."
298.0,Provider,"that's one way to look at it that's a good way to look at it. yeah all right um. So. I am going to share a document today on forgiveness that we're going to work. Through so, can you guys read. What i'm writing. i'm going to read it to you. forgiveness, is a process where someone who has wronged. chooses to let go of their resentment and treat their wrongdoer with compassion. that's what forgiveness is, according to this information sheet let's keep going forgiveness, does not mean forgetting are condoning the wrongdoing. Granting legal mercy or reconciling the relationship, you can forgive a person, while in no way, believing that their actions were accessible or acceptable or justified. On the other hand, simply saying the words I forgive you or accepting an apology is not forgiveness, in fact, forgiveness can occur without ever speaking to the wrongdoer forgiveness, is an emotional change that occurs within the person who has been wronged. Does anybody want me to read any of those again because they're deep. Oh."
7902.0,Patient,yeah okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So stop me if anything triggers a memory or a story or a thought that you're having. here's what. here's what forgiveness, is the decision to overcome pain that was inflicted by another person it's a decision you make. forgiveness is letting go of anger resentment shame and other emotions emotions associated with injustice, even though they are reasonable feelings it's choosing it's making a decision to let go of the anger resentment shame. forgiveness is treating the offender with compassion, even though they are not entitled to it."
7902.0,Patient,"Oh. I have been triggering statement. So i've had to deal with a couple instances to really forgive somebody is one of my best friends and he had date raped my fiance. And I feed them to a pool multiple times and kept standing back up and beat the hell out of them, but also, I mean I forgive them now. But, at the time I didn't and it took a lot to actually get through the entire forgiveness process, but with a the death of my baby's mom being foul play and me, knowing the person, she was last seen with the. trying not to be impulsive and. turn them inside out, basically, is really hard for me. And yeah that's the symbols, where I can put it is I can't find myself finding the forgiveness for that you know."
298.0,Provider,yeah. Anybody.
7902.0,Patient,Have any triggering statement.
298.0,Provider,yeah you know you're being really honest it's okay to say hey I can't find forgiveness this person did something so cruel here's where i'm at I have not got there.
7902.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"um. And and. Who am I to tell you, when you're going to get there."
7902.0,Patient,"yeah. You know I still have. extremely violent thoughts about it, like grotesquely. Bad thoughts, but you know i've tried and I what I did today was a piece of it. But I mean i'm sure eventually i'll be like oh shit happens, but until away, and you know I really hope for both of our sakes, he does not cross my war bad."
298.0,Provider,"uh huh. You know how they say the forgiveness, is for you."
7902.0,Patient,Know i've heard forgiveness as weakness.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. i've heard that forgiveness, is for the person who's giving it it's letting go of the anger, the resentment the shame and other emotions and then being able to have compassion for them. Even though they're not entitled to it."
7902.0,Patient,"No, I got Joe."
298.0,Provider,Tara. yeah and you think of anyone that you've had to let go of anger and resentment and shame what what's the story there.
7902.0,Patient,um my ex husband. Oh.
298.0,Provider,You have compassion for. His situation now.
7902.0,Patient,i'm yes i'm getting there.
298.0,Provider,you're getting there. yeah. Do you treat him with compassion.
7902.0,Patient,"I don't really talk to him, very often, and he just sent me a. an email basically stating he wants to stop paying alimony but. He can't because it's ordered by the courts and it's just to me it's kind of lateral a little shady to do, while i'm in treatment, you know I mean. um. But I can also see where he's coming from you know I can't imagine writing somebody a check twice a month, you know."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
7902.0,Patient,When you're angry at them. yeah but. It is what it is.
298.0,Provider,"It is what it is and you don't need to attach a lot of emotions with that. Right, I think I think you're dealing with the facts here."
7902.0,Patient,"Right and the thing is, I agree, like the forgiveness, is for for me, not for him, you know it's because I don't want to sit in that shit anymore. So yeah I agree with this."
298.0,Provider,What are your thoughts.
7902.0,Patient,Steve oh Kevin.
298.0,Provider,Kevin.
7902.0,Patient,"well. hello, Mr pretty easygoing guy which. Is any new opportunities to add a friend of mine were brands wrong hiding inside easton 16 and. Pushing me briefly not been bringing me they tend to prefer weddings you pitch me on to them in a really long using them super Nice and, finally, it took them forever they find his me on your mother fucker rank on the cots who would I would. Give that. It did it took me, but he wanted to eat me up. In a body to body would. do that. i'm trying to. Do that later skis and show, and then it goes in. It kind of Nice job. Nice and ready to go and no better than your debt and effective I ended up going to jail. In it very good, according to this chick chick style. I don't know. I was minding my own business, but anyways yeah i'm not gonna get into detail about it, but as definitely something I did forgive somebody for. It. Okay yeah i'm i'm not sure i've never forgave her. But we'll circle back today, maybe."
298.0,Provider,"Okay well let's look at the four phases of forgiveness, you have the first phase, which is the uncovering phase, during this first phase of forgiveness, you will improve your understanding of the injustice and how it has impacted your life. So, instead of just reacting on emotion you actually sit and think about why are you having such strong emotion over this. Next, the second phase is that decision phase, during the second phase, you will gain a deeper understanding of what forgiveness is and make the decision to choose or reject forgiveness, as an option. Anybody interrupt me and think of where you're at in the different phases feel free go ahead."
7902.0,Patient,Oh we're gonna save the second base kind of sounds like the pre meditation base. Every said you're gonna do it. may sound a lot nicer than premeditation.
298.0,Provider,yeah that sounds like a legal context.
7902.0,Patient,"context, yes, like don't let you."
298.0,Provider,"The work phase, this is number three during the third phase, he will start to understand the offender in a new way which will allow positive feelings towards the offender and yourself. In your. In your own stories. Can you see yourself working through these phases."
7902.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah it depends on with WHO.
298.0,Provider,"or which situation. And stage, for this is the final phase of forgiveness, you will further decrease the negative emotions associated with the injustice, you may find meaning and experiences or recognize ways in which you have grown as a result."
7902.0,Patient,"Okay. Everyone to hold a grudge began it really been a bad decision door, I had to really lose you beato grudge another word myself that battered women's shelter that kind of turmoil somebody else."
298.0,Provider,"You could even turn this whole four phases of forgiveness on yourself. Like are you are you in one of these phases, when you forgive yourself for the poor choices, or whatever it is that you're thinking about."
7902.0,Patient,Thank you.
298.0,Provider,"So my mother in law, never liked me or she did not like me. And i've got story after story that. Still curls my toes about how mean she was to me, she died about three years ago, and she had a very long painful death and um. I had a really hard time forgiving this woman. Is she just she was mean. And i'm um. I think i'm getting to the deepening phase, but I don't have to interact with her anymore. that's nice it's Nice that I don't have to interact and you know what I can never go back and feel. Those things those emotions that I was having at the time I can't repeat those emotions I don't even want to repeat those emotions and i'm growing because I don't have to be in that situation anymore, and I love that there's distance now. between me and her."
7902.0,Patient,"Oh gonna say it'd be like easier to forgive somebody after they're gone forever, you know because they're not still there, I you know i've told you i've had serious issues with my step mom."
298.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
7902.0,Patient,Like it's so much easier for me to forgive her from across the United States.
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7902.0,Patient,"But when me and her are in the same household ID search great and usually ends and me having to go to the psych Ward. yeah. But um yeah I know. I can, was that word relate to your story I guess."
298.0,Provider,"You know I put it time heals wounds. just getting distance from. The situation is a good thing to aid I don't have anger towards my mother in law anymore it's done it's over she's dead. My. had her funeral. This is terrible at her funeral her sister leans over and with whispers to me, she says, I can't believe it my mother made it to sainthood and she's only been in the you know dead for two days and she's already made it to sainthood. which she she was such. just listening to everybody talk about her was not the woman that I knew but. will have a different memory when somebody dies. Alright let's see what we keep going any thoughts from Stephen or Tara Tara."
7902.0,Patient,Not too far.
298.0,Provider,"All right, during the uncovering phase of forgiveness, you will improve your understanding of injustice and how it has impacted your life use the journal prompts below to begin exploring. describe the injustices, you have endured what happened, why was the treatment unfair, I gave my example of my mother in law, I didn't tell you what she would do but. What it does anybody have something maybe different from what you've already talked about. Maybe something lighter than."
7902.0,Patient,"Muslims time anything triggers a forgiveness for me it's like a super traumatic experience I don't have any light. Somebody drink my energy drink, without asking me and that I couldn't find out who was but I went ahead and told everybody hey. Next time I haven't drink in the fridge don't fucking drink it, you know, like okay i'll forgive the first one, but what is it a. Shame on me earth still coming shame on you vice versa. yeah like the second time after i've already given everyone a warning and whoever good at the first time forgiveness yeah i'd be a little pissed off somebody shouldn't it again."
298.0,Provider,"So I think you, you gave examples um so think about these different things about how the injustice affected, do you over the stolen monster drink was their anger and shame painful emotions."
7902.0,Patient,There was me not having enough energy to make it through group and getting kicked out.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
7902.0,Patient,cuz I finally.
298.0,Provider,Did it.
7902.0,Patient,It burst my bubble.
298.0,Provider,It effective time and money.
7902.0,Patient,Is that their. Money social.
298.0,Provider,It changed your worldview. that people are evil.
7902.0,Patient,"Yes, and they shall. stay with energy drinks."
298.0,Provider,"It it reaffirmed those reoccurring thoughts about injustice. yeah so you you end up repeating people are going to steal from you, you know it puts a negative connotation at how you look at your private things in a environment like you're living. Exactly now, there was no physical harm in that situation and I don't know that it changed any behavior of yours."
7902.0,Patient,"I was a little better, so I mean."
298.0,Provider,"that's emotions that's that's emotions. So things that injustices would be painful emotions change. behavior practical costs change worldview cognitive reversal physical arm I don't know if you guys can see that but it's interesting at when you look at something that you, you look at a situation. At where you feel an injustice has happened, you almost have to look at these six different things, and goes, what did that affect. And just that little monster drink disappearing. Red Bull. Because. Three or four of the six things listed here that one incident caused for things to happen to you, time and money negative thoughts, change your world view and there was painful emotions like anger. It makes it validate. Matthew it validates what you were experiencing, it was a bigger deal than just a missing soda."
7902.0,Patient,"Exactly. economy makes you stay on your toes a little bit more, which would be a change the behavior. and cognitive rehearsal of always thinking okay well I don't know exactly who did it, so I might as well have to think that everybody is capable of that so you're gonna get a paranoid in a place where you're not needing to be. And hiding so like I keep all my dreams in my room. And I count that, to an extent I don't count them all, but."
298.0,Provider,"So. We have to then take it to the next step there, there was an injustice done to you, yes, what, what are the pros and cons of forgiving the people who may have done that to you now we can't blame. The person because we don't know the person, but in this situation of the Red Bull, what are the pros of forgiving the person."
7902.0,Patient,"A. Well, I don't have to sit there and be hyperventilate or contemplates anything. grabs so you know it saves my time emotion and social status at the House. Well, if i'm the con side I take everyone and question them it kind of makes me look like an asshole see the language. mm hmm and i'm not basil I just don't like my shit."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, but the pros you already went through matter of fact, you went around and told everybody I forgive you all just don't do it again right. OK, so the pros are you decided to forgive and you have you're not going to run around and be in a bad mood and and take it out on everybody anymore. Exactly okay. What would be the downside of not forgiving everybody."
7902.0,Patient,Not trusting everybody.
298.0,Provider,"Right right, that would be a cause."
7902.0,Patient,"relationships, because you would be like all right, I obviously can't trust anybody, so why make friendships that he ever lasting and then next thing you know there goes your whole subvarieties circle. of people got your back and you're like no dude I don't want you to get my back, because I can just see and. And first you get a laser you right into a relapse and then back to square one."
298.0,Provider,"So you forgiving people is a better choice and the cons, because not forgiving them, as you said, it leads to not having friends not having people who have your back not having sobriety. Okay, so there's more things on the pro side of forgiving like you did. Yes, okay. It says here whether or not you've made the decision to forgive describe how things might do different different if you decided to do so, be specific as possible, so you went ahead and gave the example of the con you were very specific if I don't forgive people i'm going to get very. agoraphobic. If you do decide to forgive everyone like you did How are things going to be different."
7902.0,Patient,"Well, you just take by the enemies out overnight and just be like Oh, it is what it is i'll just get another drink. and move on and not have it ruin my day."
298.0,Provider,Exactly and.
7902.0,Patient,"I just had a cold one. In the fridge but I had semi cold ones in my room. So I was more like okay well i'm just gonna go grab a different one. and have it all Nice, instead of having one that I had in the fridge hidden fairly well and that would be the end of the problem there."
298.0,Provider,"Is. That. All right, I. Go."
7902.0,Patient,This is definitely something that has actually happened. And that is how I saw this. With food stamps.
298.0,Provider,"So guys, I want you to think of. A situation and for next week, would you remind me that we're going to talk about this page again and how to work through forgiveness and maybe you can bring something different, and. What were the pros and cons. Of. forgiving that person what were the emotions that you know what was the injustice that was done to you and describe the situation and we will go through the phases again together. Alright guys who needs a medication refill."
7902.0,Patient,"All right, I don't think I do them good."
298.0,Provider,"All right, I already have. Matthew West wrote me a couple days ago and I refilled it when he asked for it."
7902.0,Patient,"Oh yes, I know I wanted to talk to you about the pan, and all that stuff almost killed me."
298.0,Provider,"Almost killed you I blood pressure, medicine."
7902.0,Patient,i'm going to pick somebody up from the hospital okay. i'll see you that's a big deal see and again.

298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7902.0,Patient,"I usually get i'll have my one value my method on that i've been on the prepared at all in the business trophy. And usually they give me enough for morning and night right. Well, I only had one benzo champion and then I had to. Have the pro panel and I thought it was a new medication Oh, and I forgot to take my ability to which I am ready for the shot, but I didn't. Somewhere in my brain I was like Oh, he only gave me just the morning dosage so I take them right well I take to prevent it all the been joking. had my mail or my 60 mil methadone and something else, and my heart slowed down to the point where I started sweating and I couldn't stand up, I was like blacking out about a pass out."
298.0,Provider,So we do it.
7902.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"I was learning milligrams no. One time, you cannot take 40 milligrams you need to only take 20."
7902.0,Patient,"Yes, I know the trust me, it was an accident cuz I had totally seen it wrong just because I humans are creatures of habits. right but i'm in general, the pro patent all hasn't necessarily i'm. done, you know. It did what it's supposed to do, which is lower your blood pressure, but that never stopped me from getting my they've been getting a lot more frequent to my anxiety attacks and i've noticed i've been hallucinating a lot. And a like a lot more than usual, but I think it's just from doing so many hallucinogens because, like I constantly see the walls greed. And like different things. That shouldn't look like they're like you know but glitches and stuff like that and it's kind of weird and me out. But uh yeah. notice also anxiety has been. really bad through the roof so just like how i'm talking right now, and this whole session I just haven't really shut up is i've noticed that i'm doing well, my daughter does, and that is just babbling nonstop to combat with my anxiety. I feel like if I constantly am talking and saying things that are i'm basically just talk shit you know. hey. Okay, it, but I was thinking about it, yesterday I was like Okay, maybe I should try being quieter because if i'm quiet. It will make. You know, when I do speak it, you know it has like some substance to it, instead of oh it's just Matthew fucking talking his ass off because he's fucking freaked out about everything. And just super written with anxiety and. So that's all I wanted to tell you I was gonna wait till Wednesday, which is today I wasn't sure if you're coming in, or not."
298.0,Provider,"Be there Saturday, but. I am of the opinion that I don't have a lot of MED changes, from what I understand you're making MED changes with your methadone also and."
7902.0,Patient,"yeah 60 and I told him that's where I want to stop because I don't want to be like super dependent on it, I just want to be able to get through my plugin day. But it's cool because I haven't had any fentanyl or heroin cravings either had any math cravings I haven't even really been craving any kind of drug except for food. food."
298.0,Provider,"yeah that's true. But let's talk again on Saturday, when I get there and i'm going to think a little bit more on your situation i've requested the in Vegas to stand up and please check with. That please check with West to see or somebody to check the pharmacy to see if you can get the shot there by Saturday morning."
