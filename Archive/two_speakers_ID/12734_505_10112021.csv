505.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh you wouldn't know I did this 40 hours a week for do."
12734.0,Patient,Sometimes computers just don't like.
505.0,Provider,You don't I don't even ask anymore I just like. Start over. yeah but i'm i'm happy to see how things for you.
12734.0,Patient,"they've been good um things have been then doing pretty well I i've been liking, the trend relax from an anxiety standpoint um one thing I want to talk to you about and I. forgot to mention I forgot this happened last time I took us our eyes to but ever since I started taking it i've been having pretty vivid dreams again like consistently online and nothing that wakes me up nothing that really sticks with me. i'm. Second. she's someone's walking by."
505.0,Provider,No problem. No problem.
12734.0,Patient,"yeah it's just. Here so it's hard to hear. Okay um she so it's nothing that wakes me up or like usually I might remember when I first wake up, but usually nothing that like sticks with me but it's like dreams, where i'm active, and so I don't wake up refreshed I feel like my brain doesn't ever shut off. And it's like consistently feels like all night every night my brain is just going in these dreams, since I started so that's been frustrating, where I do feel like it's been helping permitting gaiety standpoint but i'm just tired."
505.0,Provider,"They don't really yeah. Okay let's let's break this down um what time of day, are you taking."
12734.0,Patient,i'm taking in the mornings right now.
505.0,Provider,you're taking it in the morning.
12734.0,Patient,"And then I take the topamax at night. is how that's when I started, because when I started it, I was also weaning off the this drill."
505.0,Provider,Right right.
12734.0,Patient,"So, which is yeah."
505.0,Provider,So you know let's think about So the question is obviously it's risk benefit. In order of first of all that's a very uncommon side effect.
12734.0,Patient,"Oh, and and I."
505.0,Provider,"you're on a very low dose you're on the lowest low as possible, so we don't really have anywhere to move as far as don't drink Alex goes to 10 milligram grams 1020 so you're pretty sensitive two minutes and the five milligrams sounds good. However, this this. dreaming business let's talk about that, so one of the options is to treat the side effect so you know we can treat the side effect of it does remeeting how you're treating your sleep. Now that's adding. Another medication. So how are you feeling about that."
12734.0,Patient,And what was the medication option fee for that.
505.0,Provider,"Well there's a one up, first of all on a backup tell me about your average to how you tell me about your weight at this point."
12734.0,Patient,"appetites been good i've still been eating while eating regularly i'm up probably three to four pounds and much closer to 120. Now than I was um. So I would say. Like I think i'd like to be Eric was like 125 ish healthy way, but I feel like i'm getting there i'm I don't know at this point i'm i'm less focused on what the weight is more i'm eating three meals, a day. Okay i'm eating. well balanced food. And i'm starting to exercise more like i've gotten in the yoga classes again at least once a week I mean, I still walk my dog every day. I started exploring like potentially trying running with my dog to get some more Cardio and. So. Definitely trying to do more activity there as well."
505.0,Provider,"Okay, so I want you to I sent you. A message to his car in the chat."
12734.0,Patient,yeah.
505.0,Provider,"cool can you write that down. yeah this medication is actually a it's an Anti depressant However we use it for sleep it's a very old medication and one of. The side effects is sedation, so it is not tolerated well enough for us to really use it as a primary anti-depressant however it's really, really helpful with sleep. it's very benign it's very safe, it will play very well with your train telex it's actually going to give you a little bit of a boost, without. Increasing the train telex I love this medication for you, one of the side effects, is it can stimulate the appetite a little bit so some people, you know who are trying to. have to be really careful not to gain weight, we. gotta be careful, a test, however, for you, this might actually be a perfect."
12734.0,Patient,solution now.
505.0,Provider,Unlike topamax unlike twins helix this is more like your brain along as needed.
12734.0,Patient,So they're okay.
505.0,Provider,"with it. yeah and have to take every day for it to be effective. So you can work with that. yeah So if you just say okay i'm gonna practice i'm going to work with the dose that's another thing you can do i'm going to prescribe it. Okay whoa because you've been you. let's start. With has actually got to be a I think the lowest is 7.5 I wouldn't normally start somebody a 15 for you i'm going to prescribe this 7.5 I want. To split it in half. or actually with even last. Okay i'm. see if it is a helpful support and the metric here is dreams. Okay attacks like co active activity and what kind of dreams are you on an epic quest where you're trying to launch it please figure something out all night, are you thinking about something in the past that's unresolved what it what."
12734.0,Patient,"it's all you know the content. yeah the ones that I remember and just in general, I feel like it's always need it's doing something it's always it's. Working on a project it's trying to get something done the one I want I had last week was that I was talking to my therapist but I said, a point was my therapist this morning. about these two and she actually brought up because I saw her before, when I was living in Ann arbor for Grad school and she had pulled up a note from my psychiatrist at the time and that's when I just started MED, so I was on zoloft and will be. Time and she said she found an old note. From that psychiatrist that when I started ssri is the first time a dreams were a side effect that I had had. been to so just something with my brain. But it's when I was telling her about was like I had one last week, where I was driving with my dog and we were driving home and then there was like storms all around us, and I could see like tornadoes and stuff and I was just trying to get home and I got. home, and I was fine, but it was like. It so it's like there's anxiety implemented there's always something. you're doing an active. And so I think that's what's keeping me going I get i've never woken up from there was one there's only been one with my X involved, and he was like. We were in the car doing we're out doing something, and he was like trying to make advances and I was just like pushing them off, and it was just like. I was always doing something I was always I never felt like I was in danger in any of them, it was always just like I was doing something there's always something I was trying to get through, or something i'm working on."
505.0,Provider,"Definitely, there is doing. But there sounds good, so we seem of safety, you know."
12734.0,Patient,"And some of them yeah that I don't know that's all of them that's, just like the ones that i'm remembering."
505.0,Provider,I think there was another.
12734.0,Patient,"Like I feel like i've woken up more days, where i'm just like oh dreams again, but I don't remember what the context was it was all just like. Oh yeah like I remember last week there was another one that I just I woke up and I remember working on a project. And it was just I was working on a project, and I remember what it was I don't remember the context around it, but I remember having to work on a project. Which is what i'm doing in real life, like my friends are getting married this week and i'm helping them put together Center pieces and stuff like that. But yeah they are so some of them have a safety aspect. But I don't know if that's at least i'm not remembering that being a consistent theme i'm remembering activity being consistent, though."
505.0,Provider,"So you know if you can keep a dream journal about what the content is you know see if it's gonna be mad. Okay, and that and that is stuff that you can process with your therapist, however, if it's a side effect to the medication Glenn let's try this makes sense for you. Because we want you to sleep to be restored we've talked about how it has to be neurodegenerative. We can talk about look up on sleep architecture that's the clinical Lord for it, that we want your sleep to have that restorative. You know patterns. Where you wake up and you're feeling rested. So I think this mercy tests have been really might have a role. And, but let's touch base with you said, your anxiety is improved correct."
12734.0,Patient,"yeah I do feel like my anxieties improved. I don't feel like i'm clenching like my teeth as much I don't feel like i'm worried as much during the day about. Like little things like my dog and like little you know things throughout the day i've been practicing with propranolol and more. And so that's been helping on days, where I have you know a lot of meetings or presentations. Good so I have been implementing that which has been helpful as well. And I think just it's been enough to in combination with. You know, doing more social activities getting more like Community going again getting into. yoga classes again. kind of getting back to a life I was used to living. yeah and balancing out not just. Working because work is still work at this point like that nothing's really improved in. and work cycle, but. I am bringing more like art into. My own life like you know yoga activity in my own life seeing family seeing friends. You know I building and stuff to look forward to that was one thing that i've been working with my therapist on so I can go out to my cottage for two weeks and have like an art class that i've schedule up there."
505.0,Provider,Oh.
12734.0,Patient,"yeah I know a lot of that stuff's been really nice it just like getting over, which is what i've always used much meds for is like. Take the edge off so that I can. focus on that stuff and that's where I feel like I am. Like i've been able yeah job so that I have the energy to do that it's just with this lack of like restorative sleep, I feel like i'm just still like slowly drained."
505.0,Provider,"Throughout. The day okay your expectations are actually right on what I hear you saying and I love this about you is that you're using medication. To as a support, but your goal is your coping skills and your investment in the therapy and the self insight like knowing yourself knowing what is replating knowing what's the pleading, how do you manage the job that's not really your ideal job. With. The things that you enjoy and, like you, are walking in the right direction and from where we start it oh my gosh. Your anxiety. it's so improved. As well yeah. yeah I feel like for walking in the right direction. So um you're doing. So many things right so let's add in this market has, I mean again i'm this medication goes up that would take a standard dose I started to a lot of people have 30 some people haven't 45 you're not going to be there. But you might not be at 7.5 either, so what i'm saying is this builders is variable. MED it's very benign. So if you're like Julie, this is through a MED. we're at right dose. Then we'll work with that. Okay let's keep that twin telex where it is, is it really expensive."
12734.0,Patient,"know so with my insurance and then there was some discount card that I got through CDs it's $10. For 30 days. yeah so i'm good right now, until that where if that wears off then maybe but. Okay far every time i've refilled it it's still only $10."
505.0,Provider,Okay.
12734.0,Patient,That oh yeah.
505.0,Provider,"Right that's great again, this is a very unique MED with yes it's an antidepressant but we're treating you for generalized anxiety disorder, much more than depression, so this man has his very novel action. For anxieties, so if it's working you're tolerating it in a week get this dream things settle down, this is the right man for you. perfect. Okay Okay, this is good stuff any relationships. Are you are you so I got."
12734.0,Patient,"It well it's opening up, I mean it's definitely like open now, I would say, so I joined a dating APP officially last week. Once i've been talking with some people I haven't gone on any dates yet, but my friends i've like let them know i'm like mentally. Open again I one thing that I did was I just was feeling still hooked with my previous relationship so I sent kind of a final closure. email to my axe and I haven't talked to him since March, but it was just kind of spiraling and I just feel like I left with pretty angry words that is not me and that's. It was what I needed to do in the time but that's just not who I am so I sent kind of."
505.0,Provider,"For you, I like peaceful."
12734.0,Patient,"Closure email and I haven't heard anything back, which I expected he's the kind of person who just cuts ties, but it really helped me like leave like and finally feel like that's done close that chapter and then feel more open to something new, so. So yeah there's definitely open moving that's right that's."
505.0,Provider,"Huge that's huge yeah. You know, and the fact that you feel that your anxiety is improving, at a time where you're taking risks like. Eating again. That tells me you're doing even better. yeah it would be one thing if you were. weren't taking any risks that's a big deal. So yeah okay. yeah have it too okay. So let's do this, I want to add this in i'm going to give you refill let's let's keep this open ended you just call with you need me i'm you know you're on pretty basic medication, we could always hand this over to a primary care Doc. You don't necessarily need specialized care so um I mean I love working with you, but if it's you know don't feel like you have to do it this way. Okay, this point we're tight trading. we're not finding. What is working, I feel like we really kind of know what's working and it's a matter of tight trading belts so um. You know either pat you call me if we need to work with those, but if we have this style, then I want you to feel really empowered or to go to your primary care Doc can say, these are my meds i'm good. huh you know just give me these meds i'm sorry."
12734.0,Patient,Okay.
505.0,Provider,sounds good hey.
12734.0,Patient,"I don't have a primary care, yet, but that is on my list to set up so that is yeah that is good to know I actually have a recommendation of one from a friend who they use for their medication, so I think she's got. Like but she's got that kind of. interest and passion so very good on her schedule."
505.0,Provider,Excellent well i'm always delighted to see you. When I see you on my schedule i'm like.
12734.0,Patient,I was like meeting with you do.
505.0,Provider,Oh.
12734.0,Patient,"Alright, so a couple questions so. yeah keep with chantel keep with the morning taking it in the morning, would you say. it's over. Either way, all right."
505.0,Provider,"I mean that you may as well, work with that variable. makes you cry at night."
12734.0,Patient,You try to lose. Okay try that and I and then keep with topamax.
505.0,Provider,"Why yeah. I don't mess with it it's it's you're on a really small boats, but. yeah I somehow."
12734.0,Patient,If.
505.0,Provider,It has value.
12734.0,Patient,mm hmm and then the new one take that when would you recommend taking.
505.0,Provider,"On good question I would say, what do you feel is your best bet behind."
12734.0,Patient,And 10 ish.
505.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, what time do you take the dog out like final round."
12734.0,Patient,Sometimes between nine and 10.
505.0,Provider,"Okay. I would say. Take the dog out. And like be ready to just settle down as part of your routine any sleep, you know we is always very much based on the transition of I did the dog I brush my teeth i'm in bed. i'm going to read this book like it's very important that you have those structures. So, ideally. it's could just take this probably half an hour before bed. So, again i'm always really respectful of the way. You process medication. So it's possible you're gonna hit take this and you're going to feel like it's like we call it the Velvet hammer like whoa I. I like I can't brush my teeth i'm out. So, for most people, it would be 30 minutes, but I would say, for you. You know, do your basics, and I know what do you start your routine plan on 30 minutes to feed for you want to go to sleep."
12734.0,Patient,So maybe it's when I lay down to read. It yet then yeah okay.
505.0,Provider,right if you're about a half an hour out. Right okay.
12734.0,Patient,"But again, it was good yeah."
505.0,Provider,there's an Asterix next to that because I would. yeah same time. If there was going to be anybody who's like 10 minutes later it's like my couch.
12734.0,Patient,"Yes, the system is very sensitive to anything."
505.0,Provider,Your dog is sitting there like.
12734.0,Patient,hey yeah hey do it yet. yeah that's good yeah do everything first but okay.
