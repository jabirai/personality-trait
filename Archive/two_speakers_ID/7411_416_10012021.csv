7411.0,Patient,"Hello. Julie, how are you."
416.0,Provider,Oh nice to see you.
7411.0,Patient,nice to see. One second. Getting everything organized okay.
416.0,Provider,"Alright, so. Welcome"
7411.0,Patient,Thank you.
416.0,Provider,keep losing your. There you go.
7411.0,Patient,You get his back.
416.0,Provider,"So I spent a little bit of time reading through some of your notes from amy. Just so I could kind of be as caught up as possible. um, but I would love to just hear from you, because, although I do work with DDT also and I am training vtt. i'm not sure how similar amy and I are so. Also use a lot of work in DVD ready."
7411.0,Patient,"mm hmm oh yeah I did a lot of DDT work and I actually found it to work, really, really well because i've been. I had seen, I think, in total, six therapist six other therapists in my life and they always did cognitive behavioral therapy and I always had some sort of I don't know I just like couldn't I don't know there wasn't any motivation to go to therapy. And so, with amy this was a new way of thinking about things, and I think it really helped because it was just different than my conventional therapy and it felt like. She understood she she understood very well like what my problems were and what skills, I needed to help change kind of mindset. And kind of prevent things from happening yeah."
416.0,Provider,And so we did a lot of hours let's go see find yourself using this doctor.
7411.0,Patient,"And one of the biggest ones that we worked on for a while, like a big chunk of a cup the first couple months that we were together was wise mine and at first, I was very apprehensive. Because I always been kind of skeptical about therapy, since it had failed me so much. But when we start working with that it started to make more sense, every time I would see her, and then it just became something where I just. started thinking about it, without thinking about it, and I really enjoyed that I made a lot of things easier and it helped so much with my anxiety and. yeah it was the beginning of my change of course and the way I saw myself and how I reacted to situations in my life and then. Later we worked on. But something that we work together in in therapy, which was the control the circle of control. And then. A couple other things i'm. Just."
416.0,Provider,You guys you've mentioned in group before somebody grounding techniques. And some mindfulness right so did you guys do a lot of that. And that's i'm imagining What helps you get into the wise lines. yeah.
7411.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly which um yeah I think that was really a changing point when I was able to carry more mindful of the situation kind of prepare myself kind of. A big thing that amy and I worked on was victimizing myself and so whenever I would start means out or like boohoo like this is happening to me, and she would always kind of snapped me back and she'd be like oh we've been working on this and she's like you're better than this like. And then I always felt really good, because then I would. Think of like just be more mindful Can I take myself away from the situation um a lot of the help was. kind of seen it in a different perspective and. kind of. Like with the wise mind kind of seeing what's real and what's not real and then focusing on kind of directing my emotions to what's real. And I guess that's something that I really valued every time I saw her because there's definitely a bunch of times, where I would kind of get off track and kind of go back to my old ways and and she was helping me steer back into. into modeling and. That was a big thing that happened in the beginning of therapy, which was, I wanted to explain every sad situation I had been in, and that was kind of my focal point, and she. helped me kind of because. Nothing in the past can change, even if we, I mean I can talk about it but i'm."
416.0,Provider,Just.
7411.0,Patient,"Long as it connects to what's happening right now. And not just thinking about all the negative things that have happened in. And, and so. That was kind of my way of thinking just kind of thinking about the saddest things that had happened or really like victimizing myself making myself feel bad about myself and not having confidence in in what I can do, and so. say I we worked a lot in and. We focus more on the present time. Like going forward and how to solve problems, and so one of the big things is she helped with my marriage and it was a total turning point in my life because she asked us really good questions and kind of helped us realize what the situation was and kind of. Really kind of focus on communication because it's, the key element in a relationship, and it was something that we haven't really focused on and. When we have them repeat together, it was just yeah it was great I think. That was one of the things that saved my marriage or my marriage is my marriage. And from then on, it was just now right now is school because I just transition to university."
416.0,Provider,And where you go.
7411.0,Patient,"we're going to uc Davis. i'm excited but i've been really nervous and there's moments in time. Where it's hard to ground myself because. everything's moving really fast, and there are times, where it seems that I don't know what's happening and there's times when I feel that I question my. capabilities and my intelligence and my ability to do what I have to do, because I also struggle with ADHD. So big part was just. Trying to. put enough meaning into the work i'm doing to feel satisfied with what i'm doing and it's down on topic or on tracker focused right um but then there was days, where I definitely forgot my medication a lot and it caused me to really space out."
416.0,Provider,Your the. inattentive type of ADHD.
7411.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I was probably halfway through. immunized sessions. that she. diagnosed me with ADHD and everything started to make a lot more sense, because a lot of my anxiety and depression has kind of circled around. This idea that I can't do anything like. That I can't focus, I am very self destructive, I am very impulsive and it's very hard for me to focus and even if I truly love something. it's still hard for me to sometimes derive meaning from it and it made me actually like very depressed for a long time, and when I first started seeing amy I was taking anatomy courses for anatomy and physiology. And so. I just remember. After class just because it was like a four hour class. And then. There was a short kind of office hour after that I would attend and I remember. Just working so hard on that class. that by the time that the class was over, I would have so much built up anxiety and I would always have a panic attack. And so that was kind of my main struggle that every day there was, I was having a panic attack, and so I was taking medication for that, because it seemed like the only option that I had. And it worked really well it kind of got me into the space where Okay, this is what it feels like to not be anxious all day and then I slowly started feeling that more and more just by myself and feeling like Okay, I know. That i've been feeling normal most of the day, and some Okay, and then. But it was just really back and forth it's just like me just anxiety and then the ability or just getting very stressed out when I had things to do, and I kind of had. Just a mental checker mental breakdown a couple times, one of them was during the holidays, because I can organize my time and then that's when amy diagnosed me because I had spent. Most of my semester my school life organizing every little thing that I had to do, because if I didn't I would freak out right I didn't know what to do, I get very scrambled everything's like in my head and not at the same time. um and then suddenly when I was. Out of school I had more anxiety. And I didn't understand it, because I was like oh."
416.0,Provider,This is my break i'm supposed to be relaxing i'm supposed to.
7411.0,Patient,But now nothing's.
416.0,Provider,Structured it just makes you kind of crazy yeah. yeah.
7411.0,Patient,"We came to that conclusion I was like oh my gosh This makes sense, so once we started on that medication now I have slowly transitioned out of taking my anxiety medication, because I no longer feel that sort of. struggle with my mind, and I think that's one of the biggest things that I have is that I struggle with understanding why my mind, is doing things and i'm just trying to figure out how to not trigger my anxiety because it's very strongly busy all. susie holiday. yeah it's it's very physical and so um. If I start to feel anxious I manifest so strongly inside my body that it just feels like I can't escape and before I came here to bright heart, the only thing that would help was drinking beer. yeah and and I thought that was very unhealthy and so after a couple months or I think there's one month of just drinking every day that I was like I can't do this, like, I have to seek help because, if I don't i'm just gonna this isn't good for my health and. But it was only thing that was working for my anxiety. And then. I kind of was thinking, I think this is creating just moorings I. Because I wasn't."
416.0,Provider,It also makes the medication that you like any anxiety medication that work. Their way less effective when you've been drinking.
7411.0,Patient,mm hmm so once I started coming here to bright heart um that's when I stopped drinking and so yeah. sounds great.
416.0,Provider,Okay okay.
7411.0,Patient,"i'm just gonna say I was just gonna say um since then I had, I felt really relieved, because I was focusing. More on my health and. I don't. Really, I, like everyone, you know likes a cup of wine or whatever, but I don't really like the feeling of being drunk all the time, but um when I had anxiety I just felt like it was no choice, so now that i'm in this healthy state I. Completely avoid it I don't like it i'm even if it's one of those things from my friends are like oh i'm overweight, now I I just moved away, and you know if anybody, but it's like. My husband would be like oh let's relax and have like a beer and i'd be like I don't know that's really relaxing. To me, because."
416.0,Provider,How you relaxing.
7411.0,Patient,"yeah it's kind of just a mindset of. Like a cultural thing that like that's how to get a break, but. i'm more focused on being mentally healthy than anything else, so that's that doesn't concern me anymore. But yeah That was something really. Big I thought in my past because it was one of the things that pushed. me to come here was I didn't want to self medicate at all. Because. I just."
416.0,Provider,"Sorry, just to clarify what you're actually still taking because your list of stuff is hold on, let me pull it up. and So you're still taking me out all right. And then, but you said you're done with Chronicle."
7411.0,Patient,"Now I have a very small amount that I kind of keep in case of emergencies um they I take them own when things start getting very stressful in my life because that's usually, when. A spike means it happens, for example, this past week with school, I had to take it three days, three separate days, because. I had just been so used to online that were in campus so lecture halls or 300 400 people and then having to go to a library that has hundreds of students as well, I just felt really overwhelmed and I remember, we had a group and I didn't have any wi fi."
416.0,Provider,And I think that was one of.
7411.0,Patient,"The worst days that I had in school suffer because it felt like everything is back to back to back it was just like one class another class there be another class and then study and it was happening so it was my very first day of school actually. And yeah so that I remember that day yeah. yeah and then. I just felt so overwhelmed and I think that's the thing it's just I have to get used to this feeling of them having their stimulus for stimuli because. That is just that's what overwhelms me just anything that's very. Intense from, so I am yeah and so yeah I take a smaller amount of it and so."
416.0,Provider,You just had on hand for emergencies and take it okay.
7411.0,Patient,"yeah. And then I go into work. chantelle and I have been working on, because it used to be daily where I I couldn't feel i'm kind of normal unless I took it, and then we kind of started tapering down from it."
416.0,Provider,and use are you still seeing wellbutrin.
7411.0,Patient,And one more try again i'm. gamble methyl. gabapentin yeah and. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah yeah that gives me. That gives me a good idea Okay, so the stuff that is going to impact your anxiety there's a lot of you trying to get a patent for sure to are gonna help so okay all right that's good Now I understand i'm."
7411.0,Patient,"I remember, there was um I was taking I think 150 milligrams of. muscles and we have to lower that those because. it's very strange, but I had a lot of anxiety. during the months of February, March and April. And it was. It was very terrible like that's when there was problems with. Alcohol and so. My anxiety spiked very high and so. and school was very overwhelming, so it was just kind of dealing with. My marriage and then school, at the same time, and then I felt like. Sometimes a Alec wasn't considering. How much I had to do for school and it was just kind of like overwhelming me over and over and over again, and for me, I thought, like this is important so i'm going to take care of my relationship, but then I was suffering and and. For some reason, I had a very weird interaction with the elliptical because I started how being very bad like nerve spasms. From my arms up like my shoulders up and it manifested them ticks and almost. similar to what you would see what some of. tourette's and. ever get to. yeah it's it was really scary I just remember. Like crying at my desk because I would see all the work that had to do in front of me and then my husband like sitting or laying on the bed, and then I would just start. spamming and then I would get on the floor and start kind of shaking and it was one of the scariest points like I had this year we're probably have in my life because I just felt like I was associating a lot so. I would get to this point, where I was associated anxious and then all sudden the heavies takes on top, and so we lower the dose and then they like fixed everything."
416.0,Provider,"Good okay so um so i'm hearing that. Tell me, if this is fresh so in terms of like your biggest struggles still are you know the stress of being in school, the stress of being in person in school, the stress the work itself. And then you know you still have the normal stresses of life, you know being away from trying to do, marriage and stuff like non to right and you've just recently moved so that's and you're going to kind of a new spot there did I get half sure that pretty well. Okay, and so a lot of stress management i'm hearing. And like an nba anxiety that comes with that. And then I heard a lot of mindfulness stuff in there, too, like opportunities for that, but that it's hard to fit in when you okay. gotcha and. OK, and then so definitely I heard pretty strongly that you want to continue using the BT skills and maybe getting some new ones."
7411.0,Patient,"And i'm very open to more. Any kind of skills that would help early I know the. The DVD worked really well, but I am just i'm open to every. Right."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean we'll we'll keep going with it and I read in the notes that you have that DVD workbook indicated to you. yeah perfect Okay, so we might do some work in there and. that's it so. Before we have you ever seen any every two weeks right."
7411.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,And for like how long were you guys meeting.
7411.0,Patient,Since I started seeing her last.
416.0,Provider,Like for what how how long is each session.
7411.0,Patient,"Oh, the sessions we're about an hour, but sometimes we would go over an hour. But not by. Not by too much, but we would talk a lot so sometimes sometimes. When it was a like a very bad time we would go like maybe 10 minutes over."
416.0,Provider,"So we'll we'll try to stick with 45 minutes to an hour most of my sessions are 45 minutes, but I can do 60 minutes with you and me just see how it goes. we'll probably have a lot to talk about and. let's see and then we can schedule twice a month what questions you have, for me, Melissa."
7411.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm i'm basically maybe I was kind of thinking about this, but then kind of also not so much because I know this whole shift and. therapists kind of was very overwhelming at first, for me, and then I kind of just learn to accept it and yeah amy regarded you know very high standard and so. So I was like okay i'm not going to just anybody, and of course we have grouped together so that makes me feel a lot better. So i'm mostly maybe just think of the style that you. approach. Like the suit situations are."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I. I definitely have a pretty strong DDT backgrounds, and so I rely on a lot of skills, maybe not quite as strong as any any of this like really beauty, but I definitely have a lot of patients that I do straight DDT where. I I tend to blend sounds like a little bit more, I think, so I have. kind of an orientation around some. Some what we would call acceptance and commitment therapy and if you've heard of that too, so I definitely have some acceptance in therapy background, I have a lot of them my background is in trauma work. So I. i've definitely done a lot of trouble work but it's I I, I find it best to just sort of customize things and then like a little bit of this a little and like you know make everybody's perfect little soup. But also, if somebody specifically requests a certain type I will absolutely get with it, if i'm qualified to do it. So yeah, I think, maybe we can do. You know, like four cups of DDT and like one cup of other stuff mixed in. yeah start. yeah."
7411.0,Patient,that'll be.
416.0,Provider,"that'll be your starting soup, and then we can change ingredients, as we go."
7411.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that sounds good yeah cuz um yeah like I said i'm just i'm open to anything and I like the idea of customization because I know at the end of the day, i'm i'm speaking with professionals, so I know that i'm taking care of and I can trust you and so um yeah. I have no doubt that will be fine whatever ingredient yeah."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, I can tell that you're very skilled space and you are somebody who. takes the skills and really practices them and resist them, so I mean. Those skills are. That that's my favorite kind of patient to work with right I love during that because they help right you've already experienced the benefits of employing this goes in your life so. You know, will that's what we'll do we'll work on different skills and will problem solve and we'll work on ways to help you manage as best you can. Again, your your goals are my goals really right. So and. Helping you manage through the school experience and kind of re emerge in person, after and. After not after, not being in person for a really long time, which definitely is going to provoke anxiety and then the other piece to it is you are what we would consider neuro divergent right your brain works differently. And because of the ADHD and i'm I definitely have a fair number of nerve divergent patients, I am also and zero divergent in some ways I don't have the exact same diagnosis, as you, but my brain works quite differently as well and. What I know about neuro divergence is that the world is not set up for us."
7411.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"So i'm finding ways to kind of control what we can go back to the circles of control and managing our like finding a pattern or as a strategy in our world to kind of manage it. In a way, that works best with our brains is pretty critical, and that includes that includes food that includes medicine that includes organization strategy is that includes. Even like study strategies like. Sometimes it's better to do short bursts there's different methods that people us who are never divergent to kind of look through some of that stuff so we can talk about all of that too."
7411.0,Patient,"Because that's definitely one of the main things that I was thinking about like coming into therapy again. It was um i've been this last week so it's been just two days a week, in two days and school started and because it sort of the last Wednesday. And i've noticed myself having difficulties again and struggling with the stress of doing a lot of work, and so I kind of dug into a lot of videos about ADHD. And because I really wanted to learn how to manage it and how to cope, and how to feel about it because it was just it's just hard to do it or management on my own. And so, a lot of things that I learned were that there's so much misguided information about this condition and. Just a lot of kind of judgment and. One of the things mostly being that I should be able to do things and."
416.0,Provider,Time to you know. Why can't you just fix it Melissa yeah I mean those those are such fallacies.
7411.0,Patient,"mm hmm exactly, and those are the things that like I think I struggled most just growing up was this constant. Because I think I definitely talk to me about this, because a lot of my anxiety comes from my early childhood and i'm not being kind of my parents weren't aware that anything was really wrong with me on top of this was like kind of level of neglect or level abuse, but. They knew that my brother had ADHD but they never thought to look into me."
416.0,Provider,And so I have the assemblies usually with his more of the hyperactive.
7411.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
416.0,Provider,And then yours is more that you're in the corner staring at the wall. and sees yeah you're you're often spaceland and he's acting out all over the place yeah symbol.
7411.0,Patient,"And then you know definitely me was. She told me that it's just more common in women to be in attendance, instead of high profit, so a lot of. A lot of cases go untreated because. No one is aware, and so it's like suffering in silence and I felt like most of I think it started becoming more apparent in elementary school elementary school and then definitely junior high and high school was just feeling that i'm. That. I mean I forgot what it was. But um yeah this kind of noticing that I wasn't working in the same way that other kids were and I was actually blamed a lot for this, and so. I was constantly going to detention and being sent outside of the classroom because. I was also kind of chatty because I was so just thinking about other things, and I want to want to express that to Maybe someone next to me, and so I would get in trouble, and so it was just this kind of constant like group punishment."
416.0,Provider,"And you've internalized a lot of messages that are unhealthy about yourself when it's not like Oh, this is how her brain works it's oh there's something wrong with you why can't you control your behavior right we start to take those messages in because you didn't know any better. And yeah that can be so a lot of anxiety."
7411.0,Patient,"yeah it's definitely what happened because a lot of times, my report card there was like something's I scored very high, but in the bottom, where there was comments and when my parents were like in the table with my teacher be like very bad behavior. needs to fix behavior like just not a great student very distracted and it was just constantly and it was always going to have trouble and I just felt so defeating so I spent a lot of my time thinking that I. Just was like a learning disability or something I was not very intelligent where there's actually a lot of times when I notice, where I was doing like really well in certain areas school and. And so, after all, that stuff happened like it just became like more like i'm not going to try as hard because why try, if people are punishing and so um, I think, by the time like I tried to take college seriously there was just all this like added like a feeling of hopelessness or. Failure and just kind of just a lot of negative feelings towards myself and my ability to like six like 16 in education and."
416.0,Provider,"So yes, you figured out yet think you're really smart. And that you have ADHD but you're actually really smart have you figured that out yet. uc Davis that's not an easy school to get into. you're studying a scientific major. that's not easy, and you had no support academically growing up that you needed, so you went in. To all of us you're still doing it, despite the fact that you were completely disadvantaged like at a disadvantage starting this program so if that doesn't convince you that you are actually really smart and just have ADHD I don't know what well."
7411.0,Patient,"that's typical. yeah for not something i've been trying to internalize more because a lot of since its ongoing and in my personality, I guess, a lot of the times I and. Maybe I would say, like to humble and so every time anyone would say something like that it just feels so wrong person so it's a slow process but i'm starting to kind of get it more and just accepted people's. Like compliments or even just like stating something like a fact like Oh, you did really well and you really worked hard and i'm like well if it is. And i'll beat myself up for that one time that, like, I was watching TV in that study and so. yeah it's definitely one of those things where I like even I had a study group in my Community college and when I told them that I got into uc Davis, I was like honestly I don't even know how I bought in there, like they probably just refilling some quota. And so."
416.0,Provider,I know I. need to fill the quota for you.
7411.0,Patient,"So it took me a while to like kind of process that i'm like now i'm just being on campus and being with other students it's just like something that. i'm trying to revisit like every time like I started feeling and then, of course, sometimes it does take over, but I know now in my head that all it takes is just confidence in myself, and I can do it and. that's one of the things where like I sometimes forget and it definitely depends on what you said, where it's like if I don't. Like sleep eating like medication if something in that equation, and goes wrong, my confidence goes way down and then, when my confidence goes down my anxiety goes up. And so. I have been trying really hard to focus on that and it's been getting better, and now I go to bed at like 10pm and I eat breakfast lunch and dinner, and I make sure, before I leave to have a protein shake and try to focus on not being an email and. Trying to do more mindful of my health because I noticed that it's. Directly correlated with. Just my mental health and so um yeah and some days like recently this last week i've been a lot more confident and when. I felt like oh I can't talk to someone or i'm like really nervous or am I, even in the right space. That was like kind of the first three days of school and then slowly have been like now like don't think that it's only going to cause the failure like pulling i'm not going to take advantage of the opportunity I have and. I yeah that's something I try to remind myself, because we had orientation and. One of the things, one of the orientation teachers, because we are the smallest kind of seminar thing is that she really trying to drill into us but there's so many resources at the school, so I went to."
416.0,Provider,"I was gonna ask you about that, so your diagnosis of ADHD have you shared that with the school and do you have accommodations for it."
7411.0,Patient,"know what I, I know that I have to get them because. One of my biggest issues was before pre comin I would have panic attacks during tests. And i've always been slower up finishing tests, because I. have so much anxiety that it just kind of blows my mind, and then I work slower and then. That was a problem that was having in Camelot because. There was all these huge math problems, I had to do and math is not my forte, and so I would just. Like I couldn't get through a problem, and then I would just instantly have a panic attack, right after because it felt there was so much pressure in my head and so. It wasn't until the last three months of me and current college that I got accommodation. And then i'm so like oh wow this is nice like they give me time and a half, and even though. I have more time it's almost funny because feeling like I have more time. makes me calmer, and I."
416.0,Provider,And if. You haven't told uc Davis that yet. or you're still working on that.
7411.0,Patient,"yeah I I don't know I just I think one of the reasons is that i'm just trying to acclimate to the schedule, but i'm I haven't gone to the office and I know I could but. I feel like I. Constantly kind of forget my medication when i'm at school and that causes me like after maybe 3pm to kind of just. not have the energy to go to like the office because usually there's a break in between, and so um I talked to Sean tell about done we're doing an accent early federal. So hopefully I just have to take it one time and then not thinking about it but i'm definitely I was thinking about doing that, but I was kind of nervous because I didn't know if the school really took anxiety or ADHD seriously, or if they were going to think that."
416.0,Provider,"First of all, they have to, because under the American. Americans with Disabilities Act. They have to accommodate you so but also, I can absolutely 100% confidence. promise you. that there are a lot of other students who are struggling with the same thing and to need the same accommodations or something similar."
7411.0,Patient,"mm hmm that's true because I joined this club, and I was talking about this in like a little chat or we have an APP and. We started talking about the accommodations and I was like Oh well, i'm thinking about going, and I was asking I think we'll just kind of talking about it and seeing if anyone has accommodations and then one student was like. yeah you told me how it goes, because I I i'm sure that I need them, but they have anxiety and I think they have ADHD but they have like really bad anxiety and they are transfers to and so. They were like oh just present me now because I think I need them, but i'm too nervous to go in and ask, and then there was another student that said that it's possible but their application. Or the process is a little. tedious so it kind of drugs on and so. They definitely do have it, I was thinking of. Going in to their interest to do it because. With every time I try to email people it just takes so much time and it's it gets confusing so i'm definitely gonna go I think i'm going to need something definitely from bright heart and. Like just because they're going to definitely ask like okay like do you see someone or. Are you getting it. Like figured out right now, or treated something and because I know that there's a possibility that students go in and you say Oh, I have this and i'm not."
416.0,Provider,Any students from your doctor so it's just totally fine.
7411.0,Patient,"So yes, I was definitely looking into doing it because I have a feeling that. i'm not gonna take it seriously and then there's a test and i'm going to want to run out the door and I can't do it and.
