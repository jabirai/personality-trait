16980.0,Patient,Lisa.
760.0,Provider,hi Jennifer.
16980.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, are you doing."
760.0,Provider,"Good okay can't see you. There now, I can see. Have you been this last couple weeks."
16980.0,Patient,"Well, not doing really well I talked to Santa she's on vacation so we emailed a few times but. I need to be back on a mood stabilizer."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16980.0,Patient,"And so I just been kind of spiraling down to the dark hole. Okay, and not been motivated I even doing what comes walking working out makes gives me my. makes me feel calm and I haven't even been doing that lately, I just have no drive to do anything."
760.0,Provider,You have no drive to do anything. Okay So what does that.
16980.0,Patient,"I sleep for a couple hours and then, and then a few hours go by, and then I sleep again. Just my clock spin off. yeah we went through a bunch of stuff last time I met with you but. One of the things I forgot to mention to you is that, but a year year and a half ago. I had a home invasion. and I was able to get my mother and my niece out, and I was in there with the. burglar. And to help him hostage until the COP show up. log on the phone with the COPs. So now he's getting out of jail."
760.0,Provider,So this is this is anxiety. Producing so he is that part of this spiral right now.
16980.0,Patient,"I think so because you know I feel like I look over my shoulder. Okay um you know he. He robbed the liquor store and that's how you because he he he came here rob us, and then they put them in jail, he made me on the Internet. robbed liquor store put back and then he took a plea deal and I didn't have to testify in court, but it's just for whatever reason, just didn't the last two weeks it's kind of been in my head."
760.0,Provider,Okay. So okay.
16980.0,Patient,"I did correct because they're actually. that the police actually asked if they could use my. My called them as a train as a training process. Oh, because I was, I was engaged to somebody that isn't SWAT and he was a chief in and."
760.0,Provider,For he had trained you on what to do and situations.
16980.0,Patient,"yeah and I was calm and just chill. You know i've got a. robbery in progress i'm at this address where they are who's in the House, you know all the above, so I was, I would have been ready for something like that, for a long time. Because I broke off the engagement back to 2006 so. It just kind of feel. than being like my mother just screaming and not know what to do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so perhaps you are calm in the moment but it's the anxiety is delayed and you're still kind of. living with it, is that fair."
16980.0,Patient,yeah it went away for quite some time and I think it's just knowing that.
760.0,Provider,The trigger of him getting out. yeah did you didn't know this person he was like. No major that just happened to target your House.
16980.0,Patient,"That he. stole stole his black cadillac parked it backed up in the driveway. And then came around to the back of the House and try to get through a window, but the window right completely. So then he kicked in the French doors. And that's where my mom my nice for and. I was upstairs. yeah and and yeah scream to them, you know house and. You know I had I was still upstairs. I got my gun and I got my phone and. Then I. found wearing what one of the dogs barking near him, so I knew exactly what side of the House, he was on. The way this House is set up like downstairs goes in a circle three different roads."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. And so, this is the same House."
16980.0,Patient,You had another man alright.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Alright, so that's perhaps a trigger for you. So so what's the plan with the medication that."
16980.0,Patient,"I talked to her yesterday chantelle yesterday and screaming for different names of different medications to look it up and in see how I felt about it, I was on abilify, which is a weight gainer. You know I had the brain surgery so after brain surgery, I was on steroids and seizure medications for. A couple years which I don't a lot of weight talks about that and with me walking and exercising again and being off those medications I was just on abilify. which was helping me. A lot, except for the fact that I was gaining weight, always been. Like 10 pounds a month. been on it so, for instance, like. Last time I walked was probably four days ago and I did 10 and a half miles so i'm i'm doing me i'm exercising walking jogging. to drop weight and i'm finding that my weight thought really going down in my niche is getting worse."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's affecting you physically and. yeah yeah Okay, so you are walking in exercising you said, four days ago."
16980.0,Patient,So you'll ask.
760.0,Provider,That was the last time and did did you notice the day that you walked that amount did did you feel better with with your anxiety or.
16980.0,Patient,"Did I do what I do, but then I don't know I just came up I got got home and it wasn't even that I was tired from walking so much i'm like I was like spiders straining myself. I don't know this last year has just kind of put me in this darkness like just. Not wanting to do laundry 11 my 85 year old mother and. She can't come upstairs anymore, because her her to help purpose reasons. So I take care of you know how long the laundry is upstairs so I take care of. A lot of stuff. For the House and clean out the kitchen and things like that. And I just haven't. i'm usually OCD like everything has to be in place and things like that I don't like chaos like. And I just don't feel that way right now okay."
760.0,Provider,And you think once you get your medications stabilized you're hoping that it's going to get back more back. To normal and you're planning to do you're exercising right.
16980.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are some of the other things that work for you as far as managing your your anxiety and depression. Normally, oh they're."
16980.0,Patient,Really. I take my sonics and that calms me down.
760.0,Provider,"OK, so the medication right."
16980.0,Patient,"And then just working out is just that I know of that works for me Okay, and like once everything's in its place and. and taken care of in the House, it gives me a release of. Everything everything's done."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so the act of. being consistent with your chores. yeah and you keeping your environment in a certain way does it stress you out that when you're when you know that the laundry has been accumulating."
16980.0,Patient,"Just like I they had me on hold to check in with you, I was on hold for 20 minutes. And that that right there just triggered my anxiety."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Let me about that."
16980.0,Patient,i'm never late. i'm always early. If i'm not early I get anxiety from it and I noticed like I went from one to 10 and just a couple minutes like nobody's answering the nose answering the call knows you know. Like. don't want to miss this appointment i'm trying to you know.
760.0,Provider,"I believe, if anything, you might have been. It was it was less than three minutes that I saw you pop up for two minutes, so I you're on you're on time, I think I can explain to you that. Sometimes you know we have appointments before and everybody comes to the same room like this is my room, and so I see you, and then I might see the next person after you. And you know the person before you, and so, if it's not a group, we want to make sure that we only have one person at a time. Well, so maybe that might be the reason so once you're in the waiting room if you can kind of talk to yourself and say i'm there he's kind of like being in the waiting room of the of the office."
16980.0,Patient,But I wasn't I wasn't even there yet. I just had zoom Christian typed in the numbers and I was waiting for. Like that the guy that answers to send me somewhere to wait for you.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so okay."
16980.0,Patient,I was attacked it.
760.0,Provider,"All right, which on my end it."
16980.0,Patient,"If so, my name is meeting you know you don't know that i'm trying to get the on time okay. That makes sense to you."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, yes. Like I guess my purpose to I don't know the job of how other people do the checking in, but I do know that i'm I log in right on on time and and wait in the room, and in my perception, you were on time and my perception. Right, which I know that's not your perception, perhaps, but. You have made the attempt, you have logged in and and it just took a minute for the person to. Pass you over to this room or. Okay, so what are some things that you can do when you're starting to spiral like that."
16980.0,Patient,"I actually hung up and redialed or try calling the 800 number that I have. For your. facility in that I left a message there, but no, you know so abi dial the one. number for the virtual meeting. So I did it again."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, it looks like you did all the right things, but when it comes to you to anxiety, what about deep breathing Have you ever just if you ever tried that has that ever worked for you to do deep breathing when you're feeling anxious."
16980.0,Patient,i've done that. I don't feel like it helps. I don't I don't know. I don't know how to meditate the proper way. There isn't like a something that's coming to the net. When I get to that anxiety just put my wheel my in my head starts spinning.
760.0,Provider,"So you're just ruminating it's just going okay. All right, how about mindfulness if you tried that or where. Something simple. You know, because. meditation is a practice. Would you like to try some mindfulness right now. Okay, that be something that that you'd be open to kind of learning about flooring."
16980.0,Patient,i'm open to everything in anything to help me.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, because what happens is when a person spirals they get anxious, maybe, maybe they're. Some part of the brain might be like kind of going back to the past traumatic things that have happened or we're worrying about something in the future, stressing about. You know the chores that you need to do in an hour or tomorrow, or you know or being on time for that appointment so mindfulness is a practice. Just like meditation is a practice and and I don't want you to confuse mindfulness with meditation we can have mindful meditations they can go together, but we can practice mindfulness without meditate. And so, these things are a practice it's not it's kind of like anything that we learn we stumble in the beginning, we don't we don't necessarily get it right, the first time, but as we continue to practice and continue to try. It evolves and we learn, little by little, how to do it, so my my suggestion to you is to just use use it daily."
16980.0,Patient,or.
760.0,Provider,"Is it when you wake up and you're feeling super anxious but use it when you wake up and you don't feel anxious, I think I think just the habits habits can help us or habits and hurt us."
16980.0,Patient,You know.
760.0,Provider,"You know what i'm saying so um, let me just review. we're going to do some mindfulness. I want to read to you a little bit on the sheet and if you, if you like this and if you'd like I can I can email it to you later on, after our session it's just a single sheet. because it gives you four little simple. practices to try of practicing mindfulness so it saying what is mindfulness mindfulness is a state of non judgmental awareness of what's happening in the present moment, including awareness of one's own thoughts feelings and senses. senses meaning, what do I see what do I hear what do I, you know what do I feel as far as touch. What do I smell even taste. So during a state of mindfulness, you will notice your thoughts feelings physical sensations as they're happening The goal is not to clear your mind or to stop thinking it's become aware of thoughts and feelings, rather than getting lost in that."
16980.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"And then the the other component is acceptance, we don't have to like feeling fear or feeling is anxiety, nobody really likes those feelings. But it's a process of of thinking feeling sensations. you're you're going to notice should be observed in a non judgment judgmental way and i'm going to remind you again it's a practice so you know you can say things i've noticed, I noticed that i'm feeling anxious."
16980.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"And, and you can say things to yourself, like you know of all emotions, including anxiety comes, and it goes, this will pass i'm feeling anxious and this rather than. trying to push it to the side, rather than to try to fight against it, to try to protect ourselves, because what I think once we do that we're like kind of in the cycle of building it. And it right mind just keeps ruminating and so if we just kind of you know breathe into it think these kinds of thoughts and work towards being non judgmental about it."
16980.0,Patient,"That makes sense yeah it does. Okay, email that to me."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, definitely going to definitely going to it does help with Depression and anxiety, it helps with memory focus and mental processing it reduces rumination. improves your ability to adapt to stress and your ability to manage emotions so we're going to practice, one of them right now called the five sentences, because this is something that if you're not feeling motivated it it'll take you probably a minute or two minutes if that. Okay, so let's before we start let's can can you rate your anxiety right now on a scale of one to. 10.8 and eight okay. Okay, so we're going to practice five senses and what i'd like to do is i'll will take turns i'll go first just to kind of show you how to do it. And then you'll do it so we're going to making make a conscious effort to notice the present the present moment through our senses. And i'm going to look around my my room here and i'm going to notice five things that I see, and I see jennifer's face and her glasses, I see a mindfulness sheet, I see a chord for my earphones and I see a depth."
16980.0,Patient,OK. I see my dog. My bed. My. lamp. In my TV.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good okay now i'm going I four things that I hear. I hear my my dog barking outside I hear the sound of my own voice, I hear a slight ECHO through the zoom. And I hear a quiet room."
16980.0,Patient,I hear my dog licking his foot. I hear my fam. My air purifier. and your voice.
760.0,Provider,Okay now three things. Three things I feel. I feel I feel my fingers. I feel the cushion of my my office chair. I feel my feet flat on the floor.
16980.0,Patient,Okay um. it's feel my phone. I feel my hand my leg my arm on my knee to hold the phone so okay. And my toes are tingling.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and one thing you taste. which will be I I been drinking water, so I can kind of taste the water. But i've been drinking. Okay okay you go."
16980.0,Patient,And I still taste the coffee I just finished.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and one thing you smell. I smell the the cinnamon air freshener things I bought for the holiday season."
16980.0,Patient,"I smell nothing. Okay, wait your. fear for is working."
760.0,Provider,"So you smell fresh air. Okay okay all right, so now rate your anxiety."
16980.0,Patient,Probably more of a six okay.
760.0,Provider,"So it's not a perfect fix it's just a way to kind of turn down the volume of the variety and this is, this is probably the simplest one. This is the one that I think that would require less motivation, because you don't really have to do anything do it anywhere. anywhere, you want to be. But there are other ones, you can do to there's also one called mindfulness walk and I would encourage you to. I would ask you if you're willing to practice this maybe even a few times a day. First of all, when you get up you could do something to when you wake up. mindfulness walk probably would want to do that more than once, once a day, but while walking you're going to make a point to practice mindfulness you're going to start by noticing how your body moves paying attention to the way your feet your legs or arms swing. The way each step feels and then you expand your awareness, to the surroundings, where you're walking, what are the things you see smell here feel kind of similar to what we just did. But."
16980.0,Patient,pretty much do that with remote lock it.
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so it sounds to me like you're walking is been mindfulness and we didn't even have a name for it. Right that's really good okay good so you have those two okay. Then there's also."
16980.0,Patient,"Go ahead sorry I haven't been remembering things my memory is just. Thought. Like I can't remember things that I did yesterday, or this last week that's why my will tell you the last time I went walking because I remember I just know it was a few days ago. And that's not likely."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, what about keeping a journal on what's going on for you what you're thinking what you're feeling you think that that would help you."
16980.0,Patient,"and I can try and do that I haven't been very good in the past with journals but I know, for instance. let's see tomorrow I go for my neurology appointment for the screw that's this my brain. and find out what next steps are. Because I already did the other MRI. To find out the differences of a family screws move, since January."
760.0,Provider,"To now you. Are you are you feeling anxious, is there any level of your anxiety thats related to what's going on with you physically."
16980.0,Patient,"Yes, because. What I had my first surgery. To get the tumor taken out of my head, I was very carefree of like long I gotta do I gotta do it and that's just the way it is well other people are surrounding me of like why don't You paint weren't you're worried i'm like because it's it is what it is. there's no way. there's why be. upset or anxious about it just it's something that has to be done. Okay, and now i'm looking at. Knowing that what my recovery was like knowing you know. What what it all really entails until you live it you don't really know all the different senses and all the different feelings that you have. And having to go back through that again. Like time is just been back then, was a weeks gone by, I didn't even realize like that many days seven days gone by. Now i'm looking at you know i'm looking at surgery again on my brain. After redo the whole entire surgery because of the screw that's coming here. yeah so tomorrow will be more of Okay, so the screws move X, Y Z and we can let it rest for a little bit. Or you know see if it's continues to move or you know, the one thing that they didn't want is for it to break the skin open."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, you've heard infectious. fun yeah. So you're going to know that if that, if that were to have. Her you're going to know that right."
16980.0,Patient,So yeah.
760.0,Provider,to feel that so. yeah i'll have to go to the. Emergency if that happens.
16980.0,Patient,"yeah i'd have to go to the emergency room and they'd have to do surgery right there which. doesn't, allow me to choose doctor doesn't, allow me to you know."
760.0,Provider,"yeah, which is another."
16980.0,Patient,"The whole credibility yeah. I came out on I came out Okay, you know, and of course you hear the stories we hear the people that have had brain surgery, and they don't flow okay. or they partially paralyzed or they've had seizures and all the above. I think, knowing if I need to have surgery now or that needs to be in six months, or we wait another year and see if it continues to move, or what is that there's anxiety about that."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16980.0,Patient,So some of the questions will be answered tomorrow.
760.0,Provider,"i'd like to i'd like to talk to you a little bit about the difference between there, there is like a subtle difference between anxiety and fear. anxiety is. more of a general feeling it's not a specific it's like a general worry like maybe could be formless. Whereas fearful things could could be some of the things that you're talking about the worries that you just expressed to me, which you know we both know are legitimate things you know. What happens if this. If the screw breaks through the skin, what happens if I can't use my doctor what happens during the surgery all those things you have specific kinds of beers. So processing, I really would encourage you to pick up a journal, and if you know journaling doesn't have to be some long term, you know i'm going to write 10 pages, a day kind of an exercise. yeah just write down this is what i'm thinking, this is what i'm feeling. This is what's worrying me. Maybe some things that you did to kind of ground you a little bit."
16980.0,Patient,yeah I. Prior to my other surgery I did. What is it called. A directive. of my wishes of.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, what did they call it prime directive or."
16980.0,Patient,"Something that sorry I can't remember. You know so that's I have that that still remains the same of. You know if things go a certain way and. You know what to do, or what my wishes would be. So that's."
760.0,Provider,And who's in charge of that.
16980.0,Patient,"it's my cat my cousin because she's a cardiac. nurse. At a hospital. Okay, so."
760.0,Provider,And you trust her. Completely with us.
16980.0,Patient,Okay yeah that's what I did last time and we went through you know pages of. Of. What would. What would be what would my if I couldn't do things on my own to you know.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16980.0,Patient,"Or if there was a feeding of ours, can we start with the feeding tube in and how or what I want to be to color code, you know different things like that."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do you feel the need that you need to review that with her again, or maybe or Have you already done that or."
16980.0,Patient,"I haven't reviewed it, I just have it from the last time. because she would be an object, she would could put her feelings aside and be another personal I mean the professional end of it, of why you know. If we continue down this road, just going to be a vegetable I don't want to live like that I, you know. The reality of. You know if I don't have functions of my body, you know turn the plan off. Things that I couldn't look I can't live with, or why."
760.0,Provider,"Do you think it would help you if you reached out to her and I had another conversation with her just, just in case just to that would be something I mean you could do. That might give you a little bit of peace about it just to just to touch base with her, since you have such trust in her."
16980.0,Patient,yeah I am i've kind of she has i've got the appointment tomorrow and so we're in you know I talked to her often.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
16980.0,Patient,"And I already said, or you know if I need. You know they do surgery again on me, or they come up with some technology, whatever it is. You know she's she understands that as how I would want or go about doing things. Okay 11 he injected to was you know, he did put me on some feeding to for a period of time, I only want 1000 calories and she's like i'm walking that because i've been waiting. For the steroids so put me on a diet in she what's your go under 1800 calories a day like that's not what I want I want less."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16980.0,Patient,I mean I play harder certain things and.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, using humor that's an that's another good way. Okay, all right i'm. pop up having been sleeping."
16980.0,Patient,For the last you know I haven't changed my medication. For sleeping in years and for this last like couple days I fall asleep for a couple hours and then i'm awake for a few more hours and then.
760.0,Provider,That includes nighttime to.
16980.0,Patient,This note that's all including activity during the day I don't sleep.
760.0,Provider,"Oh so you're not sleeping so that means your your mind is ruminating, what do you. Do you lay in bed worrying, what do you do."
16980.0,Patient,"Now it's just. i've just. kind of stick staring at the ceiling just. I don't know why it's been like that, I mean i've been tired site. Because they fall asleep, for you know i'll be watching TV or something and i'll be those you know, often realize of dozing off and go to bed, and then. I sleep for a couple hours and then i'm not many faults and then around for I fall back to sleep for another couple hours and let them."
760.0,Provider,Do you do you. turn the TV off when you know you're calling you so you turn it off at that point when.
16980.0,Patient,That list the time that I usually throw the timer for it to go off.
760.0,Provider,"Oh, so you it turns itself off. yeah okay okay. All right. Perhaps you could try to utilize that exercise that I just gave you."
16980.0,Patient,to live.
760.0,Provider,"By that as you're trying to sleep. and Try to add some deep breathing when you're doing that to maybe. Because when we when we get anxious, or when we get fearful, we have a tendency to breathe like super super shallow."
16980.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"And if the more you can do to combine things. Maybe do some kind of physical activity, even if it's. I don't know just like leg lifts or something. Just to get a little bit of movement it doesn't have to be the walking 10 miles if you're if you're feeling resistant. And I think we had talked about this last time there's a part of you that's worried about doing that much walking because you're all I think you express concern that too much movement could force that screw or move that screws sooner."
16980.0,Patient,yeah I don't really talk about that big boy yeah. You know.
760.0,Provider,So is that something that kind of like goes through your head your you know why maybe.
16980.0,Patient,"yeah it's gone to a, especially when I start to job. it's a respect, I feel the heel of my left foot hitting the ground and in the vibration going up to my head."
760.0,Provider,yeah Have you any of you out and maybe tomorrow you're going to ask the doctor about whether or not you should be jogging a little bit or just walking. or right when he would suggest in your do you tell your doctor that you also have struggle with anxiety.
16980.0,Patient,I don't seem very often but yes okay. yeah we're also doing my botox injections in my head to. For that X and for the nerves that are inside of my head that constantly hurt.
760.0,Provider,Okay um.
16980.0,Patient,"So my head will be nice and tight, but. Can you put a little railway face."
760.0,Provider,"huh. Okay. All right, alright, so you seems like you're dealing with a lot."
16980.0,Patient,"that's where I need I need some. medication stable you. know. yeah I am having to push right all right, I mean, I know that. i'm in touch with how I feel and sense of anxiety mood. Why am I not getting up and getting dressed and going walking in the morning and why am I sleepy tell us. You know I set my alarm for you today because I didn't want to ever sleep because i've got to get it right that I get sleep in the morning."
760.0,Provider,"What about if you want, if you if you're having a hard time walking 10 miles, what if you just even walk even just a few blocks would that be easier."
16980.0,Patient,"it's not even about the distance because I rather do the distance is that, for, in the sense of just. Getting myself tested it out the front out front door. it's not about like Oh, you know, only a few blocks. Okay, I didn't minimum five miles one out the door."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so what is the resistance to getting dressed is it is, it is it the shower Is it the. Just to get out of bed."
16980.0,Patient,"What what start feeling like I wanted to anything I just. For instance, I got up to do laundry the same laundry basket like three times yesterday and I get solid roster and i'm like I don't want to forget it i'll do it later and later has never been a thing for me. do things now while you can, and when you have the time and I know it's like I really noticed it when I got it like three times the same pile of laundry. And i'm like nope just go put you got to do it, I mean nobody else is going to do it for you so. When you walk the walk to the."
760.0,Provider,basket and and you stop yourself and tell yourself I don't want to do this.
16980.0,Patient,"You know it's like your laundry or if I do this i'll do it later and then there'll be staring at me right in front of me, and then I."
760.0,Provider,See you bring the white laundry basket upstairs and maybe or you haven't wherever it is you're. Happy Friday.
16980.0,Patient,yeah it's just a matter of. actual physical just doing it. All day which are not used to.
760.0,Provider,"Can we practice can can we maybe role model, a little bit of how we could use mindfulness. Because London, you know laundry. kind of no it takes a while, because you have to you know you have to move it you got to start it you gotta move it from the washer dryer then pull it out, you gotta fold it and or hang it up all that kind of stuff but how could you know, using mindfulness as a technique. to manage just one simple little task just just to help you get up and take a movement because the longer. You you allow those thoughts to ruminate without taking a different kind of action, the more than anxieties and a bill. throw one way that I could suggest and i'm just going to take the laundry as an example, because you you brought that up a couple of times now. is to say to you i'm going to say i'm going to be aware that there's a part of me that doesn't want to do this laundry right now, but then I can also say to myself, you know what there's there's another part of me that really doesn't want to look at this laundry basket being done. And i'm going to let go of my judgment about that and i'm going to i'm going to do that laundry anyway and i'm going to tell myself i'm picking up the basket i'm walking up the steps and i'm going to be mindful of every step. of you know, the mundane tasks of doing laundry now i'm putting the clothes in the watch now i'm measuring this again i'm getting out the box of soap i'm opening the box of soap i'm measuring the soap that i'm putting i'm pouring the soap. i'm closing the lid step by step, pressing and then go back and sit and try that out, do you think that that might be something you might be able to try to get you to move. Out of that space."
16980.0,Patient,"yeah and that's what I eventually did. Okay yeah and then, when that wash machine has been put in the dryer and then throw the next slide. Okay, it is more in the sense like Okay, I have to fold i'll do this one, first because I have to fall, that the most then later."
760.0,Provider,For that does help. yeah okay and does that does that affect your mood in any kind of way does that make you feel less anxious.
16980.0,Patient,"or angry. After typically after I do laundry and i'm done cleaning and things like that I feel at ease. And, yesterday I just I didn't get that at ease feeling."
760.0,Provider,i'm.
16980.0,Patient,feeling and why I don't know something's not working right laboring.
760.0,Provider,"let's just perhaps Jennifer you got some new things that you're more that you're not that you didn't have a lot that you were were thinking and concerned about last time, but the the new thing of the. The person who attacked broken to your home getting out. The appointment is now tomorrow so. You know that's another thing."
16980.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,I don't have a lot going on. yeah.
16980.0,Patient,"And I need help. Okay i've been through. I know that the medication plays a big part of it. yeah because i'm able to have a different file in my brain and just all mixed in, in one pile."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we can we can say to ourselves to even with medication there's a process to medication, because you know I. Unfortunately doesn't work quite as well as like when I have a headache and I take an aspirin or an aleve or whatever to get rid of my headache that you know, we have the expectation that within 20 minutes, then my."
16980.0,Patient,symptoms right my headache are going to go away.
760.0,Provider,"there's a process to healing and there's a process to getting stabilized on medication and. You know. Maybe keeping a journal of everything you've done all the progress you've made might give you a little bit of relief. Because you you've been asked to research, some of these medications did you start that process."
16980.0,Patient,yeah I stopped sharing when I got off the hotel last night.
760.0,Provider,"And, did you come to any resolution or any thought on what you wanted to talk to her about."
16980.0,Patient,"Next, I wanted to really address it in my own head today."
760.0,Provider,You went to think a little bit further.
16980.0,Patient,"All right. Okay. And okay going she gave me four different ones, to look at so it's a matter of me going through them. And what part teams to what parts Do I need out of out of medication versus what it what it does for for somebody they try to try to find the right match."
760.0,Provider,yeah and sometimes we we can make our best educated guess. But you know we know best after we've taken something and had the chance to have it built up so and then experience the effect or lack of effect. And so again that's. that's a so telling myself there's a process to this process feels better than. feeling anxious and worried that this is going to take too long kind of thoughts.
16980.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,And so that's part of the practice of not being judgmental about it this this is in process i'm working towards this i'm researching researching this i'm thinking about this that makes sense.
16980.0,Patient,"that's why I started yesterday, I want to continue today and she told me to send an email or and i'm still having to play with her on Friday."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right and. A journal, I like it, even if it's. Like a spiral notebook. or some sort that could. Maybe sit next to you in your bed, and you can write down some of these things that you're doing and thinking about. might help you feel like you're making progress."
16980.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And you, you could write the chores you know the cleaning laundry that kind of thing to see think that would help."
16980.0,Patient,"i'm going to open for truck for trying anything. You know, not being close minded about. Any of us yeah. yeah that's why you should take a look at these two medications and okay i'm."
760.0,Provider,"Good. Okay, and you'll meet with her on Friday, and you have a few days to think about it. Okay."
16980.0,Patient,In different state of mind to look at it. When i'm not feeling fulfilled or blue or if i'm feeling i'm. feeling good or feeling anxious. To look at the different. Effects of all of them.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah, I think, making maybe focusing on some baby steps, right now, and you know might be the the area to work towards now since you're having since you're struggling with motivation doing a little bit of something is better than doing nothing at all. it's our as so. i'm."
16980.0,Patient,"Just time has to go by. More you know what the answer now, and and black and white. Okay, I know I have to find that shade of Gray, but."
760.0,Provider,"Well, so so let's talk about that, how could we work, could you how could you use mindfulness based on your understanding right right now to look at that thought that you just expressed that I want the answer right now."
16980.0,Patient,"it's just it's not gonna happen, they can make something happen faster than my part of doing. Doing my part in it."
760.0,Provider,"This is a process. Right, this is a process, I am progressing in the progress the process."
16980.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"I had my appointment. I have my appointment it's all it's scheduled. Today is Wednesday. December eight. And, and yes, and maybe writing around somebody that writing down some of the points that as your as you're reviewing those for medications the things that you were thinking about. And you know have that there because that might help you when you have that appointment on Friday to kind of help you remember, because you express it sometimes you forget things. yeah so writing writing it down will give you something to do. give you an action and that's something that you can control. yeah okay."
16980.0,Patient,"i've i've started. One of those sheets so what's now what needs to be done and the action okay many different categories of. Different surgeries I need. feeling empty and anxiety and. I started, you know I started that process."
760.0,Provider,hope.
16980.0,Patient,"and You know, seeing it on paper, it just makes my. What else needs to be on paper, what else is going to that hamster wheel. And just seen it we realized okay what this means to be able to take care of this or i've already taken care of that we're just checking them off what i've done."
760.0,Provider,"What about if you were to take that same principle and apply it to some of the smaller things so that you could have a little bit more satisfaction with the areas that you can control which, like say the chores or the some small amount of physical activity. Getting dressed. I know cooking dishes what have you. With that helps. You try that."
16980.0,Patient,Putting those things on paper. No never done that. Because. I think of clean House a whole House will be clean. it's a good size house to be plenty of room to clean per day and it's 5000 square feet almost 5000 square feet.
760.0,Provider,wow that's a big house 5000 square feet.
16980.0,Patient,And to 48 4800 and something.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16980.0,Patient,"original where I grew up was boy races in calabasas his house my parents built that's was 9000 square feet, so they downsized moving here we downsized to move into this House and they've been in this House for years, my dad passed away six years ago, but my mom. She doesn't see this as a big house. So trying to get her to downsize for the last six years just isn't happening."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well then, you know you don't. I don't mean for you to write down every single room I didn't envision you were living in an enormous house. But maybe just the simpler things that I know."
16980.0,Patient,"Like there's always around like. You know that. That needs the attention that you know. In the laundry is only upstairs and so whatever's dancers, needs to be carried up. it's a good thing that we do have there is that bedroom and bathroom connection, my mom lives in versus the master."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I would think with that much square footage there would. Be downstairs bedroom."
16980.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. You know I grew up I grew up it I I was privileged. You know, we had the live in made and when they sold the bigger House you know the House in calabasas. Do one of the reasons why they bought they bought, this House is that it still had. Live live in quarters for the the made that we had. They weren't. They weren't out for having somebody just come in, they still wanted, you know. A full time person. living and cleaning. And now it's just now i'm the one that does the cleaning the laundry and my mom has moved into the downstairs bedroom."
760.0,Provider,I think. Okay.
16980.0,Patient,So there's a whole lot to all my different issues.
760.0,Provider,"I guess keep it more simple, not so overwhelming, but the basic things that needs to be done, and maybe maybe some of the rooms in this big House you could just close the door and not worry about."
16980.0,Patient,"done. i've tried to do that. doesn't work for you, it looks I know it's it's just a dorian between me and the space that needs to be clean. or warm. Miss about my mom is not very good with organizing or doing any doubt because she. lived a certain way with my dad. For all those years."
760.0,Provider,"She was used to somebody else just cleaning it after her. yeah and so it's not like programmed in there. Right okay. All right, Jennifer that's a lot i'm gonna. I am going to send her this mindfulness things. Maybe just keep a log of what you're doing you know basics, with the clock, you have to do dishes and laundry. lists. and Practice mindfulness as you're doing it. and trust that there's a process. yeah i'm in process and that's that's like the verbiage that I would kind of use in my head, this is in process i'm working on this."
16980.0,Patient,"You know, and the other thing I have is we have three dogs here, but I have. One of them's mine. From i've had from when I lived lived in my own House. And you know how smack me no one wants to go go outside or he wants food or something like that. So he's always got me. Getting up and moving around and sentence."
760.0,Provider,is good.
16980.0,Patient,I take care of him and he he lets me know what you want to go outside or he lets me know that he's hungry.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16980.0,Patient,"So, for instance, this morning he wanted me up at eight I didn't want to get paid. For it."
760.0,Provider,Oh.
16980.0,Patient,"Oh, like four times go back to bed, and finally, he went back to bed."
760.0,Provider,Oh.
16980.0,Patient,So there you know I have more than just my mother why I have to get out of a better way you know not. Helping my mom but.
760.0,Provider,"yeah and and a dog is gives a lot of pleasure, you know."
16980.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Being with a dog and they don't really demand a whole lot because more. yeah my affection for. A bowl of food and give me some water and. oops I gotta go outside.
16980.0,Patient,bossy. pizza is the dominant one.
760.0,Provider,Oh okay.
16980.0,Patient,He has to be at the door first yester. For help are held by the other dog.
760.0,Provider,Oh yeah I think we talked about that last time you know.
16980.0,Patient,going to get through the days and get the answer so.
760.0,Provider,"it's it's coming. you're keeping your appointments. And so, add some of these you can try the meditation there is a meditation one on this sheet. If you see the green squares at the bottom are different ways of practicing mindfulness. don't feel you have to do all of them. The easiest ones are the you know the five senses the mindful walk and then maybe the body scan might help you as well."
16980.0,Patient,Okay yep.
760.0,Provider,"and start practicing that between now and then and I hope you get some news good news tomorrow on your medical appointments and and also with your appointment, on Friday, you get some good. yeah keep moving steps closer to the resolution of that call. yeah okay."
16980.0,Patient,What sort of trying to do.
760.0,Provider,"yeah now what you are doing. it's just you know I you know if I was practicing mindfulness I would say, you know I wish this was faster. But i'm doing it."
16980.0,Patient,i'm not that patient and that's what.
760.0,Provider,I feel invasion.
16980.0,Patient,I want in it i'm I want let's do it let's take care of it now.
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16980.0,Patient,not pushed off to another day.
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16980.0,Patient,"So that's why I came to doing some laundry yesterday was like I can get it up, because I knew I had to do it, it wasn't. i'm just using the laundry as an example of things to do."
760.0,Provider,yeah I know.
16980.0,Patient,"You know, just like he's he keeps coming my dog keeps turning he wants his dinner that's only four o'clock he has to wait tell me, yes, wait make us lays down."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16980.0,Patient,it's too early i'm just trying to keep myself. headed the right direction.
760.0,Provider,"yeah. Well you're in process. yeah just keep repeating that and if you feel impatient I get if i'm being mindful I i'm excited. I don't like it. That, I have to wait. I feel i'm feeling like I want it now. But I oh this isn't in process so we're acknowledging, we have to acknowledge our feelings, because we can't force a feeling to be something different than what it is, so we can acknowledge it and then also hold it another thought that Oh, but this is in process."
16980.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"Because there's things we can control, we can control to get up and do the laundry we can get it, and we can control getting up and taking a walk we can control getting up and taking care of the dogs, but we can't control. You know. Making the appointment or. come sooner or anything. So, focusing on that, and you don't have to like it Jennifer you don't. You know, but, but just it's changing just little a little bit of settlements, the way you talk to yourself kind of like here that thought I want it now. Yes, but it's in process today today's Wednesday. And I walked right away."
16980.0,Patient,"Right yeah. that's it. it's very brain I want it now. Yes, somewhere struggle with phone. My life."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, so again that's mindfulness is a is a practice, and you know we can choose to think something or not saying something or a corrected later if you thought habit is something that we're used to thinking we can then kind of remind ourselves that i'm working on. that's the next thought, not to beat yourself up that i'm impatient but. i'm feeling impatient and it's impulse. So for can be true okay. Okay. All right, so you have your appointments. set on schedule."
16980.0,Patient,I don't have another one in December with you.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and about two weeks. yeah so start this process i'm going to send you the sheet. soon as we get off. i'll go ahead and email it to. Jen. At Yahoo. Yes, right okay i'll send it there to you and. take some of the simpler ones and add it to your practice and use it when you notice that your anxiety it's a six or higher, but is it but use it just as a habit, even if it's just a simple one to five cents."
16980.0,Patient,All right focus so much.
760.0,Provider,"All right, well, I really wish you well tomorrow okay. Okay Friday."
16980.0,Patient,"Okay, all right, thank."
760.0,Provider,You we'll see in a couple weeks. Okay okay. bye bye bye.
