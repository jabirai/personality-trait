I wasn't cramping or anything but they wanted me to basically staying in bed like modified bedrest like I could do some stuff but some not so my house got tore upside down and. skylar would have to work all day and then come home and. Try to clean and it was bad, but I went to the doctor. Tuesday Or was it Wednesday I can't remember those earlier this week and. They check the baby's heartbeat and gave me another project or exam and they said i'm fine so and I haven't spotted and Mike I think today's like the ninth day."

207.0,Provider,um you how are you feeling now like over all the knowledge.
430.0,Patient,"um i'm still um it's not near as bad as it was, but like my with this pregnancy my energy is. So drained like I have to talk myself into shower and and that's like I literally think that's better than sex I. Love my showers and I. have to force myself to do it. And I made that means clean and that means like he's at work for 12 hours a day, so i'll just. Like say okay i'm going to do it in 10 minutes all even set alarms even with cleaning it's just I have no energy they gave me um. I don't know how to pronounce it but it's fancy for iron."
207.0,Provider,Like.
430.0,Patient,"A high dose and it's not helping but they when I when they took my blood, they said, I was very, very anemic."
207.0,Provider,um so you have to eat things that are high in iron.
430.0,Patient,"They didn't they didn't say that they just gave me that but um people has been telling me like bananas his sister told me like to put cucumbers and water and drink eight which I haven't. done it yet, but."
207.0,Provider,"You need it, you need a pair of fake and beef."
430.0,Patient,steak okay um.
207.0,Provider,"yeah I have a friend who. Her husband is a vegan make you better not eat no meat and don't do this, she said. She was she was in low in iron and she like what you don't know offer them and yeah. I think it was. taken before and whatever else, she was. To help to do it, so you know, there are things that you. can eat to help. outside of taking the pill I think it's Just to give you a bigger booster lately, there are things that should be eating a lot of green leafy vegetables like spinach and all those like been cleaned the greener, it is the better."
430.0,Patient,"yeah I say I like the weight I wish we had we haven't bought spent a long time, just because she don't like it, but like I love Brussels sprouts like when I cook stuff like that I have to make separate for her which. We have to force her to eat meat and stuff if she could just live off macaroni and cheese like that's what she would do but. I love all that stuff so I need to get it, because yeah my pre nato's have iron and um and then they gave me separate arm and it's not."
207.0,Provider,"it's an audiophile if you're if it's not helping them. Like not at all, because I um I think. In one of my pregnancy that happened the doctor said he had he had told me to do, naturally, and then. I don't think I did it naturally until he said, you have a choice if either you do I tell you to do, or when you go into have a baby and a half, I think he said, you know, give me blood or something like that you think you need it move."
430.0,Patient,"It came from yeah I was anemic for her, but I didn't know, I was anemic they just said, I was so like I did take I am but I didn't feel feel like I was so. I didn't Oh, I did was take my pre nato's and go on about my business, but like I they they had to give me they thought they were gonna have to give me blood, because I lost so much. But they gave they gave me this pill that makes you make blood quicker or something so I. Did today in the hospital like four days after because, like I I passed out and everything and it wasn't from having her as she she hadn't been born 20 minutes and everything and then all of a sudden. I thought I picked myself and they're like blood spouse like over the bed onto the floor like it was that bad, of course, one of the nurses rolled her eyes, because she knew. Like I did on purpose like yeah but I did on purpose now you have to clean it up late no I didn't mean to do that I had no idea that that was going to happen, but. yeah it was bad so."
207.0,Provider,"yeah are you want you to do is just like even in the morning. To make a shake. smoothie or like a shape and if you have a little blender couple of bullet bullet or something. just throw all that stuff in there, like in the the spin age or anything that banana or whatever it's high and drink it maybe that's something that you, in addition to whatever your. iron pills that you drinking until they get to the point where they said all right, you need to either pasta, the pills, or whatever, but just like difference movie he didn't."
430.0,Patient,"Tell me yeah yeah right. I guess right now there anything i'm doing is like a eat a banana in the morning and then. At night like in the mobile night when I get up from here, I would eat one and he buys like. We used to only buy one because they would go bad we at least or two away, but like he bought two bundles as time and none went bad. Because i've been tearing them up, she eats like one a day, sometimes, but I eat two a day, but I don't know it's it's rough I can't wait till it's over."
207.0,Provider,Did you ever talk to the doctor about the.
430.0,Patient,"Yes. He. didn't approve of it um. But, like, I still find the baby's fine he just looked at me weird maybe he's just been a doctor so long and he's never saw some on suboxone I mean those are his words he's never saw are pregnant mom on suboxone. And he's a he's just like I don't know about that, but I told him like joey has I guess and it's been fine, but he never really said don't but he just looked at me like what like no that's not how that works, he gave me that look so. And that that was on that was when I just last went went to him, but they were they were short staffed like we end up being there two hours and that's not like normal like from the time we go in there sign in to leave. is usually like 20 minutes like they took my blood my pee all that my blood and P was done within five minutes, and no one can ever get my vein, so there really quick with it, so we were into being there two hours I don't know. I don't know if he would have had time he would talk to me more in depth, but his face at it all scholar was like scholar doesn't want me he went to my own sub he takes to because that's what I took with her, but I just don't know what do."
207.0,Provider,You What do you do say Julie said.
430.0,Patient,She said that it was fine.
207.0,Provider,She said.
430.0,Patient,"No, no, they it well, I I haven't talked to her, since I talked to him, but when I first told her, I was pregnant, she said that it didn't matter that I could go to that or stay Ram it didn't matter that it wouldn't affect like the baby. I don't know but. I don't know, but the the I think the problem that he's having is they haven't done studies for the now locks lawn. they've done. they've been they've done studies, with the other with pregnant women, but they haven't done it with that so but I was like okay say I bring. say I overdose right now and i'm pregnant. I shoot up with heroin overdose what are you willing to give me and they and. The doctor said they're going to give the now locks on so that's going to get in the baby stream, then, if I have the baby and I the baby gets a hold of some hair away in orthodoxy caught and what would you give it will give it that so that's that don't make sense to me why. I don't know if if I had a different pharmacy i'd be okay with going to serve you text, but I don't and last time I was on their subtext. I don't know what's wrong with them, but to like. they're not I don't feel like they're fully. I don't explain it they're not they don't last as long like I had the pharmacy in one town, and I was getting w tax and all of a sudden, they said telemedicine is illegal we're not fucking with it like. we're not doing that you have to switch somewhere else, so I switched to the pharmacy i've been with now for like. Two three years and I went from their sub you tax, which is like a little tiny white pill to theirs, which is an oval orange when and I was struggling. Like I was struggling I was waking up with with withdrawals and then that's what I but, at the time I was just breastfeeding like I wasn't pregnant or anything but Dr Malik wanting to keep me on that, while I was breastfeeding so. I asked him I was like if, like i'm getting re watching her off, can I go back because I can't do this like it's, this is not. This is not working i've never ever woke up with sweats and just achy body like that's not normal and that's the pharmacy at that so that's why I don't want to switch. And she was talking about up and because, when you're pregnant you metabolize quicker but, honestly i'm not having any trouble with that at all. Like the dough someone is fine, I it hasn't affected me at all, so I know if I switch to that and i'm at the pharmacy i'm at now which I mean that was two or three years ago they could have different, but I want to take the chance. There there's w Texas horrible whatever it is, I don't know what brand it is i'd never seen it before but it's it's not it's not good. So I don't know. I guess sort of see what. She says, because I feel fine and the baby's fine as of right now so."
207.0,Provider,she's gonna be.
430.0,Patient,"The 22nd I know it's it's a. Yes, they're they're doing a they wanted to do the."
207.0,Provider,Work they could have done.
430.0,Patient,"yeah the blood test, but I don't want that, because. I if the baby is retarded or something."
207.0,Provider,"No, I said what that tells me what detected."
430.0,Patient,"Yes, there is, but they also he said that they they they combine that. And I was like okay so they'll test for all that, and he was like we don't have to tell you, and I was like yeah I just don't want to know, unless there's something. Okay, if it tells me my baby's retarded or it tells me something's wrong. Is there something we can do right then and there to help the baby and he was like there would be nothing, and I was like that I don't want to know, I want to set my whole nine months like devastated and stress knowing. My babies retarded so I just rather not know, and he said we don't have to tell you, but I was just like no and I hate needles in chat so it wasn't necessary I thought so in two weeks on the 22nd they're going to do ultrasound to find out the sex. So. yeah. Just can't wait to it's over this is war me the hell out, and I think i'm gonna go ahead and do my. tubes, even though I know it's going to be painful."
207.0,Provider,i'm not the only point.
430.0,Patient,"where everyone told me, it was painful and they give you paying bills and I can't have a bill so that's why I. said."
207.0,Provider,"Last time, listen you're hearing it from courses out there is not one pain that is associated with it, you come out of the hospital with a band. legit banded."
430.0,Patient,So why do some people get pain pills them.
207.0,Provider,"Listen, you have you what you need to ask them is gives me the full million receipt tell me exactly why you were in pain. Maybe you maybe you may feel. Like you did."
430.0,Patient,not worse than given birth and then he.
207.0,Provider,"Maybe he felt like he did sit up. is about it. I think. That I need to take things those know what I mean. You need to be in pain that they failed. yeah it. Does not hurt at all, there is not one pain associated."
430.0,Patient,"Well, first of all."
207.0,Provider,"I think about the only thing that I remember, they knew. They had a hard time wiki meal. And the only reason why they have a hard time waking up."
430.0,Patient,Because they put you under why they do it.
207.0,Provider,"You know, keep me awake."
430.0,Patient,"Why not, they could take the baby out and then just go in there and do it, they can't do that, oh no that's if that's if you have a safari and now, if you have a Syrian and the doctor did it. um i've had all my natural. Okay, so if you had a safari and I."
207.0,Provider,"think that those are already in there they'll do it, while you're already in there, but my particular doctor said come back and I had to come back after X amount of time. So that's my particular."
430.0,Patient,"doctor yeah they they offered to do it. Not like I don't know if it was right, then, and there or not, but asked me if I wanted it done and. Then."
207.0,Provider,"deny them to stay, so this is, I think you have to take into consideration factor in this for me, this was six years ago, and so you know and that's my doctor now, it sounds like what you live, for the most part, in a small town, so how they do. Things so and those doctors found."
430.0,Patient,A little stone age's while i'm driving. I drive an hour away to a big.
207.0,Provider,"dirt either way. Either way, some remember everything is all about the person, but the treating provider so. Right everybody has their own feeling and how they feel about certain things so some people that my doctor I felt was a little old school he legitimately was a little old school and that's what I liked about you. get older Jewish guy and he was a little old school was how he did things. yeah um. So, and he would tell you, he will give you like the science and the business and he had been at that time and practice little over 40 years. And so that's kind of the same teacher so for him, I think it was if it was a Syrian then they do it right, then, and there, but given that it was not Keith he had me come backwards other people, I heard their doctrine fit it a little differently. And and and some doctors do the two timing, or the day some removed the actual."
430.0,Patient,So did they cut their stomach or do they scope inside your.
207.0,Provider,Know it's.
430.0,Patient,A giant.
207.0,Provider,Through your belly button. it's like.
430.0,Patient,"Oh, my God."
207.0,Provider,that's why your car with with you walk out with a band aid it's like well they how he did it with laparoscopic be they're looking at a camera and they do an incision a small incision to your your belly button.
430.0,Patient,So it's just sore a little bit.
207.0,Provider,"I don't remember being two artists remember I couldn't I couldn't lift up my baby. Oh, I couldn't mess up my baby I couldn't they said, you could I couldn't listen to this up, I couldn't pick up anything over a certain time. And that, and that was maybe for the day. That was little I just remember coming home and I slept the day away."
430.0,Patient,Okay.
207.0,Provider,And that's that's about it but and they just said that they had a hard time waking me up and said she thinks it's because I will complete the product.
430.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So, and I did a 10 week class of equity was i've been attending so much faster. But again, he was old school, whereas i've heard other people, they say something differently so, so I think when you're taking in information I would definitely say. You have to ask them to circumstance and and see if what they're telling you applies to your situation I. present my doctor, he was very old school, he was really too old, for he wasn't, even though he was yes with traditional medicine, but certain things he didn't necessarily delete and so like you see how your iron is low and they automatically give you a pill. yeah just like do. ABC and d like he was. Everything natural and. It wasn't going on, then he said, take this pill. That then."
430.0,Patient,that's how I wish I wish more doctors would like that were like that I wouldn't probably I mean it's. i'm to blame 100% but if most of the doctors I dealt with. would have just been like try physical therapy or this.
207.0,Provider,"I probably wouldn't before yeah. yeah he was like that he was like trying, all of this. First, before we take this so."
430.0,Patient,I hated him back in the day.
207.0,Provider,"yeah he was like so like even. In so he said he would say, and this is how old school, he was he was like your body is naturally designed for you to have natural birth, for it to come through the birth Canal. So he doesn't jump to just be like screw it let's cut it open and just be done with it like from a long way, he is like do all of this stuff and when all else fails, then we'll do this that's how he was. So you know if you have like friends or whoever that's telling you, you have to ask them like what were your real circumstances surrounding in comparison to just cheering whether the trauma or the this and then automatically think that will be your."
430.0,Patient,"Situation wasn't. will say that's how I that's why I didn't with her, but that's why this time i'm just like. i'm doing it, no matter what I didn't care how much it hurt us because, like they gave me that. I did the birth control that's up inside of you, and it gave me like I get pimples everyone does here and there, but it gave me cystic acne where I couldn't touch my face it hurts so bad. swing skylar breezed I literally wanted to rip off his face. It like it fucked me up, we were driving he was driving one time we had my baby she was four months old we had her in the car. And he wanted he either he wanted my window up and I wanted it down or vice versa, I don't know, but he ended up putting it the way he wanted, and he was going like 65 mile an hour and I put the bitch and. I put it in park. and Through us all and. The I don't do dumb shit like that and I immediately called like that day and had it taken out my face cleared up. And I was normal, so I was like."
207.0,Provider,Taking the.
430.0,Patient,iud um yeah.
207.0,Provider,Yes.
430.0,Patient,"yeah but but it wasn't it I got the generic version, of course, because I medicate it wasn't actually called that it was called something else, but it looks the same yeah it's fun me."
207.0,Provider,"I think it's not the devil shot, it was I forgot what they call it."
430.0,Patient,"I used to get that but I just I can't do needles a it flips a the Fuck out I like I you have i'll get it if I absolutely have to, but so, then I was on the pill. And then I started like my mom went through menopause early my grandma went through it when she was like 34 started it so. my sister she's four years older than me she has already started it, so I was having symptoms and my family doctor told me that I was starting it so two and a half years ago I quit taking the birth control, because I stayed consistent with it, I just that was just like I take. I take a sleep aid so every night like I just took it at that time so i'd never forget the whole all the like until she was almost three. yeah like two and a half, and then I have been on it sense, because my doctor like did test and off my symptoms and stuff because I was don't have it hot flashes said that I was. Like pre menopausal I was starting it and now, obviously I want that or can you get pregnant and pretty minimal pose I wonder."
207.0,Provider,i'm sure.
430.0,Patient,"wow. Well, her bag, yes, she owned our ass from a hole in the ground and she said it was Okay, if I quit taking them and I I got them like online where you don't have to you just have to. write down. here."
207.0,Provider,Did you think you were free medical.
430.0,Patient,yeah like I was explaining the symptoms to my mom and she was like oh yeah like you're starting them and I went to the doctor and i'm i'm 40 now I just turned 40 September 1.
207.0,Provider,That happy belated um but who did the doctor say that.
430.0,Patient,"She she thought yeah that she thought I was starting it. So to a half years ago, I had quit my menopause have not got pregnant once and like skyler thought he couldn't have kids um I got pregnant three months within even knowing him and I had a miscarriage on that one, but then 12 days later. I got pregnant with her so. I thought, not to say that you can't but I mean granted Yes, you are pregnant, now so then that blows whatever monsters out the window."
207.0,Provider,yeah it does you remember your pre menopausal it doesn't mean that the hormone and everything is no longer in existence.
430.0,Patient,"Say no one told me that. No one told me that and, like, I thought I thought, if I could get pregnant i'd be pregnant when then first few months and it's been two and a half years. But I also didn't know that you only have a window to get pregnant I just thought. that's item, well, I was 39 when I found out, but I did I thought you could get pregnant anytime you had sex and that's not true there's a little window so obviously we weren't. Around that window no not at all, no one ever told me that even even my baby doctors, I had no idea about any of that."
207.0,Provider,there's a. 24 hour window.
430.0,Patient,"All there's only 24 wow say yeah. I like I I I googled it and it said, like. That window that's open like, if I had sex like two days before and the sperm was still there, then it could still make it up in a."
207.0,Provider,"mirror it's there, for I think three to five days."
430.0,Patient,Well yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And I think it was it was I read it back Okay, so I think it was all the different forms of contraception is what I was reading to understand all the different forms. And as they broke down each form that's how they that's how you get educated on it, so the reason why it's a 24 hour window and it's a 24 hour window, and I think in when you are most fertile in the month. When you're going through. When, what is it called the just my mind."
430.0,Patient,i'll do.
207.0,Provider,"Relating yeah when you're ovulating. there's a period in time when there's a 24 hour so so like when people who were trying to get pregnant and they sit there and they do all this monitoring. it's because they are trying so that and then they'll say okay it's time for us to go, and the reason why they said it's time for us to go, because then you Lisa it's millions of it that goes up."
430.0,Patient,And that's what tracker is then that's what yeah yeah it's tracking.
207.0,Provider,"When your firm and when. When when. So when a person says okay it's time to go, so when you go after the process there's so much that comes out but there's a whole lot more that goes and stays there. And so every day. Some of it dies so as it but there's still a lot that there. In that period so that's why, if it was today is your encounter it doesn't mean that it's today you got pregnant, you could have gotten you to get pregnant, maybe on Saturday, because all of that is still up there."
430.0,Patient,"But this. This pregnancy been so weird because, like I. i'm a month ahead than what I thought I was well that's what the baby is measuring and I had a period in May, I had a normal period in May and I got pregnant in May, but."
207.0,Provider,Oh.
430.0,Patient,By my like I miss my period and. I had appeared in May sorry and June I had appeared in June so. It looks like I should only be for months and that's when I went to a doctor about what I told them like I had my period in May or June.
207.0,Provider,Normal whenever you go to the doctor and you know they look at the little chart their little heart. When they tell when you say when they ask you when was the last day of here period.
430.0,Patient,Yes. And I see and mine was June seven.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think it was I think it's it's typically I think technically it somewhere after your period is probably when it happened, I want to say it's either before or after the actual period because the."
430.0,Patient,period.
207.0,Provider,"When that one that one the fertilizer so that's what creates the period because the egg that did not get fertilized is what breaks down and makes you get the period. But I think it's somewhere after that, so there is this arm, so there is this tracker you think there's an APP that you can get on your phone. Yes, I hope that Okay, so if you actually pay attention to that X there's that APP tells you your fertile days and it tells you. right around when you can get pregnant. And I would personally say that act is pretty accurate, so it tells you because it will tell you the day. It tells you like leading. Up to your menstrual and it will tell you this is your fertile time or is it says you start articulating here."
430.0,Patient,"Well, that that the APP I have don't say that it just says like like if you're trying to calculate like when your babies do, and all that."
207.0,Provider,"stuff and no no i'm talking about a period tracker. period it's called it's technically it's called straight a period tracker and it says this is when. So June 7 is when you have your menses, and so it tells you okay so it's both the last week because it tracks it every month, and it says okay typically it last like three days, four days, whatever amount of days. And it says projected date of your next menstrual, but when you look on the actual calendar, the calendar says this is when you're articulating. And then, based on when you're articulating it tells you during that observation period when you're fertile so if you're trying to get pregnant, it will say this is when you're fertile and so, if it is that you your activity within that time. period in that time is when you have you had gotten pregnant. So in that same APP. If you did get pregnant, I think. He waited."
430.0,Patient,"Change he saying I got. he's saying I got pregnant and may, though, and I had a parent in June. Like I had to know."
207.0,Provider,"Some people Some people even know it's very rare, but some people, even while there, while they're pregnant like actively you're pregnant I got a mailing there's some people who still have a period. Where there's some people who still have a fear of every month what causes I don't know, but some people still have a period."
430.0,Patient,And it does affect the baby or anything.
207.0,Provider,I have a friend who said her mom so had a period right for it right off a whole pregnancy period.
430.0,Patient,"that's like after the ultrasound and because I thought I went in there, like i'm nine weeks pregnant and he was like. After they did the ultrasound which the ultrasound lady didn't say anything, who went there, and he was like oh honey, he said you're not nine weeks, he was like you're measuring 13 I was like what."
207.0,Provider,"Because they measured the baby. So you're when you tell them so and that's how they come up with the actual due date so you know when you first go and they said that your do let's say December 1. that's the original deep, do you know the due date is December first based on your last period, but your due date is always fluctuating."
430.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like the APP from June 7 the APP said i'm my baby's due march 25 so, then I go in there to him and he said, oh no now it's changed to February. yeah February 25."
207.0,Provider,"We go with the development of the baby, based on the the ultrasound that they do, but then sometimes once they start measuring that line in your stomach so you're The date is constantly changing that date is constantly changing, and so, in the end. That maybe. They made their grand entrance when they feel like you can."
430.0,Patient,"yeah well i've had dates changed by like a few days, but a whole damn month and I had a period that's just like what I couldn't couldn't believe, but I mean it does make sense of why I. felt like shit and like skyler thought it was the medicine cuz I didn't know, I was pregnant I just be sitting there just woke up and like. Like look like, I was not now, but I was just tired and he was like he was like because my pharmacy like change the brand of it like they're yellow packages now and. he's we're weird make about that stuff he he likes to know what he's putting his body and stuff and he was like it's probably that like. you've never done that, before he was like are you overtaken i'm like no I take exactly what I always have for the whole time i've been here I don't take anything different, but here I was pregnant had nothing to do with that. or or anything i'm just so."
207.0,Provider,"Tired but in Part of the reason why they give you so you have to again your due date so you said right now, your due date is march what."
430.0,Patient,It it's February 25 now. It was my 25th.
207.0,Provider,"So your new date is February 25. i'm they give you two weeks after and they give you two weeks before because it's a window that may give you they give you that window, because the truth of the matter is no one who knows when. And this is, this is what a doctor my doctor told me he says to tell you, when you the day you actually got pregnant there's no way for them to tell their only speculating when you. it's only a destination they're making, and so, once they measure the base so my children has they were always born after a week or two after dinner today."
430.0,Patient,Did you have the same doctor for all of them.
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah I told him when I told him after the third if you plan on retiring on time. I thought they give you two weeks before, and then they give you two weeks after and sometime within that window is when they said that you know the child, so I just wanted to tell you what my doctor what."
430.0,Patient,"I was induced with. Like my my son and carry had the same doctor, even though they were like almost 17 years apart, they had the same doctor and I found. This doctor actually I didn't I didn't know if he gave I mean my friend said he gave good pair but I was just nervous I wanted someone that was comfortable or would be okay, with the medicine or or not, even if they were okay just didn't. Was not disgusted about it so like I did some research and found out like. My friend cassie had both are boys to them and so that's why I went there and i'm. Like a dumb So my first appointment I didn't when she asked me what medicine, I was on. She asked me like in the hallway and there was, like other people and I didn't tower. Because I, like my heart started beating fast every time I have to tell someone that like I literally I physically sometimes get sick card stop and. So then, when I got home, I called and I was like i'm sorry I should have said something I just it's hard it's hard for me to tell people that and she was like oh honey, we already we already knew it's in your chart and she said. You need that medicine, she said we don't judge here, and she said don't ever be afraid to say anything but we already knew, so I don't know how the hell do they already know, is what I want to know, but I didn't ask her that."
207.0,Provider,"Our bodies are different, and so you have to take that in. consideration and. And you know why is it that. You know, some people still have a minstrel after they're pregnant, you know why is it that some people, you know I i've always exactly 30 days after i've always found out that I was pregnant."
430.0,Patient,"With megan i'm. She escapees that's what they said. today's been two weeks since she's been doing a doctor. I don't know she's only went to church his grandma's a preacher and they pick her up. Like schuyler's off every other Sunday so every other Sunday he takes her, and then on Sundays he works, the grandma takes her to a new place she's men that's what they said, it is, but I don't think it's that because she said. Give it about two weeks and she'll be completely cleared up to day is 14 days and I called them yesterday she's still digging herself, like her body is going to be so scarred up they gave us two things and medicine it's completely gone. I use the last little bit of it last night and it's not. And I don't have anything and and scholar doesn't have anything and she said that it spreads and all that to. wash our blankets skylar did the carpets like just everything and I just don't believe that. I believe she miss diagnose that because it would start to ease up if that's what it was and it's not so I called. Yesterday, like hey you said, within two weeks, I mean it's been 13 days today, like my baby is digging herself until she's role so she asked me to come in today so her appointment set to 15 I don't know what the hell, it is. I first I thought it was mosquito bites and. Like after a week i'm like this is not right, so we took her in there, so I don't know I just hope they get it get it taken care of. Because like I said man skylar never got anything. on us and we we thought ants were biting her because answer been really bad this year and, like I put. Like I sprayed in her room but and stuff in there, so we let her sleep but us until like it aired out and stuff so you know she. kind of just have her legs wrapped around your body and your arms and your face and I never got anything and so he either that he so I don't. there's so many things that could be I don't know what the hell, it is, but that's what she like looked at it real quick and said that's what it was, but. The medicine that they gave it not helping and she and she literally digs them till they bleed and they're everywhere, she has like a couple interface but they're literally everywhere, I feel so bad for. Her."
207.0,Provider,yeah hey. let's schedule your the eighth at.
430.0,Patient,"Sure i'll cabaret. Yes, that'll be perfect, we send me a text that. I was reading on what to expect expect, and they were talking about which I forget shit anyway, but like they said, like pregnancy brains, a real thing, and it is like it's wow. I can't remember shit like i'll say something to skyler and then five minutes later he'll be like you said this and then i'm arguing with them like no I didn't he's like oh my God like yes, you did say that I don't remember. I didn't know that was a thing, but like some something's going on, I got like I literally can't remember anything, even though I think I do so. yeah."
207.0,Provider,"And this is the other thing you and I, I would recommend that you, you take it easy on yourself. Because the truth truth be told, is that. you're."
430.0,Patient,Older adult their side they take it easy here.
207.0,Provider,yeah you guys take it easy because you the fact that you're older they consider you more high risk.
430.0,Patient,that's what it says on my paper that says high risk.
207.0,Provider,geriatric geriatric barely gave you a title.
430.0,Patient,Lord yeah.
207.0,Provider,You could have left it at high risk. For.
430.0,Patient,"scholars like Jerry after i'm like skylar 35 and up is dairy after and he was like Oh, he was getting mad like damn you're not like six years old and pregnant i'm like 35 and up is considered Derek."
207.0,Provider,Like.
430.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,Like i'm like you could have. been done with that same geriatric um but yeah it's you definitely have to keep it easier and you know the toll that it takes on your body and just kind of how your experience with it is it's you know it can be different so.
430.0,Patient,"I would, this is a rough. Best i've ever had. Oh, everyone, I guess, so again."
207.0,Provider,"In and maybe as you as you progress you'll probably feel the same way, because just again just the toll it takes on your body. yeah the impact that it has on your body you'll probably get a little bit more. annoyed or irritated not just with her, but with him and as a lot, a lot of that comes with. You know I do think that there's something there's a little bit more. value in appreciation, with it, I don't know if it's because you know we show last or. You know more tolerant and patient. Because you're older, but it definitely takes more of a toll on your body, it really does."
430.0,Patient,"yeah I I was 20 when I was pregnant with my son and now i'm 40 praying with this one, and I would I just remember, I thought that pregnancy was bad no like I will I. Work in just getting up clean just doing everything and now i'm looking at. Like I got yes, I got sick a lot, but other than that, like I energy."
207.0,Provider,"What did he. say about your pregnancy. Who. your son, what do you do when your opinion."
430.0,Patient,"He said I hope that's not true i'm not speaking to him right now, anyway, he he called me he facetime me. from jail and asked me to pick him up I picked him up three times. They didn't they weren't putting him, he was at the jail, they weren't putting him in there for public intoxication I think he has a drinking problem. And every time he's ever called me what you've called me three times I was eight months pregnant eight and a half months pregnant with her one time. I went and picked him up skylar went picked him up by himself one time this is like the last four years and then me and skylar both went together and have picked him up and. He called me a couple days ago, and I was just like no i'm enabling him because he's not gonna call anyone else because they'll flip the Fuck out. And i'm just like I understand because I wouldn't I can try and talk to him nope so has asked got left there, I was like call your your girlfriend so. But she was on the way to take their baby to the doctor, so I don't remember what happened with that, but that's a whole yeah I don't think he's his his dad actually his girlfriend is seven months pregnant so he's getting ready to have a baby brother by them and then whatever this is. I think he's upset because he was like you guys have a grandchild and stuff like. yeah you're technically not supposed to have kids when you're 18 and 19 so."
207.0,Provider,that's what you thought here.
430.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz he's uh he's upset because it his dad's my age, I think his girlfriend's a little younger but um yeah they're gonna have a baby so he's gonna have to news that blend right he doesn't care, I think he has a drinking problem."
207.0,Provider,and
430.0,Patient,i've tried it.
207.0,Provider,"I don't wanna. This is like you said coming to that, please. Coming to that place of. saying as much as you want to be there, and you want to help him, but then acknowledging like hey buddy you know, I think, maybe i'm enabling it because because of the place i'm coming from. uh huh you're not necessarily at the same place like i'm looking at it like I was there I understand I you know I wanted that support and all that, so you. yeah I know it's not helping him. helping him. Because in his mind he's thinking, the same way he's not seeing it as how he's just like well you're always going to be there you're always going. To always. But then, at what point do you recognize it and saying hey you. know until he gets to that place where. When he calls on somebody and they're not going to rush to his restaurant, then it makes it it forces them to start thinking about hey I need to make a change."
430.0,Patient,"And I don't have a dime and that's what that's what upsets me too, because his dad is that might come and get him but they would probably fist fight like his that. don't know all the times that that happened and i'm like so you want this this respect your dad by having him. You know, though out in the middle of the night or do whatever but you'll do it to me that's disrespectful you know it's wrong or you would call your dad so I was like I can call your grandma your dad for you like, I will I will do that and. He was like no I will, so I don't know what happened i'm called ass I just I can't I can't anymore, he knows he's not i'll do during when he comes here if he is I time to leave I just don't want to be around it and I see what that leads to. And I just it's he's my son and I love him but he's an adult and you make your own choices, but you're not gonna do that dumps and my house I can't stand. Alcohol or anything like that and I don't want it around me and the accident and he's one of those I love you cry drunks get the hell out of here get out of my face I hate people I hate drunks like that, like why why why one drinking cry and shit and. Like or drunk set or mean like that just I I can't stand the damn drunk and I don't care of my sound or not he will be here doing that shit and i'm not helping him anymore. He wants to come here and eat and. sleep, he can bank picking up from Joe and I quit giving them money the baby needs something i'll go buy it that's how I do. langham have no more money because I don't care if it's only $1 through the drive through one who's big rock De Beers no i'm not i'm not buying that shape not buying anything like that, because you're rowing in your shit. So, of course, he is look at it like."
207.0,Provider,That weren't written out there right now.
430.0,Patient,"it's not pill it's not like pills or heroin or math or whatever, but it can be just as bad they can be just as devastating to your life. if not worse so it's all the same boils down to it's all the same, and I tried to explain that to him, but he doesn't listen so whenever but we you when you send me a text, I think I already asked you."
