3482.0,Patient,Mary.
243.0,Provider,what's up.
3482.0,Patient,"Oh man i'm having problems with my prescriptions and it's not your fault, which is good, which I guess, but I need your help i'm. The we've been doing a. couple different combinations of the adderall to test it out, but unfortunately the pharmacy that I go to. couldn't fill both prescriptions, at the same time, because they didn't have one of them in stock and this happened back in probably July. So, ever since then i've been off meaning they would fill one prescription like a 20 milligram prescription. And then not be able to feel the 30 milligram until a couple of weeks later, so what ended up happening was I ended up doubling up on the 20 milligram and then having to double up on the 30 milligram most of the time it was Okay, but inevitably it started getting messed up. What i'd really like to do is fix it so that I can have both at the same time, so I don't have to worry about having to go back to the pharmacy and. trying to figure out if it happens, or whatever is going on it's just starting to make me crazy the problem I have right now is i'm not really do for the 30 milligram of. Of. The extra release adderall until. To the 27th, but I am currently out. Of adderall because I only got 10 milligrams of the regular release from you last week because that's all they would. But. So I need something to tide me over till next week, but it's got to be something that they can fill. And the reason, and I think the problem okay. Okay sorry. I think the problem is."
243.0,Provider,called him.
3482.0,Patient,Okay.
243.0,Provider,While you're on the phone.
3482.0,Patient,"Good okay. And the problem was, I think i'd asked you about the other complicating factor was i'd asked you about possibly changing to the 20 milligram regular release and you gave me, let me try that but. I actually do prefer the 20 milligrams. 20 milligrams regular releases too much of a jolt. I know it's complicated Mary. said talk to you a long time ago about it, but I just was hoping it wasn't."
243.0,Provider,So do you want the 20 regular release with the 30 xr.
3482.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like them both but I don't think I can get the 30 xr until but the."
243.0,Provider,Only the only one that sex or is it 30.
3482.0,Patient,The xr right now is the 30.
243.0,Provider,Now what you want.
3482.0,Patient,"I will be able to get it till next week. But i'm and if I guess the. Missing if I get the 20 xr right now, then i'll be doing the same thing that i've been doing the past which is doubling up on the 20 until I get the 30 next week."
243.0,Provider,So just just Just what do you want for xr only the 30.
3482.0,Patient,"Is there anything is there anything else, they have besides 20 or 30."
243.0,Provider,So my question again is a regular release of 20 a regular release of 10 in it xr of 30.
3482.0,Patient,i'd rather have the extended release of 20 and the extended release of 30 and have the regular recent release of 10 okay there's a backup now I gotta run.
243.0,Provider,"I. Can last night, this is Mary i'm nurse practitioner working with Deborah kearney birthdate 10 1656 and we're having trouble with the Ad around prescription. Which i'm changing to a 50 s are 20 which is 20 and 30 combined of each of asr and she'd like to be able to pick those up together right now they're being. not filled, at the same time, which causes her to have to double up on one and then she runs out she's not due until the 30th but she's out because she's had to double up. In addition to that she takes a 10 milligram regular midday, so if you could help me try to figure out how to fix this. By the way, thank you for. No other lady and group, though. I know, but what you said about false less last night last time was really good."
3482.0,Patient,"Oh no and the thing is Mary. she's got to understand. That the long term. effects are going to screw her up and cause more anxiety because I mean I they were going to give me an MRI because, as well, so much."
243.0,Provider,Keep keep working on it.
3482.0,Patient,I will i'm happy to but she's got but you tell me what points I mean she's never going to think that going off of it will make her less anxious but she's got to realize that being on it is going to ultimately make her more anxious when it's eroding her.
243.0,Provider,"I think she does realize that but it's just the doing it, you know and the constant remembering you know."
3482.0,Patient,"Well, I think what you need maybe put it on the clock and then she taken the klonopin she tried that. Because Colombian it doesn't have the same kind of effect that it that xanax does but it helps you get through the. You know the twitches and stuff like that that you that if you've been on a long time I at least I went through when I was coming off of it, but I only needed to be on the klonopin for like a month."
243.0,Provider,yeah well.
3482.0,Patient,"But, again, I really didn't that the other thing was you were. You were determined. not like the fact that I was doing it and. You didn't like it in a way that just wasn't oh I don't believe in that drug but it's just not good for you and i'm worried about you being on it and that made me start thinking more about that. yeah other. So. But i'm happy, it will be as."
243.0,Provider,I am too i'm very happy with how you turned out.
3482.0,Patient,"Well, and to. What i'm."
243.0,Provider,"Here I am. hi I need some help i'm Mary casner i'm a nurse practitioner, and I work with Deborah kearney birthday. Let me tell you what the dilemma is. She takes at around 20 s R xr in 30 X are together in the morning. For some reason they're not getting filled together so she runs out and she's been doubling up and now she's up entirely and they're not do till the 30th. She also takes a 10 milligram regular midday, and so I need to know from you how I can fix it so she can pick them up, you know around the same time."
3482.0,Patient,Mary.
243.0,Provider,"Okay, so one is going to she can pick up on the 26 and one on the 28th. And you can you can't put them together for her to pick up the same day. yeah yeah she's out because she had to double because she was she was out of one of them, so. So I would like to make it so she could pick up both the Ad route 20 and 30 on the 20. sure. Out of all but the tense because of the way it was filled like to you know see if I could authorizing really pick up. Yes, yes. Had. because she you couldn't give her the you didn't have the. For the 20 so she had to double up."
3482.0,Patient,I think it was the 30s and actually.
243.0,Provider,So did you double up on their 30s.
3482.0,Patient,"Now I doubled the breath, this is back in July, I think, and I doubled up into 20 I doubled up on the 20th initially and then, once that ran out I got. I had to go out for a couple days, and then I got the 30th because they got it in, so I doubled up first on the 20th and then I doubled up on the 30th and then I got the 20s and."
243.0,Provider,"30s Ward and you can you wait listen, let me, let me see if I can. Make it so you can talk to her, can you hold on a second."
