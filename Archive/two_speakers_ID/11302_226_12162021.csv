11302.0,Patient,I hope so um I believe I got two a's and two b's so.
226.0,Provider,it's really good if you.
11302.0,Patient,Do.
226.0,Provider,"what's up for this So what do you have like a month off. What do you got going on the holiday, but you know the break."
11302.0,Patient,hanging out with friends. My grandma might come visit and. yeah just relaxing.
226.0,Provider,"it's good to me. Right, what would what would be helpful to go, what do you want to go like today."
11302.0,Patient,"I would like to go over. i've just been feeling really low this entire week. I hung out with friends went skating for the first first time, which was really fun. And just a lot of good things have been happening, but like my mom and I had an argument. Last week. And the whole like energy in the House is just off. My mom is. She always does this where she pretends like everything's okay. But if we say something. about the argument she'll kind of like go off again so. yeah just my i've been really low I. Have energy to only do like basic self care."
226.0,Provider,yeah. yeah yeah yeah so the basic self care kind of talked a little bit we touched on some of that right like brushing your teeth like tell me what basic self care like what does that look like.
11302.0,Patient,"Just taking my medication. Taking a shower brush my teeth. Eating drinking water, like that's the basic self care for me."
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay so you've been able to keep up with all that though right. yeah okay. So, how does the arguing with your mom impact you, and how does that impact your self care, do you see a correlation."
11302.0,Patient,"I think I do because. I don't feel like. i'm supposed to be doing self care. I was able to do yoga consistently last week, this week, I was only able to do it once. and I just feel like i'm not. Like I it's not worth it for me to like. Do self care if that makes any sense."
226.0,Provider,"Is that what happens for you, when you get in an argument with your mom or is that all is that all the time."
11302.0,Patient,"it's all of the time, but it's more when I get into an argument with her."
226.0,Provider,"What do you think happens like what do you think. What part of you, you know okay so self care is really about taking care of your basic needs. hygiene. Oral hygiene. food, water, sleep. So when you get in an argument with your mom all of that gets disrupted. Then wondering what is that about like think about like that, why do you think that what does that stem from where you feel like you don't. deserve I don't know self care."
11302.0,Patient,"yeah I I feel like I don't deserve basic like self care. and I mean it stems from me like always having to put her needs first and, like her. Opinions her values like everything before me. and yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So what happens is you become cut off from yourself. When you feel like you have to put her needs and her wants before you, that means that you aren't able to be your true authentic self at a very basic level. Like face. I mean, never mind like you know you want to be an astronaut, and she wants you to be a school teacher right or Never mind that. You know she wants you to marry a certain someone and you want to marry somebody different or that you want to be with somebody dating somebody and she wants you to be with somebody else, like those are much bigger so My point is that, even on just like a very basic. Your basic stuff doesn't get met all the other bigger stuff forget it, it can't even like think about that. Like that's completely off the table."
11302.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So what happens is like then you're not able to become grow into and be the person that really feels good for you. So there's a little bit of like an identity crisis going on. So you have to act and be a certain way, for your mom to get her acceptance and to get her love. Otherwise, you know turns the household upside down what was the argument about."
11302.0,Patient,"um. It started the day before. or like. yeah I think it started the day before my dad was over. Just a little bit of background history on their relationship. My dad's married, but he still continues to have sex with my mom. they're both okay with that so like. And my. I haven't I don't remember what exactly we were talking about but. I. called my mama whoa on ax it it slipped out I feel like I was kind of projecting like. onto her. Because that's kind of that's kind of what i'm feeling. But she. she replied, she said, oh like i've only been with your dad and one other man and. That kind of set off my dad. he's really all about trust and having that open communication with her and he always thought that, like she would say that he's the only one that she's been with. And if it caused an argument between them, they both got mad. And then the next day, my dad came over for me to fix the fire stick the Amazon fire stick and. My mom came home. We started talking about how. Things haven't been going well with Julia because, like things just have been. Pretty off in our like situation. Like it just it hasn't worked out for us to meet. and I think I started talking about my friend Andy. She kept miss gendering them and I kept correcting her and then she got mad because I was correcting her. and It just it stemmed from like. This little thing, and my mom just went off so."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, did you guys, is it resolved."
11302.0,Patient,"No, because my mom is the type to forget forget it ever happened and never speak of it again. So."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you said you were projecting onto her tell me a little bit more about that."
11302.0,Patient,"um. I guess the value so hold from my mom is that i'm like only supposed to be one person and. that's not what I want to do, like, I want to be able to. connect with people like. I necessarily don't feel like I want to be with one person. But at the same time it kind of contradicts with like what i'm feeling because I actually do want to connect with people and. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So, are you thinking that your mom spouse Okay, so are you thinking of it in terms of like your mom's values or to be with one person and that you're thinking that that's how you should be, but you really don't want to be."
11302.0,Patient,"In a way, yes."
226.0,Provider,"it's I find it very interesting that your mom is slipping with your dad and your dad is married. And then she doesn't have an issue with the fact that he's basically cheating on his wife, with your mom. So there's a lot there's a lot there."
11302.0,Patient,"yeah and. I think the wife knows, but she's also Okay, with it, like she. relies on my dad financially so. yeah yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So it sounds like it's like enough it's an open marriage, maybe."
11302.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so yeah I mean there are couples that have that and i'm totally okay with that so with That being said, if you need to develop your own morals in your own principles in your own values and on what you feel is right for you."
11302.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So be careful not to get caught in what you feel you need how you need to live. Why don't get caught in. Living the way you feel your mom wants you to live. get really clear on how you want to live like what's good for you it's healthy but, but what. morals and principles and values, do you hold true to yourself. there's a lot of codependency between you."
11302.0,Patient,Speaking of that I actually found the book. Now you recommended at. The bookstore I was Andy and I had to buy it so it's on my reading list now.
226.0,Provider,"Okay nice awesome you've got you've got four weeks off from school, you know, like like pick it up and just you know, like I said you don't have to read it cover to cover. You know, you can just kind of you know, find things that apply to that you can read it to cover to cover to cover whatever works for you, you know so good for you that's awesome. yeah there's there's some really good stuff in there, so the reason I suggested that is that it might i'm hoping that it's going to give you clarity around. The codependency that you have going on with your mom your mom's codependent on you like. You guys are probably pretty equally codependent, on the other one, but so what happens is that it makes it really difficult when you're codependent you put other people's needs to have yours. And then that and so what's triggering for you is that can you get in this argument with your mom and then you being able to just take you know do self care on a basic level kind of falls by the wayside. Okay that's not good for your health okay like now we're talking about like just oral health brushing your teeth and flossing you know it's you want to go to the dentist like that so bad oral hygiene can create issues down the road part part issues bacteria travels. You know, to the brain to the heart, so you really want to you really want to look at that is like Okay, this is how i'm keeping myself safe. and You know, taking a shower is just like having good hygiene like so I just read something. It was really interesting it said something like. And cleanliness and poor hygiene are two things that destroy relationships and marriages. So um cleanliness can also be like one person's really messy and leaves other stuff you know around the House and one person's really not a no and keeps everything really clean or not having good hygiene and being with somebody that. You know, has dirt under their nails or smells like has body odor or you know their hairs greasy you know that's not appealing to. Some people, I thought that was that was really interesting i've never heard that before. And so. You want to be able to. Like the work for you is to. You know, create your own independence, create your own autonomy, be the person that you want to be for you. So you feel true to yourself and feel happy. Because it sounds like for the most part it's like you can have an open, honest conversation with your mom like I don't get the sense that you're afraid of. Speaking your truth always Is that correct. Right so you've already got that you know, and so, which tells me that you guys have an open line of communication, whether she likes it or not, you're still communicating what's true and honest for you. So that's good. You know that's that's good you've got one category down. So this just takes. Like like exploring it and kind of learning about it just kind of practicing being separate from your mom. Like it's not easy, believe me, I know what i'm saying i'm what i'm talking about I know isn't easy it takes it takes time. To do it might go really scary it might feel like no way that's not acceptable, I can't do that, and you know some people's reaction is like well I can't do that, because then my family won't love me. So if I if I don't act this way if I don't present my myself a certain way within my family they're going to reject me and then I will be all alone. And that's very common for people. When that might be people's reality, but sometimes you have to check yourself and go is that really reality based thinking is that would that really be the case in my family of origin, or does it just take some really clear, concise honest communication."
11302.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So be really careful like try and connect the dots there. When you have an argument with your mom you know go like check check in with yourself and go okay How did this just make me feel like how am I feeling right now in this moment because. Not doing the self care is a form of self sabotage. So you go okay Why am I feeling like this, like what part of this argument really impacted me in touch me deep. To make me feel like I don't deserve to even do the basic self care."
11302.0,Patient,yeah I can see that. yeah.
226.0,Provider,How often do you have arguments with your mom.
11302.0,Patient,"Bull Lately we haven't had arguments. So this is like the first after like a couple of weeks, maybe okay."
226.0,Provider,"And then in between these arguments, how do you guys communicate you feel like it's healthy communication."
11302.0,Patient,"it's I feel like it's like two roommates living together. um. yeah I can't speak to her about things that. are not what she values so. I just kind of keep to myself, sometimes."
226.0,Provider,yeah. That might be the best thing to do. you're not going to agree on everything. So it's kind of like picking your battles.
11302.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"And so I would just stay really mindful, you know have how you're feeling like internally like how he feeling like check in with yourself and just go okay. Did this just really pissed me off or to this really hurt me or. Am I cool this and say okay well what what what where Am I and all of that, so I want you to just be mindful about how you're feeling like mentally and emotionally how you're feeling. And then read that book. Anything else. You feel like you're doing overall."
11302.0,Patient,"Overall i'm doing surprisingly well I kind of. i'm stepping out of my comfort zone, a little bit by just hanging out with my friends and like meeting new people so."
226.0,Provider,yeah I think it's great. it's great. Okay So what about. Thursday December 30 at noon.
11302.0,Patient,"yeah I can do that, did you say new."
226.0,Provider,Yes.
11302.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I can do that. Going really well um. we've been. Like yesterday we've been talking about cognitive distortions and I. tried like exercising that a bit today so."
226.0,Provider,yeah. yeah. there's there's a did you guys go over all the different kind of cognitive distortions cognitive dissonance there's different ones.
11302.0,Patient,yeah i've noticed the connections in. Like I tend to mind read. that's the biggest one that I tend to do a lot.
226.0,Provider,"yeah isn't that interesting. yeah I think you know exactly what someone's thinking. yeah. Okay, good right on. Okay well have a great Christmas."
