14943.0,Patient,Can you hear me OK.
298.0,Provider,"I can oh good, thank you for meeting me today. let's see how is your medicine working for you."
14943.0,Patient,"i'm pretty good I had i've had one or two nights where I really haven't been able to fall asleep until like one in the morning, but I don't go to work till 10am so it's okay."
298.0,Provider,um. If you get sleep life is better. I think I want sleep more than I want food in life.
14943.0,Patient,I wish I was the same just. always been always been an issue.
298.0,Provider,"yeah. I am just pulling up our last is it, do you know what we were going to go over today, or is this just a check in."
14943.0,Patient,"I think it's just a check in I did a group yesterday. And then. I am gone back to work, which is probably helping me get into a better routine so i'm not obsessing just about the sleep issues I have other things to obsess about. So, even though, even though i'm not in the lab yet because i'm immunocompromised. So. Like I have to kind of find things to do, like wander around and my boss has been really busy and hasn't been able to help me and so that's a little frustrating but. You know I I text her I call her and she says she will come over and help me i'm in a different part of the building and nothing so. it's I don't feel very useful right now but it'll get better."
298.0,Provider,Okay. um are you eating okay.
14943.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm actually gaining unexpectedly gaining some weight and I don't know if it's the medication or not so."
298.0,Provider,it's 100% the medication.
14943.0,Patient,is okay.
298.0,Provider,it's the seroquel. um.
14943.0,Patient,yeah i've gone from 192 298 in just two weeks.
298.0,Provider,"I don't know how long we're going to be able to keep you on the seroquel because. It puts you at higher risk for diabetes and. All the bad things so we, we have to think about that, I would like to get a little further past the hospital visit and then think. About yes i'm stabilizing more and then look at coming down off that metal. yeah we've gone to a more expensive, one that doesn't have the weekend."
14943.0,Patient,"Oh, what what's the what's the other one."
298.0,Provider,"i'm there's other methods out there, like re lar the are a while and lead to death. That those don't have the weight gain they don't have the component for sleep, but we can look at a different method for sleep. So those maybe two minutes you want to do some research on."
14943.0,Patient,"rate rate of Rayleigh i'm sorry, how do you know how you spell it it's a V."
298.0,Provider,yeah they are. And so that's kind of how you spell it.
14943.0,Patient,"Okay. All right, yeah that the weight thing I was really surprised it's like i'm not change, I haven't changed how I eat at all so. I was like."
298.0,Provider,"i'm, which means that we still need to meet keep meeting. To we if this weight problem look at some what is called is second generation anti-psychotics. Okay, and look at once that don't cause the weight gain."
14943.0,Patient,"Okay okay. yeah I mean I do want to tighter down I just still am not I haven't come off the the whole manic anxiety episode, yet I mean i'm still. i'm on i'm getting better, but I may need a you know another month or so I don't know if that's."
298.0,Provider,"I agree, is very reasonable we don't have to do anything I really need your brain to. Have a break from the anxiety yeah. anyway."
14943.0,Patient,"You know i'm definitely i'm definitely getting better and more settled um, but I still have i'm still on the anxiety train right now, like we were talking about brain weasels I was called them, I have a brain worm that's just. My brain. And unfortunately it's just time that i've gone through this a couple of times in my life, so I have come out of it and gotten back to normal it just takes a little bit of time."
298.0,Provider,"Here yeah. All right, anything else would be good to go over."
14943.0,Patient,um no I have occasionally taken an extra trezza don't. But that seems to be. That seems to help me if it's late at night and it's like one or two in the morning i'll just take an extra trouser down and i'm hoping that's okay to do.
298.0,Provider,"It is, I just need to. Maybe go up on your dose so that you don't come up short."
14943.0,Patient,"Oh okay yeah cuz i'm normally taking three two and a half to three drop downs, but not the seroquel a circle I just take two. Okay, and that seems I take the third trezza don't if it's like one in the morning and I haven't been I haven't been able to get to sleep and that usually helps me."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. that's okay i'm okay with that I. Will just stop at three, though."
14943.0,Patient,Right right.
298.0,Provider,"And one of the things that we would be looking at because you're on paxil at 20 milligrams and you're on track down at 3,000,300 milligrams there's always the possibility, not that it would happen to you, but serotonin syndrome. And that feels like the flu you develop a temperature yes. So if if you get that feeling it's probably that it's too much transfer down. All right, and. Thank you for meeting me."
14943.0,Patient,"Sure yeah I just got I just got home from work so i'm just done decompressing and it feels good, though, to get into a. A routine. because all of my coping mechanisms went away so. I am exercising more you know, keeping it keeping my heart rate under hundred but doing more walking."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I like that."
14943.0,Patient,we're.
298.0,Provider,Get that heart better.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah I know I know well and i'm also on the right line of set the injectable so that's been extended for six months by my rheumatologist. And then they're going to do another echocardiogram. To see if the inflammation it has gone away, and then hopefully tighter me off of that as well. Wonderful So hopefully i'm not one of those long time recurrent people but i'm i'm i'm learning to cope and i'm learning to adjust. So that's I just can't will this away, I just have to give it time."
298.0,Provider,that's right.
14943.0,Patient,"All right, you're good to go."
