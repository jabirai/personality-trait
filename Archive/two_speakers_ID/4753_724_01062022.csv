4753.0,Patient,"No nothing just got should I just barely walk through the door and now. hey that's cute couple hour, while an hour and a half, but today was a little bit longer I got out a little bit longer to so."
724.0,Provider,Do you normally have like a long commute.
4753.0,Patient,"In the morning it's about an hour and 20 minutes, and after work it depends on what time I get out but. it's about a half hour. I mean half hour longest about an hour and a half. hour 45 so. yeah."
724.0,Provider,That kind of socks those is his. Distance or is it because of traffic.
4753.0,Patient,"yeah it's good traffic, you know if I don't get out of there before 330 then it adds like an extra half hour, you know but it's not it's not that big of a deal, you know okay it gets me time to wind down and. yeah it's not that bad I got to do it, so I try to be positive about it, you know."
724.0,Provider,"What do you do to like listen to podcasts or like audio books or anything like that, while you were."
4753.0,Patient,"yeah so what I do is i'll listen to well on the way to work, I like to listen to a radio station out here. it's Bob and Tom and the Moreno not and gets cross country but."
724.0,Provider,yeah sounds familiar.
4753.0,Patient,"yeah so I listened to that they're pretty funny and then on the way home I usually. i'm either on the phone or I like listen to like Facebook videos you know I just have my ear headphones in the play and yeah listen I like I like to listen to the news or something you know, on their. videos is see what what biden's up to these days. it's always exciting."
724.0,Provider,"i'd say so. yeah audio books are really good too. I find that, like most radio stations kind of boring, you know if you listen to music plays like the same 10 songs on. So it's like if you're going to be in a car for like that long you might as well be like entertaining yourself or educating yourself, so I tend to look for something interesting like listen to comedy shows or. audio books and stuff like that, so I have like a like a 45 minute commute so in order, just to stay awake you know what I mean like I need to like look for some of the like stimulate so."
4753.0,Patient,"Keep the window, you know crack the window at least a little bit of you know it's wake up i'll do that on the way to work and the way back because it now it's cool a little bit colder out so you have the heater on and it gets you sleepy."
724.0,Provider,drives her eyes out so you can blinking more guitar you know. Well that's cool. yeah see like a new gig.
4753.0,Patient,yeah there's there's a lot to a lot to learn for sure and it's it's fast pace and. yeah it's cool i'm enjoying it i'm learning a lot and staying busy.
724.0,Provider,So what do you do exactly.
4753.0,Patient,"So so they're basically production homes, so in a subdivision so let's say they might be putting up 100 homes. They have subcontractors, you know that do plumbing and framing and all that right so, then the superintendent. And i'm the assistant superintendent so we, we run the schedule and make sure that you know for each phase so each phase might have. Eight 810 homes going on at a time and then and then at certain next time the next phase goes on, so at any given time, you can have. You know 30 houses going on and at different stages they're all different stages you got to make sure that are showing up, but this person showed up this time. countertops are showing up at this day get a coordinate that and so everything's phone in within a time there's a time frame, be done, and you know, then. The cells opposite selling the homes, you know so, then they have a date they need to move in so we got to get that done, and you know people will say you know the other and say the. frame or the let's say. The countertop guys have a job somewhere else, so you know they only come in for two days and then they're gone another job, and then we need them back, and then they can't come, you know so it's just it gets confusing to juggle everybody and. yeah so i'm learning on the sequence, and everything and. You know people ask me questions like Brian home I don't know yeah. Like now here."
724.0,Provider,You can always feel like that's a good question i'll get back to you on that.
4753.0,Patient,"yeah well the good thing is because my my dad's a superintendent does the same thing for a different company, so I call him constantly you know. I don't get no training from my superintendent where I you know my boss, where i'm at so I have to kind of just figure it out. yeah cuz he's busy as itself and. Then another struggle is you know, everybody speaks Spanish you know the. Worker so it's got to communicate with them and it's not just like you and I talking it's."
724.0,Provider,"Of course, in."
4753.0,Patient,"Reality to break it down, and you know APP or my mom's Mexican so i'll come on mom and hey what's this mean or a tell tell it to this guy."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean Google translate on your phone or like the guy. yeah boom boom let's go back and forth like like I used to like in the hospital like would come across people they clearly no language barrier and once you were able to figure out like what language, it was like Google translate and we like pumped about."
4753.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah OK cool it's really it's unique it's awesome you know what I mean like. that's cool.
4753.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it sounds like you're you're doing like a lot of time management, logistics and critical thinking that that's like it'd be pretty exhausting you know, especially when you're trying to learn stuff."
4753.0,Patient,"yeah on top of the drive you know and. I try to stay focused on you know, then I got i'm dealing with chick you know so."
724.0,Provider,That.
4753.0,Patient,"I tried to which is good, though, as far as you know, being busy at work so i'm not thinking about that all day you know I mean i'm constantly being semi of being stimulated so. yeah so it's good."
724.0,Provider,awesome yeah and you'll figure it out like that how long you been doing it for now.
4753.0,Patient,She is my what my third week.
724.0,Provider,"or weekend yeah you know I mean like. Give it like like 90 days you know and then you'll you'll finally like at like the 90 day point. you'll have a pretty general idea of like how things are supposed to go and then like every month after that you'll be better than you were the previous month. And then, like six months on the road you'd be like yeah I pretty much got this pretty much handle and you'd be able to manage like a lot of this stuff."
4753.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,it's a learning curve.
4753.0,Patient,"yeah and, on top of it that my first week there. The superintendent my boss, he was on vacation so that another guy come in to help and then. So he got back, he was gone for two weeks so it's playing catch up, so the schedule and everything's a mess and then now, I guess, he has a family member that has coven so he's gonna be gone for another week no me. Neither by myself so. run legal job site and i'm like man i'll figure this one out but I guess."
724.0,Provider,"trial by fire sometimes it's the best way to learn. Do you guys have any like. Technical software that that helps you manage it, or you. you're just doing it off of retested are."
4753.0,Patient,"excel I mean. And phone calls and scheduled upon paper you know the computer printed out, but you know it's not like. Any high tech deal or nothing."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're you're managing stuff you're essentially putting out fires like as a show up."
4753.0,Patient,yeah yeah and yeah everybody's calling you saying they need water over year or they don't have this thing here.
724.0,Provider,"yeah once you know, once you kind of settle in and you get like like right now it's like the puzzle people like they give you all the puzzle pieces, but they don't show you the picture. And you're just like i'm going to start with the edge and i'm going to start slowly working my way into the middle that's kind of like what it is."
4753.0,Patient,"Every time I call somebody i'm like man, I hope, i'm. Saying some correct, as it were, like no stupid that's like we're not there yet, you know as I feel like you know. Right whenever I gotta give it a try, you know, so you know."
724.0,Provider,"it'll it'll become clear to you once you yeah yeah you're smart guy you'll get to the point where you're the frequency, in which you're asking questions we're going to start to slow down and it just means that your confidence is growing and your understanding of what the task is. It gets there."
4753.0,Patient,"it's funny i'm i'm already thinking right and like i'm going to look back one day man like when I asked this guy this question, you know, like just because of. How unsure I am even when I say it, you know it's just do you guys need this, you know and i'm going to be like the House deeper was that."
724.0,Provider,"Of course. Of course yeah that's cool, though. it'll keep you sharp sounds like there's like some you know, like strategy anytime you're dealing with logistics is always going to be like strategy and what you want to do is like good time management would be like if this guy is coming in to do this task. kind of get it to overlap with this one and kill two birds with one stone, you know what I mean like you'll start to figure out ways where. You know, you know you'll start knocking out a couple of objectives at once. it'll start to make sense for that'll be a good that'll be a good gig for you to keep you like you said distracted preoccupied busy yeah."
4753.0,Patient,Right right.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, very good good. And you said, the pays much better."
4753.0,Patient,yeah it's it's it's almost yeah it's almost three times more than I was making so yeah it's good for me really good.
724.0,Provider,Good and are you still doing like like that side job for your body for the cash or you.
4753.0,Patient,"Know ya know I stopped that. That was in between. The electrical because it just wasn't getting I wasn't getting paid enough, you know."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah. And it's this new job is this like sustainable I could like is there, like a career path and there's like long term promising."
4753.0,Patient,"yeah No, this is, this is a career path for sure. Right it's. Everything that i've done, you know buying so. lot of room for growth, you know potential not only just within the company, but like you know it's in the field so it's a good, especially without going to school it's a it's you know I mean. yeah it's it's a good career path, I mean."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it'll it'll lend itself to a lot of other job descriptions, you know and other fields and stuff like that."
4753.0,Patient,"yeah I mean so, to put it in perspective, essentially, I think I was making like. 38 or something you know I our any years annually, you know it worked out that way, and now i'm on salary making close to 90 so you know it's it's it's a big jump for me there. yeah there's you know and there's bonuses and so on top of it so. it's likely that i'll get to 100 just this this year, if not next year, so. Oh yeah so you know that's that's a huge difference, you know what I mean."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean that's that's life changing money.
4753.0,Patient,"yeah yeah for sure. yeah I think my dad does anything he he's a suit so superintendent would be the next step for me, but. You know that's right it's the next couple years it's possible to get there, you know, and I think he's well over 100 so I know it's good field to get into now, I did have to you know I only got it because I was in construction, for a long time, you know. Right."
724.0,Provider,So you got a background yeah.
4753.0,Patient,Right right yeah.

Not to say that that you're going to need it, but it comes it like a good time because it's gonna it's gonna buy you some stability, you know what I mean."
4753.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"You know what you're fixing to do, and you know fight for childcare and stuff like that you might need a little extra money. You know a lot of people try to do without financial support from family or you know just that kind of stability, having that's going to help you on the legal side of the House so."
4753.0,Patient,"I know that it really did come that like couldn't come at a better time you know, especially with your like you said you know, legally and everything that's going on yeah good."
724.0,Provider,So you don't need to fight on roommate now right.
4753.0,Patient,I already have a roommate.

4753.0,Patient,"it's it's working out good he. He actually. He he has his own contract even business. And he's going what's funny is I knew him. From backing out of high school I used to hang out in the same circle he's a few towns over. But you know of each other and he's going through something similar through divorce, and it has kids so he is a. kind of you know, he tells me what to expect, and you know these kind of things and. yeah so we can we can relate on that level for sure."
724.0,Provider,Okay yeah so at least you can find like a. Like a Rambo what makes things kind of weird so is this some comfort level or.
4753.0,Patient,Exactly.
724.0,Provider,"Any any new year's resolutions outside of the legal stuff we know you want to do that what you want to get back to work and outside, like, I can tell you've lost some weight and we started doing this."
4753.0,Patient,"yeah no I I will get back into the gym but right now i'm just focusing on work and see my baby when I can and getting that whole things straightened out but yeah i'll get back in the gym I just. works my priority right now, and you know, making sure I get plenty of rest and. Those are the things i'm focusing on."
724.0,Provider,how's the House the medication any changes on that for you are stable it's fine.
4753.0,Patient,Issues yeah no. i'm my only issue is just the concept constipation you know I got that me relax but as far as the medication no i'm. I take three three day throughout the day and. yeah it works for me.
724.0,Provider,And how much of the how much of the Merrill actually take him up like a full CAP.
4753.0,Patient,yeah so I take one cat a day i'm going to update it because I don't think it's working enough so.
724.0,Provider,How long you've been taking it for.
4753.0,Patient,A couple days.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it could take like like. You know, especially in the beginning, you could probably take like you know, three to five potentially like if you're just doing like like."
4753.0,Patient,"i'm doing because it says, to take one capsule, so I do one, but I remember hearing you saying yeah give my daughter, but i'm thinking."
724.0,Provider,"I give her. Because that's what I was doing in the beginning with my daughter right So when I went to the doctor I was like look I was like this kid is you know she's. Just not shit and and when she does like a cannonball and I was like it's got to be tortures, for you know. And I was like i'm giving her me relax i'm giving her like the prescribed dose of the doctor was like she's like that stuff is. it's pretty harmless she's like so you could probably up it and it'll be okay, you know what I mean it's and I was like okay so look like now, I do and currently so my daughter goes to like these phases and she was good for a couple weeks now, as of today, this is like day three. And she she I mean she hasn't gone in like. Like like a week it feels like like so it's like four or five days and I know she has to because she gets like her personality is really bad she's she's somewhat. irritable aggressive I keep her out of school because I don't want her to like beat up a kid you not I mean so it's like. Like we can tell, like my girlfriend, I can tell you what the signs are happening and we know that she was like in a lot of discomfort so we're like Meryl acts like the crap out of her because for a while we were going every other day, you know the keeper. marriages and then, for whatever reason, this phase that she's in right now and happens somewhat frequently so now we're we're docent are like multiple times a day just piling it on piling on."
4753.0,Patient,Like a whole capsule.
724.0,Provider,"You oh yeah like every like two three times a day like I put it in our water loading it up and then you know I can tell it starting to work because she's like her stomach is as distended she's less irritable so i'm expecting any day now anytime now for like a blow out this so. So that's why what it is, you know what I mean like you could probably do like a cap for the start of your day you just don't want to be at the job site and also then be like oh."
4753.0,Patient,"yeah well that yeah I gotta do I gotta do you know. i've been putting in my copies of it, I think today is only the second day so i've been putting a coffee in the morning but. i'll bring it with me, so I don't take it anymore."
724.0,Provider,So I take a little bit before bed. You know what I mean do you drink a lot of water.
4753.0,Patient,I do.
724.0,Provider,"Okay gatorade to you know, or like. pedialyte or something like that keep your like hydrated because what's happening is is like. pain medication opiates narcotic dehydrates you so like all the water in your stomach is being pulled away and that's why it's taking longer for your food the breakdown of digest and then because it's not a lot of fluid in there, it just dries out your your intestines and your stomach. So you get a Pal the water, you know you're going to stay super hydrated probably even more so than than you normally would and whatever they tell you like eight fluid ounces a day, whatever the standard measure is for water intake. You have to go. slightly above that but below water poisoning so don't be drinking like a gallon like a day like that's not super healthy for you. So, but you do have to you know uptick the water consumption, a little bit to help with that to combat that the hydration and the mayor locks will help to has this always been a problem or just recently."
4753.0,Patient,yeah I know it always has but recently I feel like it's gotten worse yeah.
724.0,Provider,"um. yeah I don't know I don't think regardless talked about like decreasing the dose I don't know if that would make a difference, or not even like slightly. yeah i'm not sure. that's just one of those side effects that that's okay."
4753.0,Patient,"No it's it's I mean it's it is what it is. I mean, I get I can get it out, I just."
724.0,Provider,it's brutal.
4753.0,Patient,"Well, it just takes a minute, you know I mean I gotta. Go and. She can try to take a half stand up and you know what I mean like do what you gotta do you know. right but."
724.0,Provider,it's a it's an uncomfortable. yeah sometimes.
4753.0,Patient,"And you know when you wish, want to hurry up and get it out so frustrating but."
724.0,Provider,About laughing at you i'm laughing.
4753.0,Patient,I understand.
724.0,Provider,What George was thinking about the other night he was he was probably just like crawling and skin.
4753.0,Patient,yeah that was funny.
724.0,Provider,"yeah but I don't know how like how you get through kids and that having like a squeamish around that man because. You know, in full disclosure I put my son he's two and the shower tonight, like you know, like. A took his diaper off and I put them in the shower and he's like I pooped and I was like no you didn't and then I you know went out at through his diaper way and I come back to turn the shower on any shift in the shower and I was like and he's like. wipe him, so I was like oh my. God. Like I can't I can't catch a break, and then I was thinking about insurance and I was like he had to have gone through this like, how do you function like it's crazy. Well, hopefully, you know, hopefully, the next day or two the mayor likes kicks in it makes things a little bit."
4753.0,Patient,i'm going to take me when we get done here yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you could probably look it up on on YouTube or read it, or whatever it is then find out, whatever the combination was i'm surprised, like the coffee doesn't help but coffees a diuretic to so. You drink a lot of coffee all day or."
4753.0,Patient,"Now, I just have one cup in the morning okay yeah."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I feel like coffee is like a natural accelerant, for you know upset."
4753.0,Patient,"Right and there has been times, where I stopped over at shea you know Chevron like oh how go here, you know just only popeyes at the job site, you know. Product over and they're like I can't get it out on my stupid dang you know, and you can't you know so whatever okay."
724.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully it improves."
4753.0,Patient,yeah all this up it if the two year old can take it.
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah oh yeah um any other upcoming medical appointments or anything like that scheduled or concerns.
4753.0,Patient,"No. I got I got court coming up on the 18th for an incident that happened like. A year ago year and a half ago, a year ago I don't know time flies so."
724.0,Provider,kind of those.
4753.0,Patient,About a year and a half or. Two years ago I don't know but anyways I got some I broke a window. The Court for.
724.0,Provider,"So I think I briefly talked about the change in surveys, a little bit. Did I do that Monday night or was."
4753.0,Patient,"mentioned, I remember you. mentioned something about surveys."
724.0,Provider,"yeah they're they're going to you know decrease in frequency and since you're like monthly you're going to just be required to have them done by the first of the month. Okay, just look out for that and. you're pretty much on top of your services your most recent one, you did the depression one you scored zero on that so. that's nothing to be worried about and your anxiety when you score for on it's considered minimal so. Anything anything making you anxious outside of like the like the environmental factor of dealing with the you know the chicken a kid and the new job is there anything on top of that are just those two things."
4753.0,Patient,know just that's it. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Pretty standard level of it, because I, considering the circumstances."
4753.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"So, yes i'm not sending out here. and Your last talk screen was negative, you know for. Everything listed so you're good there. um is there anything else you want to talk about or issues or concerns."

724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean that's probably a conversation, for her."
4753.0,Patient,"Right right right right now, I just wanted."
724.0,Provider,"Because I don't know what she does for like the medication thing, but like. I know it'll be a month before you see her again. So."

Work on his. child custody. litigation, so will contain a mother, but our whole Katrina monitor that he'd like to get back to take care of himself good getting back in the gym but that's probably a tertiary goal at this point. Right now it's the the work and the childcare since primary focus still reports so constipation do the medication, we discussed in a group sorry. This past Monday and Dr mugler encouraged and it takes me relax that help. loosen is too so then we followed up is still no success at this point, but he's only been there for a couple days so that's not uncommon. No change in medication medication stable. As uds for 1214 which is most recent one was negative for listen substances. Positive for buprenorphine, which is what he's prescribed his pH Q nine was zero and his dad seven was a for middle anxiety and he captured was that to the ongoing childcare. issues with his ex and the start of the new job, but nothing that stands out nothing that's a detrimental to his treatment, thus far and that's it Thank you."
