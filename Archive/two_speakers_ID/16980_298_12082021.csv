16980.0,Patient,"I only i'm off. i'm off abilify it's out of my system and i'm having meltdowns. I am really very overwhelmed and i'm. i'm diving deeper into the black hole of depression. I found out that I had a home invasion, about a year and a half ago, and I was the one that helped them in in hostage until the COPs came. out. So i'm trying to deal with looking over my shoulder. But me, I mean. I just find that i'm just. On abilify I was doing Okay, but it was making making weight and. I, for everything that i've been looking at what the inner you know, maybe add not ADHD but add I fall into and also fall into bipolar. I I am. I didn't even get I didn't get up until 1230 because that's what my dog finally woke me up. Some sleeping more than I normally would and I don't have any interest like usually i'm OCD in the sense of cleaning and laundry done houses and I just it's been over a week since i've done anything. I just put everything aside and not wanting to deal with anything."
298.0,Provider,"What do you want to do, do you want to go back on an Anti psychotic."
16980.0,Patient,"I, I know I need something. Do the only reason why I stopped taking abilify is because it would I was gaining weight. In this last week I I think I worked at once, where I was working out on a daily basis, yes I. I was 10 and a half miles. With no longer. Okay, go ahead."
298.0,Provider,"And the longer that we don't treat the depression, the deeper, we can keep going down."
16980.0,Patient,The black hole.
298.0,Provider,"I have some newer anti-psychotics that I like i'm one of them being re lar You can write these down and email me if you like, any of them my my two favorite when we're looking at treating my number one favorite when treating depression would be re lar the are. A why."
16980.0,Patient,We are a y.
298.0,Provider,la r.
16980.0,Patient,l he told me about that one and that's also weight gain.
298.0,Provider,And then my next one would be like to de. la.
16980.0,Patient,"I took that once before, and I think. And it I don't know if they had me at a high def dose but it wasn't working wasn't. Doing. doing anything for me, and that was a couple years ago that it might brains change because of brain surgery. that's what I was looking at looked at. What is it. Oh concert concert. send a presser to."
298.0,Provider,"insert a you can't start out with that one just. Because it's the long acting Ritalin and insurance companies will pay for it. here's the problem. Yes, you could use some serotonin but if I put you on serotonin you run the risk of bipolar ness craziness so we don't want to trigger that Sarah to nurture type. thing and a mood stabilizer would treat depression. Like lamictal have you tried that. Next Neto write it down and."
16980.0,Patient,How do you spell it.

16980.0,Patient,la have a thyroid problem my cholesterol so high.
298.0,Provider,"So, are you going to go to your regular provider about that thyroid. yeah okay that's the ideal."

298.0,Provider,And you're a little low on your full eight yeah so you'll get some you know B vitamins get some full late that will help with your nerves getting that i'd also suggest some vitamin D.
16980.0,Patient,"vitamin D 5000 milligrams right now. I used to always do, but will be 12 shots in my clip."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
16980.0,Patient,I don't have that prescription.
298.0,Provider,Okay. um. Why don't you look over those like three four medications look at the possibility of weight gain with them it's not that it's probable it's possible anytime that you really deal with an Anti psychotic it's it's pretty much possible now lamictal it might be too gentle and. It might be too like it's doesn't work fast enough for what you're going through. But um let's go ahead and do some research on those and then email me and we'll have that conversation again.
16980.0,Patient,"Okay, why. Are these things that will also trade, a lot of the add that I have."
298.0,Provider,"I don't want to treat ad. Until we get a little bit more control of that depression and then i'm not against treating the the how they call it is ADHD inattentive type so everybody has ADHD now and there's three different types, you yourself are saying that your inattentive type I did look over your. information that you sent us, so I. Think it's worthy of us going down that road, as far as treating it, but I you've got so many ptsd symptoms right now."
16980.0,Patient,I know.
298.0,Provider,That I could make your ptsd worse by treating your ADHD. So I don't want to do that.
16980.0,Patient,"No, that makes sense I just you know that's why I use my professional. Your right hand to help me get. Through this. chaos."
298.0,Provider,"um I agree i'm thinking. A mood stabilizer would be an option first stop my first choice would be an Anti psychotic it can be very hard to get insurance to pay for re lar lead to death, I don't think it has as much of a weight gain but look it up and then right."
16980.0,Patient,"I will, and I, I have an appointment with you on Friday."
298.0,Provider,cool cool that's great let's keep talking them.
