1710.0,Patient,Brittany mouth 726 87.
431.0,Provider,"All right, how can I help you."
1710.0,Patient,"I was called into work this morning and I had to go in, before I could have like five, this morning I had group at nine and I didn't realize that Dr Malik did not have any other groups other than the one group. join a different one but they said he didn't have any other groups so."
431.0,Provider,"till next week, the same time. No problem, so you missed the due to work. yeah okay um it wouldn't be something that they're going to schedule you for next week, or is this just a one time."
1710.0,Patient,"Like I just started this job like a week ago. And I told him anytime I can pick up some extra. hours to call me, but now on and off to do that on Monday he's like. yeah."
431.0,Provider,"For sure well, congratulations on the new gig this is. yeah right."
1710.0,Patient,"greatest but it's a job, like anything I can get right now so."
431.0,Provider,"Oh, I like your attitude that's great so let me see you were last seen um the 13th last Monday. yeah okay."
1710.0,Patient,I see manny lastly.
431.0,Provider,huh.
1710.0,Patient,For one on one I did my one on one I did every like i've been compliant with everything. Exactly.
431.0,Provider,"you've been compliant um so I can definitely get a bridge prescription in for you today, however, I think what i'm looking at is alright, so I can definitely get you a script that will get you to next week, for your appointment. But what I can do, based on kind of our system. Because of the missed appointment people there is a little flag that basically says, I will give you the full quantity but the night, it has to be shorter duration, so what I will do is called the four day supply. plus a refill get you to next week and the day after, based on our policy, so you do have to go twice. before your next webinar. And once you go to your appointment again like the doctors can prescribe whatever quantity they think is most appropriate for you. Does that make sense. yeah that's fine yeah it's just your you sound very responsible but there's definitely patients who need extra incentive to come to appointments and. show up. So that's why we are these things are put in place so it's you know again i'm just going with what the system is asking, so my I have two questions for you, two and a half ago when was the last time you took your dose."
1710.0,Patient,Yesterday last night about.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, what are your loss pill. yeah okay in the other night, and I see that, like I just don't want them to be more than two questions i'm sorry, but you are on the buprenorphine the locks on eight dash two tablets Is that correct yeah and how do you take it."
1710.0,Patient,orally unready the song.
431.0,Provider,twice a day. yeah. Okay yeah. Sorry sorry I didn't.
1710.0,Patient,"um I always. Ask morning in the morning evening. Okay. Do I take it before sick, but I work late last night and I didn't take it with me, so it happened to be six o'clock last night."
431.0,Provider,"it's Okay, I mean the way the medication works is that it is in your body for a pretty long time, I think, so I would say after you take one pill. After a day and a half, you still have about 50% left in your body so feel hopefully that's some sort of reassurance that it's not like running out, so you always have a little bit That said, any issues with with sprawl are creeping."
1710.0,Patient,I mean. yeah.
431.0,Provider,Tell me more.
1710.0,Patient,I guess basically like I started sweating or. diarrhea nothing like that yet.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, nothing yet right now, no with symptoms Okay, what about cravings or relapses."
1710.0,Patient,"Now. Okay, I mean i'm i'm starting to crave a little bit right now, like."
431.0,Provider,I know we're talking about it so much.
1710.0,Patient,"yeah well just knowing that she was a woman, this morning, like. Not knowing you know I mean I was freaking out like oh my God not really aligned medicine now."
431.0,Provider,"freak out. don't freak out, we have a process in place, you know just to get make sure you have enough medication to your next appointment, especially for somebody like you, who was responsible and tried to do the right thing, so I can definitely get that called in any other use of illicit medications. methamphetamine smoking marijuana yes."
1710.0,Patient,smoke cigarettes.
431.0,Provider,You smoke a cigarette. Smoking a.
1710.0,Patient,pack of a.
431.0,Provider,Pack a day you know what super expensive isn't it.
1710.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
431.0,Provider,"I don't know I haven't checked the prize, but I remember it not being too cheap. So."
1710.0,Patient,"I bought they went up there, like nine something."
431.0,Provider,Like every time you buy the price. um any is that something you want to quit at some point.
1710.0,Patient,i'm.
431.0,Provider,gonna have to ask.
1710.0,Patient,"yeah I need I need to, but it was I was trying to one step at a time, one thing at a time I didn't."
431.0,Provider,"You know I appreciate that and you're right, you know one thing at a time and honestly with this whole tobacco cigarette smoking it's really just a smoke that's bad for you. The nicotine part is what keeps you going back right so there's like nicotine gums and lozenges and what a patches all sorts of those things that can help with it. it's the smoke that's really the one that's bad for your health but i'm not going to belabor this point I agree with you one thing at a time, so if you're ever ready or want to talk about it, Dr Malik or myself. or your therapist manny i'm sure if any one of us will be happy to support you in that okay. Okay yeah i'm Okay, I see you have pulsar a family pharmacy on Jackson pipe okay. And what I will give you a gift what i'm going to call them right now and put a verbal order in for you, and this is a bridge prescription to get you to your next appointment On Monday I will do a four day plus one refill so that's a total of eight days. Does that make sense yeah yeah."
1710.0,Patient,i'll be good till through Monday next week.
431.0,Provider,"Basically, like we give a little wiggle room, because sometimes some doctors have a lot of groups and they can't get the prescription out till the next day. So that's kind of our policy to just do a little like four day plus whatever you feel so you get a full full seven days to your appointment plus one day after um let me do you want to wait on the phone, while I call the pharmacy."
1710.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
431.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to put i'm going to disconnect from audio and i'll come you'll see me, but you can't hear me and then i'll come back when it's called then. OK OK. hey Brittany. OK OK, so I caught your prescription in for four days, plus one refill to pharmacist Karen. She said they're a little bit behind right now so give it two hours. Okay yeah to go or just call before you go. yeah Okay, you have any other medication related questions Oh, that I can help you with."
1710.0,Patient,"No, I think that there amen."
431.0,Provider,"Okay, I have one quick thing is my new thing that i'm doing you know when you're taking your met your your pills underneath your tongue. swallow your spit at the end. Or do you spit it out, what do you do."
1710.0,Patient,"The pills, I do the films, I do not."
431.0,Provider,The pills you do spit it out.
1710.0,Patient,"yeah the films, I think it them and I was just the doctor that I was saying, at the time, told me not to. be told after yeah after I was done like after a step away, how many minutes, it was."
431.0,Provider,yeah five to 10 that's usually what.
1710.0,Patient,I do. yeah he said after the 10 minutes. He said 10 to 12 but after the 10 to 12 minutes to that I could just spit it. Okay.
431.0,Provider,"So that I i've been just asking, because sometimes people complain about a headache or just feeling a little nauseous and that's from swallowing the medicines. Even whatever is left in your mouth, so when you put it underneath your tongue, it does get absorbed that way. And that's how the active medication needs to be absorbed when you swallow it it actually doesn't work that well when it's your stomach it just gives people a ton of side effects so i've been just kind of loosely asking how people are taking it. I generally tell people, to put it under neath their town tablet or film five to 10 minutes, some people find a taste. intolerable, but I agree with you, maybe 10 minutes is safer just to get everything absorbed but then like, meanwhile, you know don't your drink or talk, but then even the spirit that is."
1710.0,Patient,been a long time.
431.0,Provider,"Okay. The tablets was the same thing, though, so like when you're done you if you don't have issues continue the way you are, but if you're starting to notice, you know any. Side effects just spit it all out and then rinse your mouth with water really quickly just spit it out again just to prevent any side effects, but if, but the just know that the act of medication has been absorbed even if there's like a little residual of the pill or. You know it's fine that that medication has been absorbed in your mouth does that make sense. So all right well your mother is called in to hold her family and, hopefully, I, like you, but hopefully you don't have to come back in next week."
1710.0,Patient,"No, no."
431.0,Provider,"Go tell your work, no Monday."
1710.0,Patient,"Well yeah i'll do it that was my mistake I just thought this morning when they call it, I was asleep and i'm like yeah i'll come in. Not even thinking it out rude. I once I got to work, I was like oh no well. Like i'll see if I can join a different group or something I know they could even put me in a different doctors were if I didn't like I didn't care, but they said no, like they didn't like to do that and. All that stuff so I was just like okay well what I don't know what to do and."
431.0,Provider,"No, no, you so the general process of people ever miss appointments, the fact that you haven't come through that much that you don't I mean actually you've been with us since what so you've been with us before did you come back."
1710.0,Patient,"To our program yeah i've been i've been with this is like my third trip with you guys, which I was coming I came the first time for like a year and a half, and then I left I relapsed I left and came back like. will say I don't know November, December or something. I wasn't back very long at all and I got picked up on that three year old warrant and had. One meal so. yeah. I didn't even know, I had the war or I went to a pair of it, like, I was playing it was no reason for me not to take care of it, but because I was going on it so long, the judge didn't give me much of an option, it was pretty much you're going to jail for six months so. yeah I came home when I was fine for like a month, and then I was like I slipped up a newspaper, and I was like I knew right then like get into the doctor says you're going to be on heroin, with no time."
431.0,Provider,"yeah well. Third time's a charm and I see you been really been, since you came back in August it's been mostly green we just do colors so you've been in the morning, I know."
1710.0,Patient,"I think one week I missed group, and then I missed Group and yeah."
431.0,Provider,"yeah so just you may already know this like repeatedly missing groups does get your prescription shortened but you know, our group is where you would come through if you miss an appointment, then we can definitely help you with just bridging you to the next appointment to the. doctor's appointment. But again it's there's a lot of value just being a doctor malik's group, especially with other therapists so you know Keep up the good work and your mentor and yeah. Have a good day.
