214.0,Provider,hey Alex how are you.
9619.0,Patient,Good are you.
214.0,Provider,I am great thanks for coming on so what's been going on what's new.
9619.0,Patient,"i'm. Basically, just. moved not too long ago at the beginning of the month."
214.0,Provider,"Right, you had the whole family helping out right. yeah yeah."
9619.0,Patient,"that's about it, I mean my jobs stayed the same, which kind of sucks I had to be transferred. I wanted something new, or I am still looking for something I guess that's, the only thing. that's been like. bothering me is like I just feel burnt out of my job."
214.0,Provider,And what is it that you do again.
9619.0,Patient,work at a restaurant like. In the front of the House so like I do with the customers.
214.0,Provider,And you couldn't get a transfer you couldn't get another position.
9619.0,Patient,"Now yeah I had to transfer because I couldn't find anything like a new job time over here because it's like how far it is from where I previously lived. So. Now it's just been. yeah i've only been there for I think today would be my third day later and it's just yeah I just feel burnt out like, especially when I get home I don't know it doesn't make me feel great working."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and is it is it just the atmosphere, or this isn't the passion that you thought of when you were going to have a job."
9619.0,Patient,"Why been with the company for like two years. Now, and what's the name of the company, if you don't mind me asking second have an idea of what. mendocino farms."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, do not know that Okay, but it's a restaurant i'm assuming right."
9619.0,Patient,yeah sounds like it's kind of like in between like fast food and sit down at that.
214.0,Provider,"sense yeah absolutely Okay, and so, what do you, what do you think you want to do with this, I mean it seems to be. I don't know Probably not. coming up with you know, a value and it's it seems like it's it's deflating you So what do you, what do you think your moves are."
9619.0,Patient,Oh no i've always kind of just hot around like. i've never like done the same job. Back to back if that makes sense. I worked retail I worked in the factory I worked with kids and then food so.
214.0,Provider,You got an array of experience. yeah can you do anything with all those tentacles and focus on something primary utilizing all those skills you learned.
9619.0,Patient,I want to yeah I mean i've been sending out like applications and I don't know I feel like a big problem with me is like I. I guess I consider myself like a mass man.
214.0,Provider,"Like I know why why, why do you feel that I did you have experience working with kids before you work with kids."
9619.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,Did you have experience in the factory before you worked in the factory.
9619.0,Patient,"No, not."
214.0,Provider,"have experience in retail before you work retail. So don't say you're not in the master of none, it sounds like you're the master of a lot, the problem is is like. I kind of see it is like so where's my place like Is this the way it's supposed to be, are we not supposed to enjoy what we do, or is it upsetting to realize we just don't know what our passion is I mean is this something wrong with those two statements."
9619.0,Patient,"Now I guess that's, the problem is i'm trying to still find out like what the hell, I want to do and what i'm passionate about."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but it leisha doing it from work and not from your bed right because it isn't there's an alternative to be in deflated where. We feel hopelessness and we don't feel like doing anything, so I think the idea here is, you know now you have to spend some time on on identifying an area, you may want to work."
9619.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"You could you can continue to collect the paycheck. Until you find that or. start to figure out like what all these skills tell me i'm good at sounds like people people people person jobs, this is just skill. You know. Have you thought about like taking. like an online free online assessment about you know what what my what my life looks like in Korea with the information i've given it."
9619.0,Patient,"Think i've done that, before no."
214.0,Provider,"yeah you can go out, you know I want to know my career and it will be like 10 questions 20 questions there's once you pay for their like 100 and Dave really accurate, but like get an idea listen, this is my seventh career i'm never happy. And I went I went from sweeping floors to running unions to be in body God. to law enforcement to the American Red Cross running facilities not back as a therapist so I get what you go through. But I find it adventurous, and I never believe i'm not going to find something i'm just i'm easily pacified and I feel the job is mundane. It doesn't provide me anything, and then I say okay so what's your next step and I just take an action plan to know this is impermanent what i'm trying to do is going to launch me into the next one, so it sounds like you deflated about it, though."
9619.0,Patient,yeah I guess i'm just i'm just wanting to get out of there like as quick as I can just because it's.
214.0,Provider,"Do you not want to work in the food industry, or do you want work in the floor."
9619.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to."
214.0,Provider,yeah you will afford not to be at work.
9619.0,Patient,I don't know yet that's the thing since it's still like. New or where we're at you know my wife. I won't find out until like she gets her like financial aid or student loans. So that's why I have to keep.
214.0,Provider,"Going good. I mean it's a responsibility don't we shouldn't frown upon it just doesn't feel good, but we shouldn't. frowned upon I mean that's a. that's a pretty admirable thing for husband to do he's going to make the bread and butter and why, whatever your wife is focusing on for the benefit of your relationship you're allowing her to do it. It just doesn't feel warm and comfortable, but you also have to be a little proactive about what is it that you want to do, although you don't know you got to start somewhere."
9619.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've been sending out applications to different places, but. yeah I just wish it would move a lot faster."
214.0,Provider,"Now, unfortunately this 10 million people looking for work so like. You know, like this isn't. Although they keep saying everybody, you know employees can't find people, but every time you apply there's no responses, so I don't understand. What what what they're telling us versus what everybody's going through, because everybody's going through the same thing they're sending out, you know 2030 resumes a day and, at the end of the week, they haven't heard back from one. So I think there's just an abundance of everybody trying to do something and just you gotta keep in there you gotta keep throwing your line in the water ocean, let me catch anything right. yeah how's the medications been."
9619.0,Patient,um. I think. well. The. I didn't I haven't taken out all the past day or two just because I found it like giving me anxiety at the new work place. I don't it's probably where my head as the night but i'm not sure so.
214.0,Provider,"make sense, this is a stimulant So if you have, if you have a little anxiety you take out of role you gonna have a lot of anxiety. it's gonna kick it up yeah it's exactly what it's going to do all right, what about the wellbutrin."
9619.0,Patient,"wellbutrin. yeah I don't know. I never. I think it's working like I said i'm not, I think I told you before i'm not sure if it's doing like what it's supposed to do, or if it's just where i'm at but. yeah."
214.0,Provider,"I mean that's. Fair enough. yeah Well, we know it's not hurting anything I sometimes medications make us now feel good we feel zombie it out. Like I don't like the way this feels at least it's not doing that."
9619.0,Patient,yeah it's not making me feel bad by any means.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's look at your surveys, the one was the pH Q nine for depression it's out of four do you think that's a good. resemblance of what's going on."
9619.0,Patient,At a four.
214.0,Provider,"Well, I know you scored four which is mild. or minimum minimum depression."
9619.0,Patient,"yeah I guess that's accurate. I mean the only reason I feel like. Well, I don't know I don't really feel depressed it's just kind of. I don't know I can't put my finger on the word but. I just feel like tired and wanting like I said to be somewhere else."
214.0,Provider,"Right so i'm going to lead the question but it sounds like hopelessness like I don't know. i'm gonna be stuck with this job forever like I don't even want to be here now thinking about it furthers more depressing. or frustrating right, it could be, you could be going to frustration which is causing you know that emotional distress and I get that Okay, and the anxiety, which is the gad is eight and eight is like a mild anxiety. yeah so."
9619.0,Patient,Thank you.
214.0,Provider,And what do you think that's about what do you think the the anxiousness is about.
9619.0,Patient,um I mean it probably stems from the frustration and. Like yeah I don't know just. yeah wanting yeah the wanting to be somewhere where i'm not and then thinking too much about it.
214.0,Provider,"Right, so that you've just identified the anxiousness. Right I get it, but. i'm not saying you're not doing this, but instead of being anxious and I know you sending out resumes figure out if there's anything else that can preoccupy your time to launch you to your next position or your next employer. You know cuz sending out resumes one part but you know that's that's probably not enough so you have to figure out and you may want to figure out what what is it that you really interested in and you still may not know that's not a bad thing. But we know we don't like. We don't like our current employment that's a fact."
9619.0,Patient,Right yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Okay um Let me take a look at something else how's your wife, think about all this."
9619.0,Patient,"I mean she's like my well yeah she's with me like. With what I want to do and supports it so she agrees that if I didn't you know, have to. Go that I shouldn't let since we don't know I just yeah."
214.0,Provider,You got it you got to have BERT one in the hand instead of telling the Bush don't do something that's going to avalanche more anxiety and depression.
9619.0,Patient,And yeah.
214.0,Provider,"don't do knee jerk reactions that's pretty dangerous. looks like you haven't had a medical follow up on on August, you had a medical follow up. Overall, how do you think you feeling with the move."
9619.0,Patient,"I mean the move itself is nice it's a good change of atmosphere, I mean i've lived in southern California my whole life so moving to northern California, which is like six seven hours away. Yes, it's a nice change and I guess really hasn't hit me yet. Fully that like I don't have like my friends here my family. But i'm sure it will soon, but other than that, I mean it's been Nice."
214.0,Provider,I think the only strategy that you need to figure out is like What do you do with not being happy right.
9619.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"that's the unknown answer to this equation, and I think you're just gonna have to be more proactive and figuring out like you know what, what can I do other than resumes. And, and instead of sending out resumes and feeling like nothing's happening, maybe you need to identify one area. That you hit with resumes instead of being like oh yeah i'll do that yeah i'll do that and before you know it is just applying to an array of different positions, but with no real focus on one. And that could be causing some anxious and still. I definitely recommend going online and Google and you'll be you'll be very surprised to see what it tells you."
9619.0,Patient,yeah and what like.
214.0,Provider,What would I search. A hold on i'm gonna do that right now I haven't done this for a while um. If you just put in in this in the search bar link to I want to figure out what Korea like. there's just like a plethora of quizzes.
9619.0,Patient,there's already make sure to do that.
214.0,Provider,"No, no really cuz i'll be honest with you, I know people don't believe in this stuff. But if you if you take five of them I bet you three out of five will tell you the same thing, this is the area of focus and then maybe it'll it'll spark something to say you know what maybe this is instead of just like casting a wider net hoping to catch all the fish. Maybe I need to combine a little short and concentrate on one area. Because that may provide better benefits for you."
9619.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,Very cool and do you remember our next session.
9619.0,Patient,um I have it in my calendar.
214.0,Provider,For me it's. possible.
9619.0,Patient,"They put it for a month. No, it put it for one day."
214.0,Provider,it's a it's a Wednesday at 9am.
9619.0,Patient,So saying.
214.0,Provider,"is okay so it's the 20 nights already sets and you calendar. So it's the 29th at 9am and we'll see what this brings you and then we'll have that conversation again and see where we're at but I get it, I get it it's. Not what you want to do, but remember when you're getting ready to go to work and you're driving there you're already starting the negativity. And the link is on the whole thing guess what you bring that back home like it's consuming you try to figure out how not to let it consume you."
9619.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"All right. So then i'll See you in group, I would agree with the Admiral hold off on the outer wall. Until that doesn't create my anxiousness and then we'll figure out what."
