480.0,Provider,"have no idea, I think it was viral um I actually talked to a friend who doesn't live by me, but her family had the same thing I had like two weeks prior so it's probably something just going around."

She said the other night that did I notice anything with my drug tests and i'm like what are you talking about and I said, nine and then she said well had oxy in not so well or not, but then she said that it was blurry. And she couldn't really see it, and I was like well I didn't you know they all look the same to me. Ever since I started. yeah and when I started and done all the blood work and stuff you know, and I know I had drugs in my system and said, I did not have drugs in my system so. Again, she sent me a new one, but I haven't got it yet so we'll do another one and, but that was the maintenance, I mean it wasn't anything accusatory or she wasn't. ugly about it, but you know she asked me did on notice anything and i'm like well, no. yeah so I don't know but."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and it's fairly common to have false positives like that, especially if the pictures aren't clear, so I wouldn't worry about it, you know if you. Know you're not."
11146.0,Patient,"yeah you know, and then to you know you just say I did it, you know and whatever.

480.0,Provider,plan.
11146.0,Patient,"Right and i'm looking around and said, did I do this, yes. I did I. Did."
480.0,Provider,When my favorite people watching places like. let's listen it's so fun.
11146.0,Patient,"One girl, and I told my daughter my daughter was exhausted, you know it's a long day they started before nine. She spent the night with her The night before. And they worked on her valves for her her man, and so my daughter spent the night with her at her mother's house and another breads the matron of honor and my daughter and brad spent the night together Friday night. After we done rehearsal, and so it was a long night for my daughter to and day she's tired, but I told her after they did the toast I said. She want me to the car because I knew it was time for me to go once they start dropping down on the floor and."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
11146.0,Patient,"girl or drunk and the guy was drunk and i'm like I got. yeah a. I said. there's a girl up there and she's got on same color dress as you, but she has no garments on under the dress it is skin tight spandex and I said because of the light come through. In this barn we were up in the attic of barn. And I said. To my daughter had noticed it. because she sees card. Right, he can sit down after the days make i'm just deb our face I knew, she was tired. Plus you'd had a few drinks, they were drinking my most was getting ready doing hair makeup and loosen them up before the ceremony, so they started early to my daughter is not a drinker. So when you start around tna bye bye bye to most people are probably done even on champagne and orange juice. So my daughter definitely was, but she she held up but she's not out there dropping it down on the floor and everything but I said so when we went to the course you need to yeah see that girl, but she had come with. She was co workers with the bride and they all work together and at a spa you know she had the perfect body and everything, and I said yeah i'm not judging a bit because, but I think I would have worn garments under my dress but hey you know you do what you want to do and."
480.0,Provider,"Well, the thing is she probably didn't know that it would see through with the lighting, so if it were me and her shoes I would want someone to tell me that you know."
11146.0,Patient,"well. drunk or not, and I would say, they were all pretty john about about seven I wouldn't I don't know because I could have went to wait, you know you go up somebody and say. You know I don't know how it could have went Okay, but then again what would she have done she she didn't have."
480.0,Provider,Anything with her so.
11146.0,Patient,"You know, and then you not want I don't have to drive around or you know and in a I don't know but. That was memorable and then."
480.0,Provider,The highlight.
11146.0,Patient,"Of. My my dad sister i'm which same Father different mothers and her daughter got married and we were all invited um but like it like again I said, you know. We just never were close even my father wasn't close with them, because of the age difference. Because."
480.0,Provider,"Sorry, my dog."
11146.0,Patient,"they're the same age as me and my brother by a year or two difference, but her daughter got married and we were invited, but they got my father to make the arbor for her wedding so you take it down there. This grand estate down in Virginia, I mean hundreds of acre place. yeah. And they had it all weekend and. They took my brother was she told my brother, the daughter so. I mean the girl that's getting married. My aunts daughter told my brother, that it was $12,000 just for the venue. did not include it included the the property and they had houses for people to stay at on the property cabins, but it did not include like food."
480.0,Provider,Nothing like go crazy.
11146.0,Patient,"No band no flowers none of that so they had the rehearsal dinner there the wedding people stayed there. But anyway, we get down there Friday my dad and I we we give them the arbor and. first thing that my aunt tells us we haven't even got out of the truck yet to get the arbor down and set it up yeah the the matron of honor and a bridesmaid have been kicked out of the wedding and I was like oh my God. She said yeah over some drama so that's all she said I don't know if it was because her daughter kicked him out. of her wedding or the girls quit on because of I don't know she didn't elaborate and I didn't ask them more because. At this point, she hit us with that we hadn't even got out of the truck so we're trying to get things set up then she wants to know for coming was they done told us it was gonna be almost 200 people there, so my my dad's in his 70s he's not going even though he's been vaccinated. Because my stepmother has dementia she can't walk. Far and you know they weren't going in and I said i'm not going because I had to work that day. and But I would have been down there helping them all alone, but they don't ask they've never you see the the non closeness of the family she's never included me she needed my help down there that day and all. weekend and I would have loved to fail, that she's never. She had nobody down there to help them."
480.0,Provider,hmm.
11146.0,Patient,"And, and it hurts but i'm Okay, with it, because that's how the relationships been my whole life with her. yeah she her mother died when she was a little girl and. My grandfather my dad's dad I guess baby. Her and give her whatever she wanted her alive, because I guess he felt guilty for mama died, but she's just she's always just had that hardness and coldness tour and. I don't know it hurts me but i'm okay with I mean I probably carried part of that, along with like her grandmother doing the different Christmas gifts and stuff. You could tell for me and my brother that we we weren't the same or ever how that made me feel and I felt it again Friday, not because he created me like that, but just because I sort of understood that she really needed me there, but she still wouldn't ask me."
480.0,Provider,"To do die and that's how like it's so interesting when you can see, in other people how clear of a trauma response that is you know. it's not about you at all that's her a trauma response, a very common one, is not being able to ask people for help, even when you desperately need it. I feel like examples like that are actually I like when I have situations like that in my life, because then it proves to me that it's not personal it's not about me that's their own stuff their own trauma response."
11146.0,Patient,"that's how I always felt though until. Friday because, like I said it always made me feel. Like okay. i'm the black sheep i'm the drug i'm the one who had the Hispanic kids i'm the one i'm the one i'm the one i'm the one I own it okay always owned it whatever they said about me I owned it to their face I throw it right back up. But Friday I felt more in static towards her, I felt empathy because I knew. That I could I should have been down there helping them whether they whenever they think about me you don't matter, maybe it's all in my head, maybe it's not. hmm don't matter, none of that matters Member what I felt my whole life from that side of the family, what matters is I should have been down there helping them, and I would have liked to have been asked, but they did not asked me. yeah and i'm okay with that. i'm okay with."
480.0,Provider,"Really Okay, with it, like you."
11146.0,Patient,i'm okay with it.
480.0,Provider,Because huge progress for you.
11146.0,Patient,"It is huge progress for me because, like I said, my whole life, you know I just felt like they. And they probably did it wasn't all in my head, I know I know that yeah way before I did drugs, when I was a little girl, I remember all that stuff there's no amount of drugs that you can do the unknown unknown that stuff. Exactly because it actually happened. So going forward from that. Whatever I did through the years to know myself, not only from that side of family other things in my life that was just a part of. You know not feeling. Self worth and not feeling good enough, but still owning. owning it to whoever. You know Okay, whatever yeah that's me yeah done that Okay, whatever and just kept. But that little piece of okay well, you are worth something, and you do have stuff to offer, and you are loving and generous and giving and con no matter if I can be a bitch or everybody can when you corner somebody or grow and have it in their face they're gonna bite back. yeah not that. i'm not the starter I don't start it. Right, I can finish it or or. jump in on, and if you if you jump me enough, but I never started. But you know I."
480.0,Provider,"think this is an important thing. to point out is that it's like you're starting to recognize that you're worth and your behaviors are separate right so. Again, if you get pushed to that point to where you're going to jump on somebody that's still doesn't affect your worth as a person it doesn't define you that's a behavior. That was triggered by outside circumstances."
11146.0,Patient,It is. And who can trigger you more than your family.
480.0,Provider,Because they yeah.
11146.0,Patient,They know our bank they know you know.
480.0,Provider,And yeah exactly.
11146.0,Patient,"that's, the first thing with me and my brother to when we get into it, you know he's gonna throw up my brother is a thrower up or in your face or. that's what i've always called him me and my mama he'll never let you from. get anything, therefore, a i've never asked him to borrow money because that's one of his biggest things."
480.0,Provider,You know he's gonna have like leverage over you then.
11146.0,Patient,"He tells everybody, he would tell everybody so now you don't know. I don't care what i'm facing and how much i'm not asking you. yeah but don't matter he still gonna throw it up in my face whether I asked him or not, if he knows something you know, but if he gives you something or does something for us he's just gonna throw it in your face my whole life. that's how we get my mama the same way that. My."
480.0,Provider,"My mama just want to hear that again teaches you not to ask for help, if you have someone. Sorry there's a delay on the audio I didn't mean to cut you off."
11146.0,Patient,"Right well my dad did it too, when he was younger, I mean he just. But I think the reason my dad done it more is. He had got a new family obviously a new why, and that was the main thing you know me and my brother. i'm not saying, my father didn't help me he did. At times in my life. But we could not go over there and ask for anything right, you know. Are we got we only come around when you want something or you know why can't you pay the bill, you know you need to get another job if you got more bills in your money you need to work another job and another job and and we did. You know, so you don't. But see going back to my dad sister my grandfather, because my dad would say failed her out our whole life and he did, I mean and it don't matter. But in comparison to the to you, you would see same thing, like I said, with my stepsister she getting the new car and all the clothes, I mean you'd say Oh well, you're just jealous and bitter no i'm not i'm just telling you the reality of it."
480.0,Provider,Right.
11146.0,Patient,"The fact it's there in your face like you know and then you're just supposed to say okay. Right well my mother didn't die, but you know my dad left us for another family, and you know i'm 12 years old, what do you want me to do. Exactly I do because there's nobody coming over here, to see if we have any food. there's nobody coming to see if the rents paid so obviously you blessed and you knew the state of my mother's mental health or whatever or it's deteriorated and you know she's not working, how do you think we're paying the rent."
480.0,Provider,he's not.
11146.0,Patient,"Nobody asked that. You see what i'm saying it was just like. don't ask don't tell what I started this therapy with don't ask don't tell and we won't not. Man Thank you know, but you really don't know and if you do know, then you're not doing anything about it, so it went that way and that's how it was and that's true because i'm sitting here hmm so. You get over it, you like you said, your survival mode you do what you can and. Now that's how it was today. What I have come two days later, as far as my aunt and okay my dad he called me yesterday and told me this her brother my aunt's brother, which is my dad's brother, but like I said same Father different mother. uh. He went down there had to pick the arbor backup. Because he took it he had to bring it back. So he went and got it yesterday, and she told him that. Her uncle which would be her mother's brother other brother, did they told them, they were coming to the wedding but they didn't come. So it is sad and I felt there again more empathy because you know we didn't go. We could have went. But it's just that. Just the non closeness of it. Whatever. And then I said to you know the women telling me that you know my Daddy was lifting a basket in you know Dino at the orphanage or whatever kind of bullshit stories they told me over the years and I couldn't say nothing to nobody about it because. You know. I guess that to that don't matter if it's true or not it's not for me to unravel the enigma enigma it was It made me feel like I said I was the whole life i'm i'm the black sheep and i'm paying for somebody else's whatever yeah but I can't blame them either, because my grandparents. All the way around on all four sides i'll have. forgiven them for whatever mistakes, they made because they didn't know either let's just leave it at that and I hope they can forgive me for whatever mistakes i've made and we don't carry it keep carrying it. And same thing with my aunt my dad sister and in you know, I hope that we could become close and it's, not because I haven't tried it with the years. it's just. I guess her whole is so big I don't know I don't know I just pray for. Not the will be like best friends, but you know that she could be open to. Having a relationship. anytime she would call me I can remember, I. Can you watch my kids idea. I never asked me to watch my kids and I have I had three children to. It she had a plumbing problem Mina can you send George up here and always always did and I told him don't torture nothing because she's a single parent, you know, whatever whatever and. Then I know I sounded like I said, my brother does i'm throwing it back up what I done I didn't do that to her i'm just telling you the things that I tried to do for and I never threw it in her face. yeah i'm just giving you like a little inside of the things that i've tried to do, but then I wouldn't hear from her again till she needed something yeah you know."
480.0,Provider,which then makes you feel all those things like you said.
11146.0,Patient,"That I said. My whole life I wasn't enough. you're not you're you're only a half of us like she needed some I didn't know. And, or maybe that's how I thought, and then it just made that chip on me or my wall that much harder to penetrate because I said okay i'm stand toe to toe with you because I am you know we are six foot tall women, so I can look you in your I am this family, just like you. might not have a master's degree. And all this stuff, but I am what you are, you know."
480.0,Provider,Are you really tall.
11146.0,Patient,i'm 511 cheers to. Our dads are six six. Great grandfather was six nine. we're all told.
480.0,Provider,that's so awesome.
11146.0,Patient,So what you know they say the older you get you shrink up but I guess so but.
480.0,Provider,hmm.
11146.0,Patient,I don't know.
480.0,Provider,So it sounds like this weekend just brought up a whole bunch of triggers from your past.
11146.0,Patient,yeah but not like a fit I felt different. This time.
480.0,Provider,Like a good.
11146.0,Patient,"Like I said, like I knew I should have been there, helping them. But they didn't they didn't ask me."
480.0,Provider,And I think that's important is your learning to separate you don't feel obligated to go out of your way for people that. don't restart and that.
11146.0,Patient,"You, it is because i'm the fix for every. fix me, but I can do, everybody else yep. And i'm Okay, that I can. Do everybody else is what i'm saying."
480.0,Provider,sign of healing is recognizing that. A This is like part of getting rid of codependency because you're recognizing that other people's needs don't have to come before your own.
11146.0,Patient,"Well, and see that that's where. that's where the does the journey begins. That that's it. you've you've hit it right there."
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So did you feel empowered and proud of yourself at all, or are you still just in that like observing processing phase."
11146.0,Patient,"I felt a little guilty, I guess, not saying that i'm this fix or of other people's problems which I just said, meaning. I may not contribute anything to people, maybe it's all in my head, but I i'm i'm a worker and on my helper and i'm a giver. So i'm Okay, that I didn't go down there and kill myself and and and not feel appreciated yeah. i'm okay with that. Good i'm okay with that and."
480.0,Provider,We already do coming from them.
11146.0,Patient,"The guilt is just because that's what i've done my whole life. Okay here. i'll give for something that I think that I was. Lacking that I had to do to get people to accept me when they it didn't matter two shifts or three dams what I give I give it all, and they still didn't like i'm okay with that. Because I don't have to do that."
480.0,Provider,"So the guilt isn't even necessarily guilt over how you did everything it's probably just guilt, because it feels different."
11146.0,Patient,"and new does. It does feel different and I don't know if i'm empowered by it, but i'm. i'm okay i'm Okay, that I did. Almost called or that night and our texts are nazgul say you know I can come down there and help you in the morning, but I said no i'm, not because I gotta go to work and i'm. i'm not doing. i'm not doing that."
480.0,Provider,good for you that's.
11146.0,Patient,"Huge she's had a year. To she didn't talk to me. Yes, good half she's got my number. Yes, good asked me how I was doing I know it works both ways. But it was always me calling her or initiate and over the years and she's got my number yeah. They don't they got it. They got it they don't like you know, like how it made me feel they don't need me then i'm Okay, but once I got down there, I saw that yeah she needed some help because i'm saying with her husband said door. And if any man had said this to me is that this is what her my ex husband said to her out there. hey she told me, she said that I didn't have to dress up come down there which I wasn't dressed up a war pair of jeans pair of boots and a shirt. I just took a bath had my makeup them not like today, but I did. She did not, and he says to her yeah. Her name is Carla Carla and had a bath in two days I looked at him I see ya cuz she's the mother of the bride and look around she's got all the work to do, she's making she's the little wow when people walk in little fairies are not going to show up and do this. yeah the place is great, but uh I don't see any people in here so she's been doing it, I know she has because I just done a wedding last weekend helped with the one, so you gotta go early and stay late and do in between the the people that you did pay to do their jobs. It don't just get done now, it could with with people on obviously a $12,000 venue. yeah you can make it happen, but that's the price that nobody that's the man that says, I write the checks. yeah if you just want to walk into a wedding that your daughters having and nobody done anything but show up and get ready and look like brand new money, then you go spend some brand new oh money some kind of money. you've got a bunch of things when they're making it happen the wow factor your daughter's vision to be. pulled all then somebody spending some money."
480.0,Provider,You know.
11146.0,Patient,"No matter what kind of you could hide it in the backyard, but for not a parent or a friend or a bride to have to do any actual Labor during the ceremony somebody spending some money. yeah that's the thing, where you say people walk in and they go wow well that wild call something."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
11146.0,Patient,"yeah I don't care what colors are or what kind of if you use fake flowers or real ones, or what kind of cake or food, you had. To set the decorations up Dom beyonds and all that is expensive and that's why they they leave that, for you know what what's your budget what's your vision, what are you envision that's one of the main questions they asked for the planners wedding planners, you know. Are y'all doing the in between setup and takedown not we're not doing that well that's gonna cost you ma'am Sir yeah right. don't tell me that she hasn't had a bath in two days."
480.0,Provider,"What would you have said, if you're glad you stood up for her, I would have been like. I would have yeah that would have been hard for me not to react to."
11146.0,Patient,"write me and my dad talked about it on the way back home, I said Daddy I said i'm so glad we left cuz I was gonna knock him out and that wouldn't have been good."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11146.0,Patient,And you really wouldn't have that. But she knows I took up for two so. Do we have 30 minutes or hour.
480.0,Provider,So i'm trying to message somebody they had scheduled. i'm somebody else at 1030 but i'm trying to ask them to reschedule that because I asked about the whole self paced sliding scale thing.
11146.0,Patient,Your last time.
480.0,Provider,"they're not doing it anymore, which means that you have to pay the same for half an hour or an hour, so I don't want to cut your hours short."
11146.0,Patient,"Or if you got somebody else and it's no discount then i'll go I don't need I can't tell what time, it is because i'm outside. And why my phone it don't show me the time."
480.0,Provider,Okay well i'm going to have them reschedule because I had scheduled you for a 60 minute so it's not that they're cutting your time short.
11146.0,Patient,"yeah cuz when I checked in this morning, she said I had 16 minutes, but I told my daughter, sometimes, though, you know they do what you just said, they do, and they put somebody else in there. yeah because you had already told me they do that."
480.0,Provider,"They do, do you need to go. No okay. Okay yeah, let me just messaged the person in the waiting room and i'll let them know we just have to reschedule. Okay i'm good now right. Sorry."
11146.0,Patient,What what comment just wanted to make sure it.
480.0,Provider,"wasn't my mistake, I had to check it it's 1033 so. We have until 11 because that was every all of myself paying clients i'm being very intentional about scheduling the full hour, since you have to pay the same amount anyways I want you guys to get the most for your money. So I wanted to check on the calendar, make sure I had scheduled you an hour make sure it really wasn't mistake, before I told them to reschedule. So we're good now."
11146.0,Patient,All right.
480.0,Provider,"So Okay, so all of this, so you ended up going down to the wedding."
11146.0,Patient,"We went to the venue because she. come over there, you know."
480.0,Provider,"Were you planning to not go at all, and then last minute you ended up going I guess that's what i'm confused about. No okay."
11146.0,Patient,"He had sent me a year ago, at least six months ago, a year ago, the invitation, this is been going on. um. You know. and I guess, we were going to go, so what I told my father, I said we'll go if the numbers aren't up cuz you know i'm still not have been vaccinated i'm waiting."
480.0,Provider,yeah my.
11146.0,Patient,I told you my sister in law took it. And she's one year older than. me and her second shot is this week. So i'm going to see how she does. I don't know if I told you that I thought I did.
480.0,Provider,You did yeah.
11146.0,Patient,"Okay, so she gets her second shot this week i'm going to see how she the first shot, she was just sure an arm of my father and stepmother have been. But if the numbers aren't you know. Rebecca kept saying huge glass over 200 people there and i'm thinking, this is not like the little when me and my daughter went to last week with 60 people that's on a big farm that can really social distance and they had it set up like that, too, we weren't on top of people."
480.0,Provider,And I want my my age that's Nice.
11146.0,Patient,"This place was definitely bigger but 200 people still is a lot compared to 60 yeah. So I don't. yeah I don't know how many people came. I don't even know if my father asked her. But we were planning to go and then my brother, said that he was going. On. And then, my father said, you know because of my stepmother not being able to walk you know, and it is a big property, even though. He could have drove right up to the where the wedding and reception we're going to be still we're talking about a building like maybe 100 by 100 it's a huge walking from one end, you know it's a maybe even bigger than that. And then we just decided, but she had asked him because you know their father my father's father and his sister and other brothers father, they all have they died, three years ago you there. yeah Can you see me okay. said, my battery me plug it up head dad said she didn't have anybody to make arbor for her so they asked my dad which would be her uncle. To make it. I guess yeah. And he did. And he had to take it down there and then you know, bring it back because. That was something like I said they needed people to do different things, and they just didn't when I got down there Friday they didn't have any people yeah. For amount of work that they would have had to have done the rehearsal dinner that night. To whatever decorating and and everything. It was only the bride so hence to the bridesmaids are now, not in the wedding so obviously they're not down there helping man, I saw I met the groom sister which she had a six month old on her hips so how much. Was she gonna be oh wow you know and i'm not putting down i'm just saying so, the bride."
480.0,Provider,Know realistically. The baby your lineage things.
11146.0,Patient,"yeah right, and so the groom's parents were there, the groom his sister and a baby and then my aunt. and her husband who wasn't gonna do anything and he Let that be no because he had his bath and he his job was to bring pumpkins down. That all he was going to do, he said he was along for the ride, and he was going back his truck over there, so somebody can unload pumpkins are like me and my Daddy live. Because. you're already saying that you're wiping out about them two days."
480.0,Provider,Even unload pumpkins.
11146.0,Patient,"know he wasn't gonna let him because he didn't know where they went, is why my aunt's holding inside and he's like Oh well, he's gonna get somebody to help him I look I laugh, because I was like well who's gonna do that."
480.0,Provider,Right.
11146.0,Patient,Is that the little fairies coming.
480.0,Provider,unloading joining fairies.
11146.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,So your dad must be in pretty good health if he's up in around and building arbours and.
11146.0,Patient,"He is he's 70 he's 72 and his knees, are not the best but yeah he's he's and he's got up now they told him he had a. his heart is an atheist, which he don't know if that's from the shot, because he didn't have a checkup last year. It could have been. You know, because of the whole shut down and everything he didn't go to the doctor last year they don't know how long is hard it's been an atheist, but the doctor told me they put him on blood thinner and that you know, he was fine. But I i'm the shot made my stepmother have a stroke, the second shot and she couldn't walk fail like six or seven times because I was over there that's."
480.0,Provider,awful no wonder you've been scared of the shot.
11146.0,Patient,I yeah i'm not. i'm not 100% but you know I don't know hmm.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm not a doctor, obviously, Dr Marshall has explained, all the reasons why you should get the shot. I just personal observations, it seems like the shot having the vaccine doesn't have the same benefits as it did, six months ago, like you used to be able to use your vaccine card. to travel and whatnot and now they're still making you do the test anyways so it's almost like what's the point at this point because you're not getting any benefits. Aside from like obviously. The benefits of having the vaccine. I think societal wise there might not be many. Benefits anymore to having the."
11146.0,Patient,"that's what they're hearing that the new research because, like we said along this is new for everybody, so they're still. The data still income, and so what what you just said is true if you take the shot last year, you can people are getting it this year, because we know that it does work it's it's fading out. But if you have coding, and you have not had the shot which i'm sure it could go both ways if you give blood, this is how they're tracking it your your body is still making the antibodies in your blood so. Because my neighbor, who was a school teacher and as i've been mandated get for. school teachers, we don't know why but anyway, she hasn't had the vaccine, but she had coded last year, and she gives blood regularly and she said they tell her that it's still making the antibodies so. But you're right if you had Cobra shot last year or whenever the first immunization come out you took it and then and you get Kobe this year's because they're saying that it's. not as effective it's. wearing down so you're better to get the vaccine now. I guess going forward against but it's still your with these new variants they're not."
480.0,Provider,"they're not not protecting yeah. Which is why I understand both sides like I am always. i'm somebody who I can see both perspectives and that's why I feel like everyone has to make whatever choices most comfortable for them, because there is also research showing that. If you have higher anxiety when you get the shot when you get coven you're less likely to fight off the bad symptoms so. right if you're somebody who's going to be super anxious getting the shot then you're more likely to get worse and symptoms, because your anxiety is affecting your immune system. Well, you have to look at the whole picture of it."
11146.0,Patient,"And now you know it's it's ironic to me, but who am I, you know. Finally, you knew and i'm not saying it's changed overnight, because it has not, but just dealing with someone who my whole life I dealt with mental health in the system and i'm talking about the system for mental health with people with no money or low in my mother and how they're treated. Now that's all you hear people talking about you know the the effects of this pandemic on people's mental health and what we're going to do about it all of a sudden, you know we're going to do something about all these people. And their mental health issues okay and i'm thinking well great great because, for what the other 5070 years those people were let's you know set them out on the front porch and Tom in the Chair, but you know really that's it yeah and that's really. Sad."
480.0,Provider,"Really really sad. And like and that's why it's. it's sad but also that could be a possible silver lining of this pandemic is people are starting to value mental health and. want to do something to help people like that's what the best thing from povich, in my opinion, is transitioning therapy and doctors appointments to Tele health because so many more people have access now. Right, so I do think there are silver linings that doesn't take away from the fact that. You know, it should have been addressed 70 years ago, but at least now it's being talked about and people have the awareness that they didn't have seven years ago."
11146.0,Patient,"yeah though adage of you know, put your big girl panties on and just fix yourself just deal with, I mean people did and that's the thing, whatever it took. secretively or whatever openly and that could go for anything, and not just drugs whatever people did yeah they dealt with it the best that they could. You know, because a nobody gets to share two or three dams man honestly. they're not going to admit that and say oh you're lying that's not it it just wasn't enough money wasn't this wasn't that that's not true yeah mental if you if you said you had an issue with mental health or you were labeled. black. Exact and I know because I had dealt with yep."
480.0,Provider,You had first hand experience.
11146.0,Patient,"With my mother and it was like you think asking for whatever and i'm not even gonna say that because a lot of people have to get gas, but you can't compare it to that I don't know, but if it was like. The most embarrassing thing, and here I am saying that we have this issue and we need help that."
480.0,Provider,Nobody cares.
11146.0,Patient,"not know and there wasn't any appropriations for it, I mean if it was it was the bear minimalistic I don't care what kind of insurance, you could have it was just yeah you might have could afford it a. $400 or $200 I our therapist or whatever psychiatrist I guess your subconscious would have cost more an hour and that and that's fine because they went to school, but. I just don't nobody had that kind of money man, you know and like again they said just deal with you, you didn't fix yourself. Here in the south, I don't know about anywhere else, but basically."
480.0,Provider,I think it was that that way everywhere.
11146.0,Patient,If.
480.0,Provider,"You don't acknowledge the problem then maybe the problem won't exist, which is so backwards."
11146.0,Patient,"Well, look at all the people that castrated I mean, and I mean. Now, just now, now they're going to give them alone money or their families, I mean what do you want me to do with that. I mean what What are those people supposed to yeah exactly okay well hmm. All right. That didn't happen oh really okay. I don't know I don't have dance. In the stuff with the cove it's changing daily so nobody has the answers like i'll say again, I think we have some of the smartest people in the United States working on it and in there, I can only imagine their burnout. And they're tired and. Obviously. You know there's no end in sight, I don't know I don't I don't know the prediction on that, but. Hopefully. It will even out, especially now for these children getting whatever and everything I mean because there's nothing really yet been approved, to protect them, and if it was. Would I as a parent i'm glad you know other than my grandson he's too, but what I really want to get my kids something, yet I don't know. Because we don't have."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
11146.0,Patient,yeah so I don't it's a it's a lot of things that. I don't I don't even know. hmm.
480.0,Provider,So when did you say sister in law. is getting here this week.
11146.0,Patient,"Yes, she gets her second dose this week i'm not sure the day, but I will definitely let you know, on that."
480.0,Provider,"Now let me know I I don't know if I told you this, but one of my best friends lives with me half the week. And nurse, and she got the booster on Thursday last week. Okay Oh, she was so sick on Friday. Like you're definitely ill, but it was like 12 hours and then she was fine, but she also had bad reactions to the first two vaccines, I never had any side effects from my vaccine so i'm assuming you did the booster i'll be fine."
11146.0,Patient,"If she said, I mean she is she young, like you, are."
480.0,Provider,"A year younger than me, so I am 37 she's 36."
11146.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
480.0,Provider,"But anyway. she's fine now she had it started with sore arm and then she got it later in the day Thursday so then Friday she's. that she didn't start feeling feverish until Friday morning like 8am and then she was pretty much in bed for half the day, so it was a good four hours of like feeling feverish and the body. aches and then she woke up and was out and about doing things and we ended up going to the amusement park Friday night so she was fine by Friday night, it was literally just like half the day Friday."
11146.0,Patient,"My um. Well, they haven't been tested, they were born today the my daughter's bride that the wedding we did two weeks ago they just got back from our honeymoon last night and went to Florida. But she thinks they have Kobe. You. know they didn't go to Miami they went to Orlando they went to Disney world they went to. You know the beach a couple days they just traveled around that on more the eastern side. um. But they were she said yesterday that they could not smell our take their food that was their only symptoms, they felt fine other than not being able to smell anything or taste their food."
480.0,Provider,"So weird how it affects people differently, because, like my only symptom was a headache and I never lost my smell or taste, I never had a fever, but I had like a massive headache for about a week when I have it. But that was it."
11146.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"So weird and then my kids never lost their taste or smell either, but two of my kids had a low fever for like 12 hours when they had co bed, and then that was it for them."
11146.0,Patient,well.
480.0,Provider,it's also interesting.
11146.0,Patient,"Well, most definitely its history, now because, like I said we're in I mean we are the guinea pigs, we are, because this is like you know."
480.0,Provider,history books.
11146.0,Patient,never been I mean they're recording it daily and it's changing daily the data just whatever.
480.0,Provider,You know. it's kind of crazy.
11146.0,Patient,"So going back. To the the. I had got a thing you know now we have to pay for the drug test that's $20 and they had said. When the email I don't know it verbatim I mean I read it once and I haven't looked at it, this has been maybe a month ago, so they send me an email, saying that the sliding scale for. For self pay a change in some things had you know come down it looked like in price and then stayed the same, so what you're telling me now is though it's gone back so doesn't matter if it's 3060 minutes or 15 minutes it's still $60."
480.0,Provider,"All right, which is why, with myself pay people if we don't have a full hour, I want to make sure I let you know, so you have the option to cancel."
11146.0,Patient,"Right, so I had my next one scheduled, and that is, is it the 27 remind me I don't have mom."
480.0,Provider,Let me look real quick.
11146.0,Patient,Steve 20 something.
480.0,Provider,"So I have it on my paper calendar, but i'm just looking in the bright heart computer because that's more accurate and I want to make sure that."
11146.0,Patient,it's an hour.
480.0,Provider,"it's an hour which i'm pretty sure I only have like three of you guys that are self paced i'm pretty good about remembering to do that. Okay, so next appointment is. it's thinking. individualize therapy the 18th. scheduled for 60 minutes on the 18th at 10am."
11146.0,Patient,"I think that's what I got maybe maybe. It is you're right okay good I was thinking, the 20 something that is the 18th. For one hour right."
480.0,Provider,"Yes. Well, good, so I will not see you in group, this week, but I will see you next week."
11146.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am. i'm about my journey to. me. I mean it's just."
480.0,Provider,I do have to say that I am incredibly impressed by how far you've come in several months.
11146.0,Patient,"well. I don't know that i'm impressed yet, but I have come to realize that I. was not put on this earth. Even though i've done it Nice and my life is to try to fix everybody else but. yeah. And by doing that I, maybe I thought I was going to help me but it didn't. yeah I gotta invest in me otherwise i'm not gonna be here to do anything."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's a realization that most people never get to even with the help of therapy so it's huge that you understand that and are changing behaviors accordingly. Big big stuff I mean it took me a good 10 years of consistent therapy to get to the point that you're at now. Part of it was my age at the time, but like it's just and I know you don't feel this yet, but it's coming in the next few months, the level of emotional freedom that comes with this change in perspective is huge so huge. Good stuff."
11146.0,Patient,"alrighty well, thank you, you made me cry Ghana."
480.0,Provider,"Sorry. Good tears, though. They did it in tears."
11146.0,Patient,It is.
