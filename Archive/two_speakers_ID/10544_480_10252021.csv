10544.0,Patient,And not really I get my first box this week and my best friend does it so she can kind of help me out with it and you just put I guess you just put one part into another port and then they pay you per box. thing is cool yeah. So that'll be some for some extreme now.
480.0,Provider,When do you start did you already start.
10544.0,Patient,"Now she told me to go up there, this week and give them my name, so they know who to paint that Christianity pretty much got me the job. Just because her husband works there and then she works for her husband works there, like in person, and she works at home and then she got me in that position so i'm gonna go up there, the next day or two and go give them my information and start there."
480.0,Provider,that's super awesome oh yay. so obvious something easy to do with the kiddos home. Neil is.
10544.0,Patient,"Because I was just going to go back to work, all together, because I didn't mind but. This."
480.0,Provider,was before. cna for work.
10544.0,Patient,Here Sadia. worked at the nursing home and then the hospital was the most recent world's working.
480.0,Provider,Did you like that.
10544.0,Patient,yeah it was just. hard on my body that's how the pain pills got a little more. got the addiction with them.
480.0,Provider,That makes a lot of sense.
10544.0,Patient,yeah when I was working better syndrome.
480.0,Provider,"And it's probably hard, because you have to distribute do you distribute manson stuff so then."
10544.0,Patient,"At one job I was the distributor. And it, I mean of course i'm not I can look at them and see they need in this and more than me but it, you know, so I never liked touch it or anything but just seeing it was very triggering."
480.0,Provider,Oh absolutely.
10544.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"That would be a hard job to go back to after being in recovery, I think. At least for a while."
10544.0,Patient,Right yeah I miss it just like. My old people at the nursing home like I missed them.
480.0,Provider,And the shifts are really long too that's hard to do with a baby.
10544.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah.
480.0,Provider,don't you normally have to do at least.
10544.0,Patient,10 hour shift.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10544.0,Patient,"And I used to have like 20 patients every every night during my shift I would have like 20 patients and you can't give the proper care like that, so I was always stressed and like because. We live in a. Town that you could literally there's to stop lights and my dad's like you could miss it if you blink. is so. We just don't have enough people as cna."
480.0,Provider,"Oh baby still sleeping good, are you still sleeping good."
10544.0,Patient,"I just started him on and he's still in the breast milk, but I started giving him the low applesauce and banana. Food in that it seems to hold over on stomach a little bit better sleep a little longer. he's only been waking up maybe once a night that's really good."
480.0,Provider,that's helpful for pretty boring.
10544.0,Patient,Pretty boy right here in the bedroom.
480.0,Provider,birdcage. comfy.
10544.0,Patient,I like it too that. I got a new recliner.
480.0,Provider,"know I love recliners. they're super calm. So, how was body image stuff going."
10544.0,Patient,"still struggling only because. it's really just everything so have I spoken you since his aunt asked me if I was pregnant again. So we were at his aunt's House in a couple weeks ago I was like I think it was like right after we talked. And I was feeling better about it and then we're at his dad's house and i'm standing there holding the baby was first time she'd met him. And she got she looks at me she goes so are you ready to have another one like are you how are you, Sir, you bout to have another one, and she looked at my belly and I went. No, I just I just had him it's just good Oh, and then later on Jesse was like oh she'll know she's talking about and then his brother told me that I still look pregnant. yeah and then Friday my daughter's per mo and my mom was here in my mom's here she's the world's worst about judging me and then my. daughter's grandma my ex his mom came to drop off le. stirrups are often when she she leaves my mom because she was staring at your belly the whole time. Like you didn't have to point that out."
480.0,Provider,"it's so frustrating, so I will say there's a generational acceptance or I don't know, whatever it was was not Okay, but that generation, it was okay to comment about people's bodies. Which is not the case anymore like I think most people our age understand that that's not acceptable to comment about someone's body period. But that generation, because I had some issues this weekend, with my parents saying comments jokingly to my friends, but like about their body in their weight and like that's not funny you don't do that that's not a day. And we were talking about. That yesterday me and my friends were talking about how it's so bizarre that people that age like even it's so interesting because. The society's norms are. Changing and people are getting better about not commenting about bodies and such but it's like that generation, they just don't care. what's happening with the rest of society they're still stuck in their own mindset so that's when you get a lot of comments it's from the older people, because it was normal. For them to comment about everyone's bodies, but i'm like well no wonder, so many of us have anxiety and mental health issues, because we grew up hearing you guys comment about every single thing someone else was doing wearing being you know no wonder we're also. going to go on ourselves."
10544.0,Patient,"Like I just can't imagine myself just saying Oh, that person was looking at your belly or look at your belly it's still experimentally, nobody asked my opinion, nobody asked your opinion."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and I think that's a big part of it, too, is that whole unsolicited advice right they think that. they're doing you a favor by telling you things you don't want to know it's like most of us recognize that. We have filters for a reason, if I have an opinion about something I can keep it to myself, I don't have to voice it to every person around me. And that seems to lack with that generation as well. And I think everyone from that generation it's just more concert."
10544.0,Patient,"Most of them. yeah I made her feel bad when, after she men.com and I was like you know I still can you and feel my belly mom and she was just like What do you mean and. I was just like I literally can't feel from the top of my belly button down to the jj. And she's like you can't feel like here, let me paint you as hard as I can, and she pinched my belly as hard as she could. And I could not feel it and she's looking at me and ask the entire town and then she was grateful that and I said no, and then after she let go that's when I started to tear up and she goes boring crap I was like because I can't feel it. Like not only. Is it, you know, whatever sticking out it's not that it's not, but I also just can't feel it and, like you, don't understand."
480.0,Provider,That scared. me feel a part of your body.
10544.0,Patient,"Right and. You know by. Right regular Ob keep saying, maybe you know the sensation come back, but she's also the one who makes the artery so. i've got to go see another doctor. She may just be telling me that just because you know, maybe she messed something up and show until mishima."
480.0,Provider,yeah. wonder yeah I would definitely get a second opinion because I wonder what long term impacts of not being able to feel your stomach would be because you can still feel when you have to pee right like.
10544.0,Patient,"Internal yeah I didn't feel. I can feel internally. yeah I could still feel internally and like if you put enough pressure on my stomach I could build inside is just if you run your fingernails across my stomach if you even. touch Masonic with a hand like if I see you do it, I will cringe and tear up because I can't feel you doing it, I can see you doing it's just the nerve it's like the nerve endings almost."
480.0,Provider,that's so that's got to be so strange to. notice someone's hand on it makes me.
10544.0,Patient,yeah so last night I was pulling up my underwear and I literally went and just he was like what's wrong I was like accidentally touch the day before the dead tortoise you know what I call them my my belly like it makes me just like whoo.
480.0,Provider,"Oh man you're getting so big. Oh, my gosh is oh yeah. it's like what am I looking at I don't understand."
10544.0,Patient,"Well, usually it's like oh. here's the call sissy. Start smiling. he's just like. he's getting so fit."
480.0,Provider,Or you know who says he is now yeah.
10544.0,Patient,"I didn't think like he would miss her, but like. The one day she went to her dad's or whatever, I called her, and I put him on and it just instantly like was grinning ear to ear, so he does."
480.0,Provider,recognize already that's cute. Very cute. So how often is she at her dad's.
10544.0,Patient,"three to four days a week, just depending on like I said, we have a good co parenting relationship like we split. Three well like I need him an extra day or he needs me an extra day. God just go back and forth."
480.0,Provider,that's super helpful. And he's three months now. you're gonna talk you're trying to talk.
10544.0,Patient,Making a slow who who noise lately just going.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my."
10544.0,Patient,tooth breakthrough down there on the bottom.
480.0,Provider,that's.
10544.0,Patient,"my daughter is broke through it two months, so I don't know if it's just my kids up early teeth, but it's, just like the little white bump you know that comes to a. lot of cool to do."
480.0,Provider,Even Farsi from it or not too bad.
10544.0,Patient,yeah that and drooling like crazy like. Most of his onesies kit you know drenched there down the road.
480.0,Provider,"So precious they can handle it, they can handle it What I miss most about that age is the little like ooh sounds and then the sounds when they're drinking or eating how they always sound like. They can catch their breath it's so."
10544.0,Patient,Every time I put him on this movies he's just like.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah I love that. And then they always like sigh in between. When they can catch their breath I like.
10544.0,Patient,It yeah. So you're starving your returns.
480.0,Provider,"Oh man so. When you have body image issues, what do you do about it, do you like restricting food intake or."
10544.0,Patient,"Are there any behaviors that correlate. This week I exercised by walking they have a park at the end of our road and i've taken jace either in the stroller in a little furnace or he's in front of me. Only about. Four days this week. i've been exercising like. More because I mean. Not not letting them win but also like hey I need to be healthier anyway, you know."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and walking is a good thing, because it's not over exerting so it's not like you're because remind me do you have eating disorder history. Okay, so with eating disorders, a lot of times the worry with exercise is when you're doing it only motivated by wanting to lose weight or calories right. So walking is a good start, because it actually is more about moving your body and feeling mentally healthy, rather than just like getting rid of calories. So that's a good thing and i'm glad you don't have eating disorder history because that makes. it much harder, after having a baby."
10544.0,Patient,"You. Think my biggest it's a little little triggering because when I was using like you know you lose weight and you're. You know, using ankles all day every day and that's all you want, and I was telling my spouse, that I was like I was like it's triggering because it makes me like what. You know i'm not going to go into that in my brain somewhere it's like you'll be skinny if you do this and I played the tape all the way through like i'm not going to, but I have to vocalize that in order to do it."
480.0,Provider,yeah which is. that's a really important thing to learn and i'm glad you know that is whenever you speak. Those kinds of thoughts out loud it takes the power away from it so.
10544.0,Patient,"I was trying to tell him that, like I don't know if that's the thing, but for me it is a thing."
480.0,Provider,Oh it's absolutely a bit.
10544.0,Patient,"If I say, then I will do it. You know it's like I said. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"yeah because part of the issue to with addiction is the secrets are what fuel the addiction to so it's like if you have this all in your head of like Oh, I could use, and I could lose weight, then the."
10544.0,Patient,fat or a.
480.0,Provider,"Secret is even more elusive so when you tell somebody it's like giving you accountability, but also taking the power out because, once you get it out of your head it's not going to spiral in your head anymore, you know what I mean. So, and then that's why I mean I tell people all of my crazy thoughts, because for me it's very therapeutic because, as soon as it leaves my mouth, it leaves my brain so i'm like Okay, if I want to get rid of this, I have to tell someone about it. yeah."
10544.0,Patient,"So that does make a lot of terms as soon as I say it. i'll come up with more reasons not to like this, but obviously i'm not going to because I have to feed the baby, I have to be here for the baby did it and so it's just. I talked myself out of it not. Not that I was gonna do it, and it was."
480.0,Provider,"very healthy. I like that. yeah your mom is still healthy haha yeah. Oh, I love it."
10544.0,Patient,"I do have a question on something So what do you suggest about family members, they you know where it active action. Like them coming around like not you seeking. coming up with you like. We have. His brother is an active addiction pretty bad and you stopped by the House, maybe once a week. But it's. I just don't like it like it's just always high."
480.0,Provider,"If it's triggering for you, I think it's perfectly acceptable to set a boundary like I don't think here's the thing with family members is. I don't think anybody can necessarily get anyone else sober or make anyone else us right so him coming over it's not going to necessarily lead you to us again, but if it's triggering then that's enough of a reason to set that boundary in the first place. and"
10544.0,Patient,"If he does it. Well, it can be a little bit to agree more so just makes me not want to see how. yeah Surely he looks but also don't want anyone else to think that i'm doing it because he said, you know really doesn't."
480.0,Provider,Sound bad it's realistic like. It is something you have to think about when you're in recovery is the people you surround yourself with does make a big difference. Does Jesse know that it triggers you.
10544.0,Patient,"yeah we talked about it last night he immediately was like well don't tell them to stop coming over here but it's his it's his brother so it's like. Like. I want to be there from but there's nothing we can do for like it started off with this given him money when he needed, and you know given given him whenever we needed and now like. We don't give him nothing, no. You know, but he's always stopping by asking it's just. Like last night he wanted. amp or something like that and i'm just always tough spot for dumb stuff. Like can I borrow your DVD player your. sound system something like something stupid. Does he ever get it back or the selling it for drugs. And the last one, he said he was going to get right back, it was a standard system for core and he didn't so we went to his house to get it, and he punched Jesse. And Jesse want to get X corps so that's That was the last time we live in, barley think, but he still he still comes around and, like last night. I was he was saying, some crazy stuff about how like people were out to get in and stuff and. I don't know, and I was like David like are you sure you sure that they are it's just in your head. And yes, i'm very paranoid. JESSICA, just like Taylor, just like let it go like well. I don't like I just wish he just wasn't around here, so I didn't have to deal with. I don't know whether it be nice to him to give him advice or to just let him think what he thinks and do what he does it."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah sometimes honestly setting boundaries, with people like that gets them to hit their bottom faster. yeah, which is a good thing, overall, like it's hard to do when it's family, but at the same time, the more you enable him to continue doing stuff like that, then."
10544.0,Patient,"I agree with my brother i've always been the one who people put the boundaries on healing my brother stopped talking to me that's that's when I hit rock bottom, because my brother's. Everything so that's. Good nice mean Jesse said he would like it's the last night when I told him, it was bothering me. yeah but. I was gonna I was like I know I have this appointment today so Matthew."
480.0,Provider,"I think it would be. Honestly, in everyone's best interest just to have that boundary for a little while and is and see if it changes anything or helps anything. So is your name Taylor Brittany."
10544.0,Patient,And I go by Taylor. I think yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,"cuz I know your email, it says Taylor, and then you just said Jesse said Taylor, and I was like. Your legal name is Brittany, but you go by Taylor."
10544.0,Patient,yeah it's Brittany Taylor.

10544.0,Patient,My mom was evil and named me or call me about my list my middle name.
480.0,Provider,People do that it always weird. me out i'm like why don't you just named the baby that for the first name.
10544.0,Patient,"yeah Linda noise it doesn't make us in everywhere, I go, especially nails adult read in there, like Brittany like yeah and then the horse advanced Taylor like you'd like to me and i'm like no it's just. they've known me since childhood so."
480.0,Provider,"funny. Okay, so I need to schedule November appointments for you. i'm. Tracy about. The groups. And she wants to keep you at weekly. And I don't have much. Fight against that, because she sees you more than."
10544.0,Patient,I do.
480.0,Provider,i'm so. With the job situation it's pretty flexible right because it's work from home. You don't have to like do phone calls and stuff okay.
10544.0,Patient,"And thank you for your email, this morning I didn't see it, it was like nine and I was like oh I don't know what tomorrow thing is today, and then I don't know it's like oh should be good."
