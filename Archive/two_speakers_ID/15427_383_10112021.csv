383.0,Provider,"And does it, are you able to like go for a drive or do you. feel like."
15427.0,Patient,yeah I really go for a drive and. Some some normal tasks and stuff it seems like that kind of sometimes drowns out the noise. yeah so sometimes that helps. behind other times it's hard to do some of those tasks as well.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. and You said it's been worse, the last six months. yeah Okay, and do you know when you first started hearing them. As the years that you've been struggling with us."

383.0,Provider,mm hmm. I noticed when we were in our appointment with your mom. When I saw you last that she she was seemed a little tearful about your your condition.
15427.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,You want to speak to that.
15427.0,Patient,yeah I don't know where that came from was she was just the first time i've seen that.
383.0,Provider,Did you ask her about it after we got off the color. Are you comfortable talking about how you feel about things.
15427.0,Patient,yeah well.
383.0,Provider,How do you feel about. The situation that you're in now.
15427.0,Patient,"I don't like it, because it's abnormal sounds normal for me. i've been successful in my career and had multiple companies that have started that have been successful running tech startups have multiple you know. amazing outcomes and had a lot of success in something like the highest and hardest. Industries it's a. Big companies. So this is very abnormal."
383.0,Provider,What do you think brought it on.
15427.0,Patient,"I don't know I think something to do you know neural so first of neural transmission or something something there, this is so abnormal from my previous behavior and what i've experienced i've never heard or seen anything like this before so i'm not sure."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
15427.0,Patient,"It was like something like neural link, but without the hardware."
383.0,Provider,So it doesn't seem like it's something from that has nothing to do with how you are living your life or what you've.
15427.0,Patient,"done or not done, I mean i'll be i'll be sober and clean up everything except for the continued a pen and coffee. Taking the prescribed medicine. And the voices so continue and they're distracting and harassing."
383.0,Provider,How long were you using substances.
15427.0,Patient,"I was drinking often. But you know i've been using some some substances for since I was you know 13 or 14 years old and never ever experienced anything like this, and especially not when i've got through sense of being sober and clean. For you know upwards of a year. and It really isn't any difference for me. Which is some limiting factors, you know. Look at all of that, in the second deluxe or anything like that. But uh yeah, this is just the same as abnormal. almost like a technology or something."
383.0,Provider,When was the last time that you drank heavily.
15427.0,Patient,about a month ago.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was your What was your pattern of alcohol use before."
15427.0,Patient,Drinking daily.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
15427.0,Patient,For quite a while.
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
15427.0,Patient,"yeah but I haven't been trained, for I think it'll be 30 days in a couple days."
383.0,Provider,Are you in any Program.
15427.0,Patient,I have a big book and i've done programs outpatient programs before i'm open to doing those and being you know more involved in like that community. mm hmm but I haven't been to any meetings or anything.
383.0,Provider,what's what's keeping you from going to a meetings.
15427.0,Patient,Nothing really except for just trying to to do the tasks that I need to do for work or just like catching up on some personal stuff which seemed to be hard because of like the distractions but really there's no excuse I could I could make meetings.
383.0,Provider,yeah it might you might feel that it might be supportive for you to attend some meetings you can even attend on to that.
15427.0,Patient,"yeah i've gone to like some more like church based things my sister was just involved with something called hope California, which is 10 different cities for 10 days straight in each city so she was a leader at the orange county one, so I went a couple of days, two or three days there. But just doing some stuff with family my sister is like. baptize me again in the ocean that was fun and interesting I just think like more spiritual connection which the a and then a community are based on Corinthians so it's a spiritual Program. I think either way. i'm getting i'm getting some Community stuff. At a meeting with this except accepted an award a while ago for diversity and inclusion, with the focus around technology from minority community, the African American Community. and One of the people that's involved that i've come to know is the economic advisor for the George with foundation so and we're hoping to support our next la county sheriff so just getting involved in some of that community stuff and focusing you know around unification. So those are also positive communities, I think. it's not just spiritual based or like substance based it's also like other other things. And I think that those are healthy as well."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Is this a relatively new involvement that you had, and these Community organizations."
15427.0,Patient,i'm. sort of but not not really. With like my my work in the industry that I work in we a lot of what the industry represents is diversity and inclusion and social equity.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15427.0,Patient,"So there's been involvement for quite a while, but now, with as much focus, I guess, this is current a recent."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay um. What are some of your concerns right now in terms of you know, you said you don't like where you're at."
15427.0,Patient,"physically I like where i'm at I mean. from a health perspective I gained weight, but I know that I can work that off so physically i'm fine with that has just been kind of laying low and spending more time with family but I don't like where i'm at in terms of productivity. Because of the set I feel like the Center issue. That I haven't quite figured out what it is yet."
383.0,Provider,Okay um. well. What do you think how do you think that therapy can help you.
15427.0,Patient,"I think it's an outlet, just to be able to share it to get a different perspective."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15427.0,Patient,"So safe place to do that. I think, trust is established over time, you know so like it's better than just like meeting with random people and trying to go into communities, because there's a lot of backstory to a lot of this stuff so. Consistent meetings with like person like I think the setup that you have with the group, just like for check ins and getting to hear other from other people, along with the one on one is good. format. And then hopefully like just be able to like. better understand what's going on with me so that can be you know either diagnosed or. Or you know stopped if it's something else I don't know what it is exactly yeah."
383.0,Provider,"um well good i'm glad you're open to therapy and. You know, seeing how it can help you um. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others in the last since we last spoke. Have you been getting out and doing exercise and taking care of your body eating well and so forth, since."
15427.0,Patient,"you're eating well yeah. There was a friend of mine had a wedding at my at at a House of mine in beverly hills and so helping the prep for that. And then you know, being in the wedding and stuff that was. There was some activity there I guess. i've been in orange county so it's kind of a long drive, especially with traffic."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm when were you in that wedding.
15427.0,Patient,Are there Saturday.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you went up there for the wedding."
15427.0,Patient,"yeah me and my family my family and I. have been getting ready for it, you know the days preceding it."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15427.0,Patient,So there's some activity there.
383.0,Provider,Was that fun for you.
15427.0,Patient,"um I think it was enjoyable because I was happy to see him happy having him and his wife now. And there was some good conversation, there are some we have some common friends as well, so getting the catch up with them and his family getting to meet more of them extended family and her family as well, so yeah I think that was it was enjoyable."
383.0,Provider,"Do you feel like when you're in conversation with people that the voices are still bothering you or How does that, how is that for you when you're."
15427.0,Patient,"Do they do brother. Yes, just. it's confusing to know like who are what they are, you know. Because they're dynamic and they know things that i've been I don't know. So it's odd. But it's almost like. Having a whole separate conversation sub verbally. As opposed to. Like verbally but it'll chime in into that conversation as well, but it's like. it's like an active voice it's not like a normal thought that's like not active a second actual voice that's not my voice, because I can hear my voice talk to you through the thoughts."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15427.0,Patient,And these are different.
383.0,Provider,um. Do they ever tell you to do harmful things to anybody that you're like imprint in the presence of.
15427.0,Patient,"i'm. Not that's my recollection all right now yeah not recently. as possible, though yeah but that's not what I want to do."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm has that been to startling to you when that happens.
15427.0,Patient,um. I think they were a lot more aggressive in the beginning and terrorizing.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15427.0,Patient,"So it's it's almost like a preconditioned to that voice. And so it's not a startling. Now, and then where our neural networks and artificial intelligence and just another kind of crazy things that it could be becoming more accustomed to how it actually works. Not as not as startling I guess. Okay it's like learning to to live with it, to some degree."
383.0,Provider,"And being that that never goes away mm hmm. Well, do you have any cravings for alcohol when. You say you haven't you haven't had any in about a month and you're able to be at this wedding without partaking of alcohol."
15427.0,Patient,"yeah yeah a little bit like. not really a craving as a craving as a little bit too intense, but maybe like the thought of having a drink, but then playing the tape forward and just wanting to hit different benchmarks and not to have other factors, be to confuse what the outcome of this could be you know. So that's more the motivation, at this point, and then last night or yesterday we went to lunch with my to my aunts and my uncle. and afterwards we played a game called circle and my aunt had a drink there but and normally, we would have to drink like together just social drinking."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
15427.0,Patient,"Once again it doesn't bother me, but it makes me just think about it."
383.0,Provider,You know okay.
15427.0,Patient,Like no those are real life. I guess. Events where that's going to be natural anyway so it's good to be kind of conditioned to those when i'm in a safe environment with people that love me. I can also help. Someone hold me accountable to condition to being in those environments.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. Are you committed to being to being sober for a period of time.
15427.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
15427.0,Patient,"cuz I don't. I don't really see a benefit it's fun it's it's nice to have, I guess, but. But I don't really see a benefit that outweighs the negative outcomes. Or, like the confusion that it could add it during this process."
383.0,Provider,Right right. um well I think that's great that you're committed to not use any substances for for a while right now.
15427.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"I mean, maybe forever that would be you know, particularly while you're experiencing auditory hallucinations and struggling with that and trying to get back you know sort of on your feet."
15427.0,Patient,"How long would those typically happen happened for post, not using any substances."
383.0,Provider,"um you know I I don't I don't know I think everyone is individual with that so. I think what you want to keep an eye out for is if the voices are aggressive and terrorizing like you said, or that they they're making. Their commanding you to do things to hurt yourself or someone else. Right that's you know when you if you experience that that's important to get help right away for that."
15427.0,Patient,"yeah. To keep you. and other bloggers. We have all those outlets, with all the numbers and everything that are provided through cartel."
383.0,Provider,Good.
15427.0,Patient,"So we haven't, we have to use subsea."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and it's important that you start to get into a routine like as normal routine, as you can you know sleeping. A good sleep schedule waking up at the same time getting exercise eating well you know, and you know being engaged in productive activity, even if it's just you know doing chores around the House and staying busy and and you know. Maybe writing a couple to do lists and getting some things done."
15427.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay well i'm glad to check in with you this week we have an appointment next week, also at 4pm so i'll check in with you, then as well."
15427.0,Patient,What that is a.
383.0,Provider,18 that's.
15427.0,Patient,The gravity out that we're going to schedule.
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15427.0,Patient,"And then, this Friday at. What time."
383.0,Provider,At 11 for the group.
15427.0,Patient,"Okay yeah we already got that one too. Good to go awesome Sean fell at the ends for potentially the refill, but I still have at least another week or so on that. one."
383.0,Provider,"yeah That would be good, and then, and then I think for this week, if you can try to maybe. You know, incorporate some exercise and schedule, you know have as much structure in your day, as you can getting up at the same time, going maybe going out for a walk. Getting asking maybe asking your mom or if there's some chores around the House and things to fix you know so that you stay busy during the day with tangible things not not theoretical things but tangible like fix this clean this do this, that kind of."
15427.0,Patient,thing okay good sounds good.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, keep up i'm glad you had a nice weekend at the wedding and i'll see you on Friday."
15427.0,Patient,"Okay alright sounds good, you too."
383.0,Provider,"bye. Okay clients next appointment is on. Excuse me, is on. October the 18th at 4pm. And he reports, no suicidal or homicidal thoughts, but he is experiencing auditory hallucinations. So I would say, his risk factors, I think we do need to include this our I would say mile too. Low to moderate risk. Due to. Recent hospitalization. Continued auditory hallucinations and protected, those are the risk factors protective factors are strong social supports. He has a safety plan in place which he has. agreed to follow in terms of reaching out for help if symptoms worsen and. He does not reside by himself, he has family so strong social connections, as I mentioned before, thank you."
