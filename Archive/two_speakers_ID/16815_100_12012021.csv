16815.0,Patient,"That was my father's name. For years ago and that's why i'm going through what i'm going through. Because um. I guess it just hit me like. i've been trying to be strong, for these past four years that he passed away head of household they were I on. I have a son that's autistic boy he's high functioning, but he has temper tantrum sometimes even though he's 23 and then he has a grandson. i'm Sorry, I have a grandson that's his his little boy, so you know just a lot on my plate and trying to be strong, for my mom as well."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
16815.0,Patient,"My siblings my whole family, you know, trying to help out."
100.0,Provider,I can see how that kinda spiritually as well.
16815.0,Patient,"and I just collapse, I guess, on October 3 of this year. tired of life, I became suicidal and October 4 like midnight, or something like that, or maybe early morning is I got in the hospital that Charter oak. I asked for help. My cousin works. As a pharmacy technician at mental facility mental health facility. or she used to i'm sorry now she works for a hospital so that's why she knew of that place. I just called her you know with confidence, I called her just telling her I need help there's something wrong with me I don't know what it is, I can't pinpoint. But i'm scared I might do something dumb I tried to commit suicide, the only reason it didn't happen was because my son was out of his room. And even then, I was upset at him I was like old asleep already. Go to your room is your baby asleep like because his baby's mom was working. She works nights. So I guess my son sometimes he has insomnia. that's why he can still up, who is just on his phone like on social media. Or you know just trying to. Keep busy I guess or tiring cell phone. And my mission was to get an eye and commit suicide, I wanted to puncture my heart, to make sure that I go home to my dad. But i'm Christian and I was raised Catholic, so I know that's not going to happen if I kill myself i'm probably going to end up somewhere else and i'm scared of that I was scared of evil thoughts that I have been having and. I don't want to be suicidal."
100.0,Provider,Right.
16815.0,Patient,that's why I reached out for help.
100.0,Provider,"i'm glad you're here. and do all we can to help and, of course, you know that there's a part that you'll have to do in all this. Right um. But first of all let me. Say that it's it's probably really difficult for you, let me, let me just ask this question i'm listening to you, you were saying that you're the head of the household. Right, a lot of the responsibilities on you right. So how difficult, is it for you to see past the problems that say. To see what's good about these things that you're involved with what you're doing."
16815.0,Patient,"That my daughter and son in law reached out to help me actually my son in law, it was his idea to move me in. Here they. Just bought a house in Colorado roughly point on two months ago. And he's in the army that's why they live out here, so I don't live in California anymore, and I don't want to go back because too many memories of my dad. triggers for me to feel sad. Right and to feel like hopeless and I don't want to live anymore, I just want this pain to go away so that's why I wanted to kill myself it's it's too much pain that i've been having built. More than anything, that my dad passed away, and I feel it was my fault."
100.0,Provider,Currently Where are you at now with. With your level of depression and suicidal thoughts.
16815.0,Patient,"um the suicidal thoughts are no. But I don't have a plan. I just feel it happens when I don't take my medication and, unfortunately, for two nights already I forgot to take them. But last night in the morning. Or at like 430 in the morning, I took them i'm supposed to take about 10 at 10pm Okay, and in the morning, which I forgot i'm supposed to take the one for the stomach the mm."
100.0,Provider,or. Right.
16815.0,Patient,"But it's Okay, because that I could still take. Because I haven't eaten all I had was a shake. I haven't eaten nothing spicy or that's going to accept my or medications. yeah that's where the district is comes in, I. yc or. Just a lot of things like tomato. I don't know. But i've been taking care of that for many years, is just a medication unfortunately causes. acid reflux if I don't take them."
100.0,Provider,"Right so. your thoughts now are you don't have. Any plan, if you don't take your medications you tend to go towards suicide ideation is which are totally correct."
16815.0,Patient,I believe so.
100.0,Provider,Okay you're not feeling this. Is that right.
16815.0,Patient,"Oh, last night, yes, I was having a little bit like anxiety and i'm. kind of like doing like Why am I still alive like Why do I feel all this thoughts like demons coming to attack me when it was in reality shadows. But like I told my daughter just turn on all the light, please, because the shadows, I start visualizing them like. Like demons. Darren demons coming to get me and i'm scared of that because i'm Christian and I want to go to heaven that's I know my dad's in heaven. right before he passed away he accepted the Lord. I mean i'm born again Christian I was raised Catholic I believe in God that's. Right yes i'm trying to say."
100.0,Provider,And my dad and he always believed in.
16815.0,Patient,"God he prayed he was a really good man, you know man, you would have liked him as well as."
100.0,Provider,You miss him a lot.
16815.0,Patient,"He was my best friend yeah. And I know if he was alive, he would have cancer and he will be sick."
100.0,Provider,So that's why I don't want him.
16815.0,Patient,"back, because I know he's gonna come back like that."
100.0,Provider,Right.
16815.0,Patient,But I just want to tell him sorry for that day that he passed away that he was in a coma. With me getting emotional made him.
100.0,Provider,"Well, I don't. I don't. I don't encourage you to think that way you know, because that would basically say that you have power over people's living or dying and I don't know if your tears is that forceful, what do you think."
16815.0,Patient,We record.
100.0,Provider,Our down. So. The reason I said that is. Can you hear me cuz.
16815.0,Patient,"look like to throw it had a chance to fight for his life. Through cancer. surgery two hours later he this one he got like he had complications to surgery. He came on point for the surgery there was successful they put a call and asked to be vague and they took out some of his and testing because it twisted. that's why he was rushed to the hospital. Is a heavy pain and he told until I told them the day the day before he went to the hospital. Words I brought him a bouquet of flowers like masculine looking with a little pine up one little miniature one. I said that these are for you for. i'm not dying and I said dad. i'm a dad. dad, I just wanted to make you smile like that smile, you know right now and he's Oh, and he didn't say nothing. So it was quiet and I said, are you feeling down where did the doctor saying, because he had our doctor appointment calling us to be. exam. So he says, I. don't know I don't know why I have all this pain, but I can't stand to know more okay. it's a pain that i've never felt in my life and I don't wish it on anybody. And I kind of got emotional and he says no, no, no, no, no don't cry don't cry i'm not dying i'm a dad listen don't talk like that. So we all have to die one day right, I will yeah. We don't talk about it. To be talked about it there. We go okay well don't cry you cry the day I die i'm not gonna invite you to my funeral they said. Okay, then don't cry. So this funeral to like I didn't want to cry. But my mom was sick and my mom like fainted I didn't know she painted I thought she dropped dead. Well, if you know so then that's when I started crying and I got scared but then she they had her smell alcohol and she you know focus, but at the hospital when he two hours after the coma I mean when he was in a coma. That you fill in the coma. Two hours after the surgery when it was my turn to go see him going to room. The doctor just told us, you know just go in there with. Positive vibes so he knows you're there, even though he can't talk. He can feel you. Know we're not going to leave them alone it's up to you guys to all go in together or one by one, but the only ones allowed or his wife and children. So when I went in this course, you know I went in there. Thinking positive. But then when I saw him with all the tubes and I guess the best. I don't know the worst came out of me I guess the best thing was like just to maybe step out. So I said hi dad see you later okay down by and then I walked out, but when I got to the hallway I could still see him in the corner of my eye because it was just like a glass doors. The French doors I well you know they were open to his room that I stood in the hallway and I could still see him, but I didn't look directly at him. And I said. Okay, Dan it's Okay, then I excelled and I said I know and he passed away he died. My way the nurse. He just this is for sure, and all you see as a line and they called called blue. I got scared. I ran out the hall. And I was like he's dead he's dead. My older brother ronnie he's like Why would I go I didn't mean to I don't know what happened. I don't need to cry What did you do we never talked about it till this day my older brother and I we've never talked about it and I don't want you to know that I feel that it was my fault I died."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's let's take a look at that because there's some things going on here, and so I just like to take a few minutes and let's just try to pick That apart, a little bit because I understand that one it was a very scary time for you, that effect, he said that you were scared. Right. And you had to leave the room okay. And so."
16815.0,Patient,Because I didn't want to get emotional.
100.0,Provider,"Correct right, but that was unavoidable right because you care. What do you think about that."
16815.0,Patient,"was his first daughter mean my brother and I are 11 months apart, so it was first my brother, which is also. down. And then me and then, I have a brother that's four years younger and a sister that's 10 years younger than me so. I was the firstborn daughter like we need you know, besides my brothers and me, we had a really strong connection, my dad I was daddy's little girl since before he passed away. He was my best friend and he knows it, I told him I don't know at what point in my life, but when I was older, I told him, he was my best friend."
100.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so the belief that it was your fault, where does that come from. Can I want to talk about belief systems in a minute, but I just want to. get some more information from you as to where that thought come from that it was your fault. What tells you that."
16815.0,Patient,"Because I was supposed to be strong, supposed to go in there, the doctor. Who were supposed to go in there, showing emotion, we felt like we were gonna get emotional than just simply you know respect respectfully step out. just say bye to him because. The doctor didn't want to let us know but. I think the medical they were doing everything possible. To keep them alive."
100.0,Provider,Right.
16815.0,Patient,But I think they just didn't want to be bold and tell us you know he's dying. They said we're doing everything possible.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so you said that they told you not to get emotional and if you were to get emotional to leave the room. And from what I heard from you that's exactly what you did right you left the room."
16815.0,Patient,Okay.
100.0,Provider,"So, so you follow the instructions. You was able to leave the room. So, again i'm going to ask where did the thought that it was your fault, come in. Because up to that point you followed all the. Instructions correct go ahead."
16815.0,Patient,I told my dad died because I told him. it's okay.
100.0,Provider,Like.
16815.0,Patient,"Can I say it wrong like what did I say I didn't mean it like like it's okay die, I think he took it that way."
100.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16815.0,Patient,"But I wish I could tell them, you know to score to tell him dad I didn't give you permission to die, you were fighting. Like How dare you just die, why do you give up."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so that sounds more like your little angry with them."
16815.0,Patient,"But I love my. dad I can't be angry I do. Okay, because of my phone. You could have had a chance to live."
100.0,Provider,A.
16815.0,Patient,lot of us were ready for him to die of course not nobody's prepared for that. Right it just happened so quick.
100.0,Provider,know that. And we all know that at some point we all gonna pass We already know that. Even know.
16815.0,Patient,"How to cancer, he didn't tell her. I got cancer not."
100.0,Provider,just going to mention that.
16815.0,Patient,"Before two weeks before he passed he allowed the doctors to let us know, but he never told us. He was getting treatment. But you never told us yet cancer."
100.0,Provider,So sounds like he didn't want you guys weren't about him too much.
16815.0,Patient,"know when he was being strong and he was trying to arm. Well, just give us good memories, I guess, even though he was said we're still doing stuff with him."
100.0,Provider,And you have those memories right.
16815.0,Patient,"yeah all my life, he always was an awesome tip is our vacations breakfast or just you know hang out at the House, he would. make us. steaks or. or just you know we're just. Christmas."
100.0,Provider,thanksgiving.
16815.0,Patient,"No holidays and have the same. I mean, I still try to do the best of it, because for my daughter and. My son, even though my son wasn't with me this year he's in California. But last year, you know, last year I was with my. son, but not my daughter because her husband's in the army, so they live in base. This is already his fourth year been in the army, so I mean it's been the hall is is have been different anyways. that's my daughter living away and, yes, I have to split myself. Like last year with my son this year with."
100.0,Provider,The holidays also bring back up your dad. So.
16815.0,Patient,"it'd be strong, because it's not. Just the ones that need me know. your thoughts, of course, but do I want my dad with us you're now no because he's sick. I want to see him especially right now with the pandemic. That would be considered an underlying."
100.0,Provider,yeah so. How would you feel about yourself. If you believe that it wasn't your fault. What would be different if you change that belief. anything.
16815.0,Patient,"I would be better, I will be able to function."
100.0,Provider,I would also.
16815.0,Patient,"And just make new memories. Keep the memories of my dad, of course, but make new memories, with my grandson my family now or friends new friends."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you found a way not to blame yourself, for his passing things would be different. So then, my question would be what is keeping you from making that step."
16815.0,Patient,"You have a lot of pain guilt. Now i've been trying to be strong, for the past four years. And I can't anymore I can't be strong anymore. i'm just tired of being strong i've become a shopaholic i've always been a shopaholic but I mean. or worse now. right before I would do it because I can, and now I do it was even my credit card and that's kind of a little dangerous because yeah interest charge."
100.0,Provider,So. We have to get trying.
16815.0,Patient,"to feel I try to fulfill my pain. With shopping, because it makes everybody happy, of course, with. Getting my hair done or my nails or something you know, like self care, but it doesn't it doesn't help. It doesn't make the pain go away it's just another bill."
100.0,Provider,"What would happen if you didn't have the pain. If you accepted his passing is part of natural life it's not your fault, what would. That."
16815.0,Patient,"I would be more stable. Probably better relationship with my family or peers. Now I don't even feel worthy like I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend. Like I don't think he deserved somebody that's broken, you deserve someone. else."
100.0,Provider,what's keeping you. From letting go big meal. And the belief that it's your fault what's keeping you from doing that what. Maybe a better question is what benefitted are you receiving from. holding on to those things.
16815.0,Patient,Nothing no gonna. Destroy me it's eating eating me up.
100.0,Provider,Okay.
16815.0,Patient,"The pain is I think interference my health with my appetite um no appetite. I don't think it's the medication, but maybe a little bit it is. Probably the meditation but. I feel stable after I take the medication."
100.0,Provider,"Absolutely, which is good right."
16815.0,Patient,yeah I just think I need a day medication.
100.0,Provider,Okay.
16815.0,Patient,"Even if it causes more drowsy i'll just take a nap. yeah they start the day medication, because I told the doctor the psychiatrists that it will cause groggy feeling like over sleeping. When I would take it. So he said let's just try not taking it and then he changed me to half of it."
100.0,Provider,And now it's like I don't.
16815.0,Patient,I don't think i've been taking it right.
100.0,Provider,Okay. So do you have anyone that can help you with the meds. To make sure that she's doing that for you.
16815.0,Patient,"um. Well, she was but, most recently, two days ago my my son in law, he at work and. While in base he he messed up his ankle we twisted it, so I think our focus has been on that. has been we've been all trying to just I guess comfort him even myself, you know, like do you need anything you want some water piece of room and he's just like i'm fine i'm fine he's upset because he's in pain of porter's."
100.0,Provider,"So, can you."
16815.0,Patient,set a timer.
100.0,Provider,"set a time that would be a good thing yeah that's one to. Ask your daughter to to review everything with you to make sure, things are on track and. Can you reach out in an ester yes, yes."
16815.0,Patient,yeah i'm just going to start taking the day meditation even though causes me drowsy.
100.0,Provider,i'll just take them out.
16815.0,Patient,Because it's a lower dose.
100.0,Provider,"And it was prescribed by your doctor said. Yes, yes."
16815.0,Patient,"it's just I haven't been doing it. that's not their. President, I have these thoughts. That I don't take the medication like suicidal or not so much suicidal but like. Mike I guess. down. or nervous anxiety."
100.0,Provider,Okay.
16815.0,Patient,I haven't had. Other than last night or this early this morning. I haven't had heavy thoughts like that you know why whenever I take my medication.
100.0,Provider,So you're. able to. Taking your medication and sounds to me. That it helps you stay stable it keeps you from having these down thoughts right.
16815.0,Patient,"So there's some benefit not completely but. I do still feel a little bit down like say I know it sounds weird like my boyfriend doesn't call me or doesn't answer the phone or text. But then I have to remember, he works, he is a driver he maintains. His where he lives at the apartments. And then he also owns two other houses so i'm sure he has. to worry about those two houses."
100.0,Provider,down. yeah.
16815.0,Patient,"Yes, you don't always have to talk to. him but i'm. not good."
100.0,Provider,"For a balance would be good, probably and that's something, you know as you come here and. and work with your therapist that those things will will you'll learn those skills right, but you said that. And I hear you because, like, I have my son sometimes if I don't hear from them, I get kind of down like what what's going on why won't he called me and to your point, you know. And once I remember. That only helps me not to feel like he's just not interested, because I know he is. I think you can probably say same thing right, you know he cares. yeah right so."
16815.0,Patient,"So i'm like just most recently well he's a widow, for many years, but I think most recently. People out the ashes from his wife, I mean from his relatives. His wife's ashes, he barely got them, maybe he's having. sadness."
100.0,Provider,his daughter that's probably expected. yeah.
16815.0,Patient,"His daughters were talkers when the wife passed away, and now they are 15 and 16 so you don't know them were talking to them or expressing themselves they're awesome girls so maybe they're just having family time yeah and I have to restart. i'm not supposed to be so maybe it's."
100.0,Provider,About. it's about.
16815.0,Patient,"a sign of weakness still and I don't want to be weak I don't like crying. After I believe me, I feel like this clean like a cleansing."
100.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16815.0,Patient,"I don't feel guilty like I used to in the past. right before, when I would cry I would feel. Like not strong I would the week. So I would make myself stop praying force myself, not to cry. Because I just felt as a sign of weakness. that's."
100.0,Provider,"Right, I was going to ask you, but is it Okay, for you to be able to ask for help when you need it, or do you tell yourself it's not okay to detail."
16815.0,Patient,"My grandson he's not my biological grandson but I. have been like he his son in law has been raising him for the past three years and, most recently, he asked to be adopted, or they talk to him and he's happy about that. So I see him like a. Because my daughter sees him like a son."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so I had asked, I don't know if you able to hear me because you're moving I think it's going in and out. Oh sorry. But is it Okay, for you to sometimes have to ask for help, or. yeah it is okay good, you said that you didn't like to feel needy or you know."
16815.0,Patient,yeah I feel safe to ask for help okay.
100.0,Provider,"And most of that comes from your daughter, you said."
16815.0,Patient,"or friends, I have my Barber like why he's never coming here, but he was supposed to be here. But unfortunately, because I moved. He never cut my hair, but he became friends like on the phone. we've been he's been very supportive since day one. I talk a lot to strangers like i'm just friendly. it's easy for me to make friends, but sometimes hard to keep them because I just. don't. know. Maybe I should have. said it again."
100.0,Provider,"You said it again, you said that i'm too needy and you told me to do you know it's Okay, if you have to ask for help, but at the same time i'm hearing you challenge yourself with them too needy."
16815.0,Patient,i'm tired of them.
100.0,Provider,"Okay. You think they would be able to tell you, if they were tired."
16815.0,Patient,I hope so long.
100.0,Provider,Right.
16815.0,Patient,"I have express myself so some people and they're like, no, no, not at all, because I do apologize to them, I Tom sorry i'm burning you with my problems. or with my. I don't know my situation they're like, no, no, not at all, you could talk to me anytime you want you could call me or text me. it's okay. We all go through stuff."
100.0,Provider,"So i'd like to. challenge you in a little bit of time we have left. Maybe consider some things right, there are the facts and then this what we believe about our facts and. I don't know if you can hear me, can you keep freezing up."
16815.0,Patient,Oh i'm sorry I was just coming into the. Little more privacy over here. Okay. that's better.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so we have the facts. Then we have what we believe about our facts and what we believe about whatever the facts are will create the outcome, or the consequence if you weren't consequence could be. negative or positive it's. Just the outcome right. So let's talk about a couple of just let's just use two scenarios, the first one was. Yes, your dad passed your belief is it's my fault right that's what you told me."
16815.0,Patient,yeah.
100.0,Provider,"And, as a result of that. What How does that result for you. When you believe it's your fault."
16815.0,Patient,"tired of feeling guilty. that's why I think I started feeling suicidal like I want to take my life and just be with my dad to make this pain go away. But i'm scared of killing myself things have stopped being here, I even. think like oh my gosh i'm such a way that I can succeed and killing myself."
100.0,Provider,OK so. The guilt and the suicidal thoughts on what results when you believe it's your fault. But you also said that you know it's not your fault right you don't have that much power Is that correct.
16815.0,Patient,"I don't solely I don't fully believe. I just feel it's my fault, I do i'm not kidding i'm not being honest, I do feel it's my fault."
100.0,Provider,"Even though, you know that."
16815.0,Patient,I just wish.
100.0,Provider,We don't have control over. That right.
16815.0,Patient,promotions most emotion wise. If I wasn't so emotional. That day. I think my dad would have. Any medical help.
100.0,Provider,"I would, I would say that. Once emotional state may not impact someone else's ability to continue living so that belief that it's your fault, because you got emotional if you were to change that belief. To where it wasn't your fault. Because life happens things happen. Then, what would that outcome be for you. But he wouldn't say."
16815.0,Patient,"He would move a little bit, we would talk and he's like a complete like he moved to the only then we would like, even though he was in a coma we're thinking like he's fighting for his life and when we say that we're here for you."
100.0,Provider,And you were there for him.
16815.0,Patient,"So when we're in there with him or some of us i'm sorry. Man we just decided. One by one, so that we wouldn't leave them alone. my fingers was there. So he was never left alone."
100.0,Provider,"So that's what I mean so one of the things is while you're going through our program and you're working on on things. Is you know when you get with your doctor and you get with your formal therapists on start working on. Your belief systems okay work through the grief, because I think there's a lot there, I think you know that right. And we can work with you on the grief process and getting through all that because. It doesn't sound to me that you fully greed still have a lot going on, does that make sense. Okay."
16815.0,Patient,And the other part. Every day I talk about my dad I think of all my dad every single day. For sure since he's passed and I don't think that that's good either because it's not letting him rest in peace.
100.0,Provider,And you say that's been now what four years yeah.
16815.0,Patient,April 18 of 2017 okay.
100.0,Provider,"So we have some work to do in that area and we'll be able to to help facilitate that with you no worries the other part of the belief that I wanted to mention because I said, there was two that i'd like to address you were saying that. i'm so needy but it's okay to ask for help, but then you turn around say but i'm so needy that probably getting tired of me right, all that so again you have your friends that's the facts, you have your family members right. Your belief is wow if I asked for help they'll get tired of me. But what if your belief was. it's okay to ask for help, because they want to help me. Would that make it easier for you to ask for help, or harder for us for hell."
16815.0,Patient,easier.
100.0,Provider,"Easier Okay, and so again challenging our beliefs, is really important, because. We can't change the facts we can't change what has happened, you know those things there's nothing we can do about that. But the way we look at those things, has a great impact on how we respond to those things, and how we act moving past those things, and so one. You were saying that your your medications you weren't sure if you would take it on on track right. And so yeah it'd be good be good to have your daughter, you know, and you go over that make sure that things are in place. I also found it interesting that you say you can set your alarm yeah yeah well I do that with my medication my phone rings twice a day it doesn't rain, but you know the alarm goes off of my phone twice a day because I take meds twice today. yeah right so so that's a good idea, I think that was a good idea that you came up with um. I just i'd be curious as. To go ahead, say that."
16815.0,Patient,I just haven't done it.
100.0,Provider,i'm curious as to how that will turn out.
16815.0,Patient,Better.
100.0,Provider,"Okay. So let's let's try this maybe we can set a goal that you get with a daughter, you will. figure out your frequency of your meds and get your timer on your phone going and next week, when we meet maybe we can start with how did that go for you how's it going. let's set a little goal right. get the message in order. See how you do with that. sounds like a big part of you, maintaining. You know, a positive mindset Internet. Based on what we talked about today."
16815.0,Patient,"i'm okay with taking mass because I see, and I feel that it helps me. Okay, so set alarm permits."
100.0,Provider,"set alarm for meds reviewing with your daughter right, you said. Make sure, things are on schedule. You mentioned that you were going to take the day meds that your doctor prescribed as prescribed right, you might get a little groggy see how that goes. Right. Taking a nap in the middle of the day, not necessarily a bad thing. But I would caution, maybe that if you do take a nap in the day that you make sure you get up at a good time, so you don't sleep so long can't sleep at night."
16815.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
100.0,Provider,yeah you know to me.
16815.0,Patient,"yeah. Because I don't sleep too good at night anyway. yeah normally sleep baby like like a good good night and maybe five hours. But there's sometimes broken sleep late, but when I take the medication, I noticed i'll sleep a little bit more the nightmare it's helped me, sometimes even seven hours straight."
100.0,Provider,wow.
16815.0,Patient,I know.
100.0,Provider,seven hours is pretty good. that's not too bad norms.
16815.0,Patient,"And norms, like my visual life, ever since my dad's passed, I think I only sleep, maybe like. Four or five hours at night. And the day I find myself at work, my one hour lunch i'll have to take a 20 minute power nap. But now recently Sep tember 15 the company I work for the change ownership it's a clinic they sold it to a new clinic and then this new clinic or the owners, they don't use massage therapist in the clinic so i'm no longer a massage therapist there. i'm just an employing so I know. One of the doctor said. Well, Dr Cruz is from our chat room, he said that that's also a trigger that bled to. bring out. Everything was going on all the depression."
100.0,Provider,can change changing your role at work.
16815.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. No, I guess i'm kind of like a deal like it's Okay, maybe if the doctors, allow me or the service, allow me to go back to school, maybe one class math class. And just change my career i've done in the past, I was. No longer a massage therapist it's Okay, I still want to work for that company or that clinic and they have it over here in Colorado to like 25 minutes away."
100.0,Provider,"Oh, very good, very good."
16815.0,Patient,yeah.
100.0,Provider,"So so that's a goal, you could set. Right."
16815.0,Patient,"Of course, I have to get stable, healthy and then. Going back to school, and I mean i'm sorry back to work. The school i'll only do part time I mean one class start. off with one class yeah Mr. A map get help or is to green as well. Because that's my weakness, I have a I found out a few years ago they have a disability and now. So it's Okay, because you get to the moon, and all this extra help."
100.0,Provider,yeah I didn't do too good at math I could never be a scientist.
16815.0,Patient,math and I never got there. You know you don't really know.
100.0,Provider,"exactly right so and so right, so we find ourselves working fields where we can actually do well right. So. So hopefully yeah So hopefully this will work out for you, but like you said first it's good stable right if the meds in line get your life in order yeah."
16815.0,Patient,It would be helpful yeah get me off of that.
100.0,Provider,"I lost you, I think. I really need you there."

100.0,Provider,There you are. I lost you.
16815.0,Patient,yeah you.
100.0,Provider,Had you had said. That going back to school would be helpful that would get you out of the nest the last I heard.
16815.0,Patient,"yeah i've just you know pretty much sitting around the House and join nothing I tried going for walks every day. i'm kind of like this. i'm tired of like having a pity party every day, the only down, I want to keep busy i'm doing puzzle, but I haven't finished. started a puzzle. Four days ago."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, and. How many days you think you have left on it, if you were to do it."
16815.0,Patient,"I don't know, maybe two more is that the whole entire day I shopping and go back to it, and you know."
100.0,Provider,"Well, so how about that as another. Another goal for completion by next week that you could report on whether or not you finished your puzzle."

16815.0,Patient,Did you also build yourself.
100.0,Provider,"No man, no, I did not. I went through. yeah the field of work was very good for me and I had all personal struggles, not necessarily mental health but yeah i'm in to help them feel because. i've benefited a lot when people help me and I just always want to give back that makes any sense so."
16815.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it does because i'm in the massage therapy field, or in the medical field. Because I was once a patient. I had a back injury, which led to emergency surgery. Never walk again. And I used to get physical therapy massage acupuncture and I noticed massage helped me a lot to walk again and to get stable, so I think that's why I became a massage therapist because. I don't remember where I got the idea of becoming much service but i'm glad I did. And I love being in the medical field, helping others I was when. my grandmother was a doctor my great grandma was a nurse practitioner, and I think I want to go back into the. into the. medical field and another aspect, maybe a PA."
