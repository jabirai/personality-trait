1957.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I. can't really say they're full blown panic attacks anymore, but it's like if I know my daughter, and her boyfriend's coming to stay kind of getting like overwhelmed. A little bit."
206.0,Provider,And what do you think triggers that for you.
1957.0,Patient,I don't know.
206.0,Provider,"it's a conversation that may happen, is it the. Night you guys interact with each other."
1957.0,Patient,"Well, like I kind of tiptoe around her because I don't want her to get like to do anything to us to get upset."
206.0,Provider,upset I.
1957.0,Patient,feel like it that.
206.0,Provider,"Phase wishes so. You know. yeah undecided or still neo trying to get right with that okay. Alright, so um. Do you feel that she used someone because of those guys were entering."
1957.0,Patient,yeah I think she has yeah.
206.0,Provider,As she said that to you.
1957.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
206.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and you know it's, though. Sometimes you know the ultimate. Decision is that person."
1957.0,Patient,Right.
206.0,Provider,Much she tried to land.
1957.0,Patient,"On like she'll try to say well you know if you don't want to keep her in i'm going to go use or whatever she's do that to me really bad and. hahaha you know. By now. And, especially now being pregnant, but."
206.0,Provider,uh huh.
1957.0,Patient,Though I just don't want to go that way.
206.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you think she's she'll take this is a claim for the other pregnancy."
1957.0,Patient,No none at all.
206.0,Provider,"I want any reaction from the because of that or any detrimental concerns with your daughter, I mean your granddaughter because of exposure. Right yeah again i'm. One of the goals eating is something that you work on to stabilize your the level of anxiety that you may have. On overall functioning daily. and And when when she does come around, for you know you know to be able to at least interact with her and not having that level of anxiety going high regardless of you know, the interaction, whether she's happy upset or whichever field and that she's having that you don't. correlate that with you, being in causing her emotional distress if that's the right. So that's one something we can work on in terms of managing the level of anxiety when she comes around so one thing I could do one of those, certainly when she comes. In i'll get into that point we'll maybe even looking to. thin. Understanding whatever situation has gone on, when she comes around and see. And at the point to see how. Her behavior may play the wall in terms of how your anxiety increase because that's how you're going to manage to see okay if she's acting this way, this is what I need to do in order for her behavior and I to get your anxiety out of control. And sometimes we just have to kind of pay attention to these to kind of see how those trigger reaction within yourself, because sometimes you know we do things not not thinking about okay. Well, this happened because something else happened because normally there is a something causing a reaction when we not fully. be aware of it, but this is the The goal is to kind of pay attention, then you know, had to we add or had to remove yourself from situation, so it doesn't get to a point where you feel that you know you're going to have a panic attack was so gentle voice right. So that that's one thing at least to go started with that. and see how it goes with her when she's a one year one her. And how you can manage those also and I feeling guilty, because you know again if you didn't do anything she can this still choices that you would be making and. It would be you causing her to make those choices and that you will have to within yourself be okay with that knowing that okay she's an adult and she's gonna make choices and that certain things you won't be able to control and just be okay with that. you're not feeling i'm. Blaming yourself, for her behavior, which is our to the yasmin but it's something is. a work in progress. Right. And that's one thing and also making sure with your medical needs taken care of that So these are the two goals, we can start to see how you make progress with these and. The weight. So anything else. Well, hopefully, making more progress on your tiny house. Last time, the next time we check in. i'm gonna give you an appointment for. Next month."
1957.0,Patient,Okay.
