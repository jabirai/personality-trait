I continued with that and some other. psych meds but with the therapy. I had a couple of different experiences and when wound up moving an hour away so I started with this current therapists four years ago and i'm very happy with i've learned a lot in terms of mindfulness. And i've i've worked through some of my past trauma that I believe is is at the root of my anxiety. uh huh and. A lot of what i've been doing lately is just check in maintenance type stuff and for for. The past several months i've been feeling pretty solid in in my moods and. Where i'm at. And then. And then we switched my medication and we switched from the add a van one milligrams twice a day to the klonopin one half a milligram twice a day, so I am experiencing some breakthrough anxiety. Having some some episodes with that it would have been helpful to have a counselor these past few weeks."
383.0,Provider,I say okay.
14575.0,Patient,"i'm dealing with some stress in my life and. haven't been handling it, as well as I would like."

I am reticent to have friendships side I don't have people over I have one friend who lives an hour away, who I do visit with. On a daily basis, via telephone and trying to get down to see her a couple times a month, but driving is difficult, sometimes for me so i'm mostly i'm a loner i'm a homebody I spend. Probably three hours on social media per day that's an estimate and that's usually in the morning that's like the equivalent of my reading the morning paper."
383.0,Provider,"OK OK, I will be me I might get back to that a little bit later and are under and living in an apartment or house or."
14575.0,Patient,"an apartment with with financial assistance through head, I am disabled but i've been pending my social security disability claim for five years it's been rejected and i've had several appeals and. So that's part of what Scott me stressed out right now."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, do you feel safe in and outside of your home."
14575.0,Patient,"Yes, I do very much so."
383.0,Provider,Good um tell me a little bit about your educational background.
14575.0,Patient,"I am I dropped out of high school and then went through an adult education program and did get my diploma. i'm just kind of dabbled in college, I think I accumulated somewhere around 46 units of just general education type stuff. No degree."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and if you can tell me a little bit about your employment background."
14575.0,Patient,"Sure yeah I started out working for alarm companies in the early days of technology, which was interesting and just followed that through in a clerical pathway. and work my way up to. Well, I started as a police dispatcher and then I moved over to caltrans is a dispatcher and that began my state career in the early 90s, and I wound up working for the Department of fish and wildlife in 2007 and retired from them in 2015."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds pretty interesting."
14575.0,Patient,yeah I advanced to the level of staff services analyst.
383.0,Provider,"Thank you um any military service background. Alright, so we're going to shift to are you a divorced or single. divorced okay Okay, thank you. And do you have any children. No children okay. So we're going to talk a little bit about your your parents, you know. If we're your parents divorced or."
14575.0,Patient,My parents were together until my father passed.
383.0,Provider,"Okay um if you could tell me a bit about each parent and your relationship with them, and if you could just tell me a little bit about what their occupation was. That would be great."
14575.0,Patient,"Okay, and my parents were very much devoted to one another, and I can only recall them ever having one fight in front of us, so we had that. very solid foundation of just two loving parents and my mom was a stay at home mom until we got out of say sixth graders so and then. She had a couple of odd jobs but wound up managing a bookstore and was very successful at that, and ultimately went on to work for God shocks and retired from God shocks. But she was a very devoted mother. She may have had. um. Just just. a hard time with me as as I was growing up, and I think that. The the strains that we had during my adolescence and early 20s and then again in my 40s have more than been overcome we're very, very close now. Okay, and then my father was in the military."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14575.0,Patient,"And he met my mother through her mother, they were friends and my mom I didn't learn this until three years ago my mom was pregnant with an unintended pregnancy and. went off to walla walla Washington to live with a family and have the baby and my dad knew all this. and his only concern ever ever was for my mom's well being he didn't. When she got back he just wanted to make sure she was Okay, they eventually started dating. She did put the baby up for adoption and I am in touch with my sister now but. yeah so my dad never once through that interface they kept it as their secret for their entire lives."
383.0,Provider,It wasn't it was not his child Hello.
14575.0,Patient,"It was not his child. Someone else in the military that she had an indiscretion with, and she was 17 and they were poor and in those days, as you know, there were two options. You have the baby and keep it or you have the baby and you given up."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
14575.0,Patient,"What she did. So that's just to tell you a little bit about my father's integrity and he took care of us. As far as being in the service and after his retirement his career with snap on tools and. Setting my mom up so that she could be in a very comfortable retirement after he passed, he did develop emphysema. In the night. and eventually passed from that disease."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and any words about your relationship with him or I mean."
14575.0,Patient,"He he had some anger management issues and. I have awareness of an episode than I blacked out my sister told me about it years later, of where he kind of went off on me and spank me a little overboard. And a couple of other times I remember him losing his temper but, for the most part, he was. He was the go to work and see you when you get home dad and just didn't have a whole lot of hands on involvement. Okay, and especially while he was in the military and being sent TV why and he spent a year in Korea, when we were little and things like that."
383.0,Provider,"I see. yeah Okay, thank you. And you do have you mentioned, you have a sibling do you have more than one sibling."
14575.0,Patient,"Yes, so I have a sister and a brother that we grew up together."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14575.0,Patient,And I am the middle of those.
383.0,Provider,two.
14575.0,Patient,"And then of course the the original babies was she's our older sister or half sister. Okay, and, interestingly enough, my mother's name is Mary my first name is Mary I go by samantha mostly and our our half sister's name is also Mary."
383.0,Provider,Okay wow.
14575.0,Patient,yeah her mother Mary I think after my mom. Her adoptive mother.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, I see okay um So do you prefer to be called samantha."
14575.0,Patient,And if if it's not too much trouble in the paperwork it's just I always intermarry because that's what insurance needs and I don't mind marrying but samantha's good. Okay we're Sam.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, thank you. And if you could describe your childhood, in general, how would you describe it in a few sentences."
14575.0,Patient,"It was a very positive experience. For the most part, and I did have some childhood trauma. With a relative being molested at a young age, and that I think affected me i'm starting at age 11 I began self injuring."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14575.0,Patient,"That was hitting scratching biting it was way way before cutting ever became a thing. He had banging. um and that type of behavior just not knowing what to do with my anger and spinning out of control and. And I had been that way, since I was a small child I had always been a screamer my mom reported to me later that I would cry until I made myself sick if she didn't pick me up. So I don't know my my uncle had access to me from the time I was a baby and my siblings as well, and my my first recollections of him molesting me I was 11 years old, but I think it's likely that he started earlier."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, that did he also molest your siblings as well."
14575.0,Patient,"I believe, so they don't have any overt recollections but they have emotional issues. Okay, my sister is. A pedophile that she doesn't act on her impulses but she has she has tendencies."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14575.0,Patient,"We presses and. she's she's in a very. scary state of not wanting or accepting assistance, but she has some some deep mental health issues and has been written with depression so that's part of my stress, as well as my sister."
383.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, thank you um. I might enter that in another. Part of a top. Did you have any learning disabilities, when you were growing up any problem."
14575.0,Patient,I had a slight speech impediment I had a list. As the girl I had an overbite. And so I did go to speech therapy.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have any difficulties i'm like in the lessons. In terms of learning and testing at school."
14575.0,Patient,"No nothing like that pretty much just average, though."
383.0,Provider,So we're going to shift to pass substance use when did your substance use began when were you first exposed to. The substance use and what did you use at that time.
14575.0,Patient,"i'm alcohol would have been my first experience and that would be boone's farm apple hill. And I might have been. 14 and cannabis was around the same time, so age 14 with alcohol and cannabis."
383.0,Provider,"And, did you. In terms of present or past substance use when what other substances, did you use."
14575.0,Patient,"um I I used. cocaine, I would take. pills without knowing what they were, and I would take quaaludes knowingly I wouldn't take second all knowingly. And this is, in my mid to late teens I took LSD I took psilocybin. I took methamphetamine. um. And then I gradually got out of all of them, except for the cannabis and alcohol. Again i'm in my 30s I was, I was in a long term relationship with them very stable person and. kind of left that behind and then had kind of a meltdown after 911 and decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and start doing methamphetamine again, so in my 40s I got into math. and"
383.0,Provider,So you got a period of sobriety between. What age what age.
14575.0,Patient,"I would say, between. 35 and. 42."
383.0,Provider,that's when you were in the stable relationship. And then you started again with the method that methamphetamine at 42.
14575.0,Patient,"Yes, and and increased drinking."
383.0,Provider,"and When did you, you said in 2016 is when you stopped."
14575.0,Patient,"Yes, so I am I used methamphetamine from 2003. Now from 2002 until 2006 for four years."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14575.0,Patient,"and during that time I had a period of five and a half months, where I did not go to bed. did not did not put on my pajamas and get under the covers for five and a half months I would sleep unintentionally, you know you stop moving yours you fall asleep, it was almost like narcolepsy. It was very, very, very risky lifestyle I drove like that I would nearly fall asleep driving."
383.0,Provider,Were you working at that time.
14575.0,Patient,"I had walked off the job in June of 2003 and I weren't I was having some issues with my employer at the time, and was going to try to file a workman's COMP but I had. no idea what I was doing I was severely impaired and during that time, I would only allow my sister to see me I didn't allow contact with any other family members, I was in a. In a very bad way and continued to use the math and i'm did not ever get any paperwork filed for disability or anything was living on my retirement which which dwindled and dwindled I wound up selling my house which I did get a profit for but that again dwindled and dwindled. I was an animal hoarder during this time I had 20 pet rats that was part of the staying awake for five and a half months because they kept me so busy it was. Almost 24 seven care I wasn't the type of hoarder that would let them rot I was the type important that took them to the vendor appointments and kept good care kept him clean that it took everything out to me."
383.0,Provider,"And you had how many me. 20 Okay, and that was a do you, you said cats or rats. rats rats okay."
14575.0,Patient,They make amazing parents.
383.0,Provider,Oh wow that's amazing that's unusual. yeah you.
14575.0,Patient,"And it was it was looking back on it, it was such a skewed frame of mind that I would ever think that was okay to spend all my time and effort and dwindling savings doing that. I didn't I. wasn't thinking right."
383.0,Provider,"Right right yeah. Well, do you have any rats now."
14575.0,Patient,"No, I haven't because of the cats and the terrier it's a conflict of interest um but, as I age i'm 60 now the one advantage to pet rats that's also a disadvantage is their lifespan is short three to five years. Right, so if if ever something shouldn't happen to my current crew someday, I would like to have a pet rat again, but I would not get out of control."
383.0,Provider,"I say Okay, thank you um so did you. did so in 2016 did you go into rehab or anything or have you ever been into any."
14575.0,Patient,"To any no. I am I was impatient for mental health in 2012 I was having issues with really wanting to hurt myself and i'm was admitted for a week. And I was drinking heavily at that time and they did try very much to get me into a 12 step program that I, I personally don't believe that i'm powerless over alcohol. And I was having no cravings I was not having any withdrawal symptoms, I was Okay, without it, and. Frankly, by the time I quit and 20 I mean once once I did get out of the hospital, yes, I did start drinking again, but when I was ready to quit in 2016 and I didn't utilize the rehab of any kind, I was just over it. I was just."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so now we're going to shift to some family history any family history of mental illness alcoholism violence or incarceration."
14575.0,Patient,um yes my mom did have a nervous breakdown when she was 16 that's what they call it back then. she's been a rock ever since and. my sister has mental illness my brother attempted suicide. But is not in therapy at this time that was years ago. But clearly a history of depression with him and um.
383.0,Provider,"and your sister has also depression. Yes, okay. Were you gonna say something else."
14575.0,Patient,"And no that's that's the gist of my my family history, I don't my dad was adopted and. Other than his anger management issues which were fleeting. He didn't seem to have any mental health issues or emotional issues at all."
383.0,Provider,So the trauma that you experienced was the the the molested by your uncle was there any other history of trauma any other traumatic events occur.
14575.0,Patient,"I was also molested by my Liberal friends older Brenda when I was five years old. Okay, and i'm. by a man down the street, when I was age seven."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, any anger problems that were you mentioned that you also had you know we would harm you had anger that you take out on yourself, yes, any other expressions of anger or difficulty managing your own anger."
14575.0,Patient,And one of my decent deepest sources of shame is that I would abuse my animals and lose control and beat them.
383.0,Provider,And was this. The raw.
14575.0,Patient,"No, not the rats I also had a dog at that time I had a German shepherd wolf mix. And one morning he got out and gotten money and came in through the dog door and literally gotten mud from floor to ceiling in the living room and I took him out sign and beat them so severely that my. neighbor saw and came and talked to me he actually thought it was my boyfriend because it was so vicious he he said, Sam I saw your boyfriend beating yogi outside and I said that wasn't john that was me. Okay, and. And in 2015 prior to me stopping drinking. I had another big dog and and my little current dog that I would lose temper with, and one of the best things I ever did was I took a positive reinforcement training course from my dogs. And that taught me anger management. In addition to getting therapy."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good. that's great you took that course."
14575.0,Patient,"And in addition to the animal abuse, I would destroy equipment at work, I used to work shifts by myself and I would get angry and I can recall smashing a phone and just switching it out in the closet for a new one and number and telling anyone. smash boards. And at home to phones phones didn't last long with me I destroyed phones at home that had to be replaced, and this was in the day when phones were expensive you, you had. That we're hardwired into the wall and. Right, so I just tend demonstrations like that, where I would wreck stuff I once through a butter knife at my sister and then locked her out sign. And we're having a disagreement."
383.0,Provider,"Where did you ever have any. difficulty with law enforcement, as a result."
14575.0,Patient,"No, I only have law enforcement called and one time, I was on the phone with employee assistance program and they were worried about me so they did send officers over just to do a welfare check."
383.0,Provider,Okay um. Any history of suicidal ideation and our suicide attempts.
14575.0,Patient,"suicidal ideation yes and no attempts, and I think that. that's attributable to having an emotional support animal. and The Times that i've thought about taking my life I work it through and and my. My means was going to be the voluntary starvation voluntary stop eating and drinking V said yeah I had looked it up. But when I thought about actually going through with it, I feel like I could make a case for the humans in my life, but I could never make a case for Fred my dog I could never explain to him why i'm going."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14575.0,Patient,that's what kept me.
383.0,Provider,And when was the last time that you had had thought of. suicidal ideation.
14575.0,Patient,"it's been approximately a year, and that was also the last time I physically hit myself."
383.0,Provider,Okay. What what protects you as mainly your dog is what protects you.
14575.0,Patient,"Because you get so upset when i'm upset. Okay, and the last time I had a blow out. And I wanted to hit myself, but I didn't and I was having a hard time coming down from my anger and took one look at Fred. and had to go and make it up to them and that's how I came down and that's usually how I come down is. Because. It scares him when I get like that."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. How often do you feel the anger kind of bubble up.
14575.0,Patient,"it's been more frequently lately since since the medicine change. I I my two cats don't like each other, which is great in a small apartment and the one candace constantly chasing the undercount. And I haven't been handling that, as well as I typically do usually I just calmly put myself in between them and walk the other one away from them and just don't. To me it seems better in the line of positive reinforcement training, not to get angry with them, because it never helped their cats. Just separate them and distract them and let them go on about their day but I haven't been doing that lately so. When I talked to Dominique yesterday, she. She reassured me because I got concerned when I saw that bright heart was all about addiction management and treatment. I thought oh they're going to want to get me off the lenses and that's that but Dominique assured me that we're not going to be doing anything with my medicines anytime soon so."
383.0,Provider,I see.
14575.0,Patient,i'm reassured by that.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good good. yeah good um. So, would you say when you get angry now. Your dog helps to bring you down but. And the medication is there, but how often would you say you, you have these sort of feelings of starting to get angry."
14575.0,Patient,"Three times a week. Okay it's not it's not all day, every day, or anything like that."
383.0,Provider,uh huh that's good. yeah okay. So the last suicidal thought that you had when when did you when would you say that that was.
14575.0,Patient,"I would, I would say, approximately December 2020."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thanks. and You said you were hospitalized in 2012 any other psychiatric hospitalizations."
14575.0,Patient,No just that one.
383.0,Provider,"Is that the only house psychiatric hospitalization that you have had in your life. Yes, okay. and any financial or legal problems that you're currently worried about."
14575.0,Patient,"My financial situation is. Is a struggle and I am on public assistance and I did mention my social security claim, which is ongoing on Wednesday, I had after five years of being denied and going back and forth with appeals I had an examination with their psychiatrist. And they they did. General history, but they administered the. you're familiar with the wechsler adult intelligence scale. Yes, so it was grueling and I was stressed, and I was struggling with it and at some point during the examination she asked me how I was doing today. And I said, good grateful and it only just today, this this was two days ago the examination, but it only today dawned on me how badly I blew it because that was my golden opportunity to say i'm sick I need help. I don't feel good i'm nervous i'm stressed, but my automatic reaction is to say good I always say good. Good. Now, I just want to smack myself for saying that I can't take it back. But i'm on so annoying cuz I know I have to forgive myself."
383.0,Provider,yeah I mean.
14575.0,Patient,"I was in a boat wreck and almost lost my leg and i'm laying there, and my boyfriend asked me if I was Okay, and I said yes it's so automatic with me."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, and and sometimes when we respond automatically you know, an often many of our responses are automatic you know that's very normal, you know that."
14575.0,Patient,"took me two days to realize what I had even sent because I was just and and I didn't kind of zone out when she was talking to me, and she lost me for a minute, and she recognized that. The but so that's kind of getting off track there a little bit I apologize."
383.0,Provider,that's okay. So you're you are see you're still in the process of getting the disability claim. thing if you can go through.
14575.0,Patient,"That they will submit the report based on this examination and then i'll be due for another hearing, probably in a couple of months."
383.0,Provider,I see.
14575.0,Patient,"And i'm just really, really worried that I blew it, and then they send their they're gonna say, well, she said she's good she's."
383.0,Provider,Right right and so you're really highlighting that rather than probably a myriad of other things that she was evaluating through those through the exam that she was giving you.
14575.0,Patient,very true very true.
383.0,Provider,"So just keep that in mind that you know you're you're focused on that one thing, rather than the test is measuring many things. yeah. Do you have any medical problems any medical problems that are bothering you currently physical problems."
14575.0,Patient,"um I do have COPD but it's well managed right now I don't I don't have any struggles with it. And i'm i'm also in remission from a condition called microscopic colitis so and then my mental health and i'm i'm really. grateful, I have no no physical problems."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay good and in terms of past medical any significant past medical problems that you've had.
14575.0,Patient,"i'm a 10 year breast cancer survivor. Okay, I didn't ever miss mastectomy and 2011."

383.0,Provider,Definitely any chronic pain.
14575.0,Patient,No.
383.0,Provider,"Okay that's good. Any sleep difficulties insomnia, excessive sleep or interrupted sleep."
14575.0,Patient,"I do have a history of insomnia, and when I started on xanax 10 years ago that was what he was treating and, at the time I was drinking and I would take the xanax after I woke up at three in the morning after my alcohol wore off that's how I was using it."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14575.0,Patient,And i'm sorry I strayed from the question.
383.0,Provider,"Are you having any problems with insomnia, now."
14575.0,Patient,"Okay, so i'm medicated for insomnia, and and then i'm doing well with it sometimes I have difficulty getting off to sleep that I stay asleep very well overnight."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good um any problems with eating or just taking care of yourself in terms of nutrition and diet."
14575.0,Patient,"Well, so i'm weird in that, for the past three years i've been eating the same thing for dinner every day and it's because. I don't like to cook I don't like leftovers, but I eat a Deli sandwich with on whole wheat with cheese and spinach and chips. Every day, and then in the morning, I have granola and an English muffin and juice and i've been eating this everything, unless I go visit my friends that I don't very my diet."

14575.0,Patient,"My my critters and it is significant and. I know it sounds probably dramatic but I don't know where i'd be without them, and they bring me the joy and the laughter and occasionally the annoyance, but um. And besides the cats I get joy. from going to see my friend and just recently, I visited her and she has their house all decorated for the holidays, so that brought me joy and. And, and the feeling of having someone that knows me she's she's seen me through my worst I actually video of myself hitting myself and send it to her and we're in the middle of a fight so she knows me at my worst. i'm accused her of gaslighting me and everything and it's always me."
383.0,Provider,Okay.

14575.0,Patient,"Maybe. to figure out why. that's a hard one. and Without being too hard on myself why I would let my. Life get to this point, why couldn't make it to the finish line, and so the goal of therapy i'm. Just how to manage my life. I, I know that i'm. That managing my mental illness is a full time job I know that I knew that in October of 2015 when when I stopped working. and You know, sometimes it's not enough knowing your own truth. And, and so security has denied me for reasons such as I was able to quit drinking and therefore i'm not disabled i'm a good communicator therefore i'm not disabled, these are various denials that i've received from them. and that's hard for me."
383.0,Provider,yeah I can imagine it's very invalidating.

383.0,Provider,"Okay, so suicide risk assessment for this individual she reports that she does not have any suicidal thoughts and that last suicidal thought was in December of 2020, but it seems like she's got some well obviously some pretty. Serious impulsivity. So let's put a low risk right now. and risk factors are some increased you know anger episodes a history of self harm. And history of suicidal ideation. These are risk factors and. protective factors are her statements that she would wants to live for her pets. And she is actively engaged in treatment and has been for a while. And she has let's see what are the protective factors that she has she has family she does have some social supports. So let's. I think that the current. risk level is. Well let's put low slash moderate sorry. For her right now and i'll will continue to monitor her her suicidal. Risk factors in future individual appointments Thank you."
