15091.0,Patient,"yeah. Do you know how she got referred to. You guys because that's what I was wondering, I know that her therapist got retired or went to a different facility, and so we don't know we don't know like.

298.0,Provider,"I, I agree, I don't think this is a good venue for her. right that this is just this can be very challenging. I think we should look for something that's psychiatry only that is not a program like we are."
15091.0,Patient,"Okay, so that's what we. thought too I just we didn't know how to go about it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I think I can help with that so i'm i'm going to just charge you with a list of people who do psychiatry only not the full Program. Okay we're psychiatry. He asked why."

15091.0,Patient,Okay perfect.
298.0,Provider,I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out with me.
15091.0,Patient,"yeah I just um I targeted like if I live closer I would totally help her, but she doesn't do the computer stuff and so. yeah when she was doing it before it was over the phone and then, once a week, she would drive about three hours because she had other appointments. And so yeah work over the phone that's for more of her style."
