510.0,Provider,"And you were actually yep the last two weeks, because I am doing right after our session i'm doing your last progress report. For court and you're absolutely right, the last couple weeks you've been on point you also had a medical follow up with. Dr seldon you don't take any. medications Is that correct."

12686.0,Patient,US yes and it all your appointments in the last two weeks.
510.0,Provider,"So let me pull up I can't remember off the top of my head who your new therapist is going to be so I want to give you that person's name. And that way when the care navigators outreach you you'll recognize the name so give me one SEC because everybody went to a couple of different people, so all right where's samantha TT TT. So you are going to Stacey krug on now do you i'm now thinking, are you and group with her."
12686.0,Patient,yeah I think that is the same Stacy that.
510.0,Provider,"Stacy okay perfect, so I know they were trying for those that were nine groups with me trying to assign to a therapist you had group with so good, it sounds like. there'll be some continuity. So a familiar face, so your group with Dr cell and Stacy remains the same, but obviously the individual work will now be with Stacey are you do you feel comfortable with that that switch that assignment. yeah go perfect Okay, she will then start taking over the progress reports for your court. starting next week, but I am thrilled I can give a glowing report. And and Stacey and Dr cell will be your points of contact. Because I know you brought this question up with me and I said there's you know gotta be some consistency and also, I encourage you to talk to your probation officer and I don't know if you were given timeline from that person. Because I knew, you were asking like How long do I need to do this program. I usually. tell people a minimum of three months of really consistent progress but did you talk to your probation officer did that conversation come up."
12686.0,Patient,"No, I haven't actually see her tomorrow."
510.0,Provider,"Is my oh that's right that's. Right, you see her on Friday that's right and I was going to be like will keep your appointment today we'll review i'll just get your new therapist and that way you can kind of have that conversation. Every P O is a little different like I have another one, and the probation officer was like it's going to be up to bright heart. I don't know if that is what your probation officer will say, but I tell my clients like a minimum of three months of really consistent, you know, progress and Dr cell and Stacey will take that on so just. be open and advocating for yourself to if you feel like you know I feel like i've done what I needed to do that will prompt those two to really have that conversation, but you certainly in the last month, I feel like are really you've been way more on point. i'm pleased, do you think there's been anything different from your perspective of why. Then, then, and the completion has been better."
12686.0,Patient,"um the the first month because, like this, I was like new to this like. It like just kind of like mixed up with the scheduling and I didn't like realize that I had to have to individual you know what I mean, I think I just kind of gotten the routine of it and, like No one to like schedule them now so it's. Okay, better."
510.0,Provider,"Good yeah I feel like you have definitely, from my perspective, you found a better rhythm and you're definitely on point so if you keep this up, I would imagine Dr cell and Stacy would you know definitely be saying hey I think you've done what you needed to do and so okay all right. Well, good, well, I am. really glad to I know it was a short time, but keep up the good work it's been a pleasure checking in with you and. I will be submitting a great report for the last couple weeks."
