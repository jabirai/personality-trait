252.0,Provider,Hello. hey you. hi how are you.
6705.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
252.0,Provider,i'm good. Good good how's things been going.
6705.0,Patient,"Over overall, been going good. i've had some some setback days i've been crying a lot and I don't know if it's the medication i've been on or what and I don't care if it is it's not a bad thing. I don't cry a lot and I don't know if that's because I was crying too much because i'm super over emotional and now my emotions are balance or if i'm shutting them off and i'm not feeling stuff I don't think that's what's happening because I definitely feel some. Right, but like but like. I cry for the first like good and. I just I miss I miss my boyfriend in. respectively. You know what I mean not him I just miss. Whatever but there's so many other good things that are happening in my life it's not like I have about life or anything I just i've just been getting sad about it. Because, like the year is coming up in like a couple like six days and like i've been thinking like a year ago I didn't even know he was going to leave me that week or or whatever, like, I was so blind sighted and it's now come full circle, a whole years past and. i've been able to see all the red flags and everything that I couldn't see while I was in a relationship, but it doesn't make it any less sad like understanding doesn't make you like less sad for some reason it definitely helps but i've been. Thinking about him and it and the situation and, like what he's doing a lot. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"you're grieving and you're walking through the process, and when you do hit that year mark it always the first everything is the toughest so you're coming up on a year anniversary, it makes perfect sense that you are thinking back to the events that unfolded that's how we process it."
6705.0,Patient,"Time needs to pass for you to be able to process the whole thing to yeah which is super weird because I, this is the first time in my life that I haven't smoked or drank or. drink my way. Out of a negative headspace like i've just been trying to feel whatever This is like when I met you I was drinking like five days a week."
252.0,Provider,And now.
6705.0,Patient,"I forget my party and I get my sleep over, and those are the last few times I can remember drinking I don't I don't drink like it, and it makes me sleepy. And i'm on medicaid like I shouldn't be drinking all the time it's bad for you it's it's an actual poison it's actual poison that you put in your body and that, thank God, you have stomach acid because it's poison."
252.0,Provider,Right.
6705.0,Patient,"So it's not all about wrecking cars either it makes me gain weight it, it makes me i'm drinking makes me drink more yeah. More I do at the mall do it that makes sense. yeah So if I reframe it's just all good but I don't even miss it like I don't even care like. Almost feeling like crap all the time. I do apologize if it gets loud because they're redoing the apartment upstairs. And it sometimes it's loud like I don't know what they're doing today yesterday, did they did the carpet, but the day before I think they like knock down all their counter tops because I could hear like slept like it was so Walter was freaking out."

6705.0,Patient,"not fight off the wall, so please Oh, this was only 40 okay only, yes, but um. there's different places, depending on I see how big their and i've never been able to afford to the State pay all that money that's why I went out and I bought all this. dungeon and i've always wanted to buy one of the prints from the Disney stores, but they're so expensive and like you know, usually go to Disney like I usually go to just knew about $100 you know, food, maybe a tiny souvenir. that's hundred dollars and I don't really buy frivolous things when I go to Disney ever because it's they're all pretty trinity and once you get them home your houses and Disney and it's not you know what I mean, but I have a whole TV station, and I was like Okay, this is perfect. And I validated it and oh my God. My doorbell. And I don't have pants on. And i'm just being honest with you."

6705.0,Patient,Really.
252.0,Provider,i'm not even kidding you. Why.
6705.0,Patient,"cuz I. kind of put a time limit on healing I just feel like it's a little of normal I feel like i'm I feel crazy like are like I still feel crazy like I feel. Like, why did this affect me so bad, we weren't even married it's not like I got divorced mean how many kids like. I don't know my mom my mom does me a disservice because she says things like that at least you weren't married to the guy or at least. You know you didn't have any babies, with him, because I had you, with your dad and this and that and i'm like yeah I don't know I don't know how you did that but it's not me. No, no, I still feel like it affected me too much, and I don't know why, and I know that that's my problem, and then it makes me feel like I am crazy and you left, because I was crazy and I didn't need to deal with stuff and so he left and it's all back to being my fault again. yeah you know."
252.0,Provider,"it's not your fault, but can I tell you that what happens with most people is they don't give themselves the proper amount of time. To grieve and to look back and to reflect and to learn from the experience what happens is most people. holly bounce from one relationship to another to another to another never giving themselves that that time to heal and with every new relationship. That baggage comes with them so everything that they were hurt in that relationship they've never had time to process it it comes on to that next partner. Right and then why didn't that one workout why didn't that one work out why didn't that one work out well Hello you're carrying a goddamn mountain of shit that you haven't processed through right. What you've done by taking this year by taking this year, whether it was intentional or not is you're giving yourself enough time to grieve to heal to walk through it to understand it the most healthiest thing that you can do. I just."
6705.0,Patient,"i'm not doing the norm and that's good is what you're saying, because that is what other other people do i'm like why can't I just. Go out date because everyone's like date I mean that doesn't mean you have to be with them just go out and i'm like I don't want to. I don't feel I just don't want to."
252.0,Provider,"hey there's nothing wrong with that, especially at this point in your life, you know."
6705.0,Patient,"I get distracted when I get into a relationship, and I know this about myself and I just feel like i've. i've not done completing the things that I have set in motion and I don't want to mess it up, and so I need to be a little more complete before I even. Like worry about trying to even meet somebody because, and you know what is happening, like like all these guys see i'm doing better I look better this other stuff and i'm getting hit on but you always like get it when you don't want it and then. vice versa. yeah you know. i'm just so not interested, it doesn't matter how cute you are i'm just not interested, right now, because I feel like they're going to ruin my life. i'm doing okay."
252.0,Provider,"You are and what as something else that I want you to remember is all of those things that your mom's keeps telling you were at least this and at least this and at least this. Your hopes or dreams are in that relationship yeah and so all of those things that you didn't get out of that relationship it, however it's a, thank God, you were hurt and devastated through it, because it turned out to be something that completely opposite of what you were hoping for."
6705.0,Patient,"I keep thinking like. 11 so much and he left without even saying by like. Like that's that's not just like 6040 that's like 9010 you know, like how blind was, I just want to be loved so bad that I just kept making excuses and didn't even I wasn't even honest with myself, I was like this is fine, this relationship was fine, it was not fine no."
252.0,Provider,"No, it wasn't and to be able to have the ability to reflect see it honestly. You don't do that whenever you go from one relationship to the other what you do is that goes into a box. But, except for all the insecurities and all the mistrust and the hurt from it, it gets carried into that next relationship so now, the beginning of this relationship, the guy he doesn't even have to do nothing wrong you don't trust him for all of these reasons, from your past relationship. You know you're."
6705.0,Patient,"not ready to date for sure I would totally not. Trust somebody but that, like her, so that has been my life is going bad it just means one area of it isn't back to normal yet or whatever, but that's fine. I don't."
252.0,Provider,"Think you're in a better headspace and a better space in your life than what most people are going through, he went through. Really honestly. So don't look at it like you're doing something wrong because you're not you're doing something so right that more people need to do that, because they would feel so much better. When we lose ourselves in relationships it's like when the relationship ends, we have to rediscover who we are."
6705.0,Patient,"yeah and I did the whole like jumping from relationship to relationship without healing and like i'm not saying I have breaks in between, but the breaks in between would be really like I would be drinking and going out all the time, and so that really. wasn't wasn't. Right wasn't a break, and so, then I would get into another relationship and tell myself you've been single for six seven months, you know, like it's about time but that's not the case it's. i've been drinking i've been going out i've been staying out till 5am i've been doing bad things you know, like it's not good so. I mean every one of my excuses in a relationship. bums me out and then. I feel, like everyone sees that i'm single and that it's like an affirmation for everyone that's done me dirty to be like Oh yes, and she's the problem, and I know I shouldn't garrow other people view me but it's something I think about too."
252.0,Provider,"Well, I think they need to take heed and they need to take your lead actually because if they didn't give themselves proper time to walk through it heal, then you know there's issues in those relationships that's just the way it is you know. So you think about that. you're not doing things the wrong way you're doing them the right way. And when you're ready to be open to a relationship My hope is that everything that you have learned for up to this point, this past year guide you when the right direction to the right person. You know."
6705.0,Patient,"I need to be able to attract what I need and I need to you have to be like good to do that, you know so."
252.0,Provider,If not you just get you know scrubs you're like i'm.
6705.0,Patient,On repeat.
252.0,Provider,"Right. Like they want what you got they want your House, the one two car they want your money they want it, you know."
6705.0,Patient,"So sorry it's not even like I made a ton of money, I just made more than he did."
252.0,Provider,yeah sugar mama. And you know you got him a car. place to live.
6705.0,Patient,"Well, you know my best friend Rebecca haha she said. She was like you know. I don't blame you because you you trusted him. And that's why you do things he didn't. He didn't. ask you to buy him a car, and he gave in you offered because you saw that there's reliving other you need another car, you had the means and he didn't he stepped up and. Like that's different like you just didn't know any better and. She gives me grace and I love her for that and i'm like thank you for understanding she's like you thought you were going to marry this guy like, of course, you did all those things. Like I don't blame me for doing all those things, next time, maybe just see the red flags, but I still don't blame you for doing them and i'm like thank you like it that's what I need to hear."
252.0,Provider,"That is the truth 100% so you think about where you were back then, compared to where you are now you now are aware of all those red flags and what you've learned out of this past year in your healing and out of that relationship is enormous. you're a better version of who you are. holly you have to remember that. You know. I remember when you and I first started meeting it was all about the relationship what you all the hopes and dreams that were involved in that relationship. You know. And today is about holly. it's about what she's doing for herself it's about self care it's about self love it's about realizing that you're not ready to be in a relationship which a lot of people don't realize."
6705.0,Patient,"And I wonder if i'll ever beer and then it will die alone like that's a fear. My parents aren't young and I don't want to be alone, without my parents."
252.0,Provider,"We got to get out of stay out of those what IFS. Those what IFS are definitely killers, you know they can take you spiraling right on down to the bottom of the barrel. So yeah stay out of what ifs and stay in now. You have now. Right. there's some things that are. That are guaranteed in life guaranteed right life and death."
6705.0,Patient,guarantee taxes.
252.0,Provider,"and tax is. The thing is, is that we don't know you know we can live every day in fear. Or we can live every day by taking full advantage of what that day has to offer building up our relationships loving the ones that were with you know loving our family, to the best of our ability, loving ourselves."
6705.0,Patient,yeah somebody else supposed to love me if I don't love myself it's like a lot of wait for them to carry like they don't know what I. Need I kind of know what I need they can only do. What they can in their ability to you know what I mean like. Anybody else's responsibility to make you happy.
252.0,Provider,Your responsibility. And I think making these these decisions for yourself are pretty amazing.
6705.0,Patient,"I should hear back from San about my second job. Hope I get it, I called them yesterday, but she needs to talk to her recruiter. And I think she's gonna call me this week."
252.0,Provider,So you'll have two jobs. One of them will be part time.
6705.0,Patient,Both of them will be i'm gonna work at MAC and then i'm going to work. I walked in and he liked my makeup and they told me to apply.
252.0,Provider,They see your creativity.
6705.0,Patient,"Apparently, but are going in there to buy makeup multiple times, no one's ever done that, before that's Another thing I feel like things like if you asked me and I school senior year like what. I wanted to do, I wanted to do makeup and then I took myself out of doing it because I was like well unless you're really successful you'll be broke so bad news like ethically. Then. Nothing else really made me happy and I was like well shit i'm going to be a fucking server for the rest of my life because I won't chase my dreams because i'm scared that i'm bad at them. And I wasn't even really chasing a dream when MAC wanted to hire me they just it just fell into my lap and then I said well if I don't do this like i'm stupid. Because I don't have to go to full on Cosmetology school, and I would be a certified makeup artist there to me themselves, and I can move my way up. And I get discovered that way, I could I could like working matt corporate that would be such a badass job it's one of my favorite brands of makeup my mom used to shop there when I was a kid and. I don't know I always liked the ladies who were dressed in black with their makeup on makes it look important. it's one of my dreams and it's just a little retail job and that's kind of a little pathetic dream, but doing makeup is."
252.0,Provider,"yeah it's a start. And you're right you never know when things are going, what doors are going to open for you, you just never know unless you walk through them like this."
6705.0,Patient,I mean there's so many people who go to Cosmetology school let's say they do it to do hair.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6705.0,Patient,"And they're stuck working at great clips are fantastic sam's and that's not. What they want it, they wanted to be working in a high volume salon in beverly hills or something like they don't want to own their own place like I don't. think any of them really want to work at great clips you know mean like I don't think that's what people want to do, and they start Cosmo school. So I was afraid that that would have happened to me like I would just get thrown in the pool and. that's not what I want, I want to waste a whole bunch of money on it either, and. I think this is just a really good starter opportunity for me with with me skipping some extra steps."
252.0,Provider,I think you're right.
6705.0,Patient,i'm excited like i'm so excited. i'm never going to work a day in my life I love my serving job I don't feel like I go to work when I go there. I go there. With my it's a it's great and then my other job will just be selling and promoting and doing makeup my favorite brand. it's only for hired me and they're like you can work with all the brands know my favorite brand wants to hire me and it's and I will actually be an employee of. Long come or estee lauder my bad. As a letter. Which means is estee lauder and I get a just count.

6705.0,Patient,"I spend so much, I mean. I shouldn't see so much money on makeup. But, oh no. it's gotten by makeup everyday but like I own a lot of stuff. If I had other people's face shades I could just go do makeup because I have the concealer that you know all the pallets all the tools, all the brushes of all that you just. have only my skin color and stuff I have tammy which matches my hands, and then I have white me, which is my face you."

Which is on the outskirts of temecula. specular valley we're putting it is and it's a casino, that is, and. there's a minor league baseball team called. Oh, my God, what are they it's called storm stadium, but I don't know what are they storms like I don't know what what they are anyway. So. The owner of the stadium or the team, or something I guess his longtime friends or. With Joan jett or knows your family or like something like that, like they knew each other and or her manager or something and so she played a three concert. It was free with admission like you pay extra to see her, but if you paid to get in to see the game that day it was before the game, and it was I mean she was down there very tiny lady skinny short tiny speaks he can she not big hair anymore, and like. In leather pants I like 70 something years old. Black leather pants I think it was summer. And like a strappy. Because she's super thin steel she's little bit she has a great body, you know cuz she was a trainer and she's rich.

I have a friend that looks like Peter frampton. And with slipped out blonde hair. Now you're in high school and he. My mom actually called him Peter fenton and that's why computer games and he's the one that told me about it, he was like you want to go see them all.

Is every day I have it there's a brief feature where it it like vibrates on your wrist and it reads your heart rate and it has you breathing. For a whole minute and you're supposed to Center yourself and like be aware of the now and around you and just. In the moment or whatever the cars, listen to the blinds listen to your CAP whatever and it it just zone out and it beeps at you when it's done so you don't have to like look at your watch like it has been a minute, yet you know. i've been reading up on like inner child therapy like healing your inner child things like that um. Because it's a thing, because while you're an adult you are your your your inner child first yeah. So you just grow around that and it's there's so many even old people. that's what. You are things because it takes them back to their childhood not saying there's any healing being done but it's a very powerful thing the kid in you, is a very powerful thing, in a sense that it can bring joy and devastation, you know."

6705.0,Patient,sounds crazy the. world. On a crazy but it doesn't sound crazy no.

They don't get that extra attention they don't get time to heal they don't get what adults give themselves when it comes to healing right, and so, for the rest of your life it's like there's this there's this hurt and this unresolved pain and this unresolved. abandonment issue or you know, whatever it may be. And unless we go back and we give that inner child the things that they didn't get. You know, we we stay a little empty inside. The baby."

If you're used or if you're so ingrained to being a certain way it's really hard to learn the brain is a muscle it's hard to learn new behaviors of things when you're so even they're actively trying, you know. And a lot of that healing does come from within some of it actually happens without. You realizing that you're helping yourself heal it just like make all of a sudden you're doing things for inner child and then you feel really good for the next couple of weeks, and you didn't. realize or for yourself or you've meditated are you done cross that thing off your list, whatever it was. Bigger small whether it was a bucket list thing or just going to the grocery store because you've been so depressed and you finally made it out and you lose all your groceries and.

6705.0,Patient,"By my head that. I have my first experience but that that's so weird that you even mentioned that because I didn't know what was the thing I don't know I heard the dude talk to me about all this stuff it did, but it was a lot of stuff in it kind of just so. If I did the briefing. And my resting heart rate before I did that. said it was 84 I looked up is 84 good as at for bad, I have no idea what 84 means. And it said it was a little high it was still in the range of normal like 60 to 90 is normal, but depending on like your. Your weight your height your gender, even if you drink caffeine like there's all these factors right and I had noticed that, yesterday I drink coffee and I told you, I don't drink coffee I drink. tea now. And then and I went and got a half caf so two shots when there should be for the rest decaf and I have already drink it already got home from work. I was still buzzing from work and I sat down and that was my resting heart rate I did the brief thing and fluids my cat and went down to like 76 or 75 or something way way low. And I was like okay. cool because I was looking you know I wept emptied myself to death, and it was like Oh, you could be at risk for cardiovascular disease, if you're resting heart rate is above an ad all the time, and I was like. I just gotta I gotta get it down got to get it out, you know it's awareness, to the fact that."
252.0,Provider,"I really need to implement these little things in my life. weird breathing right it's like taking a few minutes, just to to breathe from your abdominal breathing get that oxygen flowing in your body, those are so needed, because what I don't know about you, but what I do is i'm like. i'm short breathing all the time i'm moving all the time, you know when i'm not in front of the screen I am up, and I am moving. And so I don't pay attention to how i'm breathing I don't pay attention to any of that stuff and when you start paying attention to it you're like oh wow. I need to take some moments."
6705.0,Patient,yeah I mean. I must have had to have because my heart rate was high and I didn't know until it told me.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
6705.0,Patient,"I mean, I felt fine but. I definitely felt calmer after. weird breathing is a weird exercise that everybody should do."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and the you know what's funny to me as a lot of people think it's stupid it's like, why are we meditating about breathing we breathe all the time, well, we breathe all the time, but we don't breathe, to give our whole body oxygen. You know. You don't breathe for health, we breathe debris."

I wash them get them all beat up because you know there's stinky and they're nasty and you got to get more clean and and then I pat Proust have post them and.
