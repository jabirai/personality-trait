484.0,Provider,"Okay, with that for."
15453.0,Patient,For anxiety.
484.0,Provider,"The reason I ask is that sometimes, in combination with suboxone it can lead to a little bit more sleepiness or something."
15453.0,Patient,"That was the thing I was actually getting. From from the same girls, giving them a chance about some for a long time and he's put it back to add a van and then reduce the other bit."
484.0,Provider,"To make it a safe level. Yes, okay good so you're aware of that yeah just being cautious, not to take too much yeah. And the same thing was long with alcohol you drink alcohol. Okay."
15453.0,Patient,"Maybe you're here and there, but no."
484.0,Provider,"All right, um. And it sounds like you've had some good success with with suboxone in the past, good. All right. Do you have other medical problems sounds like you have anxiety."

484.0,Provider,"All right, how about like i'm hepatitis C or HIV."
15453.0,Patient,"You know, no, no."
484.0,Provider,Do you get have you been checked for those.
15453.0,Patient,Yes.
484.0,Provider,All right.
15453.0,Patient,yeah no.
484.0,Provider,"Good and then, besides the advantage prescribing the suboxone you've taken before you have any other prescription or over the counter meds that you take. And then. Any concerns about suicidal thinking."
15453.0,Patient,"No, no. It sounds like you've got some."
484.0,Provider,Good supports in place already any history of suicide attempts at all. nope okay.
15453.0,Patient,Good. Oh.
484.0,Provider,"See. Okay. It sounds like you're working right now you've got some good social support so that's good to hear. And how about your sleep, are you sleeping okay."
15453.0,Patient,yeah yeah I do.
484.0,Provider,"Not much difficulty. sleeping okay. And how about constipation do you get a lot of constipation on that, on the suboxone."
15453.0,Patient,not really no no. No.
484.0,Provider,"And so, when you've taken suboxone in the past, did you do the. What we have sometimes called a micro dosing protocol or low dose start where you start with really low doses, and then you kind of wean down the fentanyl use or did you kind of go into withdrawal and then start it."
15453.0,Patient,"Yes, in the past."
484.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, have you heard of that that one of the things we do with the. Harm reduction mama did they talk with that with them in the program that connected, you have starting very low doses."
15453.0,Patient,"Yes, they have looked into it myself as well."
484.0,Provider,And what are your thoughts about that.
15453.0,Patient,"Until you mentioned that just know I hadn't even thought of it but i'm actually that sounds like the way to go, that sounds like what i'd like to try to do this time for sure."
484.0,Provider,yeah So if you remember the way suboxone works. Is it tries a really strongly binds to.
15453.0,Patient,"Those receptors in your brain and your body that this fentanyl binds to, and in fact it will bind stronger than fentanyl."
484.0,Provider,So if we gave you a whole bunch of suboxone it would kick the fentanyl off those receptors and you would go into withdrawal.
15453.0,Patient,So we want to avoid that so.
484.0,Provider,"Very low doses that slowly. increase, you should sort of naturally be decreasing your financial use because you won't be having the withdrawal that's kind of driving some of that. So. You would kind of you know, hope you would you could you wouldn't have to stop using right now but kind of naturally we just. require less and less as the dose of the buprenorphine goes up in your system. yeah so you know. that's what we want to avoid kind of putting you in the withdrawal, so you really wanted to follow the instructions carefully and slowly increase that doesn't happen because, as you know what makes you feel really crummy. Right yeah. Okay. Do you have any. cats."
15453.0,Patient,"Yes, I do okay."
484.0,Provider,"Is it Okay, if I also order one of those will."
15453.0,Patient,be great.
484.0,Provider,"yeah. Now, if I can get you meds in. Florida, because I am really not sure how that would work, because I have not had to do that. Okay, and so. If you have with. If you have withdrawal symptoms with this, you know you may actually be using less of the fentanyl because because you have less desire to because you have the suboxone in your system. And that may be why you feel a little bit of withdrawal, but I don't want you to be worried about the US causing what's wrong with this, because it is very low doses it shouldn't. And you know the fentanyl can stay in the fentanyl can stay in your system for quite a long time you're probably aware of that. And so you know. Just kind of you can use normally without trying to decrease the. amount. Because we don't want to rely on what's your all it'll sort of natural naturally start using less. Over time, but you don't need to stop using and have the withdrawal."
15453.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,So you'll probably just have less cravings. right we don't want. We don't want you to have withdrawal symptoms during this process.
15453.0,Patient,No meaning.
484.0,Provider,"we're in agreement on that. Okay, let me figure out, I mean, I have to message someone to find out about the."
15453.0,Patient,I really appreciate that Thank you.
484.0,Provider,"We figure it out. That this the tricky thing is going to be. Just that i'm not i'm not licensed in Florida, and so i'm that i'm done that's The one thing that may be a trick here, and if someone else would need to potentially order I may not have the answer for you like in the moment right now i'm waiting to. hear back, but. But i'll make sure we sort of figured out and get you an answer."
15453.0,Patient,"Okay, I really appreciate that I wouldn't be able to go anyways. it's 937 years old. we've got a little bit of time to figure it out."
484.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15453.0,Patient,But I do really appreciate it oh.
484.0,Provider,yeah my pleasure. sending messages to bunch of people. If anyone can help.
15453.0,Patient,"Thanks so much. past. yeah well one time, I went on vacation when I don't have my other suboxone doctor in California. And I told him about one on vacation there was a planned vacation. But this is what he if he also was was writing music presenting and at the same time, like. Every nine months of both. um and they said, you know just go ahead and go on your vacation and then you know when when you run out you just go ahead and call us and we'll send it over to the pharmacy wherever you're at. And so I flew into New Orleans for for the last two days of mardi gras and it was completely out of both and I called in, and they said. The pharmacy in Louisiana said, oh no we don't Louisiana State law says we don't do that for any. prescriptions from from out of state. And I was just like very is like it was it was pretty bad that's really bad. yeah it was terrible it was it was miserable really and."
484.0,Provider,i'm so sorry that happened to.
15453.0,Patient,These. But they were able to send it over to Texas like two days later on the way home. Especially because I really wasn't expecting it all they told me. You. You were told it was fine.
484.0,Provider,"yeah that's terrible. Well, I am I don't know see, then, because I don't i'm not licensed in, for I don't know the. rules like offhand in Florida. So that is yeah that's The thing that i'm. Not certain about. No one's gotten back to me yet. It might be something we can someone can call you about tomorrow, and I can always see I mean. The worst the worst worst cases that we can, and then you need to get your script."
15453.0,Patient,When you come back next week. I figured as much.
484.0,Provider,yeah the the way the alcohol kind of go through sort of the description with you. of how you're going to start it just if you haven't done it before. This way i'm in this mode. yeah the way it's going to work as you're aiming at three separate prescriptions and.
