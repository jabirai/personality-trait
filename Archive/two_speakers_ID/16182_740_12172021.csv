Like to be thorough, the thing cuz I don't want to like let it rest and then on. So Nice. know I doesn't want to get our time because, like I had like back probably three 4000 a car accident. A couple years ago and then my problem my desk or not like they're kind of hurting it. To the wrong spot. So I think that has a lot to do with it because the lens of my my back will bother me. But it's not enough to like. You know, do surgery or satellite mess with it."
740.0,Provider,"Well, we usually would especially from what I know about fishes they used to do your X rays and stuff when you get there. and I hope, so I hope Gary to get somewhere, I know what the holiday season and people are awful stuff like that so maybe maybe right now, in the meantime, you may just want to go see a chiropractor."
16182.0,Patient,I cut my systems that sound like strict like medical i'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
740.0,Provider,If you got groupon they were cheap on groupon.
16182.0,Patient,yo said I get botox loud like.

16182.0,Patient,"That so regarding our last session I know we got cut off I don't know what happened to you, but we got talking like."
740.0,Provider,You know why.
16182.0,Patient,"The 45 minute mark I call it that, for like a good 10 minutes but i'm not sure if it was going through still for you."
740.0,Provider,"But yeah you like. I said, I think it was I was you gone talking about like okay. Let me get rid of on a spaceship."
16182.0,Patient,know I did a call back oh yeah.
740.0,Provider,Go ahead.
16182.0,Patient,And I will say you're a mid thought when you were talking he never finishes that.
740.0,Provider,"You feel funny huh. uh huh. If you have an advantage excellent dummy let me look, let me look back on my nope. Oh, my God you want me dig up some from the great."
16182.0,Patient,state of mind living in my head. Was living in my. Day. um.
740.0,Provider,"Let me see, let me see hold on Oh, I think I remember what we thought that you would need polluted relationships."
16182.0,Patient,Polluted is what's that called. I would say.
740.0,Provider,"unhealthy relationships, but oh that's what it was, I remember what it was because you you you got these new one on a rebound because."
16182.0,Patient,"Sarah rebound it's been a year and a half, I rebounded like a month, maybe two months."
740.0,Provider,"Here you go there you go, so it wasn't a rebound definitely what they'll forgive my verbiage it wasn't everybody i'm trying to i'm trying to recollect what i'm."
16182.0,Patient,"What i'm happy, I can I can actually I got you I could say what you say. You were talking about boundaries you're talking about how to set boundaries and let you need to like have boundaries in your relationship some some some some some some so."
740.0,Provider,"And the. reason why is because of the fact that. First of all, we know that you're not good at them, because you say one of your main problems is to have healthy relationships. But we keep trying and we're not healthy you."
16182.0,Patient,"Like okay you're right, but then I feel like progress is healthy so like not like oh go to a relationship and attack it the same way there's never like there's never the same attack every time. Because I know that that we don't. So every relationship, I do things differently or try to put systems in place differently so that I won't have the same errors as before. Because I figure like if i'm not good at something like hey like if I don't have a problem, like hey i'm willing to do so much of this i'm going to do so much this proper limitation, though i'm not sure if you consider those boundaries or much limitations. But. The real. But I do try to put limitations and stuff for me, because that helps me not like go overboard for certain things. Oh yeah."
740.0,Provider,"The different, and I want you to tell me to do. that's different. If you put systems in place, because you."
16182.0,Patient,know that you're not in place.
740.0,Provider,Very see you being in place. And not have. systems in place.
16182.0,Patient,"See when I think of like people and people's personalities and how they work people. are always going to be themselves like they can be the best version of themselves. But they always don't give themselves i'm not sure how you feel about that, but I feel the reason I put this in place, because it helps me be the best version of myself and that's. The way that I found that works for me, for me, the best version of myself and do it without this those edits flyer. huh. Oh no I thought it always It shows up like oh that's how my mind works personally like okay. To like make this work late."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and it's not taking away this, this is what i'm saying, but what i'm saying is is that you're using systems as a buffer because you're not all the way, healthy."
16182.0,Patient,So.
740.0,Provider,"verses so what a buffer he is if he if you ever. You ever if you ever go if you ever go somewhere to a museum, did you go, thank you, you ever go to museum and they had them the ropes. To say it. don't say don't reach over this rope don't cross off it is wrote better buffer. yeah which means you can only go so far, because. You can you because what's on that because you can't."
16182.0,Patient,You can't access on.
740.0,Provider,"The other end right, so what i'm saying is, it is not the effects of getting rid of system but you're saying that part of my health is creating the system. And me know my limitation. So it's kind of like i'm still going to do the. In the midst of me trying to get healthy, so instead of so using this as a means to get healthy instead of actually getting healthy first. Does that make."
16182.0,Patient,"What do you consider being healthy like can I give you a definition of a healthy so it's kind of hard to. Like like getting healthy Okay, so what is healthy."
740.0,Provider,"So I say that when I say so, when you said i'll say when i'm not good relationship, which means you've been hurt right there's been some distress there they've been an issue there there's been some. What is it we in times past. Even even in growing up some people, you have some passive aggressive and things of that nature so stuff like this, so apparently. However, you operate in relationships which I don't know yet. But how ever you operate in relationship, you have. You have diagnosed but they're not healthy. Which mean you have to tell. me the disruption. And the issues and the things you struggle with in relationships to where they don't work out."
16182.0,Patient,"Okay, so. What is that, like what is your definition of a healthy relationship a healthy way set works to two people or like a healthy relationship that works for mutually beneficial for both people like, by definition, like any like definitely. Okay, so."
740.0,Provider,"In basically. is basically when when there's a healthy relationship there's no lack and you know areas right it's like we both give 100 100. We both complementing each other. Right it's, not to say there's not gonna be any disagreement absolutely not, but we have healthy open communication. So we can resolve anything we've worked during the thing with each other, you don't say this communication and and there's compromise you i'm saying i'm not loving you the way I want to love you i'm living you the way you want to be loved and vice versa. Right and so things like this. What you think what you think you're shredding relationships with black, it is difficult feat of maintain. That relationship."
16182.0,Patient,Who. knows I really am mad at people. People like half a half so it'd be like.
740.0,Provider,Okay.
16182.0,Patient,"With this person and I realize, you know I love. to block them on a B, C D E, F G and then i'm gonna roll out like I am done, I was like i'm done like. And then I go back to it i'll revisit it like a month later, and I read back someone someone said to me i'd like to be sensitive in the moment."
740.0,Provider,Okay okay that's cool.
16182.0,Patient,"Oh damn I was like. I didn't slow down this man like this, like. Like days. Down afterwards i'm like damn. I wasn't done let's dump dumb like what I do this. And then I feel embarrassed to go back and like i'll apologize, but then I feel embarrassed talking to them afterwards, like. damn right so. yeah."
740.0,Provider,So basically.
16182.0,Patient,do of course I know that.
740.0,Provider,"know what i'm saying is is a mid you know the crazy part about it is they use impulsive I don't use been posted because they defined in post is not being nothing, nothing came before us. But I say that there's no such thing because you can't operate without a thought partner. Now what I say is that you have a rational thinking. And sometimes as a result of our rational thinking we have selfish behavior. And because about those behaviors we project, how we feel in that moment. And instead of instead of rationally thinking you emotionally think. And then, as a result of you most me thanking you emotionally react. And the crazy part of our about our emotion is that our feelings and I said just feeling. And that emotion, they change they're not permitted, what we do in our emotional state is permanent, but our emotions are not harmony that's the reason why you could look at it takes me two down the road and realized there wasn't even a big of a deal. Because enemy in a emotional state you're not thinking rationally, which is why is always always, and I mean this is always imperative for you to think and not allow your emotion to behave for you."
16182.0,Patient,"know the time that happens, oh say like. i'm like the closer I am to someone, the more they can get in there, my stand by the latest but. I always I bought this instance because it was something that actually happened recently. Like another person I used to talk to like maybe like a weekly thing like a. Like four times a week and then I thought really bad like they said something they were like Oh, I need some space because you're a lot and I was like what and then I got really upset about it because, like. They said they wanted to hang out I planned the weekend I went i've got like we planned the hotel and stuff and we did all this like thing to like hang out and stuff and I wanted them to have a good time and, like. They said, like Oh, I had a good time but it's overshadowed by like something you do a B and C and I was like. When. I say as hot button, I was like alright cool so I stopped talking to him, I sent them to unblock them and every day but. um but now I talked to I like revisit and I was like oh like this is not. What I should do this is my friend, let me go talk to, so we talked and stuff and he seems like we're back to normal, but then you can tell like. I know the person like very like anthem least I know like he still like he says he's fine, but like I feel like I feel like he's like not over yet, and i'm like. gosh. But I don't know how. It feels like annoying like if he's not okay and he's like kind of like all right everything's okay. Like. This go with it like to go with what he says or go with what I think he."
740.0,Provider,"No, no, what he said. Because the thing about it is, is that you don't know enough about it to."
16182.0,Patient,You.
740.0,Provider,can make. Some make that assumption.
16182.0,Patient,there's like. there's like a little gets hit.
740.0,Provider,"In the head, but you still don't know what nobody feels. You don't know how to you don't know what people think, I understand the hands understand the non barbecues and all that kind of stuff why you. Why you as defined by you, as the strain, the same in the same sprint, and this is the thing when something happens and that's what I try to tell people when something happens and you something in error to somebody. else just because you will apologize, and they decided to reconnect with you, it doesn't mean they they they have healed. completely from their situation they're just willing to give you another 10. But you see that it gives you time."
16182.0,Patient,"that's fair that's fair. that's fair that's totally fair I figured the same thing, I just wanted to go over it, so I was thinking."
740.0,Provider,"yeah it just it and I said well i'm like manager and apology. apology, even though maybe sincere and me, it can be from the depth of your whole life, now that kind of stuff when you really mean if, on the bottom of your ankles that are the cancer so even with an apology, mind you, it doesn't erase the womb, it just let you off the hook. The person CEO has to hear from the heart, even though they had a forgiving apology."
16182.0,Patient,To make sense.
740.0,Provider,"I thought I use analogy all the time, just because you take to mail out of the fans it doesn't mean the whole erases the homeless, you there."
16182.0,Patient,"So, going back to like Oh, let me see impulsive behavior they're. Like they're like certain um. Is there, like a process that she's like say like i'm mad at someone like in this moment i'm i'm not gonna make the most rational decision i'm. The most impulsive thing possible cuz i'm like heated, what do you suggest, I wish my mind go like shabbat like. it's like a process for like no."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely i'm so happy you. may start with let's start with number one. Why, you made it. that's, the first thing. Well, because they say. Now, even though they said it, are you mad. Because through bashing. Or you mad because they think. Are you may have a good this truth and you don't want it to be true. Because, sometimes we project out for expressions about our fears and our limitations on other people. And then we get mad when he pointed out. Even though it is true. there's anything. So we have a process. So the process is why you bake. And then, secondly, do you think, do you think, do you think is the situation deserves. deserves your anger. Like should you really be angry. Like what is it going to resolve. Is he is he really gonna help. or they're going to him in this situation. Like how it felt, so you have to you have to be able to really be rational like for me when i'm angry, I need quiet because I need to understand, first I want saying that they. Did I know for a fact that if I say something I you know you can say debit is not like dentures you can talk about making your mouth once it's out is that. Right we're gonna I need to think. I mean, two things. And then, once I think. If I didn't go say to drive if I need to go see by myself. If I need to pray about it, which i'm sure nothing's gonna always do. And then i'm kind of wait. Until I met a place. To where."
16182.0,Patient,I can communicate.
740.0,Provider,Without regretting what i'm saying.
16182.0,Patient,Maybe we have to ask yourself.
740.0,Provider,"Is he really wants me being murdered, and is, and if our baby. is going to resolve the situation, or is it going to make it work."
16182.0,Patient,"I get up, I feel like in the moment for me, is it was the matter."
740.0,Provider,"If i'm really on team. Absolutely. But then think about it is wow it's a different phase, when you are used to reacting you'll you'll continue to react. Like when you're and see and i'ma say this i'm gonna say this because I mean you haven't fired me yet. So I presume that you will see some therapy will make. When you're angry. anger is derived from disappointment, which means there was an expectation. But the crazy part about it is. It was my expectation, or whether it's something we both. agreed on. Sometimes we get angry, because the people don't meet my expectations, but it was nothing, it was never discussed between the two of us. Does that make sense. And then, many times, we think that people can just lead our mind. Like you should just know. Like you can just know this bothers me. Where that's fair. So there was never an expectation. There were set. Of the of the relationship. And the when we don't meet it. Then we get disappointed we get Adrian. And we want to react because why because you're not doing good. According to my expectations. Now that selfish but Israel is realistic, we all do it, I can do. But that's why it's really, really, really, really. really, really, really. Important to communicate. communicate your expectations, because. Everybody got. We our data you're not going to know what I know is absolutely not universal rosie so without expectations you go into the grocery so eight seconds to find what you need. And you know i'm saying. You know, and then we got a good case."
16182.0,Patient,and Will segue we'll come back.
740.0,Provider,"Come on, oh."
16182.0,Patient,"my mind, like the favorite. domini about my sessions, because I talked to her like maybe like twice, so I was saying that I wanted like for mmm."
740.0,Provider,hmm she come.
16182.0,Patient,"Right now. I wanted for personal like one on one and then to. benefit more for the one on one because that's what I may see into the Program. The group is great, but also goes over a lot of like medication and like currently i'm not on any medication so when i'm a lot of times like no go over like 30 minutes of people talking about medication and stuff and i'm like. i've been diagnosed with anxiety yet. So i'm not sure if that is like the proper group for me to be in."
740.0,Provider,You say you haven't been diagnosed with. Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia.
16182.0,Patient,khufu that.
740.0,Provider,You know.
16182.0,Patient,The only therapists I talked to I guess you could like I guess night I mean tire. With that but.
740.0,Provider,"She was diagnosed. When you talk to, I think, when you talk to. yeah when you talk to Julie. Back in November. They said that he has a very he had very few things in real time from anthem insomnia anxiety and depression."
16182.0,Patient,"I saw really, really, really, really, really, really bad as it were, the point where I couldn't get up and i'd be like i'm is too anxious to go to this day. But over years of life, dealing with it is so much better, so my as it is like something that like on the ancients in a moment Bobby able to live with it, and as continue, but I would think the more. My dad is now what i'm worried about more like depression, because I got hot days, where i'm just like kind of don't do shit, to be honest with you i'm."
740.0,Provider,gonna switch from anxiety group to group.
16182.0,Patient,What is mental health do.
740.0,Provider,"massively target all mental health symptoms. I mean it's a bag. being that it just target anxiety, but mental health is more broad it's foggy Allah by Paula borderline depression, anxiety."
16182.0,Patient,Was.
740.0,Provider,My now she told me she told me that you want to be. 4000 a month extra time and at this time. I won't be able to do with an issue. Because this is mommy i'm booked completed. So.
16182.0,Patient,Make sure you mean like March.
740.0,Provider,"No, I mean nature, like Jamie."
16182.0,Patient,know that works for me like that totally we're.
740.0,Provider,Good then so that was i'm not gonna be to do it and then that's what she was like i'm considering giving you another therapist they could because i'm just so swamp. So did you want another day. I don't mind any oh seven if i'm if i'm.
16182.0,Patient,"i'm just trying this out for my first time therapy is not something I. kind of better myself i'm trying to reach the next level in my life I have some walls, so I want to get over the wall. therapies like I know everyone has a different style of therapy and everyone has like a different level of like. of education and like what type of therapists they are and what they specialize in so i'm what. i'm sticking with you, because I, like you, you're a black. I explain certain things to certain cultures, I believe, is one get it, and then like. Like I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"I don't mind seeing you every week ages, if this because, when she told me. I will continue for this month and I already knew for a fact that I couldn't I couldn't take I couldn't take seeing you every week. I try and squeeze you in as much as possible in regards to like as often as I could see you, but since January is a fresh month, then yes, when we leave for sessions, today I can book all for your patience, for January, does that make."
16182.0,Patient,"So I know like if that's if know to like see if his own work, and it seems like you want to have like cuz sometimes place like i'm a personal trainer I don't like all my patients even me. I know that I know I, like all the time, like all my clients even me I, like some of them was a lot harder to do with. With a lead flow I missed that money but. goodbye. Like if i'm, not that I like oh no. I would like to honestly share with my therapist like if i'm not the ideal client for you, if you see my is not working for you or if you can't help me further. To like progress and the direction that i'm looking for it will be i'd appreciate it if I do like hey look i'm just not that one like i'm not."
740.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely I mean there's nothing I try my best and that's why I never guarantee anything initially why. Because i'm learning. Just like you learning i'm growing just like you grow with. All I can do is what I can do. And i'm always honest out there at least i'm not gonna be perfect, sometimes. I may not know the answer man I figured out. In the woods and we've we've gone back and done. But I mean i'm just enough like I must have an unorthodox therapy because i'm I try to be as relational as I can I don't like talking over clients, I like to talk with you, I think it should be more of a therapeutic relationship versus me sounded like all war from the Dr clear as commercial."
16182.0,Patient,"Okay, I get that."
740.0,Provider,"So basically vice versa it's not really telling you is you killing me. So, as we keep going down the road and you feel like a nice, I appreciate him, but I think this is the end of the road, and I know what it is because I want you to get all the help that you need and i'm not and if i'm not the person to take you to the other side of the lake that's fun."
16182.0,Patient,"to other subjects, I thought of but I didn't write stuff down I think of it, so it goes past."
740.0,Provider,"You should read them now. I do have a question for you, though. So were you trying to be."
16182.0,Patient,"Like okay there's a lot of goals that I have, and I just want to be. I want to make it to these goals, like, I want to be a physical therapist and then like. My life. is like Kobe like relationships, things are fluctuating like we know like not dealing with certain emotional things there's a lot lot going on in my head. last one, the last. Friday thing, as you said, like i'm on my head on my if I put systems in place like hey I wake up 30 minutes meditate learn coping mechanisms that are going to help. The right way, so I don't have to spend X unless the energy on things that I don't need to spend energy. that's that's what I want to be, I want to be efficient as possible with by. Just my time. therapies, but I think that's why I want to get out there."
740.0,Provider,"And I have with it, what do you want me to what do you want to. Make lists, because I have a plumbing issue playing so don that I have for you that's why that I asked you about you think open fields and healthy relationships and they will be."
16182.0,Patient,"So. Back to that um so there's like. Okay, it helps me by if you can help by give me something I can think about this week for like try to improve on."
740.0,Provider,Oh yeah i'll put the homework.
16182.0,Patient,"homework homework does help it helps like hey I need you to focus on blah blah blah look into your relationships and then like soccer write stuff down throughout the week and think about it, and then bring it back to you. That would help. In the process, like look at your friend by what do you call boundaries are like hey look up the definition of this this this and this or like try this exercise on you to look that over like or like a video. Video of being angry or something like. This is the process to deal with your anger that I think is like the most effective. I would you. Like that would just be."
740.0,Provider,Good for me you gotta you gotta. You can write down your hurts me.
16182.0,Patient,"uh let me know my Samsung those. cuz I take my phone everywhere, so my video."
740.0,Provider,"So one of the things I want you to write about and I want you to identify this, I would like, for you to identify. How. hi your household exposures and basically how your relationship with your family has affected your relationship to other people if anything. One of the things that we talked about the last time we met you thing, how you grew up in a. protective house oh your mom is pretty passive aggressive you had. Difficulties coming out with as you fear of amanda fear of abandonment, you also talked about, however, despite used to have a good relation with your people with your family anyway. And then, of course, your brother being your hero, and things like that, and so I think, because sometimes i'm not saying in this case, but sometimes. Because you feel because you grew up in overtaken how so in a passive aggressive household and you felt a feeling of abandonment and things like that sometimes we can have a need, or we can have any if a if a. What is it called. A tendency. is basically a reaction that you don't even know this happening."
16182.0,Patient,uh huh what kind of reaction.
740.0,Provider,"What i'm saying is like dirty muscle memory your body can react, even the. Brain is not even there it's Okay, I had a baby i'm trying to get my brain bank. So sometimes in relationships with a lot of your family. Because, because you experience these things. Many times you can sabotage of thing. before it gets good because of the fact, a big fear of abandonment fear of being live fear of if I show my full says to this person, they may walk off anyway might as well go ahead and beat them to the point, you know all that kind of stuff that's. Why, I say question because I want to see. How your family relationship growing up in childhood has been like it has impacted your relationship now as an adult."
