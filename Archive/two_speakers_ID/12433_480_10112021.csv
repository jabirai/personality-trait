480.0,Provider,Hello.
12433.0,Patient,Good morning.
480.0,Provider,"Good morning, is it getting cold. hi. i'm jealous of all the cold weather everywhere, I only wear sweaters cuz I said under an hd event."
12433.0,Patient,For the rain all day.
480.0,Provider,yeah that's pretty nice I like 6070s good fall weather. how's your weekend.
12433.0,Patient,Good. cooking. nothing wrong right and my dad or. Our church had. This like fundraiser type of thing on Saturday night so. We went over there for a little bit about it that's all you did.
480.0,Provider,You went to.
12433.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,Good how was your anxiety.
12433.0,Patient,"You. know, I think. What I wanted to talk to you about is like, I think, is the reason why it was Okay, I think, is because we had a couple of drinks. And, and I think. Like Jen said I had to call them beers. And i'm. I think, for some reason lately like a lot because. Like we had to cancel the last meeting you know. We have and then been like a couple weeks before lot that we talked and. i'm just finding like is it like feeling better. I don't know my my mind. To. Try to I try to talk myself into not taking on medication, like all you don't need it. you're feeling better and then. There what's been happening in that gives me an excuse or. kind of an allowance to old you can. Go back to my old ways well. You know. Where are we drinking so. I don't know what's up with that, so I."
480.0,Provider,"Often, are you not taking your meds."
12433.0,Patient,"Well it's. Like it was just like on Saturday i've had it happen to me a few times. I mean just a couple of times and I haven't taken and then i've had where I where I kind of knew that. My some of my family's coming over or. You know, like I knew that we have this to coming up and. i've been to before. And you know they have like a beer garden man, you know. So I kind of talked myself out of not taking my medication. You know."
480.0,Provider,Like so you already planning to drink and that's why you didn't take your medication.
12433.0,Patient,"Also, but. Because i'm feeling better."
480.0,Provider,"Well, but also, you have to remember you're feeling better because you're medicaid."
12433.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,And that's the part where it's easy when we're on medication and things are going well to forget that it's a chemical imbalance happening it's not like a weakness or a lack of willpower you know.
12433.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Which is. very typical it's really hard to stay on. any sort of antidepressants anti anxiety because your mental illness will tell you that oh i'm cured things are better I don't have to do this anymore. Like that's a normal part of the process, but then part of that too is reminding yourself that you're feeling better because the medications working. And it's helping normalize the chemicals in your brain."
12433.0,Patient,I need it.
480.0,Provider,yeah. Do you feel guilty after you drink.
12433.0,Patient,mm hmm.
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's the other side of it is because. With drinking, I know you have a history where your wife started to get worried about it, you feel guilty about it and guilt is such a motivator for all types of unhealthy behaviors right, because when we feel guilty about ourselves, then we have low self esteem and then everything. starts to feel like out of control. yeah and then we start making decisions, and most of them are unhealthy because we're trying to grasp it some sense of control, because that helps us ease our anxiety. So that's also something to remember when you're thinking about drinking is, you know that line that people say play the tape through it's like you have to think about. The consequences of what's going to happen after you drink for you it's not like legal consequences but it's the emotional consequences, because then you feel guilty afterwards, and you have to handle the guilt, which is hard to do yeah. did your wife say anything about you drinking."
12433.0,Patient,"yeah she just. mentioned to me. I know cycle right. And I just kind of long i'm feeling better we all I didn't take on medication. And she's like well i'm a little worried, you know so. that's why I wanted to you know, bring it up to right. yeah and. Then just kind of get."
480.0,Provider,So when you think about not drinking at all ever again is that thought like terrifyingly repulsive to you.
12433.0,Patient,Know terrifying but I mean I. I just. saw this point. I guess because I used to joke to. read my feeling on it.
480.0,Provider,hmm.
12433.0,Patient,"It just it just kind of like this kind of worries me that what I what I will feel what I would I be okay, you know."
480.0,Provider,Like the idea of not drinking again would be more palatable if you had something else to replace that that gave you the same relief from anxiety.
12433.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Exactly I make sense, and that is the goal, eventually, is to get to a point where your anxiety is managed through medication and therapy and coping skills that you don't feel that need to have a relief, you know. yeah but it just takes time and. A lot of time, which is unfortunate yeah."
12433.0,Patient,"So. So yeah that's that's kind of what i've gone through and then I just noticed like a. got a real lack of motivation. To. Get back into you know what I will do. or no, you into that i've wanted to you know I i'm. just doing things I enjoy and. i'm having a hard time just motivating myself. do that."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. What do you think that's from do you think that's. Like depression, do you think it's just post pandemic it's hard to get back into the swing of things, do you think it's being out of work."
12433.0,Patient,"Well, I don't think it's the post pandemic thing because. I was working in my you know working. In my backyard all the time. pandemic kind of. I don't know I. think it might be saved, or something."
480.0,Provider,"Question does it correlate at all. To when you've drank The past few times, is it typically after you drink that you have these depressive episodes where you're not motivated to do things."
12433.0,Patient,"No. I don't think so, I think. I think part of that also kind of leads me to. To kind of consider to drink, the lack of motivation. More and more. Hello more after I could. do things I guess you know just start something."
480.0,Provider,yeah okay that makes sense. So you're not on any sort of antidepressant MED right you only on anxiety meds.
12433.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
480.0,Provider,That might be something that could help because a lot of anti depressants actually do help with anxiety to. um. Are you still taking a trouser down at night.
12433.0,Patient,"Not every night. Just like, for I feel like a man."
480.0,Provider,Okay.
12433.0,Patient,"And I you know, especially today. That i've had a couple of years and I don't think so, but. Like I took. I took a while. to sleep."
480.0,Provider,"How do you feel today, do you feel anxious or pretty okay."
12433.0,Patient,I feel okay I just feel. Like you're saying feel guilty over the weekend.
480.0,Provider,"Okay So what are we gonna do with that guilt because guilt is not useful, especially after the fact."
12433.0,Patient,um. I don't know I just. When you say what am I going to do to. Try to try harder. I guess just to stay on medication and.
480.0,Provider,"So typically. I think something that helps process guilt is just rational thought right so you're a human being, you had some alcohol, which is not. Illegal it's not necessarily like. Something that is worst case scenario, so practicing just giving yourself a little bit of grace to can help like Okay, I made this decision it's in the past, I don't mean to. hold on to it and carry it with me through the week anymore, I can let it go and just next time remind myself, of how I felt the day after. Because that's something that I think like you said I shouldn't have drank and I don't like should because that leads to guilt and judgment and shame right so. Instead, just looking at it like I had a few drinks that may not have been the healthiest choice in the moment but next time I will choose differently just kind of like rephrasing things in your brain so you're not unintentionally beating yourself up with your own mind you know. yeah. And i'm thinking to the trouser down might be worth taking every night, even if you're not struggling with sleep, because it does help with generalized anxiety throughout the day."
12433.0,Patient,"yeah I was, I was feeling really good. yo always a lot with to. You know, always packing on that below the level of respect for every for every day. yeah you know take it on regularly a certain time and take control, you know. me I don't take them all at once. Like as a mom. Also, I like cholesterol pill. And like a real low low dose. blood pressure, medicine. and It will also be. The anxiety medicine chantelle is giving me the silly little plan or whatever it is. And then. yeah so all those logs medications is I spacing out, you know throughout the morning and then there's one and i'm supposed to take twice a day. So. I don't know if that's the right thing, like, I was just always always I always thought that it would just throw them all in your mouth. yeah they. can come down. So, but yeah I. feel really good. What I was doing that you know. kind of on that schedule. To the point to where I was like Okay, you know online. power."
480.0,Provider,back to normal I don't need these meds.
12433.0,Patient,"Unfortunately. You know I know. like an okay thing to do at the time. into. thinking that it doesn't. mean I don't get like pass out trumping. Even to a point to where I. don't like, for my speech I just had a few."
480.0,Provider,"So let me ask you this, if your wife wasn't concerned about your drinking, would you feel like it was a problem."
12433.0,Patient,"Because I just because I know how I was before. I was taking medication and I was really. You know, I was drinking nearly every day after work, so I wouldn't you know. wouldn't feel."
480.0,Provider,"Right. So you were aware, at the time that you were using it to treat your anxiety like it was a self medication type of thing."
12433.0,Patient,I mean I didn't I didn't exactly know. But I kind of figured it out through conversations with my wife like she should ask why do you drink like by yourself. You know and.
480.0,Provider,So people.
12433.0,Patient,"And I. Have a feeling, you know I just have a feeling that you know. inside it goes away after. And it's just. At the time I couldn't I couldn't explain it to her, you know I just I can't explain it. I don't know what it is. But it's just coming to the call me down, is what I said just kind of calms me down and to where I feel better. So. yeah I knew that it was an issue because it's not healthy to check every every day, even if it's. You know, to. Moderate. Man i'm extremely. popular. and never really affected my job. You know I wouldn't I wouldn't. Be how over in the morning, like that. But well. Good."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's good that you knew that it wasn't super healthy because a lot of people do drink daily because it's normalized in society, to have a couple drinks after work and. It doesn't matter that you're doing that every single. Day, most people don't have enough self awareness or insight to know that that's not necessarily healthy, they just think oh it's normal because everyone else does it yeah so that's why I asked like if you even thought it was a problem for yourself, because a lot of times. People. think they need to stop doing something, because other people tell them to not necessarily because they think it's a problem."
12433.0,Patient,"I mean, especially with it was motivating to me to you know, to also realize it when. My wife would mention the fourth like we shouldn't do this every day and. Also, I know that I would even feel. guilty know."
480.0,Provider,"You guys had like an argument about it or she just mentioned, she was concerned."
12433.0,Patient,"No, not an argument that we've had serious conversations about it, you know. Like really worried, she was really worried about my drinking before. I started seeking treatment, you know. We. You know the couple of times. Before this weekend, where I did. Also drink she's just kind of the adults been kind of like the first time since i've been started started taking medication. I thought you're supposed to drink, because I remember anger shame tell problem just make sure you don't drink alcohol before them. And so I. I just told my wife, when she prescribed that. That medication and I said, well, I can't do alcohol and i'm taking it so and then, what do you. I don't think I told her that. I didn't take my medication, like the first time that i've been told I just I knew how to like. One of my stepdaughters is coming over. With some other family, and I can move that they're probably going to play, do you. feel good that day. Or maybe I can just take my medication and. enjoy a couple beers with one and that's kind of what led to her like whoa. Are you allowed to do that or less to do. My. medication to there you know so. But yeah we've had. Arguments with serious conversation, and you know wanting one just recently, since I started drinking she was kind of worried. and You know I don't know if you recall, but. I think in one of our groups I just mentioned that. We booked to go on a cruise. So. What it's my it's my really good time to my school his birthday. And you know he invited invited me to go on. So I just thought it would be maybe a good phone we all just dealing with my social anxiety to try to go, you know and then because. My wife and I we haven't been on vacation. pretty much."
480.0,Provider,He said pretty much since her daughter was born right.
12433.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,wow.
12433.0,Patient,that's a long time. Moving to Hawaii and. In 2010.
480.0,Provider,Was 11 years ago.
12433.0,Patient,"Seven days yeah we had a couple of we've had like a couple championships yeah just with our with our daughter, but. Nowhere where we went anywhere yeah for more than a couple of days away from anybody. So I just kind of thought that maybe it was a good time my daughter's mine now so. she's old enough, I think, and it would be good for us relationship there and just to have like five days and. also helped me kind of get over this. Social coven anxiety thing I think I have no. I know it's a it's a vaccinated cruise you know so everybody has to be vaccinated or if they if they have some sort of. Medical letter of time that they can't be vaccinated task parody going but. So it's everybody, including. The stock has to be vaccinated."
480.0,Provider,Whereas.
12433.0,Patient,it's it's just to Cabo San Lucas relief.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
12433.0,Patient,"Which is you know, so we can just try to long each. Like we. an hour and a half seconds."
480.0,Provider,"yeah long beach has all the cruise ships, I remember driving one time in my life I drove from San Diego up to La and then back down again and I remember stopping in long beach and being like oh there's nothing here, except cruise ships."
12433.0,Patient,"so on. So yeah and. So, so we just go to Cabo San Lucas for like one day and we started into Nada, which is another small little town. In bond CAFE there. But. In my life and I it's conversation we want to start to jake about Tracy that she's like she kind of bought that fall off the cruise is that you know i'm a little concerned because I know how your friends are. When you guys get together. Because my life I like I. Like. to enjoy a lot even a band around. Just kind of one of those guys, you know that the zoo. So she just kind of told her, I wanted to turn into real I don't want to be have to be babysitting you know you're not you're not you know i'm not i'm. So let's just kind of. it's kind of. been trying to process home going to deal with it, you know. When is. November 4."
480.0,Provider,Oh okay so pretty soon yeah. yeah.
12433.0,Patient,"So, because I don't have to stand up to him. and Good."
480.0,Provider,"The best way if you're ever like out somewhere or a cruise ship like that always make sure you have a drink in your hand already. So that's like the little alcoholic trick right is don't ever go anywhere without a drink in your hand already so, whether it be like your favorite kind of soda or like sparkling water or something. Because, if you have a drink in your hand people are less likely to ask you like, why are you drinking why don't you go get something. yeah and most people assume it's alcohol anyways."
12433.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean. Did. My wife kind of said that. You know, we like pre order your bottle of champagne to the room yeah just felt like toes when she kind of. gave the thumbs up to that yeah so we could just tells Catalina vacation. But. yeah that's. that's all I really want to add, is what I kind of moved to you know. sticking to medication. I don't want to. You know what. good idea to get back home all."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and you also don't want to spend your whole vacation with your wife, which you haven't had in so long feeling guilty over drinking The night before you know. yeah so that's something to keep in mind too is just the emotional consequences, and you want to be able to be present to enjoy her company and connecting with her and alcohol, something that takes you out of the present not brings you into the present."
12433.0,Patient,"yeah all i've also kind of considered like cancel. Like, to the point yeah like saying like telling them. Time and i'm like oh my God I can't just tell them and then just rebooking another one. Because we want. This is what's going on, if you if you can fold, then you can just use it towards a future careers, you know so."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, and then you and your wife could go without the friends. yeah that's not a bad idea."
12433.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,Do you think your wife would prefer to go with just you rather than the group of friends.
12433.0,Patient,"I mean, probably she she never know really make sense that what I mean. or she doesn't hang out with their wives or anything. We. We rarely get together, you know, these days, anyway, yes, like I haven't. I haven't seen my family my kids probably. Probably close to, probably for the pandemic we just come on. So."
480.0,Provider,Welcome to adult friendships you see each other once every five years. very true.
12433.0,Patient,So. yeah you just all you know kind of. going around my head yeah.
480.0,Provider,"So if you rescheduled the cruise you probably have until a couple days prior to reschedule right, so you have time to think about it."
12433.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Now I want to go, I want to go. yeah just to see see my buddy and other some other people are going I kiss sisters off of all she's on. she's like two or three years older than us. And then her husband and then I think they might have. Another. Another two couples that are going but Mike is really the only. person that I know that. And and it's just her, and I think there's like three or four other couples can help people know each other as."
480.0,Provider,"Well, so the good thing about a cruise is like you don't have to hang out with people you go with the whole time there's enough other stuff to do right So if you guys do end up going on this one that's planned you and your wife can still have time together, apart from Mike and his crew."
12433.0,Patient,"yeah. he's trying to. limit. Because it's going to be hard for him to kind of understand and I i've talked to him already I told him. For how the conversation when he invited me I said look man I haven't I haven't told anybody. You know i'll tell my family, but I really struggle with my little all. worth it, and it was I was. You. Know really, really tied to our tix medication. medication for it. and If I go, you know, like last semester, a lot supposed to be talking bs you know, so you kind of already knows. you're put that pressure on me."
480.0,Provider,"I was gonna suggest is, if you talk about it, ahead of time and kind of set that boundary and say listen guys i'm not drinking, then people are less likely to try to pressure you into it."
12433.0,Patient,"To understand you know, maybe back in their 20s or. Whatever."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
12433.0,Patient,"Come on y'all just somehow. You know, but. So I did have a real quick conversation. yeah."
480.0,Provider,that's how.
12433.0,Patient,i'm.
480.0,Provider,doing well in school so.
12433.0,Patient,"So. Alright, so it was a week ago, yesterday, she was complaining of a sore throat. yeah and then. We said okay well tomorrow morning we'll just see how you feel yeah she didn't feel anything and I I was pretty confident it wasn't anything. She had a sore throat but. So the next morning, she said yeah dad saw him a little bit and was sort of class I saw a little bit of you know, it was run now daisy read but. So I just wanted to do the right thing I call the school, I told on, and so they required to go get a chest, you know so that that's a Mani Mani Mani. Last week, last Monday. We just I just took over to testing site that's close firehouse and. At cal state with the other side over there, and the results came back the very next morning negative. Time, but last week. was already in shortly because. Thursday and Friday where parent teacher conferences you. So she. We just allow her to stay home, even on Wednesday. yeah we have the water on Tuesday. is all about on Tuesday, and I was just said alone and pull her teacher. When I got an email that. from her teacher That said, you know I had to leave school today because I was having some pains and the kids are probably going to be talking about it, so I just wanted to give you a heads up i'm doing Okay, so he we had a substitute anyway. Even to come back right away to another day so on."
480.0,Provider,So she got a whole week off.
12433.0,Patient,she's been doing okay yeah. It was just trying to get her back into the routine.
480.0,Provider,Oh that's a struggle Monday mornings are the worst my kids do not like to wake up.
12433.0,Patient,late. You know 945 and. I can't sleep. So we gotta. You. Know Tony. She has she's retired.
480.0,Provider,"yeah Monday mornings, I do melatonin with my kids to except they're old enough now to give it to themselves so every night i'm like did you guys already get melatonin I think so i'm like okay well, if you think so i'm not double dosing you. So we have some hitter this."
12433.0,Patient,She. likes to stay up on. Like binge watch like. She follows. First. Watch like episode after episode of.
480.0,Provider,that's fine.
12433.0,Patient,yeah she's.
480.0,Provider,Right.
12433.0,Patient,chloe.
480.0,Provider,"chloe. Why was I thinking. I get everyone's kids their names messed up for some reason I had in my head, that your daughter's name is skylar but must be someone else yeah."
12433.0,Patient,cool with a K.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, like the kardashian."
12433.0,Patient,yeah we I. didn't even know who that who they were. and which no she doesn't have all.
480.0,Provider,The little thing. that's funny I actually really love the name chloe that was one of mine growing up that was one of the names I was going to name my daughter that I never had.
12433.0,Patient,yeah. A lot of it. goes by there's another there's another one.
480.0,Provider,there's still an age.
12433.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
12433.0,Patient,"But one other thing I wanted to mention is I guess. I can look at the calendar. Because remember on Saturday. He said oh spat you to check in with a virtual clinic. So I checked in with them and they said that, I guess, because you're already on every other week. schedule. I just mentioned that I might need to have another new with you. Really soon. In order to stay in compliance."
480.0,Provider,"For the month because the one I canceled was oh wait no that wasn't. Okay, so we have. Do we not have schedule Oh, maybe we don't have any more scheduled."
12433.0,Patient,"For more I see the last time that we met with. man. Okay, so does that mean that we have to have another one for the 13th of this long."
480.0,Provider,No so. Your prescriptions are monthly right.
12433.0,Patient,hmm.
480.0,Provider,"I mean two weeks okay. yeah so as long as it's not affecting your prescription which it shouldn't because we can override it. We don't have to necessarily follow the same so the guidelines of the two appointments a month. mainly come from the opiate use disorder program because we're giving them suboxone and suboxone has to be highly regulated. So people that are not on suboxone we have a little more leeway as far as like what compliance actually affects, so I think, as long as we do another one before the end of this month, we should be fine, but we can schedule it for next week, just to be sure that we have. yeah let's do next week, if that works for you just to be sure i'm. Okay So what do I have next week, I have a. If we're looking at Monday I could do a 1030 your time 130 my time. And then we still don't know when you're going back to work right I think that's why we didn't schedule anymore after today it's because we weren't sure what. was going to happen with work."
12433.0,Patient,Right and. The problem that. just got me kind of stressed.
480.0,Provider,about it.
12433.0,Patient,"it's just because i'm. I was on an well when the pandemic started. The Union that i'm in. They gave the option to everybody, like if you work if you don't feel safe on the work you know or. for any reason, then we will auto you know you take. To have on employment, so I was like okay well my dad was was with us, I don't want to take any chances. i'm going to just go ahead and collect unemployment. And then. So I was on unemployment i've been on it, this whole time you know and then. i've just developed this anxiety over over the pandemic and I was part of the reason I was going back to work and stayed on an appointment right. So. But it's also because of my arm. The issue of my arm. i'm. The adjuster from the insurance company workers COMP. yeah for to the workers COMP. said that while since you've taken yourself out of the workforce, on your and you know all terribly I can't order a good. So. Because I you know always voluntarily stay home just because. So I don't I don't know. But. I guess they're talking the doctor was saying, well, the moment that you had your surgery, you should be eligible for disability from that day forward, but I was still collect their employment. So. Now the autumn, for a lot on employment anymore I stopped. You know I did the claim just ended that you know. So I think we're just trying to get people to get back to work. So there. So I guess to philosophy that I collect unemployment now. Now, I said that i'm eligible for disability, because the doctor. Here, he signed off on just total total disability because."
480.0,Provider,God.
12433.0,Patient,"Because what happened was I don't know if you remember, I had that like setback, with my arm. and A couple days later, I went to I went to go see him and I kind of told I told him about it until you know how, how do you feel about going back to work, do you are. You, on your day off for for give us more silence oh yeah from from allowed to know like Okay, and just signed it all and just just come back in a month and we'll see how to do and. I think they just determined that I might stay off until. till the end of the year."
480.0,Provider,"So that's what I would recommend, as I was thinking like as you were talking, I was like it would be ideal if you could just kind of get disability until the end of the year and start fresh in January that way you have time to deal with all of this."
12433.0,Patient,yeah um but I guess if. You follow people can still kicked in yet so.
480.0,Provider,So you're not actually getting money for visibility.
12433.0,Patient,yeah we haven't gotten anything. Going on like a month.
480.0,Provider,Are you okay financially or now.
12433.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah. But oh. yeah. I also kind of. You know my wife mentioned to me, she says, you need to get back to this that can tell you, just like you don't want to do with yourself. You know that's part of that's part of the problem with my values, not something to do."
480.0,Provider,"Oh for sure yeah so. I tell people all the time, work is my most effective coping skill for my mental health issues for sure I was grateful I got to be a stay at home mom for a while, but my mental health did not thrive in that environment like I need something to focus on that just takes me out of my head. So there's probably very little chance you'll be back to work, beginning of November right."
12433.0,Patient,Right yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm gonna put in an appointment. For you November 1 two because that is to Mondays from next monday's appointment. Just so we have it on the books and covered, because my calendar has been filling up really fast, so that one i'm going to do for 9am your time because i'm pretty wide open that day and that's our normal time."
12433.0,Patient,Okay got it.
480.0,Provider,"Well, it was good to talk to you again sorry."
12433.0,Patient,"My sickness through so many people off and I felt so bad i'm not a good sick person I don't like being sick I don't like taking time off of work, so I was just feeling guilty, the whole time. Oh yeah."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. So dead, it was just a stomach bug that those are nasty. It was one of those were like it was hard for me to sit up without feeling nauseous. Oh well, yeah. But we're all good now everything's back to normal."
12433.0,Patient,"Okay, so. I did. yeah. constantly remind myself a lot, while taking medication. She doesn't like to buy. I don't know if this is good, you can. Just tell me really quick before we go, but you know I just kind of asked my wife, sometimes I said just don't Let me try to talk me out of drinking, you know. I think. That it's cool. Okay. Go ahead and take on medication like please go take your medication yeah."
480.0,Provider,"I think that's smart. Because that's the biggest thing that helps with any sort of addiction mental illness recovery anything is. Accountability right, so the more people that know the more people you have talking reason into you like, for me, I haven't drank in almost 12 years next month will be my 12 years sober and for a while. I wasn't telling people that I was sober because you know, shame and what are people gonna think, and all this and then I learned that having people know i'm sober was such good accountability for me so like anytime I would go. meet people through the kids through school and everything or neighbors that's one of the first things I would tell people is I don't drink i've been sober a while. And then it like removes all the temptation and if they ever were to hear me say hey I need a drink, they would be like a you can't have that. yeah so just having extra accountability is really smart. and helpful for sure. yeah."
12433.0,Patient,asking her for help doing it okay yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah I mean that she has to understand, too, though, that if you have it in your head you're gonna drink you're gonna drink, regardless of whether or not she tells you not to so that's something that. It can turn messy if. You still drink anyways even after she's told me not to, but I think the fact that you're willing to even put this protection accountability in place shows that you. don't want to end up drinking and that will show your wife to. How serious you are so I think it's a healthy decision for sure okay."
12433.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"All right, well, I will see you Friday have a good week."
12433.0,Patient,"Okay, you have a good week thank. You awesome."
480.0,Provider,Thank you bye bye.
