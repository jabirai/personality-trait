Other job and just come full time there anyways so i'm full time but it's still I was, I was full time and part time before, so I mean it's a little increase or decrease in money, but it was kind of worth it."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so what What do you do, for your spare time or for fun."
1710.0,Patient,"Just spend time with my boyfriend whenever he's off work or my kid or. distant lands stuff that's about all Christmas shop about all that down here lately he's got four kids and I got one. Five kids and family members to buy for which he's got a good job, so that makes up for the money last two, which I am planning on switching jobs, I put an application and in Columbus Ohio. where he works it's like a. Factor like a shipping shipping department or something, but they make like plastic pieces that go around like the windows and, like the white vinyl decking and stuff. It starts off like $20 now so it's $17 now and within like two months night within 90 days you get $3 raise so. I think I can i'm where i'm making $9 an hour right now so."
214.0,Provider,wow that's a big increase.
1710.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"How far is that, from where you live."
1710.0,Patient,"an hour and a half that he's already drive you know what I mean we can get a hotel and stay like it will work, the same shift then we'll just stay at a hotel because I get I get a discount on rooms, so I can get rooms cheap why worked at Hill and before. I get rooms for cheap so. I would pay it's about the same for gas we pay for gas every day for a room so."
214.0,Provider,"Right, I agree."
1710.0,Patient,A lot more sleep if we just stay.
214.0,Provider,And and and. What are the hours is.
1710.0,Patient,"where you are. What yeah it's midnight, but like in a two week period, you only work a week like you work two days you're off today's you worked three days or off three days, so you work half the time that you're allowed as much overtime, as you want like you can go in and. soften um, but you can work as many hours as you want or whatever like they don't. they're not going to stop you from working overtime. overtime, you really good money so."
214.0,Provider,And one more you know if this is going to happen and.
1710.0,Patient,"I just put the application, a few days ago, so but I got pretty good chance with him working there, and he has a couple friends that already work there and they're like higher up on the they been there awhile and they're all pushing for me to get the job so pretty good odds."
214.0,Provider,So so how's that gonna how are we going to navigate between that job and treatment now.
1710.0,Patient,"I get off at like six o'clock in the morning. And my groups or Monday at nine like i'm not going to come home and your streets asleep anyways you know I mean it takes a while to wind down, so the group should be fine and then. i'll just have to schedule, like my one on ones around through that. Like I mean I have my days off so halfway entering our two weeks, you get half a week off of that so still have time to. Do my one on one says."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so what we should do is when we."
1710.0,Patient,"In a perfect world, when I get it. You know the more."

214.0,Provider,"yeah maybe what we'll do is we'll go down to one session with me and just two groups, a month."
1710.0,Patient,idea that'd be great.
214.0,Provider,"Because if you got a. Job right the job is telling me where you're at and serious commitment right. And you're already figuring out. gas prices hotel room and you're thinking about life, you know, thinking of all the things so you know, my concern is. You know we've got to be careful that we don't interrupt your good motivation everything that's going on. But hey man, this is killing me having attendees groups and see you. I get it, so I think it. warrants a discussion on the 29th um okay how's your cravings and oranges spin."
1710.0,Patient,"I don't have any I have not had one urge to get high. I don't even I don't even think about getting like going out and then heroin anymore before, when I was on suboxone it stayed in the back of my mind like I don't know why but. I just I wasn't ready I don't think like it was still like reserve reservation I had or something because, like before it's like constantly it was a battle anymore it's just the time I get to work and deal with life i'm too tired."
214.0,Provider,"yeah it's another full time job it's totally a job, with all the time. It doesn't play well, but you gotta. So the doctor is going to talk to you about this. So I am looking at your drug screen you're coming up with thc you have a medical marijuana card."
1710.0,Patient,"No, I do not. it's i've smoked. It was it was dummies um I got a gummy and I think it was like two days before my drug screen one gummy and then. I think it was a couple of drug screens or that was once drug screen I had thc and also, and that was it just I had a gummy."
214.0,Provider,Bear song.
1710.0,Patient,Because it makes me paranoid yourself.
214.0,Provider,"Right in September, you will good. yeah and."

214.0,Provider,"So he listen i'm not i'm not going to do the you shouldn't thing what i'm gonna do is, I know he's going to talk to you by. His philosophy is. If you don't have a medical marijuana card you gotta stop but here's the thing you're not doing it all the time. yeah it's not an every john's me, and I can."
1710.0,Patient,"toggle ISM is screwed up and it says my system for everyone, I do do it is the last like three weeks."
214.0,Provider,"Right, some people. If I can't process it out, so I think if he has that discussion with you, which he will eventually if it isn't next group of a group after you just need to tell them and i'll tell him to we spoke that I understood it was just something you did it's not a regular team."
1710.0,Patient,"No, not at all I can't I can't function on it so. it's about like taking one of those quantity out."
214.0,Provider,"i'm OK. OK, so I think I mean listen, the only thing we should be ready to discuss is you've got that job and then discuss reducing frequency."
1710.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,You know so just keep doing what you're doing you're doing great let's not miss the. session on the 29th of.
1710.0,Patient,"Okay, I won't. The last two times, I had a one on one with you will, the first first one, I mess, I went to like I was at I was at work and I went to get on and it was like. It was our towns like Christmas lighting thing and, for some reason, like at amp T was down like I could not do anything on my phone I could make a phone call I sent me nothing. wow and the last one I just I just missed it, and that was my fault that."
214.0,Provider,"Everybody but it's Okay, because. you're still going to get the two you need in the month. that's the good lot of this. So it doesn't matter what you didn't. disclose this will you're going to do so that's important and don't forget the patient satisfactory survey."
