14032.0,Patient,"i'm okay just locking in my office, so we can have some time."
726.0,Provider,how's everything with your hair of.
14032.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you i'm. swamped at work so. I didn't have time today."
726.0,Provider,yeah well how are you doing.
14032.0,Patient,I am I am super overwhelmed with life and everything right now. Work is complete shit show and i'm like just barely hanging on by the seat of my pants.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so. I know that last time we talked on. You kind of shoes with the daycare or the with your daughter."
14032.0,Patient,yeah so. I am. I was able to find her a new daycare facility and um she's going to start on this coming Monday. So. We got that going and then i'm licensing is investigating the the abuse allegations.
726.0,Provider,So okay there.
14032.0,Patient,"yeah. takes about 30 to 90 days for them to complete their report, so i'm just kind of waiting on that to to come in and go through."
726.0,Provider,enough for what's what's making you feel overwhelmed I mean I know you have a lot of stuff going on work is busy but. How has it been like the past two weeks and you've been feeling really overwhelmed or more recently.
14032.0,Patient,"yeah so um I have a lot of responsibility on the APP work as it is like i'm i'm so I don't know if I told you what I do but i'm i'm a property manager and I manage. I managed five buildings down here in downtown sacramento. And my biggest. Well, my biggest property that I focus on is an apartment complex, so I have 96 residents and then I have 1233 commercial building or commercial businesses. I am the only onsite like office person, and then I have an onsite maintenance person who. assist me with like the everyday people the building. Well, he he's going through some stuff and has basically been like MIA for it he's been going downhill for like a month and a half. Two months. But it's kind of like i'm. coming to a head he hasn't been to work in. Like 10 days, and so it just increases my already heavy workload, because now, I have to step in and do what I can do to cover for him not being here. It just is just a lot more on my plate than. Normal."
726.0,Provider,"Because of that. And are you like, when you get home are you able to like. kind of rest, or do you feel any any anywhere in your day where you can kind of relax."
14032.0,Patient,"No so i'm like I get home and i'm my daughter's so freakin needy and so um you know I spend time with her and make her dinner and then lay down with her go to bed wake up and start all over again the next day. yeah I am i'm I am having a friend of mine and pick her up from school like in well because i've been having to work late. um so i've been having a friend of mine pick her up from school it's been almost every day, this week, so that I can work late and then. It gives me like extra kind of time in the evening for myself it's not very much, but when I get a little bit of time i'm, not least, I haven't been leaving the office until like six or seven."
726.0,Provider,wow and what and you're going in early for work too.
14032.0,Patient,yeah I didn't hear about anywhere between eight 830.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, oh gosh yeah. it's you know it's just. A friend that you said that's kind of like a mother figure. Okay."
14032.0,Patient,"All right, Erica Erica used to be my boss so um when I worked for Bank of America, she was my she was my boss and. She was so cool, like me, I was just a baby when I work there and MIA was sick a lot when she was a baby and she would let me bring her to work with me and like. I know she would hang out in the back of the bank like you know, in her play pen and she was a good she was a good boss like she was always really supportive and everything and we've just remained friends over the years. And my daughter's God mom and. Like she is amazing like. Absolutely moving like she's an angel."
726.0,Provider,so good.
14032.0,Patient,yeah she's like an angel.
726.0,Provider,Do you feel supported at work like with whoever your supervisors or anything because it sounds like you're doing a lot of work and you're staying late a lot.
14032.0,Patient,"No, I don't really feel like supported so i'm like this is not the first time that I like there's been serious issues with him might just not performing you know well, not being a team player and he's i'm his boss and he's disrespectful to me, at times, you know and. had a lot of issues with him and i've tried to terminate him but HR didn't support it."
726.0,Provider,And so.
14032.0,Patient,um we're now trying to they're trying well me and my direct supervisor are pushing for termination but I don't know if a car is going to allow us to terminate him.
726.0,Provider,So part of the Union is that why.
14032.0,Patient,"No um it's a big property management company and they're concerned about being sued. You know, like they don't want. Any legal ramifications for like you know firing him and then him being able to sue us for wrongful termination."
726.0,Provider,"Why. Like if he hasn't been out work, though, is it because he has like a medical reason or is he struggling with addiction I."
14032.0,Patient,"I think he's struggling with addiction, but that's not what he's saying um. So the first time, so like i'm half after every three day holiday every after every three day weekend he calls in sick, the next day. And then, so this kind of like started Labor day um so we had a three day weekend for Labor day he called in sick Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and on the third day I let him know that he needed to bring me a note before he came back to work. So the following morning, which would was they for. I came in, he was clocked in and working and i'm like did you bring a note because you know that's our policy, you have to bring a note. To say that. you're cleared to return. He didn't have a note. And he said that he wasn't able to get a note, and so I helped him login to like a virtual physicians thing and get that know. And so I realized now I probably shouldn't have done that I probably should have let that be the reason he was terminated, but I didn't I help them and. And he got to keep his job so. That was my corner. that's where it kind of like all started and it's been downhill, since then, so just recently, he said that his sister died. um and so he called in on Monday, saying that he just found out his sister died, and that he wouldn't be in and then he called out again on Tuesday. And then yesterday he he called and said that he would be in but late, and when I pulled up he was outside with a resident, and he was crying and hysterical and like. Just just acting like like not how you should act in front of a resident, you know, like very dis kebab related he was he hadn't shaved he smelled bad."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
14032.0,Patient,"yeah so I was like i'm. I can't make you go home, but I think that you know if you're not able to work and pull yourself hold yourself together like maybe you should consider you know going on and so he said that yeah he needed one more day and then this morning he text me and said that. Is he just he just found out his sister killed herself and that he isn't he's he said he's all fucked up and like you know. he's got excuses why he's not coming in and he's calling in sick i'm so. that's why they haven't. moved to terminate them."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that sounds like he's struggling, but I mean."
14032.0,Patient,"He really is yeah he really is struggling like um I find them to be extremely manipulative. Like. He is so disrespectful to me like so disrespectful to me and. Yesterday he when he was outside in front of the resident he's like and I told him I think he should go home and he's like I just don't want you to fire me I don't want to lose my job and i'm you know doing that in front of one of our residents, which is uncomfortable. And then he comes in here to the office and he's like a blubbering mess and he's like you were such a good lady, you are a good good lady and and I just appreciate you so much like he's so full of shit."
726.0,Provider,Like he treats me like garbage.
14032.0,Patient,"he's disrespectful he's rude to me, but yet i'm such a good lady like. yeah he's manipulative."
726.0,Provider,"I mean you have five, I can see the stress because of the five properties and just managing all of the work that you've been doing."
14032.0,Patient,"um. yeah it's overwhelming and then to to deal like with his shit on top of it, you know yeah it's just it's just overwhelming I would have. I mean, I get it, maybe he can't he can't do it, but I would have more respect for him if he would be like i'm struggling with addiction or i'm struggling with alcoholism. And i'm not okay like I would have so much more respect for him. All this other bullshit but I can't you know. I can control him and how he chooses to deal with it."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you could. You know I mean it's up to him, but if it's through HR HR can't tell his supervisors anything so I mean, I can see, I can see a lawsuit if they know if someone is struggling and they're not offering help or like Oh, we can refer you to get some like counseling or go to treatment or something."
14032.0,Patient,"yeah I referred him to our employee assistance Program. So I didn't do that um you know cuz I do, I do have a heart and I, you know, am compassionate to him and his situation you know and. So I did provide him with our resource, you know our assistance program for employees um but I unfortunately can't like like he has to Paul you know. My game. yeah so. definitely want him to to get whatever help he needs, you know."
726.0,Provider,"So, with the stress that you're under you know i'm trying to think of. You know, ways, because it sounds like you're with people all the time you, with your daughter or your with people at work, the whole time it's like. How can even if it's just for a little bit that space of time, that would be for yourself, you know, maybe I don't know if you have like a big time for your daughter like what what would feel. Like your self care for you."
14032.0,Patient,"I really want that, like so I really. I have a bad um i've created a bad routine with us, where I lay down with her when it's time for bed, and so um I literally she calls it. balls that cuddle her I literally have to cuddle her and hold her in my arm. For her to go to sleep and this monster that now she will not go to sleep on her own i'm in any capacity, if I am there. And it's a monster I created. A bad a big monster."
726.0,Provider,What time she goes to bed.
14032.0,Patient,"Like 839. After that is it Nice was higher. Well, I normally I normally just pass out like with her, you know. i'm like laying there you know, like and i'm holding her normally by the time it takes her to doze off. i'm asleep. I can fall asleep really quickly like I. So in every now and again, like all be asleep for like a little bit and then all wake up and like get up. But usually I just stay down."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's not like it, because it's you and her it's not like you have another person to be like let's trade nights where we we put the kids to bed is so. It makes it difficult to kind of plan anything out, but I want there with work is there, like. What are you comfortable doing like How long do you feel like it can sustain the pace of the work that you're at now."
14032.0,Patient,i'm. Like how long can I do this.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
14032.0,Patient,"I don't know. Like I don't know probably like maybe a couple more weeks and the sad part is. it'll probably get harder before it gets easier. If you know, like let's say we do terminate him the time that it takes to hire somebody else and get somebody else here like you know what I mean like. it'll probably get harder before it gets easier. But i'm kind of expecting that."
726.0,Provider,"i'm thinking of like. we're gonna have so much going on it's like we can't smell, and we can like fix and change everything from where it's at right now but it's like how how to manage these feelings of being overwhelmed and kind of like. What you're already doing is you're aware of it, but it's like What do you do with it. So trying to figure out it's like yeah I feel overwhelmed but what am I going to do to kind of help them to have that not take over my day is i'm overwhelmed all the time and i'm. You know I don't know if there's any part of the day, where you could like take a breather maybe through lunch or something, but to just slow down and just do one thing at a time. Just to kind of break it up a little bit, because when you're fast paced the whole time it's exhausting you're gonna get tired very quickly."
14032.0,Patient,yeah i'm gonna crash and burn you know.
726.0,Provider,You know.
14032.0,Patient,"So I do have a Disneyland trip coming up, you know so i'm super excited for that i'm going to take full week off."
726.0,Provider,about some.
14032.0,Patient,"I know i'm so excited. So, like that's coming up like i'm holding on to it, I think we have like what 16 I have like 16 days before we leave."
726.0,Provider,I thought.
14032.0,Patient,"Like oh my gosh it's finally coming. yeah so. I am i'm just kind of holding on to that, but yeah I mean I don't know, I think that, like. I can, I can do this, like if if he's terminated and like we can hire somebody else I know that long term that is going to be better and like. I will probably be more relieved to know that. Somebody else will be here, then I would be if he stays like if that makes sense."
726.0,Provider,yeah not that doesn't make sense.
14032.0,Patient,"And being here just all around makes my job harder, you know he's lazy he's not a team player he's rude he. He doesn't follow policy and procedure, I find him to be. I find his behavior to be dangerous at times and. Like highly responsible and so. Having gone would almost be like a relief, even though it would be hard for a while, like it would. Almost be more comforting to know that he is on his way out."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14032.0,Patient,yeah. So. I guess. i'm.
726.0,Provider,Not you go ahead.
14032.0,Patient,"Oh, I was was that I guess my mom is doing better. She um she's getting ready to go to a rehab facility. In Arizona. For like. For like rehabilitation, for I guess she has West Nile virus or something."
726.0,Provider,Really that's so like rare.
14032.0,Patient,I don't know like this is coming from my brother in it. that's what my brother told my uncle so I don't I don't know.
726.0,Provider,Really what's going on.
14032.0,Patient,"yeah hmm yeah that's what that's what he said. She um my uncle said that she's she's awake but she's you know. kind of like still discombobulated so I don't know she had a stroke, or something. Apparently she's doing. Apparently she's doing better. So i've been toying with the idea of i'm planning a trip to go see her and like say what you know say my goodbyes not even say what I need to say because there isn't really anything I need to say but. Like say my goodbyes Sir so when she does pass I don't feel so. You know. what's the order yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Like not like you want closure, if anything, were to happen."
14032.0,Patient,"yeah. it's weird because I don't really feel like there's anything that I need to say to her like i've tried to say what what I wanted to say to her, but um. i'll never get from her what I mean and so. there's there's no point you know in like trying to force that. But it would be nice to tell her, you know that I love her, and you know. Say say goodbye to her. While she's on she's still here."
726.0,Provider,"You. know what to Jennifer it's like. Sometimes we don't get what we need from like let's say our caregivers our parents or whoever, but sometimes like like you like like you met your boss at Bank of America. And know meet people throughout your lifetime in your journey that kind of fill in the spots of what you didn't get sometimes. And we're still trying to think of it's like all like I didn't maybe have that traditional like mother that that I that I would have wanted, but. But someone came into my life that really like just brighten it up and just like really made it so much easier and like it just feels really good."
14032.0,Patient,"value. yeah. Erica value to my life, you know. Like she does it gives me like X like it's extra family it's like. They have dinner every night at 6pm like we have you know it's. always a standing invitation, you know, like. it's just like that that extra stability, and you know. That you know that family dynamic. there's you know there's kids everywhere friggin animals everywhere. Like it's like I don't know it's it's yeah I I totally get it because, like I am and i've always said this i'm really lucky like I have a shit mother, but like I have so many badass women in my life. You know, like. Really really do do that shit in our life so good, to me, you know. yeah i'm thankful for that. yeah really am."
726.0,Provider,"And you may think of like maybe there's a night that they could watch, you know your daughter, so you can just have a day three bucks a night for yourself just to rest and. You know sleep or whatever, whatever it is that you need because you know when you give yourself time refer just you by yourself um it's going to be in it, it will feel it won't feel like. you're lost you're going to feel like you can kind of connect with yourself and then like figure out what your next step is or what's going on, or just sometimes just the quiet really. can be helpful and it's not too much quiet because you know that the next day you're going to still be with your kid and see them so it's not like the over you know when you have like too much time off and it doesn't feel that great."
14032.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think i'm gonna I think i'm going to have them take me out on Friday night, you know so that I can kind of like sleep and chill you know."
726.0,Provider,watch a movie.
14032.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I am. I definitely need it, I was, I was actually supposed to work this weekend i'm in napa to help with one of the properties out there, but luckily like at the last minute, my boss called and he's like I think we got it covered and we. have to work like six days this week so like Oh, thank God. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"But yeah yeah just keep tabs of like when you're feeling overwhelmed and if you need to reach out Jen like even if it's not the way that we meet i'll I have no problem, like we can meet it's not an issue at all. You just want to vent or whatever it is that you need. To just kind of get through, you know."
14032.0,Patient,"yeah I am I was also going to tell you that um well, I was supposed to do my psychiatry appointment yesterday. um but the the the lady that I was going to do it with um she had an emergency and had to reschedule right. I was talking to her. Yesterday, I think I want to like. By I don't know how to explain it, but like. I really like struggling with like energy and like. Like doing stuff that like I don't if I don't have to get up in in like do something, then like."
726.0,Provider,I don't do it so.
14032.0,Patient,"i'm wondering if it's like my depression and stuff so i'm going to. Talk to her and see like if maybe like we need to adjust my depression medicine, because i'm not like i'm not like you know I can't move, but i'm definitely like if I don't have to do it, I don't want to do it. So I think that's a good idea."
726.0,Provider,"I think it's good to talk about it with her, but I would also, I would also include like everything that you're doing right now, because you're working a lot too so even the sides. um you know you're feeling depressed but also on top of that you're being. you're feeling overwhelmed and you also have a lot going on at work and you're also dealing with a Co worker that it doesn't feel it feels like it takes a lot of energy, it sounds like to you know. communicate with or deal with. So you know all of these things in combination of course the it to me it sounds like you're just super tired. um but it doesn't hurt to ask the psychiatrists and see what they think about it, because i'm not a psychiatrist so they might be able to direct you better and with that, but i'm be you just have a lot of like. circumstances that are kinda zapping your energy and it couldn't be also just being at work and just having to give give give of your time."
14032.0,Patient,"Even like I i've been feeling like this, though, for a long time, like. Even before even before i'm. like this, this last month or so. i've not like this for a long time. Like i'm like my brain wants to my my brain wants to you know do steps um and and get up and like like on the shot on the weekends and stuff like I I don't even like hardly shower like. I don't know i'm struggling like i've been struggling and i've been struggling with that for like it's been it's been a long time, like."
726.0,Provider,Our okay okay that's not.
14032.0,Patient,"um it's not just like a recent thing. Also, I think, I think, maybe adjusting some of the medication or seeing like. If there's something else. That is is better recommended."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
14032.0,Patient,yeah and plus I haven't really seen like a psychiatrist anyways um it's all like my medications always been with my primary care. So maybe it's a better thing for me to see. Somebody that specializes in that you know.
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no it's a good idea, so once your next appointment with the psychiatrist."
14032.0,Patient,The 14th.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so that will be in another seven days, so another week. So you give it another week I would tell her what you told me that it's been six seven months and you've been feeling this way i'm. i'm when you say that you feel super tired and exhausted, is there, like if you were to scan your body, where where does that energy stay, do you feel it is it in your in your stomach in your arms and your legs, I know it's a weird question but i'm just curious about something."
14032.0,Patient,"Probably like. Like my shoulders and, like my my testing my stomach."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so like the upper body. yeah okay alright, so I want to try something with you on again. it's called I don't know that we talked about you know eventually doing trauma work, but for the beginning stages it's it's really. Doing other things before we get to that place so what i'm going to do with you it's called I I movement desensitization so basically, I wanted to just focus on the body sensations that are coming up, if you feel like. And I know in mobile do it in just a second, but if you start to feel overwhelmed or something's coming up, and it feels very uncomfortable for you and you want to stop. You just you could just like put your hand up or something and now know, to stop doing the I movement Okay, I just want you to. What i'm going to ask you to do is I want you to focus on the parts of your body that you said that you were feeling that energy of like. tiredness all right, and I want you to follow my fingers So when I say follow my fingers like it's not your head it's just your eyes Okay, and just you'll. Hopefully, what will happen is. The movement, the sensations that you're feeling in your body will start moving out or if your body, where wants to move, but let's just see where it goes okay. Did you feel if you feel nothing that's okay to just let me know we'll stop okay. Okay, all right so i'm gonna. i'm going to put my fingers right here, and so what I want you to do is just focus on the body sensation that you that you feel of the tiredness and just follow my fingers okay there and there's and there's no wrong way for you to do this so whatever comes up. we'll see where it goes okay. Was that like."
14032.0,Patient,kind of fresh you. know. Like relaxing.
726.0,Provider,Okay okay so. And so.
14032.0,Patient,I feel a little lighter.
726.0,Provider,Oh alright cool so let's keep going with it okay. So trust your body and knows what it's doing. and focus focus back on that last sensation that you were feeling the lighter the feeling a little bit lighter and I just want you to follow the fingers okay.
14032.0,Patient,What is that. yeah.
726.0,Provider,"it's I movement desensitization so you know how like. You know how your brain has to chill hemet like hemispheres. When when you when you do it with me it's it's the sensation like if you were running. Okay, so it's it helps slow down the system. So, so your natural like you know when you're anxious and you're. When you're they call it the sympathetic system, I want to get too technical or anything but it's the part of the body like when you do, that I movement. It stimulates something on both sides of the body, so it starts to calm the nervous system, a little bit. And it distracts you from all the thoughts coming in your head, so it kind of just kind of goals were wants to so like the body sensation. that's why I say trust your body, because it knows what it's doing that I movement is doing something and you're getting a feeling from it you're getting a reaction."
14032.0,Patient,yeah like the tension of my back is like like like less like I don't feel the tension on my spine like I did before.
726.0,Provider,"Okay. good to know, is it still there. Do you are, you still feeling the sensation in your back."
14032.0,Patient,"I mean, I say it's still like a little tight, but it's not like it was. yeah I feel like lighter and then I feel like my my spine like my spine might like loosened up a little bit if that makes sense."
726.0,Provider,"It does it does. And Actually, this is exactly what this is made for that's why we focus on the body sensations. Well, so i'm going to do one or two more sets of that and I want to see if we can get to a point where you don't feel it anymore so we're going to keep doing it, and just track your body if it's still there just let me know we. want to get okay. you're doing perfect. But just focus back on that last feeling that you had in your body get really into with it and just kind of get in it okay. How does it feel now is it still there."
14032.0,Patient,No yeah it's a move like I I feel better. Like. Like the like the tension in my back in my body area is like I can feel it like.
726.0,Provider,Okay.
14032.0,Patient,yeah like I feel lighter.
726.0,Provider,"And what we're gonna do is we're going to do another set okay. And then i'm going to ask you and see where how it feels at that point okay. Engine no rush no rush i'm not rush on time, I just want to make sure we We really do it okay. you're doing great let me know if my fingers are going too fast or too slow, you let me know what you're comfortable with and i'll adjust to that."
14032.0,Patient,yeah I feel better.
726.0,Provider,So.
14032.0,Patient,Not a surgeon either.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so basically what we did is we desensitize. We did a desensitization. We are not that wasn't doing any kind of processing, so what we did a similar to what we would do if we were targeting that specific memory that was traumatic. Is your body is processing the feeling so you're feeling overwhelmed so then in turn your body is physically feeling the feeling of being overwhelmed and having a busy day. So basically your body just naturally calm like move the energy out, and I know it sounds weird but it's it's such a great like tool to use."
14032.0,Patient,That was cool.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
14032.0,Patient,That was cool yeah.
726.0,Provider,"that's cool so when you're so what I would want to do is in our next session. What we can do is see how you're feeling at that point, and maybe we can target just the feeling of feeling overwhelmed. Okay cuz press, we can do a do we can do that again and we can do it specifically for the feeling of being overwhelmed."
14032.0,Patient,yeah that'd be cool. yeah yeah.
726.0,Provider,cool.
