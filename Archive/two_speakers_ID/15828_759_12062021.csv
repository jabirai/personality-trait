759.0,Provider,Oh i'm sorry about that.

15828.0,Patient,i'm doing okay yeah things are okay um. No low lows are high highs so right in the middle.
759.0,Provider,"right in the middle Okay, and are you doing good therapy as well."
15828.0,Patient,"uh yes, I have been yeah."
759.0,Provider,And how's that working for you.
15828.0,Patient,um I I have not been getting a ton out of it.
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15828.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,And you're not been getting a ton out of the Fed is there any particular reason or it's just not the right format for you.
15828.0,Patient,"um. I think. It feels like I think what has been working is like. feeling, supported by a group and. Recognizing like. You know what. i'm going through is not the. necessarily solely unique but what's not um I also go to. codependent anonymous meetings, and those are slightly more specific so everybody in there is. Dealing with slightly similar situations. And then the group therapies here, it feels like they're it's more of a broad range of. challenges. And so I I think kind of the support that's being provided. Is. Like a more generalized to address a bunch of areas, as opposed to like specialized for a specific area."
759.0,Provider,"sense. yeah so you're getting more kind of out. You know just going to you're codependent guru and that seems to be working well for you. You know. And yeah and I do agree, you know these groups are are meant to be kind of fucking general sometimes they have a topic. Sometimes they don't but it's not really Pacific in terms of one area that you might want to work on some groups are like that, but then some others, you know are kind of not. So I get that yeah yeah what's the name of the group that you're in."
15828.0,Patient,Oh gosh I don't know it's Tuesday at Tuesday at 11 group I don't know what the name.
759.0,Provider,you're like on Tuesdays Tuesday mornings.
15828.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah yeah yeah. yeah that's all the. let's see I think that's all it. has given me. Or at least, all I can find I should say. Tuesday at 11 yeah. You bet for here or the codependency one. freaky yes yeah all I have is to stay alive, but I think."
759.0,Provider,"You say 11 okay. Okay. yeah so you know, like as you go along in the program way when you meeting weekly or twice a week every twice a month."
15828.0,Patient,Twice a month.
759.0,Provider,"Twice a month, we can put that down, you know to one time, once a month, as you go along with the program okay. Okay yeah because you already have group, you know you have record dependent group that's working for you, so you said that you mood hasn't been a low or not, you know down it just been stabilize. mm hmm okay good. And what's one thing you're gaining from the codependent group."
15828.0,Patient,"um. I relate to a lot of the there's specifically there was like a chart that sort of outline things that are common. For someone with codependency to say or thing and then on the right side column. It gave like. adjusted ways of thinking. So it might say something like. I like. My value is determined by my ability to help others or whatever, and then like on the right hand column, it would say like. My value is inherent in who I am so trying to sort of like shift mindset from. How I typically think or feel. That might be. A armful or unhelpful. To my recovery process into a way that might make it more helpful."
759.0,Provider,good to hear it's good that you're gaining something from the whole process.
15828.0,Patient,"yeah it's a process and. Aware that it's not linear so some weeks, make a lot of progress, some weeks, not so much. But. yeah man it's good it's good."
759.0,Provider,"Good good. All right, what would you like to focus in on today, what can I, you know what would you like to talk about or what can I help you."
15828.0,Patient,"um. uh well i'm sort of in between. How I feel about. Being on antidepressants. i'm not I just don't know how I feel about it. In the past, when I took them I took them along with a lot of other things like I was doing meditation and therapy and exercising and changes to my diet. And it felt like it was all of that stuff but I saw a distinct change. Over time, so I couldn't really isolate how much of it was attributed to taking antidepressants. And then. I went off antidepressants and then the pandemic came around. and I felt. Obviously depressed or anxious which felt. Like a natural response to the pandemic. You know, it had really like adversely affected my routine and my work and everything else. And so I guess I just don't know where I stand with it i'm not sure if. You know my goal is to feel better. So sometimes I feel like well the antidepressants are going to make me feel better great and then other times I feel like. I would like to be able to feel better. If antidepressants aren't necessary if there are other ways for me to feel better I would prefer that but I don't know that. that's possible so I you know i'd really. i'm having trouble knowing how I feel about it, I guess."
759.0,Provider,"So you're having trouble with you know figure out how you feel about taking the antidepressants. But then. You know medication is an added tool, you know just like we use tools and we have coping skills, you know, considering just added tool, just to help you feel better you know. And i'm all about if it's helping you know if you feel like it's helping didn't die is something that we can go with, but you are unsure if it's helping right. Correct yeah so that's that in lies that kind of like you know, like Okay, should I really be taking us I don't really know if it's helping or if it's not helping you know, like and how long have you been taking the anti depressant."
15828.0,Patient,"A. crash a couple months, maybe."
759.0,Provider,"A couple months when you should have by now, I would say, like i'm no doctor. But just in terms of my professional experience usually even at the one month mark people start to notice like if it's helping or not. or notice a difference, you know you're at the two month mark and you're still not noticing if it's helping or not, then you know that is of concern and this probably you know, a question, because you get your medication from bright heart tell for from a different prescriber."
15828.0,Patient,bright art House at the at the moment yeah.
759.0,Provider,"At the moment, okay."
15828.0,Patient,i'm changing the health insurance. So I don't know if it'll continue that way but yes.
759.0,Provider,"Okay. that's probably conversation to have with your physician just you know, like Okay, no this doesn't. You know I can't gauge, if this is working for me or not, which is of concern for me, you know, be a good conversation to have with your physician, you know, but in terms of how you're feeling overall you know, like let me actually some questions in regards to that. Okay, and before you start taking antidepressants when she moved stabilized."
15828.0,Patient,"uh. No, I was also. I guess the no, but I should say that I was in a relationship that was like. harder than it needed to be and. i'd since. sort of exited that relationship, but that was definitely a contributing factor like i'm part of the. codependency work is like. me sort of taking a step back from being engaged in relationships, where I might feel. I might feel an obligation to sort of like invent overly invest in have someone else's feeling so uh my mood was not stable. But i've sent exited that relationship, so this is that sorry, this is the long answer, but that's sort of issues like I don't know if this is. Related to sort of like the work i'm doing to focus on myself or if it's related to the antidepressants."
759.0,Provider,"yeah that's Another point I was going to bring up because she can be doing something else that might just be working for you, that is stabilizing me. Even without the medication so it's hard to know you know which one is causing you know how to direct the fact, as far as you feeling, you know, like your mood is stable like at this point."
15828.0,Patient,mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,So just writing down.
15828.0,Patient,"Information, no, no problem."
759.0,Provider,What are some of the other things you're doing as as far as like coping those coping skills.
15828.0,Patient,um I try and make like a mental gratitude list in the morning.
759.0,Provider,Talking about gratitude and good yeah that's good.
15828.0,Patient,"yeah So the first thing I do in the morning it's not automatic sometimes I wake up stressed or anxious. But then I remember to do things I try and think of. You know, a short list of things that i'm grateful for to start my day. Like I said i'm sort of making more time to focus on my needs so i'm taking space where I need it. which has been helpful i'm. A. And then I meditate sometime in the afternoon usually."
759.0,Provider,You meditate and afternoon okay. How long does your meditation go for.
15828.0,Patient,"I do, between a like 12 minute one do a 30 minute one."
759.0,Provider,So.
15828.0,Patient,"yeah sometimes the 30 minute one is like a rest meditation so I listened to meditations that are focused on sort of like. Rest like sleep so sometimes I fall asleep. But, in general, they are focused on sort of like self love and. yeah so fluff I guess would be the big one."
759.0,Provider,"I find it interesting that you, you dive into kind of like self love hasn't been a point in time, in your life when you can say that you love yourself or not."
15828.0,Patient,"uh yeah I would say. i've been part of what i'm. realizing are recognizing through. Examining my codependency is that a lot of my self worth I needed to how I was of service to other people, or how I was impacting other people, so if I could do things to help other people I and they felt good, then I would feel really good. But if I tried things and it didn't make them feel better than I felt really bad. And coming out of like relationships, I would often feel. Good have very low. Self image, because I felt like I had lost purpose, because I wasn't able to like positively impact somebody or that, like my efforts to improve their quality of life, or whatever. fell short so in those instances, I had like very low self image and I would say, like that is a constant thing to sort of remind myself about of like my value is not measured by. My ability to. affect positive change and other people or anything. Something i'm trying to focus."
759.0,Provider,"you're trying to do so, your self worth doesn't it's not me not privy to just you know much you for other people, you know, like it's more than i'm learning to kind of like have your self worth me doing things, maybe for yourself. You know ain't into your needs and your wants and your desires."
15828.0,Patient,Exactly yes yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah. Okay. So I want to map out like a treatment plan for you and I just want to see where it can you know I hope you in your mental health journey.
15828.0,Patient,Okay. um. I don't know that I haven't I don't know what I need. Specifically. that's part of like. that's part of the journey i'm on I think is like quieting. Trying to quiet my everything i'm thinking about and like really listen to what it is that I need.
759.0,Provider,So maybe identifying your needs.
15828.0,Patient,Yes.
759.0,Provider,yeah that makes sense okay.
15828.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense.
759.0,Provider,yeah so identifying your needs maybe learning more about yourself.
15828.0,Patient,mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,That can be something also move work on. Is there anything about the past that you like to dive into.
15828.0,Patient,"I don't know uh. You know I wish I had a. I presumably. it's come to my attention that my parents had a they're divorced now. But they had a potential a codependent relationship. They got divorced, when I was pretty young so. I wasn't around for a lot of it. But i'm sure that's had an impact on me."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so they're called dependent relationship yeah we we repeat the patterns, you know that we are shown you know, but as children. And yes, kind of like diving into like attachment styles, you know that we learned, you know in childhood and that we kind of like repeat."
15828.0,Patient,In right.
759.0,Provider,it's just a matter of breaking those patterns okay so we'll talk a little bit more about that in future sessions to. Is there anything else that I haven't mentioned.
15828.0,Patient,um no I don't think so. Sorry i'm late. My phone kept bringing from bright heart so uh apparently I.
759.0,Provider,"know I sent a I thought that you they probably were trying to reschedule because I. I thought that I had last yes, I like he probably didn't it's not called log back end so I put in that you might need a reschedule that's probably why they're."
15828.0,Patient,"Calling oh okay. yeah no problem. But anyway, sorry um."
759.0,Provider,"But yeah so we'll talk more about you know I didn't identify your needs learning more about yourself and talk a little bit more about co dependent relationships, as far as you know, those patterns or left life patterns that you have learned and how to unlearn. yeah. Okay yeah so let's talk a little bit about about identifying your needs, you know, like sometimes that's hard because, like you said you're on a journey and when you're trying to learn more about yourself you're trying to. Think of you know, like our learn more about what your needs are you know so what's one of your needs that you have learned so far."
15828.0,Patient,"well. I mean, I have, I think, is to like. feel purposeful uh. I have in the past that you'll be did that to like what can I do. For others, I think that's a good, I think that can be good to meet that need, but that can't be the sole thing. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so just having purpose in life."
15828.0,Patient,mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,"And before you have to be that purpose is doing things for other people, and now you're like just shift that a little bit. Well, I do think seating gives me purpose, besides."
15828.0,Patient,uh. I mean.
759.0,Provider,"Sorry, of these questions are redundant, but i'm just."
15828.0,Patient,Trying to know.
759.0,Provider,It can be like.
15828.0,Patient,"A no um they're not redundant. or I don't feel that they are um. I think i'm. A. That. I don't know like you know i've i've only got this one, a. A one life to do all this stuff it's like part of that should just be like enjoying. enjoying it. yeah it's like enjoying my life. I live alone, right now, and I actually really like living alone, but I have felt. Like mild. or almost passive a pressure like societal pressure that like that's not what you want to do is like live alone is that you want to like find a partner and stuff like that and I sort of had a realization like last week that. No, I I really like this, like if it if there wasn't external influences. I would absolutely. I would absolutely keep this like it works for me so."
759.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah you don't have to go to like societal expectations of you know, having a partner or not having a partner or whatever that works well for you."
15828.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,"Like if you learning dad you know you like this kind of like life, where you're building for yourself with just being by yourself and that you feel good in that way you know, all the better, you know, at least for right now, you know this is working well for you."
15828.0,Patient,"You know, yes."
759.0,Provider,"Having your own place. And just living on your own, as you know, something that you very much, enjoy. That goes back to what you're saying your purpose one dean's your purposes is just enjoying life that's it that's you know not have the. II II he he."
15828.0,Patient,"Right. yeah um. yeah the trying to have. Measured expectation, I was reading an Atlantic article yesterday that was basically like. Like measure your expectations about what. Life is supposed to be an offer, and things like that, and again part of that is the gratitude piece, and like also i'm trying until sort of like. limit and eventually hopefully eliminate. social media from my life, because I feel like that puts. That puts a unrealistic expectation that like your life. can be this. great thing all the time, because most of the people. Most of sort of the. stimulus i'm getting from that is a collection of. People celebrating highlights, and so, if that's all you're getting it feels like all anybody's doing is having a good time, except for you. So i'm trying to. curb that. If that makes sense."
759.0,Provider,yeah. it's. Shared on social to me. tends to be. I moments and people's insight when they're having fun are now in doing something and. Those smaller not.
15828.0,Patient,"Yes, a little."
759.0,Provider,bit. Can you hear me OK.
15828.0,Patient,I can hear you.
759.0,Provider,"You can hear me. Okay, might be freezing up sorry i'm not too sure if it's on my end, but I do notice your screen is getting a little bit stuck at some certain points."
15828.0,Patient,yeah that's okay.
759.0,Provider,"yeah we're power drill. yeah so. yeah social media can be kind of forced the word. there's a term that I kind of use so i'm not thinking about it right now. But it's not you know, like how we say like real vs real you know, like instagram vs real life, you know, like how it kind of like books in real life, we want to post on instagram I want to post on Facebook, you know, sometimes it's. Not necessarily what's going on. Now, having those highlights and those drills. You know, he you know, like and it doesn't really give a clear picture to what's happening yeah so I like the fact that you're kind of limiting you know, the amount of time me that she spent on social media yes. yeah just cut it off into their own."
15828.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah open up a book instead or something that's what i'm trying to do.
759.0,Provider,"Good good yeah yeah if you ever need book recommendations if you want any you know, like good books on having you know to deal with kind of like mental health just X me too, because I have a lot of."
15828.0,Patient,Good books right okay. yeah Thank you.
759.0,Provider,"yeah but yeah just opening up a book, you know, sometimes that could be satisfying enough."
15828.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"I think I had a friend who recently has done that, too, she was so like it says spending 1015 minutes on instagram i'm just gonna open up a book and just start reading and then she got through a book, so you know works."
15828.0,Patient,yeah exactly yeah yeah there's a there's other. ways that I can that are healthier for me to engage or occupy my mind or entertain myself or. Whatever it is.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. Do you have a good, you know balance with fight friends, you know, are you getting out engaging with people."
15828.0,Patient,"um yeah ma. ma um. yeah my job is. I. Teach. The improvisational comedy so I get to like my it's very nice and relaxing and fine. And I am fine indeed. The boundaries between like or or the healthy. portions of like socializing that way, but also recognizing that's my job, and then. socializing when I feel like I need something that doesn't feel as work related or and and reaching out or engaging with like a small group of people who I feel like I don't feel any pressure to. Any pressure to be a certain way around if that makes sense."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15828.0,Patient,yeah it does make sense.
759.0,Provider,So you do improv. improv you know we're commenting that must be fine that's.
15828.0,Patient,Fine yeah. yeah it's really. it's great i'm very that often makes my gratitude list. Is yeah we've all got to work and i'm fortunate that my work is like silly the. Light hearted and. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"And that's a good way to connect with other people, but like you said, having boundaries. Yes, like it's important to him, because he doesn't want that to overtake you know all of your time like you want to have good, healthy boundaries and in place so that's good."
15828.0,Patient,"uh yeah. yeah I mean the boundaries it's a big part of it and because I live alone it's like Oh, I can be very content being at home being alone and then sort of recognizing that like hey I should like go out and see somebody or go out and do something. Everything in moderation, you know."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm I like that everything in moderation.
15828.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, well, we talked about like gives you purpose in you know a little bit about your needs. Let me see. I did have a question for you. What about like in the past, you know, like he said that you to attribute your purpose to you know, like helping other people out different things of that nature have you always been like that."
15828.0,Patient,i'm.
759.0,Provider,"There, like a shift or anything of that nature or you just normally just always been that guy that puts people above maybe your own need sometimes."
15828.0,Patient,"uh I think I. mean i'm definitely. A biologically I think. Very introverted and I think with that comes been highly sensitive and so having. yeah an acute sense of like how other people are feeling. What how what I say or do, or what other people say or do, how that impacts other people I think i'm highly aware of that and so i've always been. tried to be responsible, about that. But college. I majored in political science and philosophy for my undergraduate and spent a lot of time thinking about how my actions affect other people and sort of made a more concerted effort to. Think about that to be proactive about that stuff and I think it served me well, and to a point, but again everything in moderation, and I think I over I may be overdid it like there are, how other people feel is not my responsibility, all the time, so. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"yeah it's not your responsibility, all the time yeah you could you know have empathy and compassion towards people you know, like. How they kind of react that's on them. You know control kind of like your reactions and what you do, as a person."
15828.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. Exactly."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you know, being a highly sensitive person, you know walking around in the world of course you're going to feel sometimes whether people feel. You know you're going to pick up on those cues more so than the person that's not you know sensitive, you know and that aspect, and I think that's Okay, you know, to know that about yourself, you know."
15828.0,Patient,yeah I think that's kind of. The big part of this is like I was doing it for so long intentionally. Because. Because I thought it was the right thing to do. But I wasn't paid attention to the cost. What it was costing me.
759.0,Provider,yeah i'm glad you mentioned that you weren't paying attention to the cost that was costing you. mm hmm and what was the cost.
15828.0,Patient,"I think, just like. I. I couldn't identify my own needs anymore. Or what I wanted like I it wasn't even about knowing them and ignoring them, it was like I got so used to not listening to them that I stopped even identifying them."
759.0,Provider,Okay. I see that you know just kind of losing yourself a little bit in our whole process.
15828.0,Patient,mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,yeah. And that goes back to when we first started talking about what's the codependency group that you're in.
15828.0,Patient,And kind of fly.
759.0,Provider,"You know that whole process of you know, paying attention to someone else's needs instead of your own you know, like especially like in a relationship when you're you kind of get lost and. yeah and aspect of having like a relationship."
15828.0,Patient,Exactly yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay. So I want to end off today with. Something I can give you to do you know and in terms of therapy work, and I want you to say that your mood is kind of stabilize you know, like. Which is a good thing and that you're also practicing gratitude you doing your meditation and. One thing. That, I would like, for you to do. is just to keep on doing what you're doing but also maybe journal work. If that makes sense, I know, like, I think you are we do that with the codependency good like guys have a chart right. Maybe, just like from day to day or from week to week or it could be two or three times mountain of the week you just write about how you're feeling how you doing. not feel this way today because. Our I you know why am I feeling this way today, you know just actually yourself simple questions, just to check in so it's a little bit of a check in you know with yourself. Okay, so how you doing how you're feeling. sense."
15828.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good good. All right. Did you have any questions for me or anything any last thoughts words."
15828.0,Patient,"um I don't think so you've been very, very helpful today, thank you."

15828.0,Patient,"i'm gonna well i'm flying to Colorado to beat my mom and then her and I are driving back to California, to have it at my sister's so. yeah uh I guess like pretty big plans, considering the last two years haven't had a ton of plans."
