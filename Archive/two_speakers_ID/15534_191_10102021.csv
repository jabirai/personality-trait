Members so you should be enough, a private location awesome. Okay, all right, then, if you don't have those things, then we usually don't let you in group or if. We noticed that you don't have them. We put you out of group. And you have to go through the virtual clinic usually you won't be counted as attending your group. So groups, as usually what we do your refills okay. If you ever miss a group give us a call, we can either work with you to get your medicines and or work with you to do a makeup group Okay, because we do believe in harm reduction. Okay right So what are some things that you need to do to stay at bright heart health to be compliant. To stay at bright health to have those good outcomes Okay, because buprenorphine is a control substance it is watch, so we have to do your drug screens.

15534.0,Patient,"Usually, is probably like every day, or like once a week Okay, now that I got that vpn it'll probably be about every day okay."
191.0,Provider,"And so what do want to encourage you to we do encourage that you stop the marijuana part of reason, we want to do, that is, that is. Long term the consequences of how that impacts your lungs and then a lot of people notice that it actually makes their mental health worse paranoia anxiety or. And so, as we're talking about these drugs, we want to encourage that just stop them now, we understand that certain things you can't stop all of a sudden, like xanax. is one that will have to work with you to come off of okay and we'll have to work with you, with mental health okay so we'll we're going to target different things and try to take them one day at a time, so one it's not so overwhelming and it's not so much of a shock to the system okay. As I sound like a plan for you."
15534.0,Patient,yeah it does okay.
191.0,Provider,"So it sounds like with the cannabis use you've been using for 17 years is that correct. yeah okay all right, and even though this is a lot I don't don't want you to get discouraged that's why we're going to deal with things, one day, at a time and it's a process okay so journey all right."
15534.0,Patient,it's crazy to hear like. The years of traits ever use like. Each one is so long.
191.0,Provider,"But you know what's encouraging because i've been doing this for a long time, I think is good that you are as young as you are and you're seeking help that's admirable and so we got to all the positive that we can find Jacqueline. We gotta hold on to them okay."
15534.0,Patient,yeah for sure i'm tired of living like this hey and.
191.0,Provider,yeah and you were smart enough at a young age to to start seeking support overcome this so we're going to focus on the positive and it can be overwhelming. But that's why we try to do it one day at a time and for you to not feel like you in this by yourself okay.
15534.0,Patient,yeah.

191.0,Provider,Are you. In your mind. You just yeah and over and you keep playing rewind.
15534.0,Patient,"yeah and thinking about the what else and the wise and all that stupid stuff I shouldn't be thinking about um. But, most importantly, like I just don't feel good like i've tried to get sober. quite a bit and I I just don't feel good sober."
191.0,Provider,"Is it because those those thoughts fluid your mind, or what."
15534.0,Patient,I don't have energy I just I feel crappy i'm tired i'm sluggish my body hurts i'm just well.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's work on one thing at a time okay. Okay, and because the truth is, when you get dependent on the drugs and they're providing you certain things it'll take the body some time we'll just so we will start with the buprenorphine. let's get you where you're not having all that. pain and and get you filling stable, because if you go on up and down it's really hard to find some stability okay. And so. let's put you on the buprenorphine locks on we'll start with that and then will target the."
15534.0,Patient,order that is that just have you checked.
191.0,Provider,It is.
15534.0,Patient,"I can't take like the regular subs they like, give me real bad headaches and I break out. I don't know it's weird I just I tried to take them because that's, the only thing I can find on the streets, which is why I haven't been using them for like."
191.0,Provider,"A week, the way we usually do it because we have that we can't just. Take. We have to be able to witness that you're not able to take it, because. you're ORs actually shows that you can take it, and so the insurance company oftentimes will not release it until we. have evidence that. you're not able to take the able to take the people nor female locks on I will have to work with you on that Okay, and if we find."
15534.0,Patient,Evidence of that okay.
191.0,Provider,"Well, we would you do is start on a low dose of that see how it works have you dose in front of on the camera with one of our nurses and see how that works for you. And then, if we're able if we're able to see and understand because see the thing is you've never taken a dose with us. And it sounds like since you were taking it on the street you don't have any diagnosis of any allergies okay so for assurance purposes and for with us will have to be able to document, if you truly cannot take the medication OK. So i'll work with you on that all right. Okay, so uh definitely want to encourage you not to do to acid Ecstasy Ecstasy or molly and how long have you been using those drugs."
15534.0,Patient,"I tried all those wow laid back when I was like. let's say probably like 23 years or so, so i'd say like 2015 I think."

15534.0,Patient,Like recreational recreational drugs like those parties and stuff that you'd go to the rave that's what it is.

191.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're going to methadone clinic okay so we're going to do what's called the DSM five and I just need a yes or no answer and this 11 questions that's going to take quite a while we're going to see as much of your history as we can get through. Because we have them see if we can adults you all right, and so we have to ask you, these questions so opioid which would be the heroin or. And that also includes the percocet and then you stimulants, which mostly includes your crystal meth but that stimulants also will cover cocaine and crack. And then you sedatives which was mainly your xanax and then the marijuana okay Dan and then for the party jokes acid SSC molly those sorts of things we're going to put the acid we're gonna put that on the hallucinogen and then the other drug alcohol. Okay, so."
15534.0,Patient,"I forgot to tell you that a cocaine is actually my drug of choice, I would rather have it, the math. it's just nowadays methods, all I cannot be good."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and I prefer cocaine, but methods pretty much what you're able to get.
