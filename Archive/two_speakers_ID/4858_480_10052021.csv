Evil he wants to go there, so that's what we're working on, they changed as medicines he's been in and out of the hospital so many times. Some of the stuff that he's been on like for many, many, many years and that's probably the reason he's balling it looks like he's drunk all the time and. You know they don't have the right change any of that shit that's not their their portal they don't. They definitely don't want make him over there. it's, all I can do to go visit so. not dead, to the office and smack somebody so i'm we're going to try to get a move that no real major changes, no improvement sure. yeah that's true he said some improvement he's not. he's not going he hasn't been back to the hospital because of fluid on a card that. They changed his heart medication around so it's obviously working a little better, and they gave him a like this, so. he's having where life is all the time, which makes me feel a little better about the situation, but he falls several times a day, and you know, he was falling here at home do, but not that many times, I mean we're talking five six times a day over there."

And he's got to be having nightmares again, you know mom's not in the same bed with him he's not talking about it much but. he's got to be heaven again and if at least he was it sounds very he would be able to go to his group, and you know, he would be able to they could attend to those needs better."

And I mean i'm really glad we have lawyers offices are praising it because. It didn't. He thinks he's going to get a lot of money for it because he doesn't understand how it works and it's just got such a major problem with the basement in the mall that. i'm almost afraid that, when they look at it, that mason inspector over there, to make sure it doesn't have black mold and they may have just been condemned the place, you know as possible."
