13718.0,Patient,"My family, like me, because i'm on board a lot of things. About a family to push them out of their issue for me and and then i'm like a failure, I keep. me in a certain place like you know what am I going to do or don't help them, you know to me."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, because people pleasing it's okay I don't want that. So in regards to that i'm doing, do you say boundaries, do you say now. Are you supposed to be."
13718.0,Patient,starting to do that with my mom.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so before you just map out to them, which i'm on like How long are you carrying on these issues of other people."
13718.0,Patient,years and years.
740.0,Provider,"Yes, it's called people pleasing is the truth, if I right and a lot of times we do they would our family, because there are family, so we feel like all well I gotta be there for them, because they're my family. You don't say and I add, is patient, the same thing all the time, I said, well, while you're being there for your family who's there for you."
13718.0,Patient,know.
740.0,Provider,"Who can you tell your issues on who can come take OK false and allow you to relax and being able to experience really. You know i'm saying, who allows you to be vulnerable because the thing about it is. With Martin is the fact that, since you already have your own trauma and you already have your own issues you can afford to take on nobody else's because you haven't dealt with chores. And so what they do is is that a lot of times will personalize somebody else's issues and then we'll put it on our face any age to the burden that we are ready for this, because I may say yes. So that's why, when people come to you like red good like I thought you. know this one, you have to really be like I don't have you know I will love to hear what you have to say, but at this time yo said I you know i'm. i'm in the process of the working on my own issues, and so you know i'm not able to hear your time. In a nice way it's just being able to set a boundary because if they go bad news is a lot of times if family and their issues if you personalize what they have going on, on top of what you have going on, of course, that revision depression, because you did you feel affair for their case. Yes, and then you saw taken on their emotion. You know i'm saying and there's a there's a there's a such thing as being empathetic versus being sympathetic see what happens is that you're not empathetic you become sensitive and so with simplicity is is that you don't feel sorry for you enough to take on the burden for you. you're not selected."
13718.0,Patient,"It is. Is hold on time yeah I agree, but it's kind of ironic because it's like no idea was. Like I don't know it makes me feel week bye. Susan."
740.0,Provider,"What they mean I got a master's in counseling, but I think also counselor. That is the main thing I am going to cancel my fail, a lot of people feel like oh I got a degree that I got the school loans and I gotta pay back the debt that I should be able to hear myself I hope that's cool. But that's not possible all the time and the thing about it is, is that a lot of times our trauma or the things that we have gone through actually sometimes it's too much to wear at you i'm saying it puts us in a hole, with what we can even bring it. right to ask for help it don't take away the fact that you're not smart I mean that you smart it doesn't say, you said that you're not smart. It has a say girl using data science degree, and you can even make an idea, all it does not want to say that just says that you're strong enough to be able to ask for help, and you know you need it. So I mean i'm thankful for your degree. But at the same time you put just like the group to the. User we do go to work. And here, you know in this life, it is a safe place for you to be able to be vulnerable to share what you're feeling. You know i'm saying and so. One of the things as they say, is is that if if your family in taking on their issues is triggering your depression, then we got to put something in place. Because i'm sure it's more than just mama. So if boundaries good everybody it ain't just a mom i'm grateful that she was able to say abandoned mama but what about the other thing. i'm just throwing a number out there, I don't know."
13718.0,Patient,"me my my mom to my sibling conditions, my grandma my grandma but it's like. By me having a miscarriage my cousin had it in March, right after this character my grandma's to bring in that. i'm sorry."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I can imagine just me I can't imagine it out, I just recently had a baby, three months ago. And you say, well, I can't imagine you know, the idea of losing one you don't saying, but at the same time, you have to express the Green and say hey green. I love you and I know you're trying to celebrate your great grandchild. But when you constantly bring it up. that's hurtful for me i'm going to know sensitive space, you know, so I don't want to constantly be reminded of has cute this baby is and blah blah blah blah because that's hurtful for me and the thing about it is. And let me warn you got to communicate, you have to you have to properly communicate, so these people can know because they don't know unless you say something this part of setting boundaries."
13718.0,Patient,"grandma you know I do talk to her, but it's just like I don't know she's stuck in a way it's just like you know I think my mom also send things to record. You know, even though she's my mom and my mom and my mom you know my dad didn't have money he's like look, you have to like I don't care what it is."
740.0,Provider,"So I mean that's what you can and sometimes you gotta ask the hard questions with your grandma and with your family period, but do you not care happy you. So do you know, do you not do you not care that i'm still I came from a loss leader care that i'm still grieving because I brought this up to you and you're still doing it so are you now, are you not sensitive to my emotions or did you forgave or the same because a lot of times. It grandparents, you know they get they they get overjoyed with new baby, to the point to where everything else seems like it goes out the window. And sometimes you sometimes we focus on one thing, so much and we adore working to become insensitive for what other people have going on. And it's tough because of the fact, of course, as you live with your grandmother, then of course you don't saying you have to undergo that but you really don't have to you can say something. And if you don't work, the first time, say it again. Because, at the end of the day, you're a you are in charge of what comes into your circle you're in charge of what comes into your ears you're in charge of what have been what possibly in place. Your your mind something no, we cannot control, no, you cannot control having a miscarriage they'll have a thing. are very, very hurtful doesn't mean you're not gonna be able to have any more children no that's not what that means i've seen too many people come back from it. i've seen too many people bounce back from it, you know said if if that's what you want to do in the good lowest CPC and just go ahead and for you. But at the same time, you should have to grieve the loss and the thing about this is that, if your family members are insensitive today. Then you're gonna have to speak up and either you're going to have to speak up or you're gonna have to really set a firm boundary because of the fact that a lot of times it's hard to hear when you can't get reminded of what you love. it's just it's just hard you know i'm saying, and so, sometimes you may have to. me if there's something that she chooses to do, then, sometimes you may have to be like all right i'll get up and walk away will get up and go to your room or something like that or just walk out the door go take over or whatever I say, and so, once I."
13718.0,Patient,Do that i'm just like okay my mom.
740.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and then at the last you don't like. When i'm sad to me yoga and things like that, and so these are things is just really and I know you said it before, but at the same time, sometimes you just have a So do you not care. about where i'm like I mean you have to ask the hard question because the thing about it is, is why does that you have to be there for you, and this is how you're there for you. Because of the fact that you're in charge of what comes into your ears you're in charge of the environment that you choose to be around that that you're in charge of it you're saying you're in charge of what you're taking and what you like and what you let out and so. So we got to say something if you don't work Saturday, you can blame me say I was talking to my therapist and my therapist a you can blame me I don't mind showing me some saying it's okay. So that's, the most important thing. Secondly, of course, like I said I am. deeply sorry for your loss. In Thirdly, you can recover, you can come back from."
13718.0,Patient,that's what i'm trying to do yeah.
740.0,Provider,"You can recover and you can come back from the you recover from, so much so, this right here. You can come back from this to insane from a mother to a mobile, you can come back from me, you can recover young say anything about it is. And the thing the thing about it is, is a huge task that you have to agree, and this is not the moment for you to put all yo yo yo. yo Cree superwoman Cape and for you to act out strong, if needed, but like i'm good, and you know you know the facade that we put up the sense of strength and just like we gotta be strong for the people, he was wrong. email because we hate when people as let's try with you."
13718.0,Patient,And yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Well it's loud with you, we hate that because, as you start breaking down and all that kind of stuff and you know, some people, you can be vulnerable with because they don't they don't they. Some people would take it for granted or they're not sensitive enough to even to even know how to deal with the situation. So. that's one thing now The other thing you say what's another trigger anything you say so we got the seven the miscarriage Oh, the job. So what do you do for living."
13718.0,Patient,You know.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, I don't hear I didn't hear nothing you say it, but it felt like you, you doing something really great."
13718.0,Patient,I think mine.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, say just. Try to stay at home with."
13718.0,Patient,My friend Alan.
740.0,Provider,"OK OK, so the shovel they work include a, of course, we know that we live in a in a pandemic time and people are leaving."
13718.0,Patient,"My. breathing treatments allergy. shots me, coming from a gentle that like ration."
740.0,Provider,"OK. So the major stress from, that is, from your job is is what or who."
13718.0,Patient,knows. You know how the mind or. sure that they have.
740.0,Provider,Okay.
13718.0,Patient,Can I ask a question.
740.0,Provider,What do you do self care. Self care.
13718.0,Patient,pretty much.
740.0,Provider,"Good was born, you know what Let me take a bit i'm not gonna say of myself here. def not enough. it's not enough because I mean I mean you got to go to sleep, because you got to get up and they say go to work, but sometimes sleep after the depression. Because now all you do for self care sleep. Like How else do you take care of yourself. How do you nurture yourself. What is your relaxation look like."
13718.0,Patient,"This is tanya you know I try to sleep go to sleep i'm weakness, really. unit to drink coffee."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. So, and the thing about it is, is that a lot of time with this when your life consists of just work and sleep or complete. Words simply saying hey my daughter work in a place to take care, my daughter, working with it so wow that that adds to the depression, because it's like you have their their reckoning moment was like I just my life. All I do is. Other words taking my phone and go to sleep. But, but you have to have something in there, that you do for yourself. yeah there's something in it that you do for you. say it again."
13718.0,Patient,"And to figure out a regimen or something, you know that will help me with my own."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, and even if it's not something that you do every day right, it needs to be a day the physicality you and you alone Arab American me she's also the gym for 45 minutes. If you go shopping for an hour, if you take yourself after he if if you got me to a massage or you will get your productivity your nails well and they all pompous. But you need some form of self care, you have to take care of yourself and the thing about it is it don't say Mike you have been. It doesn't seem like we have. An idea I know below on your face you did look like, I mean you look like you're hurting in real life, and I see that and so it's one of those things to where of course you know you have to be able to acknowledge, is my. If my if you take a good daughter."
13718.0,Patient,16 I mean you know we do so my grandmother my mom she takes her to school when i'm at work and.
740.0,Provider,"we'll see if I can take a look so she can be out she can be our best. Okay, so that means that you have time to do something for you. So they can consist of a lot of a lot of different things. It can consist of. Things from i'm like hold on, let me see if I can pass up in your face, I think that should be the society, maybe I won't say okay. I wish I had examples and ideas to kind of help to see which one you would like to be for with my but anyway, we could just talk about it. So what are some things you've always wanted to do, which you never got to."
13718.0,Patient,"Travel my friend or somebody I haven't traveled and that's another thing like Kevin Peter says, I will travel leaving my Vegas or take a trip somewhere and I haven't been able to do."
740.0,Provider,one.
13718.0,Patient,of it.
740.0,Provider,Put your double marathon pack your bag. um no vacation time or anything like that that's available.
13718.0,Patient,"Yes, well since we're short staffed i'm taking a vacation. pretty much like a month."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good, well, we got a vacation set up so that's right. Now, what do we do in the meantime between now and November."
13718.0,Patient,"You know I just said, stop here and start going to get my nails done taking a moment that little hour and a half to do that, and probably just go for a walk or something you know just. thinking a little bit."
740.0,Provider,"So. Another thing. The journal. The journal consistently well, it is time to read it."
13718.0,Patient,"was consistent but. It was consistent, but he kind of like fell off, but. It was every night or. once a week."
740.0,Provider,"And what are some things you, if I may, what are some things that you channel about."
13718.0,Patient,I have thoughts on my little mentioned how around seven on the papers and i'll tell anybody about it right in paper or whatever.
740.0,Provider,"And there's generally hope you feel better or just kind of like Okay, I put on the paper but, but nothing changed. Okay, so let's make back and pass time because. I want to know what actually makes you feel better what works for you."
13718.0,Patient,"we're going to the beach, I sometimes i'll just put on my headphones and listen to music grinding down to the beach and."
740.0,Provider,"How far away, do you live from the beach."
13718.0,Patient,In 20 minutes.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's one of the things that you need. You need to change of scenery. You need to change as a result if the beach or something take your music, which you to the beach take your journal wiki to the beach and Journal on the beach. Why not if it just wanted me to go I wish I lived 20 minutes on the beach, and I do, that every other day. In the sand running in the water, like a look at. That, and I do have a time so I wish I live next to the beach so me, I mean if the beaches were. You find the file is in the piece then just change of scenery real. Safety German sort of REACH. Out of your journal, I mean outside of you've been saying, I want, I want you to right now. I want you to write down what a better version of you looks like. What a better version of you look. At today from self affirmation. I read a. actually read. A quote today and, and I was talking to. I was talking to my husband about it last night, and I was telling him, but a lot of times we get so stuck in our pace that we forget to fight for our for our right now. And many, many, many times, you know and so save a lot of times you won't hear me big be been I mean hear me. we're not going to linger I mean sometimes will pattern things sometimes we're seeing from things from the past but we're not going to dwell too much in it, because the thing about it is there's nothing we could do a bad. Literally there's literally nothing we can do about it, but at the same time we fight so much for for a path that we we found suffice for now. young man, and so what happens is is a because of the fact that we have unresolved any areas of such thing as having unresolved issues from your childhood. Because of the fact they do you know i'm saying, because of the trauma and thing that you the things that you experience, even in your own household you know i'm saying, and so a lot of times when we when those times when I resolve they did add on some more issues. And, and also more issues to the point to where now navigate trust issues that our relationship issues never tested, so we got all this kind of stuff and the thing about it is, of course, we know that there seems from childhood, we understand it, but my focus is is how to be better now. right because I can't I can't fake we can't will not, I can't but we can't speak look what people have done in the pay is we can't fix what they say we can't fix how they behave and things like that I would never ever discredited I would never ever. make it seem as if it didn't happen that's something I will never do. However, at the same time it's like okay what's this they did happen, how do I get up and how do I move forward, because the thing about it is and what I learned was Martin is that the people to do this they think another, the better."
13718.0,Patient,They do why.
740.0,Provider,"They thinking about a day, instead of the time I didn't. know anything and then about us. And the crazy part about it is if they they feel that they do the time they did they consequences they got the registration on it on the thing, and I also I did my time I say five. Maybe even say, and sometimes they don't but at the same time you don't forgive for this, like you, forgive for your sanity. You forget, for your own peace. You know i'm saying, and so what is a the quote says there's the secret of change is the focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old but on buildings and then. And so that there's always going to focus on the on the focus on building the new and so on this one, I want to know what a better version of you look like, if you could be your ideal self what would your ideal still look like."
13718.0,Patient,Not not stressing. Bollywood not give a shit. done that.
740.0,Provider,So why do you allow stuff that you take control to get the best of you.
13718.0,Patient,"Family like you said earlier, his family and I felt like you know i'm not obligated to but you know, like I said i'm just a constant let that go and let them build their own stuff because i'm saying that has not been anything but deteriorating my own."
740.0,Provider,I want to say i'm telling if your dad told me he was obligated.
13718.0,Patient,"Just me, I mean i've always been like a Karen personalize our skin tone, and I think that's a mistake. hearing."
740.0,Provider,"But you can be a caring person and feel instead allows people to care they own load don't mean i'm not a county Tennessee just because of the fact that I gotta I want to do on my own so. I care. But I care for you enough to allow you to figure it out or two for you to get the same hip and i'm trying to do for myself. I can only help you if there's a limit of how far can help you. But when it becomes repetitive, you need to see elsewhere."
13718.0,Patient,"that's why that's why i'm you know i've been. Dealing with her, her guilt trips mom and stuff anymore, you know she she knows. I was hospitalized in 2019 and August I have my own stuff like."
740.0,Provider,What happened in 2019 which will have to delay.
13718.0,Patient,"servers vibrates and when I woke up from surgery I couldn't hear me please, and when I went home the ECB on and and when I went to burning heart rate when. I went to the emergency room there. was no. Daily now."
740.0,Provider,"Right yeah you can't. You can't you can't you can't do nobody else's so I mean you got a daughter. and trying to write and try to raise her. In the right way and so. yeah so we can work on it, setting firm boundaries i'm not talking about boundaries that they they this that exists temporarily and being dependent on how bad the emergency he is that our list of the boundaries that's not the vendor i'm talking about i'm talking about firing boundaries. So the point to where you're able to actually speak up for yourself and be okay with knowing that that does not discriminate. Your concern it doesn't discredited you as a person, it does not say that you're not a caring person. It does not say that you're not tied it doesn't he doesn't play beach and I in the Vedic you know, to the needs of others, but at the same time, you have to take your own. So you have to be concerned about your own me because of the end of the day, you i'm saying, who pays your hospital bill. who goes to pick up your prescription. Hope I should you take your medicine, on time, but you can say I hope your food that strength, nobody because of the fact that the thing about it is, the more you keep saying yes. The more you keep saying is, the more people will continue to come. And then, once you say know that I will you be funny why she acted funny a while you been I see any other time in a thing of end of class is is creating this new version. that's what this journey is called it's called a new version. Right, because the next time, and I want you to practice is now. Like the stuff that we talked about I want you to practice this map, because then maybe the next time I see you I want I needed to be some kind of a list of overload I need your eyes to be brighter I need I need to be a half a piece of a smell corn anything. Because I want you to be able to experience what it feels like not to take on anybody else's problem. So that means for the next 14 days. You will not take on anybody else's. will not, I mean, even to the point you're not even listening to them. Well, can I just share that with you right there. And you can blame it on me i'm on an assignment."
13718.0,Patient,Now.
740.0,Provider,"Please blame it on me I don't mind it out just a moment and I find it i'm on an assignment and my therapist said I can take on a lot of problems I can't even listen to over the next 14 days. You don't say and even it and even at work, you know use a supervisor i'm like sometimes when they bring your problems, it can be too much. You know i'm saying allowed them listen go to your other counterparts and y'all need to problem solve only come to me when you can't figure it out a young. Maybe we didn't have a new meeting, maybe we need to have a new meeting and the staff meeting and put some things in place, because what happens is since you're still carrying it says you're so used to solving people's problems because you know you've got to find the. fingers are used to solve the problem, the being we take it to work. And we feel like okay we'll we'll you know y'all just kind of have a problem. But see what happens is is very critical people."
13718.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"A crippled vic and he calls them to be called dependent on you. And and that's my. that's not what we want is because we have to deal with, we have to deal with internal issues that have surfaced. And then literally putting your life to a halt, we go into work, because we know we got to work with you i'm saying we're doing what we need is amanda work retaining. So we go to work, because we know we got to work you i'm saying, I have to be after you have to be a mother to my field on, because these are things that I have to do. But at the same time. When users, that you were going through the motions but we're not excited anymore. there's no there's no feeling behind me. i'm just going through the motions. Because of the fact that I know this, what I have to do and i'm treating you would you say. routine yeah and i'm sure you didn't get on the job because you didn't like it, I don't know on and on about like you know what I want to apply, but it down because I can't paint. i'm sure that those will enjoy behind a once upon a time, but now the joy has been sucked out because people are linking on you. And not just a word but at home, no, no, no, no boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries. It does not mean you don't care i'm going to say this, one more time because I eat it just seemed like the reason why you do this is because of the fact that you're a caring person again, it does not mean you don't care. It does not mean that you're not concerned. But at the same time. The same example that you said, for your daughter. That even as a single parent I can be independent and I can take care of you. This the same example that you put forth even at work, how am I, how are you going to learn to be independent and if i'm always there. I mean that's what you see just the senior. i'm sure. I mean, I was raised by saying apparently that's what mama told me. you're saying and the thing about it is is it's just less the same type of let's say type of example that you say even at work being a."
