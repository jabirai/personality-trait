298.0,Provider,hi there Riley. it's good to see you.
12098.0,Patient,You too.
298.0,Provider,How have you been.
12098.0,Patient,"i've been all right um i've had some like ups and downs, but for the most part it's been pretty. Like middle you know what I mean like I bought like super depressed i'm not super I mean i'm anxious but i'm not like as depressed like I mostly have anxiety over depression, but my depression goes in waves, you know."
298.0,Provider,"And so, when you have the anxiety how often are you having it what's what's going on in your mind what what are you feeling."
12098.0,Patient,"i'm. Totally just like overthink. And that causes a lot of anxiety. um it's mostly like health related and. Like basic life related like finances and things like that. um. But I overthink a lot about like myself i'm like oh my God, am I, being weird like you know, like did I say. It because I over talk a lot so sometimes I overthink about what i've been saying, or whatever."
298.0,Provider,haha. hey how How would you describe your moods lately.
12098.0,Patient,"Pretty middle I would say not super excited not super upset or anything but, just like man. And I got. Well, they haven't like fully diagnosed me it, but my doctor things I have Gilbert syndrome. it's a liver disorder. it's a mild liver disorder it's nothing like life threatening or it's not doesn't affect like the longevity of my life or anything like that, but it just kind of something that I live with. And it does have symptoms, it can cause anxiety and stomach issues, and I mean it's a bunch of random things but. I did read that I could have something to do with my anxiety problems not completely because I do have like trauma and stuff so like I got diagnosed with anxiety, when I was like really young, but it could also be a small factor as to why it's so bad sometimes. Like depending on like how i'm eating and how i'm like living my life or whatever. depends on like. How anxious I am if that makes sense i'm not really sure I mean i'm still learning about it but."
298.0,Provider,Interesting so i'm i'm reading about it and they say that it is a. inherited thing. On the. rubin I.
12098.0,Patient,"talked to my I haven't talked to my dad yet, but I talked to my mom and I was like hey just so you know, and I was like it is genetic so it either came from both of you are one of you, but what I read from it is it's like a recessive mutated gene. So if it's recessive I think. Just one of my parents, has it but i'm not sure if i'm still going to talk to my dad because i'm like you both should get tested just to see like i'm curious now Oh, you know, like it. Right oh. My mom was just like well sorry if you got it for me like dang you know, and I was just like yeah and it causes like like some most people don't get symptoms and stuff which is like I guess a rare thing for me, because I have most of the symptoms."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
12098.0,Patient,"But they're not really bad it just makes me feel like tired a lot, you know and like. i'm not like i'm a little weaker than other people sometimes and it's hard for me to gain weight, you know that kind of thing so. I basically don't even know what there's a famous for I just knew that I needed to talk to you because I had a really and."
298.0,Provider,"i'm off the BAT I totally love that because I just It makes me get refocus back on your life your situation, so thank you for coming to see me."
12098.0,Patient,yeah I just and like we had talked about medication before i'm just like honestly i'm like mentally not ready to like start medication it's not something that like i'm not interested in necessarily it's just. I have huge anxiety with starting medication and I don't want to like worse in my anxiety. Right now.
298.0,Provider,So right right.
12098.0,Patient,and
298.0,Provider,I totally okay with that.
12098.0,Patient,"yeah and like you know that I smoke a little bit of we'd like sometimes that helps calm me down. When I am feeling anxious because, like like I said, like i'm an over thinker, so that does help sometimes and i'm. doing it all the time, but it does. help me when I need it, you know I."
298.0,Provider,can do that.
12098.0,Patient,"By just probably if I don't you know, like at night, like if I don't like I just won't sleep until like 3am you know so."
298.0,Provider,"One thing I ask is that you keep monitoring, because I do have patience that cannabis worked for a while and then it stopped working and it became a problem. And so it's. You know, as long as it's not causing you more anxiety then i'm you know somewhat okay with it."
12098.0,Patient,"Okay yeah no it's not costing me more anxiety because I feel like. You know I don't only use it at home, so I don't bring it with me in my vehicle or anything like that I feel like that would make me anxious, you know."
298.0,Provider,"I agree, that is, that is a. Challenging spot there. um. Okay. How have your moods then."
12098.0,Patient,"Not the greatest. i'm a very like happy person i'm very talkative, especially at work like when i'm hanging out with my co workers like I work. I work with dogs, so I don't hang out with a lot of people I work with like five people and, like that's it, you know so. i'm very talkative I let people get to know me really fast, because I feel like if they get to know me fast and they won't understand they'll understand why i'm so weird later on. But. I feel like that causes my moods to kind of go up and down because sometimes i'm like really, really talkative and then some days i'm like. Not talkative at all like i'm to myself i'm like thinking a lot, you know, and people are like are you good you know because I like usually so talkative so it's a it's interesting. To like look back on like. Like it is a little up and down, you know."
298.0,Provider,"I hear ya. I think you're learning yourself and you're learning, you know where are you I hope you don't get burned by someone because you over share."
12098.0,Patient,"Oh that's been an issue for me like growing up because i've always been like this, like in school and everything like i've always been really talkative i'm really friendly you know, like, I really want to make. Our buddy you know i'm usually not a mean person, you know what I mean so. I feel like people are comfortable with me because of that, but. I am like Sometimes I feel like a over share things and i'm like Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that or like you know. But I don't know if that's like an ADHD thing or you know what I mean because, like i'm always like all over the place, and I can't really focus on one thing, so I changed the subject whole lot."
298.0,Provider,"you're young you're going to kind of grow into your brain. don't worry about it and. it's here, you need you know it's so refreshing to me to to to talk with you to meet with you there's a I just like it. you're. you're very kind."
