14227.0,Patient,"Just slow, I mean that's what i'm trying to do that now, I was trying to I should have done it a long time ago, to be honest with you but uh. I was like it's kind of a long story, but I was really trying not to stop this job go and go to a different one because i'd like to get some that pays more anyway. But I started I had moved in with my best friend like. Four years ago, or something like that I can't remember the exact time frame. and his family actually owns a moving company and that so one of their guys quit so I went in and took over there, like kind of saved them because it's family out there wasn't a lot of trouble. And he actually ended up passing away a year ago, and so I really don't want to leave them hanging like just you know just leave them waters. But uh i'm like I gotta look for some because my unemployment, even when I was getting at the company down the $85 a week. Because they said when I was getting to on generous they gave me too much money because I made a mistake, a filling out the paperwork, but I didn't make any mistakes, because I called them and had them do it over the phone for me. So they actually just sent me a waiver to try to get my a what they say was too much like I had an overdraft like I owe them money paying that like get that drop. and hopefully when that waiver goes through i'm hoping, they give me a little bit of back pain, but I doubt they will because I say and I already got it."

I had a patient That said, every time she got on the zoom she noticed the cat would hop up on a chess every time we would talk, he would just hop up on her chest, so I don't know what it was with that. Castle county interesting I don't. always understand why they do what they do."
14227.0,Patient,"they're definitely got a reason behind it, though."
191.0,Provider,"yeah I find dogs well I could figure out cat some i've actually been close to the cats and dogs, but I just think dogs a little bit more predictable."

14227.0,Patient,"Oh here's the thing I went to do my labs and when I got it was like for like I don't have a work in sorrows it was a hassle again they're like. But I got there and the lady said, and she didn't tell me over the phone when I made the appointment or nothing because. I made an appointment didn't they canceled I had to reschedule I went finally went there and they said it was out of pocket they don't take insurance and they didn't have my. Like thing faxed over to him anyways so they can do it i'm like I can't pay out of pocket for this, so I actually just talked to someone on here and they said to look for the one name West so i'm. Hoping I can find one of those. close to the area I was planning on trying to do that, after I get off the phone here as well. yeah that's."
191.0,Provider,"Right our health can find the closest lab for you, and some people do it at their hospital."
14227.0,Patient,"See that's what the lady of the first time I scheduled it she. found the place to me, and she said it was close, but it really wasn't that close, but then, when I call the second time. And said well they don't take insurance, I was asking them for one close to me, and they told me to just call and try to find out myself, so I don't know if they was just busy when I. Video chatted in or what but if I can't find one close to me i'll give it another call and and try to see if they can help me with that."
191.0,Provider,yeah so yeah We really do need that let's see so you started August 15 has your cup COM or anything.
14227.0,Patient,"No, but uh I was noticing group, someone said, like one a you counselor said that they come once a month, so i've been in here about a month now, so. My apartment building it they're going to I got a lot going on right now, but we just got a manager was kind of like a slum but uh. We got a new manager and she's trying to fix up the place and she just started a bump my rent to on job but that's a whole nother story, but anyways. She ain't in the office that much and they're doing a lot of like maintenance so some of the mail they've been keeping. Instead of and because our males like inside the building, we got a little cubby that we unlock they've been keeping some of the mail in the office and it's been taking us longer to get so i'll try to get Ahold of her and see if I got any mail in the office to see if it's in there."
191.0,Provider,yeah it was shipped out based on a computer shipping date ship date was on nine to 2021 and it says here's it it's been delivered to your location.
14227.0,Patient,"Okay, so it's probably it's probably in in the office i'll try to get that and get that taken care of as soon as possible, but someone in group was saying that. They was told that and it took them a additional two weeks to get the Cup. I love that."
191.0,Provider,"yeah i've had people say that when it was shipped, but it was delivered i'm just letting you know what I see here, and then the other thing i've had patients to me they like you know, like some people notice a cup. In a folder and some people have been concerned that you know, like people. People know about these drug screening cups and."
14227.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"have some other people wanted to just get it, because they want to use the test tube. So yeah it can be a bit tricky and that's why it's good to be able to have a place that was reliable, so let us know if you got it, but if you go ahead and get that urine drug screen done. Like at quest, then you know, once you get that done and we get to result in it, account for that month OK. I can get it in September and account for September, but we don't want you going several months without getting a year."
14227.0,Patient,"For sure man. i'm hoping i'm hoping it fits in my mailbox because, like I said it's just a cubby and it got a lot. But they just started doing this thing that makes no sense because i'm not in a like that the son of a. apartment, but if we get a package that doesn't fit in the mailbox they. Put it outside our door, so if someone sees a package else on my door like event that's a cup if they don't know that they might have a stupid and keep walking and not find out till they get home so i'm hoping it's it should, I think, a couple fit as long as it's not some crazy big. Oh yes, good fit in my cubby show."
191.0,Provider,"yeah so let's look out for that Now let me ask you this, how should sobriety going."
14227.0,Patient,"it's going pretty good you know i've you know those good days and bad days, but for the most part it's been a little easier than I what I thought it would be. But there are there are definitely you're saying days that are worst days I like i've been having i'm thinking about switching my pharmacy. which I don't want to do because, like I said, my car is not running right now but there's this one pharmacist at the pharmacy that is just so rude and like gives me a hassle about like I think she looks down on me, because she knows what i'm getting. Because like I haven't been have been rude with anyone else, but every time I call the ask when I will be ready or anytime I go into pick it up as she's there, she is just so real time, so I like jumping through hoops for her to get get the stuff it's kind of like. And no. kind of makes it more difficult, but other than that it's been going pretty good I got a pretty good. Support system and all so."
191.0,Provider,"And i've had other people go through the same thing with certain pharmacies and they had to change, so let us know how we can support you. And if you want to bring that up in a group just ask Rochelle and see if anybody's in your area if they recommend because there are some pharmacist. or locations i've had people say don't go there, because they never treat us right, so your other patients i've been asked you really good will recommend and places, especially if you get a couple of people in your area. Let me ask you this, any slip ups or relapses on madison's."
14227.0,Patient,No ma'am.

You had sent some promethazine and, for me, the first couple times and then I haven't got to sit in and i'm like I need some more of that, because what the strips I can keep them now that I can keep them down now even without the promethazine but I get like gabby and I gotta. lay lay down and fight it for like the first 1520 minutes."
