9784.0,Patient,"uh you know I just I just gave up opiates like heroin so like. One thing at a time, one day."
431.0,Provider,"I appreciate that you know i'm just want to just put you know there's a lot of. benefits from quitting smoking it's really just a smoke that's terrible for your body, you know if it's just the nicotine straight and fusion I don't have as big of an issue but that's what keeps you going back to the smoke, so the smoke is not healthy for you, but I appreciate your."
9784.0,Patient,habitual just back and forth like.
431.0,Provider,"I get that right, so there's that component. that's why some people gain weight when they tried to quit because that same like eating motion so now what I appreciate you being candid I think one thing at a time, I agree, and let's keep you on the path. of recovery of getting better health so with your suboxone is definitely something we can help address that and avoid any sort of symptoms that you may experience. So what I see right now, first of all Julie does have a note on your kind of prescription that should she wants you to get medications feel that her groups, I just want to put it out there, because that will be that will definitely be mentioned, so if you."
9784.0,Patient,definitely help.

431.0,Provider,"I know they did like enforce some of a cut off time it's kind of like class if you're not there within 15 minutes, they almost don't they don't let people in anymore just. Because they don't want this."
9784.0,Patient,"group got that I could even do it on Thursdays um because it's not like an actual thing that like that you guys say like Oh well, if you miss Tuesday just go Thursday this you know I mean I did I just did that one time and."
431.0,Provider,"yeah. We have some discussion about it, I think the challenges, when people go at random times that makes it difficult for people like all my group when we're trying to. bridge patients and we're not sure what day to you know bridge them to and they create some sort of delayed for you guys as well and, as well as just kind of like all this messaging going around. So i'm my one reminder for you it's just these group appointments, you can cancel it and that that doesn't count against you, because even. In addition to Julie, putting a note in there that she wants you to get refills at group I do see in our system, because you haven't shown up in you know. A few appointments and sounds like a lot of things were going on, but because of it is actually telling me, I can only give you a two day prescription, you know and that's the recommendation.

9784.0,Patient,Yes.
431.0,Provider,"So. She didn't ask me for your insurance information, she said to bring your ID and your insurance card. Do you know if wall brings works for you."
9784.0,Patient,that's what. went down. But it was a different walk the dog. It was. like that. They made it because.
431.0,Provider,I don't know.
9784.0,Patient,"Why, they said I had make a primary. With them. The pharmacy."
431.0,Provider,"So sorry you're breaking up I wasn't super short, what you say, but sometimes a health plans want patients to be set up with a home pharmacy. So i'm wondering if that's the case, so what this is what you could do right now okay um because i've already called your prescription into walgreens it's there they're going to work on it. And then she said that swing by around seven o'clock it will for sure, be ready. What you can do right now is find your insurance card and give them a call and just because you moved right, so the if you need to establish into a new home pharmacy. So ask them is is what it worked at walgreens first of all, they should be able to tell you quickly, yes or no if walgreens in their network, because I know, sometimes it's kind of contracting information is not straightforward so that's my first question, if you can call. Your health plan. To say is walgreens workable for you, if they say yes, then you put ass if you need to establish them as kind of you know you're trying to get a medication filled there. Is there anything you need to do. Maybe there's nothing. So if you can do that I will be great, but if there's an issue, then you have to link to log back into here. Okay, so if there's an issue then just log back in to this link and then we can try to call it into a different place when you probably want to assume just because you know Friday is busy, and some. Closed earlier is that sound like a plan. yeah okay."
9784.0,Patient,"All right, thank you very much."
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so um I know you just one last thing because Julie did get back to me, she is really excited that you've reappeared I think you would disappear for a little bit um. I know you had mentioned not taking any illicit drug and it's just I just want to reiterate the importance of that and let us knowing if you had to use anything. More for the reason of just want to make sure we're not putting you into precipitated withdraw when you take suboxone so just is that. it's not an issue. Okay, because I know it's it feels super crummy worse than just a regular withdraw, so we just want to make sure people are aware, but. Okay next time I talk we'll talk about cigarettes, but. All right, but for now again your prescription husband called in four days to last you till Tuesday group, please go to that group with Julie, where she can write you a lot. You no longer prescription if if it's appropriate Okay, and then I hope that everything works out with insurance, but if, for some reason walgreens is not a good pharmacy for you just come back here and we can call it into a different pharmacy. thought it."
9784.0,Patient,All right.
431.0,Provider,Okay Thank you so much dylan waiting yep.
