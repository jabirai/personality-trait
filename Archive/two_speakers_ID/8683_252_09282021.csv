8683.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. The babies, I can I want to get them into something in here to just keep them active, you know we play a lot outside and all the time. swimming would be good, right now, the rain in the winter and fall so i'm trying to keep them busy all of us occupied."
252.0,Provider,sounds like you're doing pretty good.
8683.0,Patient,"yeah I feel better this week i've. been reading along and meditating still and China. They do things out of my comfort zone. Okay that's outside of my comfort zone like they so like we have a very large family but I only talk to my mom and my grandma and my sister and yeah he's fine right now. and When my grandfather passed, I think, three years ago. My family used to hold our entire family used to spend a lot of time together and hanging out in the barbecues or I don't know because of a little cousins would spend the night and. We just have a good time and everything, for example, the data and they divided. You know. And so, this weekend at the football game my my cousin's son. was playing against my son, so it was there were rebel teams. But I stepped outside of my comfort zone if it he would you guys want to get together and I don't know Barbie you come to my house or we have pizza just so sitting down, and I was really scared because I don't know. My mom my mom was left by her father when she was a little girl, so my grandfather actually raised my mom. And that created a lot of jealousy between everybody else in the family, so they don't really like us, because he definitely fever. i'm sorry I was kind of nervous to ask if we could get together, but they said yeah let's do it that I got sick, so I was kind of nervous like I made these plans to. gather us and then i'm sick so send is already getting anxiety about just thinking about being with everybody because I haven't talked to everybody and so on, I don't know where there are, how they feel about anything you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8683.0,Patient,"But we all went Sunday and we had the most amazing day it was it was weird because I. Am so isolated and i'd love and love my solitude but it felt like. You know, like when something's missing. yeah that like a little bit like it helped fill that hole a little bit, so it was like really, really i'm i'm just shocked actually How nice it was it wasn't like. Things just went smoothly as they possibly could have so and everybody had such a great time the kids like you know how. The little kids meet another little kid and it's kind of awkward they just all the kids just started playing, like everything I was more more it was it was amazing was a really amazing way and I think I needed it I needed a lot. Okay, to express to them that. Like I don't want to just see them when somebody dies like they're still my family and whatever you know. life's too short and the kids are growing up about each other, and I really like to just love to have make their kids and my kids like. That felt. Strange for me to say, but i've been trying to open up and. Let people, and you know, even though I told you last time I don't trust myself, that is, that is still my family and we've never done anything wrong, so I just. feel like i'm looking for like i'm going back to basics here lately, you know. So. Pretty amazing yeah it was really good every every literally everybody there who didn't want to go ahead, such a great time it was it was awesome so."
252.0,Provider,Exactly what you needed.
8683.0,Patient,"Something I didn't know anything. About game in particular. I didn't talk to her. My dad's girlfriend I haven't spoken with her, because I had a conversation with her after our meeting. And and. Who else was there, there was a bunch of people there that i've had issues with in the past couple years. And I did my mom said I did really well like just being cordial and respectful and getting everybody, you know. I get I don't know just act normal because i'm usually quite rude when I don't want to be around somebody and i'm like can you can you go, but I know it was for my son and my kids were there, and everybody would just wanted to see him play so. I tried to stay on my best behavior, which is an object like I tried I just came, naturally."
252.0,Provider,amazing.
8683.0,Patient,"yeah it was it was amazing. and But yeah I, so I had had a conversation with my dad's girlfriend well she had a conversation with me and I think I told you, I didn't want anything to do with that relationship for a while. I read you the conversation, so you could tell me your. Your perspective on sorry. This is how it started. She said. She had been asking about the football games. Can you hear me. yeah okay she'd been they had been asking about the football games, but like I said I hadn't seen my dad for. Months or heard from him, not even a text. So she said this rj has a game, this weekend, and this was early September. And I said yeah but I don't I don't I don't want my father to be there. you're welcome to come and she said what time what time or day is it, have you told your dad about the way you feel. And I said no, not right now there's no point if he can't self reflect on his own or even send a text as a parent or grandparent once in a while I don't want to keep claiming it as my responsibility anymore. i'll check the schedule, I think it's in solid at at 9am but i'll double check to make sure, and she said. I guess I don't really know how to maneuver through this he loves you and the kids more than you give him credit for, and I understand how you feel as well, it hurts my heart that there's a barrier and i'm not sure what boundaries, there are now, but is he not allowed to see the kids. I said I don't want you to have to maneuver through any of this he doesn't say anything to me or even asked about the kids this has been my entire life and i'm sick of it, how ridiculous to care for one grown child now because my sister has my niece and. They constantly watch her and help my sister, but my dad never wants me to be without my kids i'm just saying that for me to you. I said how ridiculous to care for one grandchild but not the others I forgave him for abandoning me but not my children. I said at some point, I have to start setting healthy boundaries for myself, and right now there are none, he is a parent. And everybody speaks for him. And when so you could tell me he loves me but his action show 100% otherwise. i've been in therapy, since I was 12 because of this. And at this point I don't really care if I ever see him again, is it nothing I say will change any of this it won't change him it won't change the past and it won't change who he is. He should have been there more i'm tired of having to validate my feelings or explain myself to all of you, because he's just been a shift father, he said he could have stopped at any time in the last 30 years and try harder. at any point. He can't just be here when it's convenient anymore, or for special events i'm struggling here more than ever. And he knows nothing about me and he doesn't even care to know how any of us are doing and I can't get past that at this point I don't think it's fair because my sister is easier to deal with that she's favored at this point. You guys all post on social media. On special dates of him and her alone or you guys with data that's my niece and I don't think any of you think or care about how I feel or how my children might feel. I said, and on top of that he knows what it's like to be abandoned by his by a father, he is wrong, no matter. How much how much he says he loves me and she said. kendra I don't know what you mean when you say he cares about one grandchild and not the other he loves them all, unfortunately, his feelings about Richard that's that's my kids dad. minimize makes him minimalize family things and also my sister doesn't have her her daughter's dad isn't involved in their life so my dad it makes it easier so because my dad doesn't like to be around the men that are dating us."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8683.0,Patient,"So that's why, but she said, unfortunately feelings about Richard does minimalize his family priorities. I can't tell you how to feel about him as a father, but from what i've seen he's been there for you, maybe not as much as he should have, but he has tried he struggled with him in your mom's relationship. which unfortunately affected you i'm not going to try to persuade you to feel differently, but I do think. Your anger is miss miss directed it sounds like you're blaming him for everything that you're going through and that's not fair, he can't even begin to understand. That you're hurting or that there's a problem if he doesn't know in in regards to crystal there is no favoritism i'm sorry you feel that way but you're wrong. sounds like family therapy is needed, I, and I hope you're not upset with me for my words. And I said, my feelings are valid and that's all I know for sure, and she said i'm not saying they're not valid you're also very angry and maybe telling him how you feel would help allows you to move on. that's a heavy heavy load you're carrying and I said i'm angry because i'm sitting here. and trying to heal myself reliving moments, with him, but nobody else was there for with me as a child, you weren't there my mom wasn't there, none of the 10 girlfriends he's had has whether. i'm trying to heal from this right now and I don't think having a conversation with them is going to help me be less angry right now. I said a lot of people don't like my relationship with my kids father, but they're still here for us. I said, to be honest, right now, isn't the time for me if you'd like to give him my numbers, if he could ask me or talk to me about whatever he needs that's fine I have nothing nice to say right now so i've been quiet, out of respect. He said I don't want to get in the middle of this because it needs to be between the two of you at this point. I said you just got yourself in the middle, he doesn't. If he doesn't know how I feel and I like I said now it's not the time, because everything I would I say will be. said, with an incredible amount of anger. Now is not the time. Just to be clear, does that mean you do not want him to see the kids it said, to be honest, the babies don't even know who you guys are anymore, so I don't know how to answer that right now. So that was my conversation with her, and that is like my like my entire life story with my father, he has had I probably met about 12 women. And every single one of those women spoke on his behalf he's never spoken to me unless he's really upset with me like or he had you know we're in close proximity he he doesn't have an. anything to say, and I think it's for the same reasons, I don't because we don't have anything nice to say to each other, but my he treats me a lot differently than he treats my sister, and by no means, am I jealous and my jealous of my sister but. When I lived with my father, with my baby I wasn't allowed to leave the House I wasn't they would not help me watch my son. They wouldn't they wouldn't do anything for me, and when I was a teenager and I lived with them, there was a door lock outside of my door, so I couldn't go anywhere or do anything. And when that my sister she drinks with my sister he goes out with my sister and he'll watch my sister will go to Vegas for a week and he'll watch my was not really him it's my step mom metal watch my niece but. And I also like I said, my my niece doesn't have a father what was she does but he'll only see, for if my sister has sex with him, because he has a whole family is a family, this was like a an affair so. I want my dad to be there for my niece and my sister because they don't have a male figure in their life and he left, he was in and out of my life. But he just left my sister completely. So I want that, for her, but I don't like this, but it's different for her and I, you know. And I don't like the way that. Like people are speaking for him and I have to speak to people. That aren't him, you know to it and i'm tired of it like explaining myself like how could things have not been that bad if you weren't there to witness it like I wasn't great or anything but. Like How can anybody tell me that. My choices are my feelings are not valid. You know. I mean, he texts them ready is very simple, as my mom my mom calls me every single day, and if she didn't hear from me like for until tomorrow, she can break down the House and see like what's going on. Right she knows everything about me my dad knows nothing, nothing, nothing about the kids and then, when they see him, though, like you know he's like come give me high they don't they're standoffish they don't want to get upset. Think. I think i'm Chris we lost him he went on his birthday is December 24 and me and my sister who brought all the kids to go see him we went to his house that takes us both about 45 minutes to get to his house. And when we got there at 9am he wasn't there any other Jenny had cocaine remnants all in his nose and i'm like. Do you really are you like my sister won't say anything but i'm like are you serious. Like you have no respect for your wife, like, for your wife you haven't been home in three days today we're here to celebrate you and Christmas and you have cocaine in your nose you don't even have the decency to like clean yourself or not do it. And you think I want my kids around this shape. Like when you like when it's been it's been like a fault in my life like with my my relationship with my kids dad and with my father and a lot of people like a fall in love with the idea of who they could be you know. But I don't and I forgive a lot of what's going on there, but like, how do you. don't need to believe that everybody has to grow everybody has to change, this is not, not the truth. When I if I yell at me kids or do something, you know, and if i'm snappy with them, I go home I go to bed at night and I cry. Like, how can you do make these you know. crazy. Huge dislike decisions and not feel and or any regret or. need to change, you know and. I am I just don't understand it like. I really was everybody wants me to tell him the way, I feel, but the man doesn't talk to me like everybody speaks for him he's never been there, like what and I also know that. I should be the bigger person my pet my parents are trauma, but like what when does that start."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8683.0,Patient,"You know what how do. They really care it's not going to cheat cheat you know many women have told him how many people have told him to change. My voice is not going to be the one that changes it, you know and it's not and I don't want to have to ask him to check on my kids like he should if that's not in his heart, because then it's not yeah. So i'm just mad that she even spoke to me like that, because. Like he's a master manipulator he manipulates tons of women. Like."
252.0,Provider,"And then, if any, they all come in and want to fix the situation that isn't there's two things."
8683.0,Patient,"I mean. i'm also like a fiery person eight like in my process is a fighter, I have a. Low tolerance for bullshit and disrespect like very low i'm very patient with my kids but for as it from an adult to an adult to be disrespectful. Is it this it triggers me like immediately because it's not just me he's for my mom has tried to commit suicide multiple times i've seen all these women, you know. Just like broken. After that you know. Being with this man and. So when I mad at him it's not just about me it's about everybody it's about how it's changed me and my relationships with men for people, you know just guarding myself or the way I dress or you know. it's changed some so many things, and so, while she like when she says like you're not getting I get it's messy mess up your whole life like I feel like an aspect that has it really fits yeah between him my and my mother being you know suicidal and. Like the the single mom i'm really pushing and trying hard and. broken and depressed. I do feel like it's kind of twisted my world upside down I don't know like. Because I could be both of them i'm very much like both of them, but. I don't know what to do at this point like do a talk to him do I say something I don't know what what to do. What does that even matter."
252.0,Provider,I think that. Having a conversation with him about how. You feel.
8683.0,Patient,"ugly feelings, a lot of ugly things."
252.0,Provider,"I think that. Taking away any expectations that he's going to respond to do something different, you know. Definitely will make a world of difference on your side. But. I think hearing it. from you whether, even if it's in a letter. kendra from you directly from you. You know. And you're not looking to make a difference, making different or for him to do something different, this can't change him. But it may help you. heal from it, oh it did. Everything can change right yeah."
8683.0,Patient,But I don't think like telling him that won't. won't make a difference.
252.0,Provider,No it's not about making it different. it's about healing.
8683.0,Patient,"Our brain multiple multiple letters to them in my journals that I right and every time it's it's different it's more it's less. Sorry now this mucus. I. Just don't know that I bear like hey I obviously don't want him in in my life anymore, you know, and he. And I don't know how to say that. Or if I mean that you know, like later yeah. But I know, right now, like that's he is not what I need and. I think. Like. To be did happen to earn the name grandparent means you should be there, you know I don't know, nobody knows what's going on with me because I never asked for help. So that's why people that's one of my character losses, you know, everybody says you don't ever ask for help, so we don't know what's going on and they get it, but like. If you just think a little bit you know, like my grandma's watched me and my sister when I was little because they were. They needed help, they were busy like it's the same theme for me, you know, I have three and two of them are nine months apart. And how do you not think anything like oh yeah she's totally fine you know. Like they hand me a lot of money and gifts and stuff for the kids but nothing. Nothing else you know and that's why a lot of people say you're blessed you have everything the kids have everything and i'm like."
252.0,Provider,You don't have the most.
8683.0,Patient,"My kids don't have. their grandparents like my mom comes once in a while, but she gets really bad anxiety from them because they're just so rambunctious. And she won't watch them overnight, but. Really she's there a little bit more. Like my grandmother my great grandma is here to help me for a week, just to. Just to help and spend time with us, but like it's only a couple people you know yeah. But I don't I don't know I don't I think like when she says, can he see the kids like he he hasn't seen the kids he told me to abort all of this, you know, like. He stopped talking to me like during my pregnancy is because I was, I chose to be pregnant, you know I remember like I remember all this stuff and so to put the put the blame on me like I feel. wow wrong. It feels wrong. You know."
252.0,Provider,"yeah one statement that I heard was race, he is the parent he gets to navigate you know this whole thing, and he should be, if you want something different, then he needs to add different you know, do something different."
8683.0,Patient,"that's i'm thinking again he drinks that he's using and he's playing sports and he's partying like that's what we're that's what he wants to do. You know, and it and even if he did say hey can I watch the kids like I would say no, I don't trust you with my kids so I feel like there's nothing, nothing left to do, or at least not for now like, I feel you know. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,You know what I was told. get to temporarily rip up your parent card. If it's too much. You get to make that choice not forever. Because in a month or week 24 hours you may feel different.
8683.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's what I don't know, but I know that later in life. With toy. color. I know that. He might have more regrets later. and I don't know like I said I don't feel sorry for the man, because I am a 31 year old woman and I have three children, and I know i've made mistakes and. i've reflected i've tried to grow and i'm always trying to grow, this is that something I can't like I can't forget, you know. And I don't want the kids to have to love anybody, that is, it around them all the time it doesn't support the the you know through good in good times and bad times. So. I don't know, everybody gets tired of everybody telling you how I should feel or what I should do because. Right now, I feel like I just need a break. Even if it's permanent or not permanent like. I feel like I need a break I don't want to talk to him. And I just feel bad because I don't invite him to my son's football games, but. I don't know. I don't know go about that."
252.0,Provider,"I think part of it is you know what you're saying is as far as them being in your kids is like it is about being present. You know you can't. You can't expect to be invited to share the good times if you're not there to help walk through the bad times and. You know he's done done and said a lot of really, really mean things to you."
8683.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't want to feel like using them as a kind of. Foreign I feel like. If you were there. Practice or helping you can you know, everybody. Has a weight loss going, you need anything, or maybe I when I played football, I did this there's not one damn thing I haven't talked to in six months. And, and so, and why does he want to be there. At the at the top at the best at the tops of you know, at our highest."
252.0,Provider,It. You.
8683.0,Patient,"I don't want I don't want to. You know. Nobody in my family gets along with him so when he comes around it's also very awkward and that's another thing is like I don't want his presence like everybody's like walking on eggshells, you know kind of. skirting away because they don't want to make him uncomfortable or rub him the wrong way it's like a problem in. So many so many ways, so for now I just said, for now, like for now I can't it's a no it's an animal. And that's it so i've been feeling okay with that lately so i'm trying to just. continue focusing on trying to step out of my comfort zone, a little bit without moving more and more. don't know gain a lot of reading and meditating and. Just busy all the time, so, but every week I feel less like stressed about. Everything I guess I feel like i'm doing the right thing for me or for them, you know, in terms of protection, because when like I told you when I did. The inner child healing meditation she asked me to protect her, and I said that I could it because I don't even know how to protect myself when I feel like i'm finding a way to protect both right now yeah and. Then it builds good like nothing's gonna hurt nothing's gonna hurt us, you know."
252.0,Provider,I do know.
8683.0,Patient,That you know people.
252.0,Provider,"A lot of people, you know they might not understand they might not they might get hurt feelings, but, honestly, when you set boundaries, with people. And you put you first and you start doing the things that are helping for you they're going to be people to get upset because they, like the other side right. i'm not worried about what other people think and do what's right for you. And it's a Daddy children matter right."
8683.0,Patient,"yeah i've been thinking about that a lot lately it's like. i'm tired of moving for everybody else right, you know. You know even my whole day is consumed i'm just Mon i'm not even you know i'm just during the day, so when. And you know speaking to other adults or who I want in my space or whatever I try to make sure that. i'm speaking for me, you know, and what I want and try this so take care of me. But it's hard it's hard i've never been presented say knows too much to many people. I mean, in my family i'll say no, and stuff like that, but I mean just you know I tried to not say no, a lot, I saw uncomfortable saying no but i'm really trying to. Make sure there's movies crossing anyone's anymore, especially with the kids to me, I could take a walk there I don't want this world is messed up place and I don't want anything. Extra for them that's you know unnecessary so it's been a lot, but I do feel like i'm making some progress, I don't know how, but I feel better."
252.0,Provider,feeling you doing the things that are right and healthy for you.
8683.0,Patient,i'm trying.
252.0,Provider,"And it's really true you go in and you protect that girl you protect that little one inside, you know. And it does bring you some peace, and it does make you feel better and give you the strength to move forward. yeah really done."
8683.0,Patient,"yeah that's I told her, even if I don't talk to him now maybe in a couple months or a year i'll feel like. able to speak to him respectfully because I do I don't i'm still a person who doesn't want to disrespect anybody, you know, but I know the truth hurts. and Then anytime I said something to my father that was kind of out of line he he stopped talking to me for 10 years, so I know this one's going to make it so he didn't even he might make the decision that this is over, you know forever. but either way that closure like like. I feel, sometimes, he would have better, it would have been better if he was dead, because it wouldn't have been this tug of war, you know in and out of being I promise and earn and not show up or whatever, but. it's hard it's hard because he's alive, and you know she wants to see the kids is all this stuff so I just wanted to be able to speak from a. Like a a calm place. and make sure I really like you know, because all these all these images and visions and like you know everything i've suppressed is coming up and I don't even know if it's true or not, or if it's real or not, sometimes I have a dream, it feels like a dream. Mass my mom and she's like yeah, but I do remember very specific moments, and that that really changed my life so. And I feel like he's kind of like a narcissist, so I would think he would gaslight and say that that wasn't you know me or him, it was me like he said I was always a very bad child but. I always excelled in sports I had really good grades, I was, I was a. yeah I was, I was a high energy child, but I. I was always busy always kept myself busy, and I didn't start getting in trouble until high school when girls were I was being bullied severely in high school and. I remember the first day of my freshman year I went to the bathroom and four girls were there, ready to jump me, so I was always I mean i've never initiated a fight but i've always fought to defend myself and that got me in a lot of trouble, no matter, no matter what so. Even with men, you know men touching your grubby me as men, and I was a spicy teenager for sure. But they've had to take me out of jail like juvenile home stuff because of fighting and nothing else, I have no duis no no drug usage no nothing but. yeah he's always said as as out of Crystal and I am the bad at my sister's crystal out of both of us i'm the bad child. or like his most difficult child, you know."
252.0,Provider,How would he know he wasn't really there.
8683.0,Patient,"that's that's insane my mom didn't I always think I didn't even tell my mom Thank you like. You know, hard to work to. Make sure I was okay every day and not you don't think my sister's more MIA pick any of these women. who pulled you out of your mom's House and you know. Like now. The woman that he's been with for like 14 years. She fixes credit now he owns like 12 properties and he's just monopolizing money and it anytime he does work a job and she doesn't make him pays rent or any of the bills or anything like that. He could leave from a night to two weeks, and she doesn't have to respond to her tell her where he's at they sleep in separate rooms. And like I we people have even caught him cheating and brought it to your attention and she's like no that's not what's happening and that's I have been my life story like seeing went like my mom did that for men, because she was a single mother. Every woman, I saw in a relationship with my father was always the provider the. Like lifting a man up. And I think now like, in my last relationship, he was like I mean I was a stay at home mom he's like don't you want to work and I was like no. Why would I do that. Because i've seen a woman work so hard for a man and everything just get ripped out of her him. I don't want to work for any I don't i'm here to work for a relationship, and the second baby like I would. i'll do for myself and my kids but I don't ever want to like have to uplift and a man or take care of amino and I know, sometimes in a partnership like say during the pandemic men lost their jobs and women. You know, as a partnership, but that's a trustful partnership, but I have a really bad idea of women, supporting women and i'm. Sorry, I always I don't know. I don't I just don't know what to do, but she got she's very blinded he blind he goes back to women, a lot and it's kind of scary so. But she went to the game on Sunday, even though I was upset with her after that conversation, and I was cordial my mom my mom can't stand here. At all I think when. My mom and my dad's friend her name is ella. My dad's current girlfriend baby. Okay, and. We will Okay, and when they had the last conversation they had she said, the next time you tried to commit suicide make trees of God. So my mom doesn't like, for my and. i've gotten past that but there's a lot of. nastiness in. That little circle so."
252.0,Provider,wow.
8683.0,Patient,"it's hard it's really hard for me. to navigate everybody and everybody's feelings and thoughts around this one man, you know. But I don't know why my parents relationship that you know I had nothing to do with it really. So I like I said I don't want to take responsibility for this and. Really you're really you guys are just two people with your own traumas trying to you know navigate like me that's forgiven but. Take it, you know, keep it at a distance, like this one, you know because i'm not. Everybody has their own problems and and then not trying to. Like reflect or you know the bring that into anybody's life, so I don't know until I feel like everybody could be. Safe and find and cordial and like we don't really have to do, they are talk about, especially with the kids around. I don't know I feel like. I didn't really say the right things, but I feel like I thought my point to them. I just i'm kind of confused about whether letting. them see the kids I guess. it's asking be achieved be fast enough."
252.0,Provider,"I think that first off, I think that you're thinking and where you're at. is the best place you could possibly be. I really do you're very, very aware very self aware you're very aware of other relationships and what they really mean, and you know there's no sugarcoating on any of it. I think that you're going to make the right decision for you and your babies. yeah there's that's what's most important. yeah you know. So, remember that."
8683.0,Patient,"I mean like I said I just don't want anybody, I think, somebody said that you're using them like you're using them like it's like a bait to get attention I don't want anybody's attention, I want, consistency and unconditional love I want effort, I want like that's fucking bare minimum. yeah from a from a from a from a parent. Because I like i'm telling everybody saying, like my expectations are too high, you know, like i've settled for too little and i'm not going to do it for the kids you're not going to play tug of war with my kids you know i'd rather have them have nobody and. Then, to have the feel feel anything that I felt, you know I want everybody around them to be consistent, I want them to feel stable I don't want I don't want anybody to. take away, you know anything from them like even in sports my dad said you didn't do that good, and if we didn't do that and that I never. It was never like hey did such a good job, you know, and I don't mind doing that rg I don't know I just don't I don't like it, I don't like I don't want the same. Like genetic trauma to be passed down."
252.0,Provider,"To the kids that you acknowledge. happening here is that happened yeah hey i'm gonna be there a you know going to do this and then no show no show you know, let down let down lead and. You know, but and everybody accepts it because it's just the way he's always been some acceptable behavior you say you're going to be there for children be there for my children if you're not going to be there, then you don't need you."
8683.0,Patient,"don't don't be my my sister's a pusher like show push tonight we're going to do a you're going to come on come on we're going to do and i'm not that way you don't want to hang out with me I don't know I don't care at all, you know. I don't at all, but my sister is much. More she's a lot easy easy easy going than I am very bright personality, she doesn't even when I tried to her shows you like won't cry she gets uncomfortable with me crying. because she just doesn't want to think about anything you know she's just pushing it down pushing it down and she forgives and she keeps going, but I am not to her, I admire her for that I wish I was. You know just go out and have friends and drink and you know work and love life and stuff like that, but i'm not i'm not like that I process too much. yeah you know."
252.0,Provider,"I think that you are, you know in this position where you're able to. Really redefine what direction your whole life's going and how your children raised. Is the most they're, the most important people you know, in a world they are that the next generation and generation after that what this world is going to become and keep continue the cycle of trauma. By allowing the same thing over and over again yeah and stop it did in his tracks yeah."
8683.0,Patient,"Well, especially with the stuff i've dealt with, with their father, you know it's like it's my job to do the best I can for them, because it's sometimes all they have yeah. You know and i'm not perfect, so I don't know what to do all the time, but I am desperately desperately trying to to make things okay. For them, I want them to have a justice chance the chance out there, you know between like the mental health issues and. All the violence it I don't know everything all this crazy stuff in life, I just want them to you know be okay with it with themselves and doing something they love and you know not worrying about anything else it's really hard sounds simple but it's so difficult."
252.0,Provider,"really, really, yes, but I can tell you that kids learn mostly. By watching yeah and so they're watching you heal yourself they're watching you to help the things they feel that. Within you know within you when you take care of them, they know when you're hurting they know when you're not they know when you're happy they know when you're done. And when they see that when you're hurting you're doing healthy things to help yourself that's what they learned. amen."
8683.0,Patient,"amen yeah I think. I always a lot of people tell me that fell know they cedar you know, especially when they're older and. They get to see people for who they are other people through they are in the Member all the time we've spent together and they'll understand more, but I try not you know I try to like my eight year olds are extremely upset with me. You don't want me to see my grandpa you don't want me to you know talk to my dad or seat see my dad. And i'm like it's not that it's not that at all like I can't explain it to you because you can't understand it it's not something you should know or understand you know, but I. I do tell him that. Everybody deserves to be happy and I and i've been I have not been happening for a while they not with them, but i'm just meeting. me with myself, you know, and I said and I really want to be happy, I want to work, I want, I want to follow my dreams and I want you know just like you have dreams, I have dream and. I just told him that that's that's The only difference, right now, as those things are getting in the way but. If he wants to talk to this grandpa he could have a conversation with his grandpa going to have a conversation with his dad or whoever he could have a conversation with these people, but I can't speak for other people, you know. So yeah nothing that I tell him because he really understand until he's older, so I just hope you forgive forgive me. For you know all my mistakes."
