527.0,Provider,yeah well how are you doing how's things been since we last spoke.
11461.0,Patient,"um I know. good and bad. depressions been really bad, but. I really been. Fighting through my resistance. I am our last session I. It became very apparent to me that. I resist. Dealing with my issues quite a bit. I worked hard. To to work on them, but I think I deny a lot of things. Okay um you know there's that balance between you know sucking it up and get them, making it to life, and you know i'm letting go and you know, to understand how you feel and. Okay um. You know I i've been asked a lot about my. My. Oh, what do you call it i'm. A dancer vanishes and you know, without we went back with you, with other therapists you know about my job to the stuff like that. And i've come to the conclusion that I actually do have very severe. abandonment issues, I mean this isn't anything new that i've had abandonment issues but. I. I i've come to realize, there are a lot worse than i've been admitting to. I think that. A lot of what I do. negatively is is a result of that I took I push people away. A lot. And then I don't do it on purpose it's also. Conscious but. I do it, I do it a lot, you know i'll say things that offend people I will. I will offend people directly and and. And I realized this because you know I push people away I also don't I mean there's some people that I work very, very hard. To maintain my relationships with but. Most people I go out of my way not to be in touch with them and it's all because I don't want to be. rejected night I don't want to be abandoned by them."
527.0,Provider,yeah and i'm going to leave first before anybody has the opportunity to hurt me.
11461.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly um. I don't know what to do about it, I mean except you know, be more courageous but. I think it's one of my biggest problems and I don't know how to deal with it."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, what kind of what kind of thoughts or feelings, have you been having about about that, like."
11461.0,Patient,"Well it's kind of been a process of you know, trying to journal, you know my feelings and you know, whenever I when i'm feeling sad or wonder if something bad happens. I think about okay. If I write something down what what I right and it got into several moments and different times throughout the last two weeks. Or, I really kind of just sat back now no movies, no, no, video games and just sat there and thought about you know all the time to their push people away all the time that you know that i've been. abandoned, you know and a lot of the sops hit popping popping in my head I talking about 1000 times a day all of them are either me pushing someone away and feeling stupid about it or or or me being afraid of somebody event or somebody actually banned me and it being hard. Okay, so. yeah that's what Bradley about."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah. So where do you where do you want to start with that Steve.
11461.0,Patient,I ignore their.
527.0,Provider,Good observation for yourself.
11461.0,Patient,yeah I have no idea.
527.0,Provider,So what have you been doing to try to push me away.
11461.0,Patient,"Nothing nothing I mean you are. I mean i've had a lot of therapists been me to you know so. All of them, in fact, I mean there was one that did that a couple that that you know I I quit seeing them. Because I didn't really think I was getting anywhere with them, but there's a lot that have been abandoned me they just stopped. You know, making appointments with me one straight out definitely I mean it's been pretty bad so. it's hard to go to therapy. yeah. So I have I during shooting the push you away, maybe um I don't know if I didn't realize it and he's have my bed offensive or anything like that that's you know not who I am they just what I do. And I don't even realize i'm doing it most of."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah well, I think, too, I don't know that you've tried to push me away, you certainly push ideas and suggestions and and I think i've called you out on it. Like when i've you're like. Well i've tried that didn't work and try that done more tried that doesn't work and so. You know you're real quick to do that and so versus well, maybe let's look at a different perspective of it and do something. You know, yes, maybe that didn't but why didn't that work and so exploring those options differently so yeah I think I don't know how are you feeling about things that you've been doing. Excuse me, things that you've been doing the last few weeks, because I know we've tried to do some more exposure things and challenge, some of those kind of self sabotaging behaviors."
11461.0,Patient,"yeah um. I don't know if you can just resistance to therapy resistance to dealing with. You know my emotions um I don't know that's really pushing me one away um. But. yeah I mean there's a lot of things that I tried that haven't that they haven't worked and. I suppose I can keep beating at it, you know with you know from a different perspective but cure. In the last few weeks um. I don't know i'm pretty lost the whole thing isn't much time as I spent thinking about my mental health and thinking about you know what I can do to make it better hey just. I really just don't come up with any answers. Not many anyway."
527.0,Provider,So what have you been journaling in regards to the abandonment stuff is there anything you want to particularly share or focus on for today and maybe set some goals around Steve.
11461.0,Patient,"i'm thinking to set goals. I mean I identified certain things I mean there's certainly my. My divorces my daughter. And you know that's all severe abandonment during. I don't know what kind of goals, I can set around that and. You know I mean I can set goals around you know, the future of you're not pushing people away but."
527.0,Provider,"what's getting you a hung up on being able to move past the abandonment because yeah we can certainly think about ways to not do it moving forward. But where are you at right in this moment with what you're feeling about it, like what what's keeping you where you're at, because if we don't address that then it's not the way it doesn't matter future goals."
11461.0,Patient,"I finished, but. deep down, I feel like i'm not worthy of not being advantage that anyone who gets posted me should abandon me."
527.0,Provider,Okay. yeah because my parents abandoned me.
11461.0,Patient,"I. don't think there's that so much um. I think, maybe that bugged me through my childhood."
527.0,Provider,yeah. yeah let's talk about that a little bit like Tony tell me about that.
11461.0,Patient,I can't recall a single mom is a child. My mother never wanted me I don't think that ever really I don't think I ever really felt that way um.
527.0,Provider,remind me again how old you are when you got adopted.
11461.0,Patient,Six months.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I thought you were a teeny baby so. yeah okay. yeah okay. And what was behind the adoption."
11461.0,Patient,"My biological mother. had an affair, with your professor, who was married and had kids and and he insisted and her parents and insisted that I get put up for adoption."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11461.0,Patient,"I mean just that simple, you know when I talked to my biological mother a lot about this and I said, you know, there was no there's no answer. That you could give me that would have made a difference because at the end of the day, I found the parents that i'm i'm grateful if you weren't able, and you know that that you gave me up for adoption said, you know turning do yourself in a bad situation or. or or having an abortion, you know i'm very grateful for that niamh because I have wonderful parents and. So."
527.0,Provider,When did you find out that you were adopted.
11461.0,Patient,"However, I remember the first time, I was told, and I was reminded of it several times so i've always known. It was never some big surprise you know my parents always had this really, really great thing, where you know they sit me down, they say, you know I want you to know that you know that. Someone else or your parents, but you know you're special because we picked you, you know so anyway just just really, really sweet. speech you know, so to speak. That i'm sure that the the adoption agencies, you know, probably gave gave my parents that you know and in a ticket something that my mom practice. because she said it perfectly you know, and my mom isn't necessarily a an incredibly well spoken moment so. wasn't and. But she killed that I feel I know I remember feeling good about the conversation."
527.0,Provider,"I was gonna say what, what do you remember about first hearing that I remembered that she made me feel special."
11461.0,Patient,"And that I I did I felt special. Because I was chosen because yeah I was lucky, I felt lucky. That I was chosen."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. How did kids respond. When they knew. or when they found out that you were adopted. I was that.
11461.0,Patient,"There was nothing negative there was nothing negative, in fact, there was a lot of people who always been a lot of people. i've been surrounded by that there were adopted chill you know all my elementary school classes Karen white my profession, open to people, they all you know where that and even when I found my I. found my birth mother an accident. Either I put it up on Facebook, you know about about what happened and and and and a lot of people started sending me private messages that are my friends list. That I had no idea that they were adopted."
527.0,Provider,And you know they shared their experiences with me and and all that kind of gave me some really great advice so it's Nice. mm hmm.
11461.0,Patient,I mean it's always fairly positive that you know that way so.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so what was what was your parents kind of approach to your biological parents like where they open to you know, did they share a lot of information about them."
11461.0,Patient,already have a lot of.
527.0,Provider,English okay.
11461.0,Patient,But they told me everything they knew everything.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11461.0,Patient,"which was it might add that my name was going to be Alan that. That it was true, but my mother and my Professor edit here, Professor. And you know everything they told me everything yeah. They even they even showed me papers on. You know, with with all the information. In the Adoption Agency wide about what my nationality. Was they said I was half Filipino and have Portuguese and my father is pure Portuguese my mother is mostly Filipino. which you know, made it for a really cool Nash, but i'm pretty sure the Adoption Agency glide to my parents and they can feel like I was maybe like our own biological kids because i've had my gene a test and say, and I didn't have dropped Portuguese yes."
527.0,Provider,yeah. yeah so how were they open to you looking for your parents are you know finding out or.
11461.0,Patient,"Meeting i've never i've. Never looked for my parents, I only actually only ran into my biological mother, because I want to know what what my GPA was so i'm not cool for 100 bucks I can find out, you know what nationality is that because that's not something I really know and. And, and I did that. I get the results back six weeks later, and it says, you know hear your DNA results you're from you know these regions of this these countries and. And then and it's time now click here to find find your matches matches was just a dating site, so the first first listing up there, and it says there's a 99.99% chance that carolyn headway is your biological mother oh wow that blew me away. And I never it never occurred to me. That could happen, you know it never occurred to me so i'm honestly I might not have done it if I thought that was possibility I don't regret it, but um so anyway."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
11461.0,Patient,"my sister who's obviously also adopted. Okay, she did look for her biological parents and never found that you know. She was just funded by that but I never cared you know, and she and I talked about it and. I said no i'm never gonna look for them, why would I, why would I care, I said. hey at the end of the day, either you know. If my mother was a drug addict you lucky, you know next to next to a dumpster. Or you know wonderful woman who just couldn't you know. we're just wasn't in a position, you would you have for religious reasons or whether, in which ended up kind of being true and. You know it doesn't really matter makes no difference now why would mind, let her give me a give me up, I can pick them 1000 meters, you know so it's nothing personal and I know that sounds like me being my typical over overly logical self, but I really feel that way. I think adoptions, are very, very noble thing you know i'm i'm pro choice, but I think that's a great thing money you know someone says, well, I can't keep this child, but I, you know i'll go through the process, and you know finding the family loves them yeah."
527.0,Provider,"So that's your logical process, but what are your feelings."
11461.0,Patient,I mean. I don't feel any sadness that my mother didn't want me um. I don't I don't think I ever had. You know what would you say.
527.0,Provider,"So what do you feel, though."
11461.0,Patient,"Well, I feel grateful and all that but she's more looking for you know, maybe negative feelings and."
527.0,Provider,Maybe maybe not I don't know.
11461.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I mean that would be helpful. I dug deep into this, I really feel like I dug deep on this and I can think of a lot of things that I feel. abandoned for this just isn't one of them I just don't think it is, but it explains why I would it would explain why I was you know so sheltered nervous as a kid navy. But. yeah you know I mean I met her I spent I spent the weekend, you know with my biological mother and there wasn't like."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11461.0,Patient,"He didn't we had this this slightly uncomfortable dinner, where you know she's like well do you have any questions for me and I don't like well I guess the question just ask is you know why did you give me up and she gave me the the whole thing and. And that was fine. And it was just a nice conversation, it was a really nice dinner. I didn't really feel like I I. had any burning questions you know um."
527.0,Provider,I really just don't how did. How did you feel being with her.
11461.0,Patient,"Well that's good question um I was nervous and what was I nervous about um. I don't know what could have happened. I suppose, maybe I was afraid that. Maybe I just really, really didn't like her, that there were things that i'm about her that. That I saw that I. That I see in myself that I don't like. That wasn't the case that she was really delightful and. Now my biological sister her daughter my sister. I haven't met her face to face yet, but. She had a terrible upbringing. From my biological mother terrible. I mean, he felt abandoned yeah and and and she was there, the whole time i'm they agreed on nothing, it was a lot of anger still has a tremendous amount of anger they don't talk to each other. Just. awful and he was even add that she found out about me that the day before she met me, you know i'm buying on the phone and stuff like that. You know so. And she's had nothing but terrible stories about about my ladder so. I felt really I feel really bad for her. So that gave me a lot of relief, you know that you know what wow what a great thing that I was not raised by this woman, I would have been horrible. um so anyway. um."
527.0,Provider,"So what was that, like here in those things from your sister."
11461.0,Patient,"And it made me realize where my mental health issues come from you know that there's apparently a hereditary biological aspect to it. That made a lot of sense to me my and. I guess my and if you were needed like Oh, this is your. Typical sweet little old lady, you know if you would have met her, but she she had a heroin problem all kinds of stuff. Abuse she was abused by some of our axis and."
527.0,Provider,How much of an age differences there between you and your sister.
11461.0,Patient,Nine years. Nine years old yeah.

You know her birthdays in the team in a couple days i'll send her a message, then, but you know we were chatting a lot he and we get along and I talked to her daughter's my niece's. But I hadn't heard from any of them in a while now, so you know it's fine. I was gonna you know fly out to meet them but, but then cope with it, and he said she didn't want me to come out until you know all the kids got vaccinated which they are now and I haven't heard from her, but I couldn't afford the last year anyway. yeah."
527.0,Provider,yeah. What about your What about your biological dad any.
11461.0,Patient,"I have all kinds of information on him I did his name is selling unique that there's there's no way there's you know there's two of them. And there's the I found one that lives in San Francisco i've got all kinds of information on them, I even found this phone number, but I wrote none of it down. You know I mean I I just don't you know I mean he suggested that that she got a she gave me up for adoption, because he had a family and I, for that reason don't want to contact it now, you know, maybe his current wife will."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I was going to what I wanted to ask is what are your feelings about how that all played out."
11461.0,Patient,"Okay, let me answer that one SEC at each restroom. How does, I feel about."
527.0,Provider,yeah how did you feel about knowing that your dad was adamant that no. I I his actions resulted in a pregnancy and didn't want to be a part of it at all.
11461.0,Patient,"um. I think I felt the same way about it that I would, if someone else had told me the story about them, it felt like. You know what a jerk for not stepping up to the plate but yeah. I don't blame him, you know if I were in some situation I would want I would want best weapon, and now I would not have been."
527.0,Provider,Okay that's this this is your logical yeah. yeah get. Get. Your get out of your logical mind. yeah because I I don't necessarily agree where you're going either.
11461.0,Patient,"agree at all, where I was going on, because I would not have done the same thing."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, because I was gonna say what if you heard that from from one of your friends this this situation this story. What feelings would arise."
11461.0,Patient,"I would say that one I, and I, and I mean this, I would say that one of the worst things in the world, you can do is be a parent when you don't want to be one. I think those are the people who end up terrible parents. I think that some people rise to the occasion, but I think it's kind of rare. Of. I mean it would never be a situation where somebody said oh yeah my. mind my my. My parents gave me up for adoptions. And, and I would say wow what jerks I don't think there's any situation, I will say that. I would say it's a very unfortunate, and you know i'm sorry that you're going to you that if you're going through anything about you know regarding that you feel bad way about that, but um. anything."
527.0,Provider,What are your feelings towards your father.
11461.0,Patient,I wouldn't want to be raised by him. I don't think I mean I don't know him but.
527.0,Provider,Okay that's a thought. what's your feelings. don't don't. don't don't make it harder for you.
11461.0,Patient,"I don't have any feelings about it, or I can't identify any feelings, I have about it."
527.0,Provider,Okay. Okay that's fair that's fair.
11461.0,Patient,yeah and i'm even trying to put some sample feelings in my head to see how that fits.
527.0,Provider,Like like do you feel like he's a jerk for. not holding you know not being accountable for his actions.
11461.0,Patient,I think anyone that doesn't. You know. rise to the occasion and take care of their child you see jerk.
527.0,Provider,Would you say that to his face if you saw him. Would you like to say that to his face.
11461.0,Patient,If now. Now I wouldn't I wouldn't say. I wouldn't want to and I wouldn't do it. I don't feel this enough. and The problem that i'm having is for me to to to feel to say that for me to say that. You know I resent you for not keeping the and taking care of me means that I regret having the parents that I have I can't I I I just. I just doesn't work that way.
527.0,Provider,Does that have to equal that because I do for you. yeah.
11461.0,Patient,"i'm traveling I suppose it doesn't but that's certainly begging, but that comes into my head."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because i'm not asking you to take sides, or have different feeling i'm just wanting you to acknowledge your feelings about your biological family and we haven't even got to your adoptive family."
11461.0,Patient,"Well, I guess, I I have. I guess I have. A separate I and. I wish you hadn't abandoned me which isn't true I resent you for abandoning me which i'm not sure that's true either."
527.0,Provider,What i'm wondering if if you're struggling with Steve is. Having. Conflicting emotions that are both true.
11461.0,Patient,"No, I don't think I do."
527.0,Provider,Like you can be a jerk. right but i'm grateful. That.
11461.0,Patient,That you did what you.
527.0,Provider,That you did what you did like. sit with both of those.
11461.0,Patient,"I accept that those are two separate issues and and that both can happen at the same time um I don't know how much I feel that way, though I you know I mean, I have a friend who I kind of dated in high school but i'm. In adulthood, she got pregnant and. and engage the kid up for for adoption I think it's a great thing that she did you know, did you abandon that child now know what she did what she thought was best for that man, I feel. Oh yeah that's what my mother felt to you know and. And I even asked her i'm like I said, do you regret it, she said signal I wasn't in place where I could do it my parents were against. were against it and you know, and he was adamantly against it, I wouldn't had to ruin a marriage to do it, you know and and I was just a child, you know so. It can Kevin um so it's hard for me to say that someone's a jerk for doing that do I feel abandoned by. By them for doing that."
527.0,Provider,"that's that was gonna be my question. that's a strong strong word RU RU abandoned, have you been abandoned."
11461.0,Patient,"Or whether I was advantage not is different from do I feel bad that. I felt like they made a logical decision, but that doesn't matter whether they actually physically event me, you know, do I feel event and answers now I just don't I don't, I can tell you all kinds of things that I feel dangerous for I just. I just don't feel that way about this, I really don't."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11461.0,Patient,"You know and i've run so many scenarios it's like do I feel this do, I feel that do I feel this and just always always you know, and I don't feel like i'm fighting myself on this. I know."
527.0,Provider,Was there anything you wanted to hear from from your biological mom when you met with her.
11461.0,Patient,"No, I just wanted to get to know her there was nothing she's like okay why imagine you have some questions i'm like you know. Literally all my questions are just getting to know you yeah. yeah I want you to get to know me and but."
527.0,Provider,"When did you let her know about you like, who were you at that."
11461.0,Patient,"You know I just you know your basic stuff like my career my kid. You know. My divorces things like that you know um. You know what what I like and. I don't know um you know what my upbringing was like was very important to her. and It was that kind of stuff there were no burning questions like Okay, you know what will you really going through and and those questions came."
527.0,Provider,up many those were low on the list.
11461.0,Patient,"You know I really just wanted to know you know what she did for a living and. You know what she. Does with her free time which is almost nothing. very sad. And she has no friends absolutely no friends, she works in the garden he watches TV I said. She has no relationship with her family, nothing. So i'm. yeah you know I didn't have any burning questions and I thought, a lot about it, before going out there. And what am I wanting out what do I want to know and. And I even consulted you're all my friends, you said they were adopted, like what kind of questions you get asked you know and."
527.0,Provider,"So, how did you feel doing that. And in in your parents, knowing that."
11461.0,Patient,"Well, my. First loyalty is to them, and so, when I never even contacted her when I first found out that she even existed and that I knew I had to get get Ahold of her. I said, my parents down I said so, you know here's the situation wasn't looking forward to happen, and you know I told them exactly, but what I told you and. And I said, you know how do you how would you feel if I were to contact her and tell her that. You know i'm doing okay just let you know, or if I were to talk to her she's been my baby, both for coming to go ahead and have a relationship with her, you know and then we're not. it's not either or you know it's just you know it would be wonderful and there was even going to be before my mom died they they were going to come up with me to see her again. You know, so that was a good situation I there was a lot of are you sure are you sure you know i'm, not just in that moment but. In so Robin moments and and they were fine with it and said Okay, this is because I should because you know I don't care about this woman she's yeah not the person who raised me, you know he's not my real mother. knew my real parents, I made sure to tell them that never very, very cool very, very cool. So that was good um."
527.0,Provider,Do you think they questioned that Steve.
11461.0,Patient,Questions what.
527.0,Provider,"That you felt like they were there, your parents."
11461.0,Patient,serum.
527.0,Provider,That you needed to reassure them that.
11461.0,Patient,"No, but if I were in their shoes, I would have liked to have heard that I think I think I would have liked to have heard that reaffirmation you know that you know. I am, who I am because you I am you know, I was raised by you, I my bills were paid, you know was part of my head, you know the love, taking care of me when I was sick I was all you know i'm. I made that very clear and I think I would want to hear that too. So do I think they doesn't probably not you know there's some things that you know I said, you know when I was a teenager that might have been kind of hurtful in that in that regard yeah."
527.0,Provider,And that's why I was gonna say is there things that you needed the affirmation that you were their son. In that importance there.
11461.0,Patient,"No, I didn't need that. I didn't. I didn't I think that's. If you'd have asked me that question when I was you know. somewhere between 15 and 22. I would have been like well you know, things are said and. And things weren't always perfect, but your novel them adult and I look back and i've been a parent, you know to to to kids that are adults, now that i'm you know. In debt, you know I mean I put a lot of things into perspective for me and and you know, for the last you know. 2030 years you know i've been very close my parents. Last 1015 years."
527.0,Provider,Have you resolve that within yourself the things that you've said the hurtful things that you've said.
11461.0,Patient,"drink so i'm. There wasn't many of them there was a couple of comments. In some some really tough times, but so though it wasn't like you know sorry for those lot you know for the I feel bad for five years of being a complaint deck because that's not true. You know, it was it was you know, two or three moments, you know I think I told my dad once I get a refund get a refund because you did a crappy job which I didn't mean you know. And that's awful and I feel bad for that you know and as i've said before the end Those are the things that that people say that you just can't take back the matter what. And I think that might kind of fall in that category, but. yeah I mean. It was a couple of moments, and I was a kid you know so."
527.0,Provider,"And, and what you've said to me, before is. Something several of those intrusive thoughts, you were a kid. So why, why is that easier to let go of than others for."
11461.0,Patient,"me doing something. To someone in that I have an exceptional relationship with someone I live with someone that I talked to every day, as opposed to something that was done to me or. You know and. When someone hurt me. that's the difference, I think."
527.0,Provider,That you heard someone.
11461.0,Patient,"I did I did, and there are times that i've heard people, but I. Those things those moments popped into my head and i'm haunted by them this isn't one of them, it is because I feel really feel like i've resolved that."
527.0,Provider,kind of did you resolve it.
11461.0,Patient,"Some of the findings of relationship and I apologize for it, you know so. and yeah."
527.0,Provider,Okay. So how do we work on those others that you hold on to.
11461.0,Patient,Other thoughts that popped in my head i'm. $5 million question. I don't know. I don't know I don't know why they're unresolved I have spent thousands of hours you know you're picking each one of these things apart and I just. I don't know why I can't medical there's even sound that it's just weird that I can't let them go.
527.0,Provider,What was dad's response when you apologized.
11461.0,Patient,"He said he so soft spoken until easy going oh that's fine it's okay. I was it. It was a long conversation, but it wasn't. i'm sure it hurt him at the time that was unfortunately my intention, but. You know yeah."
527.0,Provider,So where do you think the abandonment came in.
11461.0,Patient,"i've been abandoned by a lot of friends, and you know early on. And i've been in bands by regard. pretty much every single one I mean I you know broken hearts myself but. Now you know my. I felt very, very betrayed by both my both my wives and I have a lot of pain for for both the sense. yeah Bennett from praying to nobody showing up for my birthday, but that was a big back I realized, I see professional that sounds but I mean I had so many close close friends, and now it seems like I have one more snaps. and"
527.0,Provider,So you said earlier Steve you recognize like some patterns that probably have pushed people away what what patterns were you able to see.
11461.0,Patient,The pattern just consistent.
527.0,Provider,"When did you first have that feeling of abandonment when you were younger, because you said it happened when you can see it when you. Like with friends growing up."
11461.0,Patient,"Get fifth grade I told you, the story last session session before. Fifth grade, and you know my friends are a lot more mature than I and. You know, they were avoiding on the playground and, and I mean they were gone nowhere to be found, and I looked everywhere, and I saw the misery rewinding back up. To go back into class and I jumped on the back of one one of my friend, she turned around and punch. yeah I was kind of playing around when when I jumped on and we'll go you just did to me and I just got back at your own pace me and with a nurse's office, and he. never know power of Jesus loves. me just asked me if I were all right, but. I mean that was the beginning of abandonment from all those guys."
527.0,Provider,What if you would have gotten an apology would that have changed things.
11461.0,Patient,If there were an apology and they accepted me anyway. um. That wouldn't change things.
527.0,Provider,Because yeah because your dad did that.
11461.0,Patient,Put that together. try to find the link there.
527.0,Provider,Because you let that go. Because dad dad apologized. or accept your apology.
11461.0,Patient,That that yeah i'm.
527.0,Provider,accepted you.
11461.0,Patient,"Yes. yeah that's right. i'm i'm married I guess that would be the similarity um. I mean I hit it, but it made me feel better um I feel horrible about myself that you know, I was such a um I was selling mature. But I mean that's not my fault I get that but. I suppose I wish they had said so in this dude slow down calm down South hacking, just as we are we're almost in junior high now you know all that and then, when we were in junior high that they would have had the same conversation so down relax you know all that that. might be that. And so I guess that creates a chain reaction of things was I not worthy of having that conversation with him, I asked him too much you know from kids to be so mature and so, and you know um. Was I such a bad friend that I that they didn't want to hold on to me, no matter what. Is that asking so much."
527.0,Provider,How did you learn about socialization because you're an only child.
11461.0,Patient,"No, not, I have a sister."
527.0,Provider,"Well, but you guys didn't grow up together."
11461.0,Patient,"Right, you know my I have a adopted sister, who I grew up playing. Oh okay yeah we're two years apart."
527.0,Provider,No okay.
11461.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I grew up. Here I used to be very close we're not at all. and I learned socialization. From. From the humbling of being alone. In elementary school middle school and high school now so much middle school but but definitely freshman sophomore year in high school. I was very much around and then there was a point where I only had one friend and we hung out all the time she it was it was a female and there was no like you know romantic thing there and. You went bunch together, every day we talked on the phone every night. I know. All right, I mean that's kind of how I learned it and I, and I gotta say all that abandonment really kind of forced me to be good and softer situation. is probably would even got me into sales, you know that I could be someone that influences others. You know. And that's that's what really drove me over the years to to work on my social skills."
527.0,Provider,"So the immaturity was there. So what were you seeing with others, that you didn't see within yourself at that age."
11461.0,Patient,What do you mean.
527.0,Provider,"Like What did you notice about your about the kids around you at the same age, you were in fifth grade What did you notice them doing as far as what play with friends like with overseas missions."
11461.0,Patient,There were a lot less anxious and I was a lot less in fact you felt any anxiety at all. They were damn good at hiding it.
527.0,Provider,Okay. So your anxiety came out in impulsiveness. Okay.
11461.0,Patient,"i'm. Okay, that we were starting to add be interested in girls and and. You know my instinct was there, too, but I was just. I wasn't as cool, as it were. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"So you noticed, you were different."
11461.0,Patient,yeah. hmm.
527.0,Provider,and different not bad.
11461.0,Patient,"Different meant that I had problems that I felt like I had problems, but I didn't know what they were."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11461.0,Patient,"And look at me 40 years later, I still don't. yeah. I mean we've been saying we were interested in all the same things that I was just as hyperactivity mature kid."
527.0,Provider,"So, probably undiagnosed at that time with. Our anxiety, or maybe ADHD or something."
11461.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean. pretty much none of those things really even existed back then. And then of course it good but. Nobody knew how to diagnose it. Certainly, how to treat it. So yeah that was there. I mean, I had a friend who lived down the street. She was diagnosed as being hyperactive is what they called it and. And their solution to it was to reduce the amount of sugar, he he takes it. A call the beach ADHD were the two types of sugars and he had to avoid. And like just spent all sugar and and we thought that was a solution is very severe problems so."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11461.0,Patient,"um there was not even a thought of diagnosing me because I battled through it. Obviously you know. it's still resulted in modern social issues, but um. yeah I mean I just kind of model to it, there was ever a discussion about diagnosing. Around too many problems with my sister anyway so."
527.0,Provider,"Ah, so you tried to be the wallflower."
11461.0,Patient,um.
527.0,Provider,"hi hide in the background, so that because there's enough focus on your sister."
11461.0,Patient,"don't think there was any of that, I would say that the word wallflowers is a word that I would never have used to describe me in my entire life. But along that same you know line of thinking, I don't think I ever fought for attention. In fact I got a lot of positive attention and she got a lot of negative attention. You know, despite my issues, I was bringing home straight days I was never getting in trouble at school you're all that stuff you know."
527.0,Provider,"Because you saw what was going on with your sister. I don't want to cause more problems for my parents, maybe."
11461.0,Patient,"No. No, I don't think that necessarily influenced me um it might have a man i'm sure he did a little bit, but I don't think that was a very driving force in me growing up. I just. You know I mean I skipped school, sometimes, but I was smart about it, you know I cared whether I got caught, so I did it in very smart ways. yeah I had to do Saturday school couple of times and never had your attention. bill I. skipped entire days, two times. to hang out with my girlfriend and you know who also skipped school and and you know site and address it, you know, and he got caught smoking weed so you know, having the gun reform school or continuation from reform school they call it yeah and. You know just all kinds of things always always getting in trouble never ever doing her homework and all that now we just never an issue for me."
527.0,Provider,So what do you think about doing some journaling around the relationships that you've lost and your responses reactions. Facts truths emotions.
11461.0,Patient,"Okay. Greg I would be pretty easy. All right, we pretty easy okay."
527.0,Provider,yeah cuz it sounds like there's some pretty impactful situations that are still getting in the way of your successes.

You know, some things that you know definitely are you know I think just being honest about where that where you're digging in heels, and that resistance and what i'm going to challenge myself on and push push myself to be uncomfortable."
11461.0,Patient,yeah yeah I guess what I tried to do but it's it's very hard. yeah very hard.
527.0,Provider,yeah well it's it's much easier to do what you've always done versus try something different or sit in that uncomfortable. feeling for for a bit.
11461.0,Patient,"I mean i'm not thrilled about the idea of being uncomfortable but if. You if. You get to it, the hard part is identifying whether it's actually there like this whole doctrine thing we spent a half, I mean almost. Half half the sessions and learning to do, I feel this too, I feel bad I just I feel like i'm pounding my head against the adoption thing and I just don't think there's anything better, but I have. The hard part is that I have to do that for everything and really be open and because what some of those things are gonna be like ah, there we go, I think I might."
