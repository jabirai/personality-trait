498.0,Provider,"Okay now. I will require that you see me in two weeks. Because. I would not do provide a prescription for 30 days out, knowing that we're trying to taper down your your usage so two weeks is the the most accurate offer at this point."
15606.0,Patient,Are you want to do prescribe me to response to. Correct and then after.
498.0,Provider,"And then you revisit with me in two weeks and we assess the efficacy of the taper medication, along with therapy and then we develop another plan from there."

In providing it for two weeks, so that we could prepare your body to taper down off of the usage of the xanax and possibly explore some other things that are less addictive, but still provide you with some relief."
15606.0,Patient,You mean even some other moons.
498.0,Provider,Possibly I mean it depends on how you it depends on how you respond to the next two weeks of therapy.
15606.0,Patient,"So, are you, seeing that after two weeks I have to drop down one. I got one."
498.0,Provider,"wants to say, maybe, or you may stay at for for another two weeks and actually add in something else to see if it works fine for you i'm not i'm not saying that you have to do anything for two weeks i'm just saying let's see how the next two weeks go at four that's all. not holding you to anything."
15606.0,Patient,"honestly. I promise you well, I can go down. To 565 in next two weeks."
498.0,Provider,"I understand that yeah i'm just asking you to try, if you can't if it's not beneficial to you if it's not. comfortable to you, I understand that i'm just proposing it as."

498.0,Provider,All right.
15606.0,Patient,"All right, in the. middle of time I did, but not right now, you know new will be there might be something that can clear my head. But if you send me Okay, after two weeks. Only I said. Not coming down then. what's The next step."
498.0,Provider,"Well, there could be lots of next steps, it could be well, we could take you up to five and try out, you know something from migraines like Tipton."
15606.0,Patient,"i'm not my friend, I have attention headed person. My goodness. I guess you're heading."
498.0,Provider,"that's not the only option if it's tension if it's tension, then we could go with something like anti histamine that will cause you a good cause, you some relaxation and. Over. I said, an Anti histamine not, not even if it's like vista real or hydroxyl seen I could make you a referral to. Julie kane who's our our kind of pain person she has a pain group she specializes in pain management, it may be something that you need to see. One of my associates for i'm just saying see how the next two weeks ago, you know you you absolutely can decline the offer that i'm making for the two weeks to me it's just. A step towards tapering or determining. determining how reliant upon six milligrams you are that's all that's all it's completely up to you, you can take the two week appointment, or you can decline, a two week appointment and out as that jira schedule a follow up with you, with. To see of julie's available it's it's again it's completely up to you."
15606.0,Patient,Let me try. There might be something to place with some medicine for. There is some potential there.
498.0,Provider,"may be what because you're. feeling your headache and attention headache and it also includes some stress anxiety related to just some of the lifestyle changes that you've been through in the most recent. You know, in the most recent timeframe and so again all i'm saying is let's see how for works if you find that it's not working, and we need to. formulate another plan i'll be more than happy to you know reassess that with you reassess your need see if any of your environmental changes have. You know, changed they have there's something else that we could introduce into a treatment plan that will allow you some relief it's just that. I don't feel comfortable only only leaving you with xanax as an only option that's all I would like to introduce some other things to you that may not be. As harmful long term with less addictive properties, but I understand that you have a long history with xanax and that's not something that I would ask for you to do today."
15606.0,Patient,"What if you give me. Two months of time. If you give me. Too much time, if I can go down to. For. Any If not, then just. find something."
