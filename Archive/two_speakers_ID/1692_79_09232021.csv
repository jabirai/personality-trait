1692.0,Patient,"Oh no too much, I guess, I haven't seen you for a couple of weeks."
79.0,Provider,"yeah beginning of September, so I mean your races coming up. Like what two or three weeks."
1692.0,Patient,yeah like like two and a half. yeah yeah I don't think anything super crazy just been like settling in and. I think things are much less hectic and they were a couple of weeks ago.
79.0,Provider,awesome you're kind of interesting.
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,So that's cool yeah. Good and how is the. let's see you've got only like a week and a half left of running then really before you really quiet it down right before the race. where you have if you're running.
1692.0,Patient,"For sure yeah and this This is like the first week where i'm like really like starting to taper down a little bit and I, I think I really need it because my like body's just feeling really fatigued these days."
79.0,Provider,cool yeah.
1692.0,Patient,yeah so i'm really looking forward to like lowering the volume and. You can't break after this.
79.0,Provider,"Totally yeah no that's awesome that you're like all right, I can feel it there's a reason, you know that research says drop it down yeah sometimes I think about before if people really knew and all the. Running right up until it. Anyway, it's kind of cool um. Any increased anxiety at all coming with the race coming up, though, like are you nervous, are you excited."
1692.0,Patient,I don't think I mean i'll probably be nervous like the week leading up right now and just yeah I mean i'm just enjoying it and enjoying like feeling healthy and being able to like go out and do things but. yeah yeah I think sorry i'm going to check my cat is like she's like.
79.0,Provider,yeah go for it. Now go here.
1692.0,Patient,Ah.
79.0,Provider,What was she doing.
1692.0,Patient,"She is so spoiled like that is in the office, and she started like grabbing of the carpet and pulling it up like underneath the door like scratching at the door. So."
79.0,Provider,it's funny yeah cats and when you're at the computer a lot of times they still want to be there i'm like but we're totally like occupied.
1692.0,Patient,yeah I think that's why they're like hey i'm here to.
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no that's i'm sure you're right you're right so true. um yeah anything good with food that you were like you'd be proud of this, or anything that you're realizing I i'm getting a little hungry or at this stage, you know, especially with running and building. up for a big race sometimes that happens."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know like. I think just with like the volume not like i'm doing crazy volume, but I like am definitely eating more than I would have otherwise, just like makes sense. I. Think it's been really helpful but. there's that. I do feel like i've just been able to be more like intuitive. kind of like go with my gut feeling. And that's been like really, really nice."
79.0,Provider,awesome yeah give me an example.
1692.0,Patient,"And I think like. Oh yeah like last night or yesterday evening, I went for a run like I just went on the treadmill obese, it was like really nasty weather. and afterwards I. was like i'm going to go like somewhere and get something like maybe i'll go to trader joe's and pick up some groceries and see like what stuff they have. And bagels. awesome like immediately, I was like okay i'm gonna have a pumpkin bagel for dinner and then some other stuff. I did that, and then I had one this morning to."
79.0,Provider,"so nice do just toast it with a little better, how do you do it."
1692.0,Patient,"So, last night I just like eight it, because then I went to like a couple of other places, after that, so I was just. rhythm, and I mean it was great. yeah so just like letting myself try different things, and like. baked goods and stuff like that."
79.0,Provider,mm hmm.
1692.0,Patient,"So yeah that's that's been really. I think really helpful and. yeah it's nice just having like a variety of foods, like in the apartment and like. I think that's just super helpful that. A lot, the only one, just like picking up like and I feel like when i'm just shopping for myself i'm like very stingy and I don't yeah a lot of variety so. So that I think that's been like super helpful. yeah. And I have a cool yeah and I I like for a long time with like meal prep everything and have like a ton of containers in the fridge and stuff. Like and definitely when I was like busy and working different clubs and stuff it like made sense, it was really helpful, but like I don't need to do that now. And I like haven't done it since we've moved in here so."
79.0,Provider,"Oh, that is a change."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah and that's been hard because, like, I want, I want to do that because it just makes things easy and whatever, but then I just like rely on it a lot, whereas I don't know like since I do have the time to like grab whatever. So yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah no I hear what you're saying, like the. Predictability of it is nice. But then it. Then what isn't as allowed if you haven't already set. Like what, what do you miss out on I guess."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah like I, I would like to do that kind of thing like it's not like i'm never going to do it ever."
79.0,Provider,Again yeah I.
1692.0,Patient,Think it's just good for me to like FLEX those muscles and like. You know. Just try to do things a little different for a while.
79.0,Provider,"yeah that's so great, because it's true, I mean who knows what job you're going to have in the future right. yeah it is sometimes nice to 10 meal prep but, when it gets into the. kind of a rut yeah. Good good i'm glad you're getting spontaneous with the food a little more, you know that's so nice how's the cooking you know what what tell me about something you've cooked lately."
1692.0,Patient,"um I guess my husband recently um. I mean like, if you like, we'll just make things and like batches like I made a ton of hard boiled eggs."
79.0,Provider,Oh nice so convenient yeah.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah and i'll just like throw things together, but I guess I haven't done anything like complicated cooking wise."
79.0,Provider,And that's okay I.
1692.0,Patient,"mean yeah like I definitely want to. And i'm not sure that we'd be able to like this weekend, but maybe like next week or something."
79.0,Provider,Are you traveling this weekend.
1692.0,Patient,I am yeah so I actually you might have some advice for me.
79.0,Provider,or like some idea remember.
1692.0,Patient,My one of my brothers is actually he's getting married outside of Las Vegas.
79.0,Provider,Like in the desert cool and.
1692.0,Patient,"I decided like why the heck not like all just stay a couple, like all he's getting married on Saturday, but i'm going to leave Monday night, so that Sunday and Monday I can go to like. going to like a State park. that's like an hour and a half. Out of the city and then on Monday i'm going as I own so i'm really excited about that."
79.0,Provider,"Yes, so I mean yeah I was just gonna say you've got to go to go to science on the. I mean there's a lot around there I don't know where you're staying. A lot of really cool stuff zions is a little bit busy you know. But there's some quieter areas in there that aren't as busy. And I would just go to zions first. and talk to the Rangers. yeah totally hey i'm going to stay the night, are you going to stay the night and like that St George area."
1692.0,Patient,So I think i'm actually i'm only going to have like a handful of hours like. six hours in Zion so. Okay. yeah I wish I could travel around it. yeah hopefully I can find some like look for like the. i'll try not to go on like the. most popular trails i'll try to find like some other that some others that might be a little less.
79.0,Provider,"Science science is so small. there's going to be people. But you. You might as well do the. The one that you go to the water you go to the narrows. open. And you can go up, then the River quite a ways."
1692.0,Patient,You know.
79.0,Provider,"I would just do that just because it's fun where your water, she was your pack your water shoes it's just so fun to walk through the water like that in the US. You know Canyon area and. I wouldn't do angel's landing. Just because if you're pressed for time. it's kind of. cool scary but. It is popular."
1692.0,Patient,You know. yeah and they're not appealing and if you're not with someone I just wouldn't do it.
79.0,Provider,"I wouldn't do that one alone. But the I can't remember the name, but with the one at the very end."
1692.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
79.0,Provider,me zions is just a skinny little Canyon really.
1692.0,Patient,Oh wow okay.
79.0,Provider,And that's just got trails off shooting down it.
1692.0,Patient,um.
79.0,Provider,But yeah if you've only got six hours just. go down that main one main trail and then maybe had a couple others like I like weeping rock. Just kind of said it's super tiny you could just run up to it and run back or something. it's just a tiny little trail but it's just like little fairy little fairyland there at the end. Though the Emerald Emerald pools are pretty. So all right so you're going to be in Vegas though that. you're going to go to that State park that's never enough. Because the. what's the name of the park I think it's state park to stand by summerlin. A mountain that's just right there.
1692.0,Patient,I know I was looking at there's like mount charleston which is like.
79.0,Provider,Is it mount charleston.
1692.0,Patient,I don't know.
79.0,Provider,I don't remember but it's pretty cool there's some cool things in there and it's not that far from Vegas like it's I want to say it's 20 minutes. out so okay.
1692.0,Patient,yeah we.
79.0,Provider,are really close.
1692.0,Patient,yeah I think I know which one you mean.
79.0,Provider,"So that was cool trials, and this is actually a good it's not kind of there's a lot of them that have quite a bit of shade. And there so it's still going to be warm but not unbearable. and science will be great you know it's gonna be cool down in there and the leaves will be starting to turn."
1692.0,Patient,So.
79.0,Provider,"that'll be me yeah. Oh well, anyway."
1692.0,Patient,yeah the other one i'm going to is called like valley and fire. State park yeah so. it's a little bit cool it'll be interesting.
79.0,Provider,yeah you'll enjoy it.
1692.0,Patient,Oh.
79.0,Provider,yeah what is that mountain. To red rock. yeah it's red rock.
1692.0,Patient,Okay gotcha.
79.0,Provider,"And rock Canyon there's some cool things in their national yeah. Some cool hikes and there's just people rock climbing in there, you can watch them rock claim anyway."
1692.0,Patient,yeah i've heard that outside of Vegas is really good for rock climbing but I didn't know where that's cool.
79.0,Provider,yeah so. cool people have been there yeah that's fine that's exciting that is getting married.
1692.0,Patient,yeah good.
79.0,Provider,"Good um. As far as anything else, I mean coffee intake are you still keeping the good in moderate with that."
1692.0,Patient,I am yeah like i've. Definitely had to be intentional about that. Because like when i'm at home and like I started to crash it's so easy to like just make more.
79.0,Provider,Totally. yeah just use that caffeine boost.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i've gotten pretty good with that, so I I don't think I exceed like 300 I can remember when I have lost."
79.0,Provider,"Nice okay nice work because I mean remember you were doing over 400 pretty regular you know. yeah no. that's really, really good fit for your phone. yeah for digestion all kinds of things. So i'm telling me just a 24 hour what you just ate yesterday, give me a snapshot."
1692.0,Patient,i'm.
79.0,Provider,The pumpkin bagel right.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so what time is it. So I think I had. Then i'm trying to remember oh I got a box of those. Those, like fig bar things that I got like the brownie kind."
79.0,Provider,Tracy they have us.
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,Is it fig brownie.
1692.0,Patient,it's like.
79.0,Provider,"Again, chocolate, I still have the crunchy and."
1692.0,Patient,herzl like still figuring the middle but almost just seems like fudgie like they just add.
79.0,Provider,it's really been a takeout the seeds or something.
1692.0,Patient,"Maybe. that's cool but yeah so I had some of those in the afternoon, I think, after lunch."
79.0,Provider,And then.
1692.0,Patient,"Trying to remember. Oh, I like was just feeling where yesterday, like, I was definitely hungry and I wasn't sure why I like it, I hadn't even like run or anything yet, but so at like 530 or it might have been five I had like hard boiled egg and like. cliff bar cool. And then I. Like ultramarathons done and then like went to the gym. And, just like got like. four miles in and a little bit of lifting just because, like I need to I didn't get to go last weekend i'm starting to like get some imbalance like I don't know my glutes are feeling weird and stuff but."
79.0,Provider,i'm good work we didn't notice that.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah so. That was good. And then yeah by the time it was like eight I love trader joe's and I was like okay i'm just getting a bagel. bagel and like a big apple and then. I like. stopped at a couple of other stores quick. Probably at like nine I just had, like some like. kale with like hummus and all that addressing. and Like I had some other stuff with that. or I might have just had that but then an hour later I had like a big my when I went home two weekends ago my grandma send us back with like some big rice krispies treats teammate."
79.0,Provider,So sweet.
1692.0,Patient,"So yeah so i'm like a big nice crispy treat and. Then at maybe like midnight, I had just like half a banana and, like some peanut butter and then I was asleep."
79.0,Provider,cool.
1692.0,Patient,"um yeah then, this morning I had a pumpkin bagel with like a little bit of cream cheese on it yeah."
79.0,Provider,Did you toast it or just have it. I just have some.
1692.0,Patient,"Hello Scott. and I honestly i'm trying to remember. Really, remember, I know that I had something, but then I went for a run at 1230. and I. yeah and then I got back in that like 145 I had like a big smoothie with like some protein powder and. Some, like chips and hummus."
79.0,Provider,"cool that sounds pretty good how about water, how you doing on the water."
1692.0,Patient,"I think pretty good um I think I could be doing better. But. And i've just been getting like so thirsty on my runs like starting at like seven or eight miles will get like really, really thirsty. But yeah I can probably do better."
79.0,Provider,i'm probably a. packet do you pack the water with you.
1692.0,Patient,"I don't. Like if i'm doing something really long i'll try to make sure that it's like at specific like twice, but um. which I had never even like really done before. But. yeah I don't know i'm like getting so thirsty."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and who knows right, it could just be you're getting older right you're just. You know need hydration in between, you know, and it could be that you are a little bit dehydrated not drinking enough, is there a time in the day, where you can really you know guzzle a glass of water."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah I think like at any point during the day, as long as I remember, like sometimes i'm doing things I forget my bottled. Different rooms and stuff like that, but. yeah I don't know I think I should try to focus on doing that, like in the early afternoon because I."
79.0,Provider,"tend to run like I mean. That would be perfect, and then you have time to go to the bathroom. yeah."
1692.0,Patient,yeah so that would probably be good.
79.0,Provider,"yeah then for sure I mean in the marathon they have the stations for you. yeah sure. But I think that is something to pay attention to you know, and maybe considered Should I be packing some water, you know those little packs. yeah. Did you ever do accutane or anything like that."
1692.0,Patient,"No, no, I luckily, you know I never had to okay."
79.0,Provider,"I was just thinking about anything else that could be affecting. thirst and know sometimes that causes problems. I don't recommend accutane. Unless it's just it's such a serious drug. me. And i'm not saying you need it, or anything. That was just purely i've known runners who've had a hard time. Getting dry throat because of accutane right and generations that's nice Thank you um. When you do finish the run just thinking ahead a little bit. And what's your plan again how long are you going to take a break for."
1692.0,Patient,"I don't know, I think it just depends on how. My body is feeling. i'm definitely going to take at least a week of like solid no running. Maybe two weeks and i'm definitely going to stretch a lot because. I just know that certain things are going to be like. ridiculously tight after that and then it's you know, like a seven and a half hour car, drive home and. it's I know that's really messed me up in the past, when I like didn't stretch for a week and then tried going for a first run."
79.0,Provider,it's like all right.
1692.0,Patient,"So you're really focusing on just like stretching and making sure, things are like feeling like nothing super taught. And I kind of want to explore some other activities, a little bit like maybe in the. Early winter like like. Like rock climbing or something but."
79.0,Provider,"That sounds great, and I think it would be good, I mean i've known quite a few runners there's this kids is cross country coach to set a record in utah for the marathon and have fun. anyway. You know, sometimes taking a longer break as a really good you know and doing another sport, you know type of a thing, just because you're going to like moving right."
1692.0,Patient,yeah totally.
79.0,Provider,Am I drawn for you the little loop de loops and recovery.
1692.0,Patient,I don't.
79.0,Provider,"Let me draw really quick because. This is a kind of illustrate. And because I think it's a good little illustration so. At first, when you have an eating disorder and my kind of don't like that that loop to loop many races. Okay, there we go right now, this is better OK, so the little loop de loops are like behaviors and. You know, eating disorder stuff and at first there's a lot of them like you know a lot of behaviors and stuff and then over time they get more spread out and type of a thing. it's easier on paper. He laughing at my loops um any we get more spread out and maybe even smaller right not as much of a vein here. And then, over time, it might go along long time and then all of a sudden, you have something, and maybe it's a little one or maybe it's two in a row, and it goes bad for a while, like something significant happens that really spent sends you in a spin. But the. Do. This these points, right here. A lot of times there's a similar instigator there. Whether it's a similar feeling. state of mind. You know that that type of thing. And it's good to just kind of know. You know just just kind of know if. If. You know somebody important to you. And you know died you're going to have a lot of grief, maybe you'll have anger about that, but knowing kind of which emotions are especially the ones that have been involved in your behaviors in the past, and knowing that when those emotions come up really, really intensely strong. It can just be a backup the heat you're a coping skill right you're not bad for having that that's just we all have to cope. So kind of identifying what What are those little. You know, even after you haven't been having any behaviors can be you know really good just Okay, just so i'm aware, if I do get really sad I know i'm more vulnerable to to the eating disorder coping skill. Or if I get really mad or. And I know I don't know I mean what would you say, for you would be. If they were strong which emotions would be more trigger points. Good."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah I think definitely. yeah something of like feeling sad or like something happening or i'm really beating up on yourself. Like earlier in the week I haven't had that like I noticed like oh i'm not as hungry and like I pushed through it, but. yeah something like that, where I just feel badly about myself, and you know, luckily I haven't had to face like super intense grief, yet in my life but i'm sure that that will be like something that's really triggering for. But. yeah definitely like. grief like frustration anxiety, like those kinds of things."
79.0,Provider,Anything with your body like changing bodies change that's a constant right. We. Are aging every day.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah for sure um. yeah like that's tough mentally old of challenging like things just like when I realized something like fits slightly different I like. that's just stressful and you know, like society tells us that we're doing something wrong when that happens."
79.0,Provider,"I was reminded yesterday, I think it was that the reason that doctors started weighing people you know. was because, if a person is losing weight that's a red flag for a lot of illnesses and yet does that seem surprising for you to hear."
1692.0,Patient,"I don't know. I guess like it isn't like a data point that when feed over time, like can you give you insight to different things, but. feel like it's more focused on it's like going up, rather than down."
79.0,Provider,yeah totally.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah like. yeah I don't know like being in like a you know, like quote unquote like thinner body like I don't deal with a lot of discrimination terms of like my weight. And things like that, but I know when I was younger like when I was 10 you know that's like I don't know how like pediatric related stuff is now, but I know, then there was like a huge focus on weight and I was like a little bit overweight and they made like a huge article about it."
79.0,Provider,"See yeah that's that makes me cringe so bad inside and oh my gosh we need kids to gain weight like and sometimes kids. gain weight and then they grow and you just anyway, when we start to think that there's childhood. Even childhood obesity is a really. Not necessarily true I guess. That makes sense. like that. phrase right there and is a cultural creation that yeah it's been challenged the timing is really good."
1692.0,Patient,That is good.
79.0,Provider,"So, but yeah I think you're right most people when they go in and they've lost weight. The doctors, like a good job. Like wait you forgot your training you're supposed to check for red flags like. You know this, and this, and this there's all kinds of reasons that. You know dullness an unknown to the person experiencing it. is losing weight from cancer to all kinds of things. yeah it's too bad, but doctors are just as vulnerable to all the dieting marketing. Going on too. yeah. As far as body image goes so body image is definitely a trigger for you. Right."
1692.0,Patient,"I think it is like not it's not like one of the worst thing like. This still definitely a trigger. And i've adapted to that like aspect, a lot more like I feel better about it than I used to. But yeah it's still can be like hard so."
79.0,Provider,"And sometimes I like to look at that, from a biological standpoint, you know what is my biological body, how is it experiencing this body change. and say let's just say, eventually, you know you are like you know I do want to have a kid and so you know you get pregnant and your body starts to change and. You there. You know, there may be reactions to it but biologically What would you say your body's reaction is to that experience."
1692.0,Patient,yeah you just like biologically it's just like preparing and like your. Like supporting another living being so it's. a tall order and.
79.0,Provider,yeah that's true.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah like I do think and that's something that, like, I would like to do in the future, like later not anywhere not anytime soon at all, but. That is like pretty scary. So."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and I do say this to my kids i'm like having your kids was the most exciting thing i've ever done and it really is like it's it's an adventure and super big reward and it really is cool so I mean I highly recommend it. I would have kept having babies I think if I anyway for lots of reasons, you know you don't keep having babies. Oh, my gosh the whole process is amazing and but there was still reactions mentally. The things that your biological body is not. experiencing just like you said it's just it's doing the next needed thing it doesn't think good bad you know it doesn't think oh my gosh what's happening. You know, maybe that shouldn't be happening that doesn't even factor in you know it's like my my little boy was asking about computers he's like what if a computer started doing something bad I make will get can't unless you program it to. You you know, unless it's what program then yeah you know what can start to scream at you or something I don't know um but no in a lot of ways, your body's the same way, like it doesn't have a plan to. Where it doesn't have a judgment, you know, and I think it's sometimes that can be a valuable check in to just go wait, I am a biological been in my inbox magical body has having no judgment about this. This is just a construct you know and just ground again and go, am I Okay, yes i'm as good as I can be considering. it's it's such an interesting ride being human. and I asked you about one more thing, like that. or any doctors appointments or anything that wasn't it i'm just reviewing or no."
1692.0,Patient,yeah and I remember when my. My next one is. it's definitely a while from now. Oh wow it's November 17.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so that sounds good."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah I think it was a three month. Three month thing, I think."
79.0,Provider,"yeah i'm not remembering it. Oh well, I can always email you."
1692.0,Patient,yeah totally.
79.0,Provider,Some. yeah I mean sounds like you're doing pretty good i'm excited for you to do the. To do the run and then to rest.
1692.0,Patient,So yeah.
79.0,Provider,I think it'll be that'll be good um any other concerns you have or anything that you're like I don't know if this is kind of me hanging on to eating disorder mindset or not.
1692.0,Patient,yeah I don't know nothing. Nothing that I can think of. So.
79.0,Provider,"yeah just keep going nourish that body do that hydration sometimes it is good, even though we carry water bottles around to just go all right, I am going to guzzle water. Right, when I wake up. Google glass. I don't know. Right at some other certain time. yeah instead of just happiness that makes sense, sometimes that can really make a difference when I have clients do that i'm like wow you went from 24 ounces to 48. Just because of those three guzzles you know."
1692.0,Patient,So yeah. Totally.
79.0,Provider,"make a big difference Okay, what do you want to do is fine appointments go, what do you think."
1692.0,Patient,"um yeah I don't know, maybe. I mean we could, like me, the. If we want to do like three weeks again or whatever we need after after Boston that might help to just do a quick check in."
79.0,Provider,"yeah, especially with you not. Being as active that's going to be kind of a. weight, should I eat as much. Okay, so that's the 14th I count right. Do you want to do same time."
1692.0,Patient,um yeah yeah that that's.
79.0,Provider,Like two o'clock Eastern on October 14.
1692.0,Patient,Okay.
79.0,Provider,Then you're almost to Halloween.
1692.0,Patient,I know yeah.
79.0,Provider,"OK cool well good to see you Bailey. and good luck i'll be thinking of you when I see the little bit on the news, maybe look for you."
1692.0,Patient,yeah sounds good.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, all right take care, see you."
