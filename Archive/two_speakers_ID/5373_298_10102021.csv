My the epilepsy specialist at ucsf on the first i'm. I asked her I said, you know all my doctors say it's that are all she's like she's like a lot of my patients are on adderall and when you know 60 milligrams a day and there they have that's not the issue, I mean if you're gonna have seizures you're gonna have a seizure. But it does like. But having epilepsy does what does make. It makes. I guess I like makes you more. likely to have ADHD or narcolepsy so she's going to see what that's about and i'm going to stay that she sent in a referral for me to stay there at ucsf. With no medication and they're going to basically just try to induce different seizures because she's not sure what type of epilepsy, I have, because I have. Different types of seizures and she's in there, usually it's one or the other, this is like. um she said, this is odd, because she doesn't know how to treat it because focal and i'm general epilepsy are two treated two different ways so she's not sure how to treat it. She did up my zona gran um that's the stuff that makes me really tired. i'm. So I do need like so I I mean I really if you're in.
