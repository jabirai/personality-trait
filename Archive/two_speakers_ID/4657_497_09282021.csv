4657.0,Patient,Mark are you.
497.0,Provider,I heard you were having some problems with the zoom thing.
4657.0,Patient,"yeah sorry about that. I don't even know where it was, but I restarted my phone that took care of it."
497.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just going to fit the volume up i'm on a MAC so take me a second to open this. Last night, as an improved and somebody was talking loud. down but anyway, you I want. Your church. or just with us, just a few months ago with Greg."
4657.0,Patient,"Yes, I was."
497.0,Provider,"All right, and then you move to Texas Is that why you stopped with the Program."
4657.0,Patient,yeah that's that's why.
497.0,Provider,And are you getting the suboxone from somebody out there now.
4657.0,Patient,No i'm not.
497.0,Provider,"Also, when did you stand."
4657.0,Patient,"I didn't I the doctor before I left give me a 90 day supply and. yeah and I just I I bought something from a buddy of mine, before I left because I knew I was going to need some so I have like three days left and i'm worried."
497.0,Provider,"And i'll take care of that i'm sorry to be looking like i'm distracted but they're texting me from the vc and I can find this person who just. They do this, all the time and i'm trying to talk to patients. And then it's like I turned my head and it looks like i'm being rude. But anyway, um because informally closed out with a she have to do the admission stuff again, but the good thing is, you know the program really well, so no problem there and I see that Greg was giving you like a 30 day supply. yeah so we can reinstate that you're not really truly like a new patient, you know it's not like you're just starting out suboxone and stuff so that becomes easy, but I just got to go through the questions with you again. So I was reading here about the. amputation of your link. Is there any you off on the opiate problem."
4657.0,Patient,"It was actually before that I was, I was healthy as a horse, you know, I was a personal trainer I was. Just I mean I drink and stuff when I was younger I smoke weed but you know drugs aren't really my route. and They had me on fentanyl after I lost my leg, and then the doctor just cut me off. didn't lower me or anything just cut me off, and I saw a. I don't remember it was a doctor, I saw I got recommended through my lawyer and. I don't know it was kind of a word practice and we just started like it was bad."
497.0,Provider,"Now you can't go from fentanyl nothing I mean well everyone's doing that today. Well yeah I don't know if you saw the DEA put out a warning yesterday and they almost never do to just see that, though it's called the one pill could kill you."
4657.0,Patient,Really.
497.0,Provider,"want to kill, you can die I forget what the name is i'll have to go look it up or whatever well, the problem is with all this illegal immigration, the cartels are shuffling all the stuff over. The border and stuff and I guess, in addition to that there's an online problem where you can't get. Whenever you're trying to get and it's laced with fentanyl but it's got something else and whatever's going on as people are dying. DEMO yeah. The thing is, you can get these prescriptions online, you know there's a lot, there are unscrupulous doctors out there. Although I know in California, you can i'm trying to think because we had some big mess, with a doctor once, who was just giving anybody, this is before. You have your crisis was accepted knew what was going on and we were trying to tell people, but in any event, this one doctor was just given led he would talk to you on my phone or whatever, and just keep sending your prescriptions or miss your payment. And so the What happened was he finally got investigated and then report came out with this rule that doctors can't on do online can't just do online prescribing like that. However, then that's then, then they came along with suboxone prescribing, and this is a different situation, like most of us who are doing this, he has something called it is called an x license it's yeah We already have a DEA license but the X license comes after you take a course. And it can be an eight hour course now, when we had the big mess last year with coven and all these people were overdosing and stuff Department of Health Services wave that course or whatever. On more and more people are getting on board with that, but still not enough and there's still some actors who have attitudes and stuff. you'd be my you wouldn't be surprised, but or mismanaged drugs and stuff and so those of us that are into this and do it all the time, know how to prescribe it and. You know, and to start patients."
4657.0,Patient,right on.
497.0,Provider,"yeah so on. Anyway, so where I was at this case you started at age 21 and it didn't have a history, before that, but I saw you in your family ministry there some history of addiction."
4657.0,Patient,"yeah my man. I think my mom I think she did stuff when she was younger to really tell me which, like I kind of didn't want from the numbers. He did stuff when she was younger she so she's been sober since i've been born, I know that but i'm. Not like I said I don't know he didn't we didn't really like really tell me about it she's just like.

4657.0,Patient,"No, no it's it's the spine but it's like saw that I can measure it by my shoulder blades in between my shoulders, but it's like. No, but it's like. it's like people."
497.0,Provider,"When. you're gone and so long, I would suggest that yeah I don't know if you have you had a chance to establish care with the premier care."
4657.0,Patient,I yeah I did the there I got an x Ray done of it like. A while ago. And what.
497.0,Provider,It was normal.
4657.0,Patient,"I went I went to the chiropractor the picture, he showed me it looked like your spine supposed to be like this, like it's like so mine was like."
497.0,Provider,Okay here's the problem chiropractor did the X Ray and run it.
4657.0,Patient,"That he did do the car, but he didn't do the X Ray he showed me a picture of it."
497.0,Provider,Does someone in his office to the extra.
4657.0,Patient,know was one of those like a different doctors office.
497.0,Provider,"Okay, I will get to greeting from the radiologist because you know when you have muscle spasm. Even when when you go for the X Ray and they tell you okay turn this fear that way, the problem is when you're in pain you do hold your body, even when you're not recognizing that you're holding your body of certain way, you are, and you can alter how the picture looks. and chiropractors don't know this, we get trained on how to read X rays, and you know all the different things that can go wrong and stuff, so I will get the radiology report from your doctor did the chiropractor help."
4657.0,Patient,"know the guy he he was an older gentleman, and you didn't even like he was going to use this little tool."
497.0,Provider,"Oh, I see well. we're up against your spine, and they just."
4657.0,Patient,yeah they quick.
497.0,Provider,"yeah yeah when it's called some kind of adjust, for whatever i'm heavy tried in the seuss."
4657.0,Patient,"know but, but I really want to look into that i've heard i've been hearing a lot of good things about that."
497.0,Provider,"I think you may have really injured on muscle and then reinjured it because he kept on trying and and even though you're saying I will exercise helps it might be like when you get runner's high, you know that same thing, like you feel so good after you exercise, and then it comes back. yeah I think yeah you should try and ensues and trust me they'll feel it that's why I was saying, can you reach factor, because I can sometimes, and you can actually feel a not under the skin. or whatever, and so you, you may need that. there's another form of therapy i'm sure you've never heard of this is called feldon Christ. it's it's feldon Christ is is based on how he has a lot to do with you know the way you sit the way you hold yourself we try on returner had like this, you should be really turning your body, a little bit and all the things that does to your body, and so they kind of retrain the body."
4657.0,Patient,You spot.
497.0,Provider,"It you got a pen there. yeah it's F isn't frank e l Deism David E and K are as and you can even get the well they unfortunately they don't get that many videos online I know they sell DVDs. If I just go go fall down Christ will eventually find the main website, or whatever, but there's practitioners that are probably in your area. And I have some of their MP3 is and I had one guy like to follow us like you know, really, we should do a video but I guess he's it's real expensive to produce a video if you're just some person and. So i've done his MP3 is, but I have some DVDs to even though DVDs are like prehistoric now um there's some people who you know that's All they do is DVDs and not unlike you know why don't you guys have some video, we can watch online i'll pay for it. we're paying for it, or whatever. So that's something I would strongly recommend a lot of people don't know about it, and I think it'd be ideal for something like this that it meant having said it it's like once you get the X Ray and you know there's no like friendship. or anything like that, so your doctor would give you the proper you know, let let you know what the radiologist said. Right I don't you have one because you were. told you know that the radiology reading in tell you, he did he tell you, he or she did tell you right."
4657.0,Patient,"yeah they did. The so the the actual chiropractor I remember, he said he was like this is like he's like this is pretty bad it's nothing that's like you know, like you said it wasn't like crazy emergency like an emergency or anything but when I call the doctor, she was like I don't really see any. yeah."
497.0,Provider,"um. Anyway, I was. Just I was just in the suits and because they're so trained, I mean their fingers, they can feel they can really sense what's off and everything they can give you, maybe even more input than that the chiropractor."
4657.0,Patient,Thank you.
497.0,Provider,"You know if he's just using that adjuster thing I mean i've had it used on me, I thought it was kind of neat but I guess it's not working for you or whatever, and then the other thing I can do this pain is there every day."
4657.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much every day, just so I worked five to six days i'd say the beginning of the week looks I just had two three day weekend so that was awesome. So, by the end of the week it gets pretty bad."
497.0,Provider,"Can you ever been on a must for me, next year, like."
4657.0,Patient,I I for a while I had something it was like a generic like bikes are all or something.
497.0,Provider,"As i'm thinking what especially while you're working as a welder if you take home before you go to bed at night that would help. And, seeing that the reason I like to give people before they go to bed as a term that used to take in it and it'll make you sleepy and that's what you get when you get into bed anyway, and then. It gives you the whole night just start people 10 milligrams so that you don't have some big hangover in the morning, you know from it."
4657.0,Patient,Right.
497.0,Provider,"yeah if you want, I can prescribe it that way, and you could try it and see if you like it."
4657.0,Patient,"Yes, we do."
497.0,Provider,"yeah we can try that it'll just be one before man i'm not big on pushing drugs on people, but if you're paying every do. And you're doing yeah physical Labor. yeah you have to leave for you at work."
4657.0,Patient,yeah I just got I just got my break but.
497.0,Provider,"Oh okay well I can't get it off because. I don't want you getting into trouble, and you know it's supposed to be confidential anyway, but I see you have your stuff so i'll go ahead and reorder the suboxone you gave them their pharmacy I hope. yeah okay so it'll go to whoever you, you told them and then send it back off and to try at night and that's what I suggest is just go online and Google the fellas price practitioner near me and see if you can find one and just read up on it."
4657.0,Patient,Okay Thank you so much.
497.0,Provider,"All right, and then hold on a minute women, you know if you have to. Cheese you know you have to get set up for groups and everything. So. we're can you sign back into the vc later on."
