706.0,Provider,hi Kelly.
13406.0,Patient,hi.
706.0,Provider,How are you.
13406.0,Patient,Good how are you.
706.0,Provider,So what's been going on since last time we talked.
13406.0,Patient,"Just working. And I started. My new job, so I have two dogs in. iron he's been working on snake."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so the last time we talked one of your jobs was. Over by mom's house where Stan with mom and there was all that conflict with her drinking, have you been able to kind of find a new place to stay or kind of put up some boundaries."
13406.0,Patient,"I haven't stayed there. In a while I think last time we talked was probably the last time that I stayed over there, I haven't been working like super late, so I haven't like stayed over there at all."
706.0,Provider,"So, have you found that to be less stressful for you. that's good that's good um because I really think you know we talked about the things you can control and the things you can't you know, obviously you can't control if she's going to drink or what she's going to do, but you can control, whether you put yourself into that toxic situation. yeah so what else has been going on."
13406.0,Patient,"My ex boyfriend texted me. Like few days ago, and just like. he's he doesn't really annoying thing where you're like send me pictures of him and me, and like trying to guilt trip me. And like I didn't respond I haven't been responding to Henry just like keeps like blowing up my phone just texting me like. He so annoying."
706.0,Provider,So did you end the relationship with him.
13406.0,Patient,He broke up with me.
706.0,Provider,He broke up with you and now he's bombarding you with all these text messages and pictures.
13406.0,Patient,"Yes, like for like um I was like willing to like be civil within the length not have any drummer and just ended on good terms, but then he kept like trying to get back together with me and he would call me crying and like. This like stupid thing, so I don't know see like realizes but like I don't want to get back together them I like don't really want him in my life, I just want to be civil and leave everything happened in the past, and like just a moment. uh huh but he just like. He takes me last night, it looks to me like a whole paragraph one, how like he's talking to this girl, and like he can't move on, because. He like still loves me and i'm like."
706.0,Provider,That sounds like a huge problem.
13406.0,Patient,That he is trying to tell me about that one. yeah you broke up with me I didn't break it with you so.
706.0,Provider,So when the breakup happened when he broke up with you did you feel this way like you were like okay fine whatever and it didn't really bother you are did it hurt you pretty hard at first.
13406.0,Patient,"i'm doing broke up by. I was hurt, but I also had like sort of like. Like weight was lifted off my shoulders, you know, like. yeah I felt relieved, but I was still sad because I spent like over a year, with him, and I was with them every single day, and like did all these things together, but then, at the same time, I was like kind of happy, it was like i've mixed emotions because there'd be times for like. Like I wanted to text him and like tell him something to the front of that happen and i'm like oh. But then there's days, where i'm like. Like stress free and like not arguing all the time, not fighting. Like. It was really makes I."
706.0,Provider,"mean that's pretty normal because. When you spend so much time with somebody. And then in there in your life consistently that's kind of like your your comfort place and then, when that comfort places gone when like something exciting or bad or funny or whatever happens. The person that you would typically go to when they're not there it's going to make you feel that sense of loss. just maybe loss of not the romantic relationship, but maybe just that kind of friendship that you had you know that that person that you could you know talk to um but, obviously, if he is causing you stress because he's basically stocking new via text. Then, obviously a friendship is not probably a good position to have otherwise you could kind of have. The best of both worlds like not in a relationship, because obviously that wasn't going to work, but if you guys, could you know, like you said, be civil and if he wanted him in his in your life, you can have that you know coexisting friendship, but if. But if that's not what you want, I think the best thing to do. You know, is to kind of you know, say how you feel so if you were on the phone with him. Like right now, if you called him what would you say to him to get the message across, like hey I don't want to be with you, I don't really want you in my life, but if I run into you at a party or something i'll be several. You know, like How would you communicate that to him, so that you got your point of pass. And then, would you want that was communicated, would you be able to block him from your phone so that you don't even have to deal with any of that."
13406.0,Patient,"Like. Like i've told them a lot of times that I don't abuse him and like obviously i'm like seeing someone else and like he recently like just asked me out. And so I told him like I have seen someone like I don't what we had was in the past, like it wasn't. I don't think he, like fully understands like how banner relationship actually was, I think that be like trying to like cover it up by like. cover it up with the good memories, but, for me, I don't have barely any good memory serves just all bad memories like. No like we never had a good day would wake up at eight o'clock in the morning, are you the whole entire day, and it was just like a constant cycle like there is no good day that we actually had. And so, like. I tried to tell him, like our relationship was a healthy like it wasn't good for either of us and we both just need to move on and like. Do our own thing, but then he tries to manipulate me and last time I told them he, like pulled the fall i'm going to kill myself card and because he does, that all the time, every single time he doesn't get his way he always does it always and i'm like. Okay."
706.0,Provider,"Well, the next time he does that say i'm really sorry to hear that, but now that you have threatened your life i'm gonna have to call the police department and have them do a welfare check on you and, but he doesn't do it again."
13406.0,Patient,"I told him I told his mom his mom knows kids mean we're like we still text me his bomber still like pretty close um so I tell her like hey like he's. he's wild and out like he's been crazy she's like Okay, and I remember when me the day me and him broke up, I was like i'm coming to like i'm going to come get my stuff like. You have my clothes, you have my shoes like i'm going to get my stuff you know and he's like no and i'm like yes, I am like i'm going to get my stuff. And he said that I wasn't alive at the House, and so I called his mom and I was like hey can you read stuff. And she would go for us like you can come whenever you want to come here stuff like it's my house he can't tell you can't come get your stuff, and so I was going through my stuff and he was just furious but he was so mad and I didn't my sister and. My sisters best friend, I came with me, because I was scared to go by myself, because he's when he's around he's like not a nice person like."
706.0,Provider,to you.
13406.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, so I didn't know like want to go by myself, so my sister came and I got my stuff and after that he just like was calling me a whole bunch of names and like send a whole bunch of rude stuff and i'm like Okay, whatever. And then we didn't talk for like honestly like a few weeks. We didn't talk and then he, like texted me randomly say that he missed me and that he sorry for everything that he wants to give up together and at this point, I was already like seeing someone else like. I didn't even I don't really mean, but I really don't like I don't care if he misses me and I don't care if it was me. Because I don't. feel that way for him. uh huh like I did like at the beginning of the relationship obviously was good, because the honeymoon phase, like everything was good in the beginning, but then. Like it was me getting accused of cheating every day and I can't hang out my friends, I can wear certain things I can't talk to certain people. and yeah I was just like traps like. Last year I barely even saw my friends barely was even home because I was at his house like going time I wasn't with him for like two months was when I was in California, with my sister and during that time. It was a mess like he was accusing me he was I changed my like my password to my all my accounts, you know cuz he knew my passwords, and so I changed on the passwords and then. automatically i'm the bad person for changing my passwords but what does he knew my passwords to myself, like that's my personal information and my bike personal conversations that you don't need to know. And so I changed my password to like the easiest things ever used everything. looks like. It was just oh yeah."
706.0,Provider,"So. Why do you think you stayed in the relationship, obviously it sounds like you were unhappy, and it was pretty toxic, so why do you why do you think that you stayed until he broke up with you why didn't you leave him."
13406.0,Patient,"It seems that I stain because there was. A part of me that was like attached to him, like because I would tell him everything like literally everything that's ever happened to me he knows about and so like he was like my best friend, but then towards the end of the relationship i'm like. I like I didn't have feelings for him anymore. I didn't like want to hang out with him and be around him, you know. uh huh and so like. When he broke up with me. I was obviously sad just because I need like my best friend like 2% with everything to that was happy. Because. I didn't have to do it. I didn't have to break up with him and it's a kind of think of it like. I kind of pushed my way in order for him to pick up with me."
706.0,Provider,You kind of forced him to do the breaking up gotcha for.
13406.0,Patient,That I don't know I don't want to do it to hurt him.
706.0,Provider,"Well, and it sounds like there was a little bit of codependency there and you've kind of pulled away from that now because you've kind of found a new path, but with him he's kind of stuck there and I think that he's trying to pull you back in. So I mean really, what do you think that you can do now to just put a wall between you and because I feel like if he continues to bombard you with texts and pictures and those kinds of things, but eventually it's going to start affecting your current relationship in a negative way."
13406.0,Patient,"yeah I. is ignoring him, I honestly haven't responded to him. So he isn't. me today. him. reply."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm and it does it ever feel like when you get those messages, do you ever feel like you want to, and then you have to stop yourself, or is it just really nothing."
13406.0,Patient,"Night sometimes I guess i'm really mean because I was with him for such a long time. But. Now that I like things pass on everything, like our relationship was like ridiculous like it was. not good, and like when I read this text makes sense to me honestly just laugh because he doesn't he doesn't understand."
706.0,Provider,Everybody. thinks that that was a good relationship he really.
13406.0,Patient,"need. Some soul searching that's that's what i'm saying i'm like he's saying that he's grown up since then, but obviously problem, because you don't see what was wrong you don't see how by was like. yeah you look at the fall and your wall every single day. Like that should remind you. How bad it was."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and not only that I mean he's not you know he's not okay with your wishes, like if. He cared about you, the way he says uh he does, and he has changed the way that he says that he has, and when you tell him hey i've moved on, I need space. He would respect that and he's not that's why I said, you know, maybe the extreme the extreme decision to make that happen would be just black him so he can text you all day and all night just never get it, and then maybe once a."
13406.0,Patient,"While i'm trying to block it, for, well then he resorted to emailing me. Just and. Then, when I bought to the email. He got like a text free. To text me fun."
706.0,Provider,From like the weird numbers that you see you don't.
13406.0,Patient,know.
706.0,Provider,"Who, it is."
13406.0,Patient,yeah and then you can.
706.0,Provider,"change your number all the time. Whoever invented that obviously was one of those like jaded people that wanted to get Ahold of somebody, no matter what."
13406.0,Patient,And so.
706.0,Provider,"Why. Did you need that. I mean like why. To be able to change your number all the time when you send a text message. That and drug. drug dealers need that too, because though they can be tracked."
13406.0,Patient,"So I tried to block this number, thank you, he will find some way somehow. to contact me."
706.0,Provider,What did you change your number.
13406.0,Patient,"I was going to. I mean, I never thought about it, but I told him like it either right before I am blocked number, and she was texting with Marina numbers, I was like if you don't stop I literally get a restraining order. If you don't stop like isn't getting you're emailing me or text me or any numbers like. crazy like this, like crazy."
706.0,Provider,"What is your friend think about all of us, or does he not know."
13406.0,Patient,He doesn't like.
706.0,Provider,"Well, obviously it's not like."
13406.0,Patient,"This one. He thinks he's very like childish and still very like immature and take it. um he. He really doesn't like to talk about him because i've told Jacob what isn't stem to me so every single time we talk about it, like he just gets mad he doesn't like he doesn't like that stuff like. Like what he did to me like he doesn't say honestly like wants to fight him but."
706.0,Provider,uh huh hmm that's a that's a typical male response. yeah that's what they like to do with my life to fight it's the testosterone.
13406.0,Patient,at all.
706.0,Provider,"huh so. What, how do you think that you can problem solve this do you think it's, to the point where you're going to need to contact the authorities and explain to them what's going on to have them intervene."
13406.0,Patient,"So, like it's come down. A lot more. Because before it was like every single day, like a different number like it was just getting crazy and I told him like if you don't stop don't get to restrain or I think kind of clicked that if he doesn't stop that you'll have no contact with me. And I think he still wants. To have a little bit of hard time with me. And like talk to me uh huh and like i'm i'm a caring person and obviously I still care for him. uh huh and I want the best for him and I told her like haley you'll find a girl that understand you and get you and, like Iraq, the best for you aren't you to be happy and succeed in life. And he just like he does not want that, for me. He just like shits on me all the time and i'm like. Okay, whatever because last time we was when he called me. We were talking about his humor and talk. and see if we can get back together and i'm like well, you can call me but we're not going to get back together like we could talk and like come to an agreement if that's what you want to do. And then we started arguing, because he asked me about the game scene and i'm gonna be honest with him and not sugarcoat anything, because I think that i've sugarcoating a lot of things in our relationship and that's why. he's the way he is with me because sugar coated things so I didn't sugarcoat anything and I like told them what he wanted to know and then he got online and started crying and i'm like Okay, this is why, like we can't work out. You don't want the honesty and the truth for answer and you don't want to communicate. it's not going to work so."
706.0,Provider,For you.
13406.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I. keep telling him not like you're sitting here, are you is man, this is why. we're not getting back together like this literally why he's like i'm just trying to talk to you and i'm like no you're not you're arguing, you want to argue. uh huh like. But I think you think. wants to have a little bit of contact that's mean that's why he's calm down. I want more than he did."
706.0,Provider,"I mean, do you want to have weight sound you don't want to have any contact with him now."
13406.0,Patient,"I, I just want to be civil like if I see him on public there's no drama there's no money. Like if his if he comes up and says Heidi also had back like. I want us to be civil think we'll probably never be friends so probably will never be forgotten. But um. I kind of just. leave everything that happened in the past. dwell on it, and I think he. needs so dwelling on me. A lot."
706.0,Provider,"And you can't help them with that that's something he has to do on his own. yeah, you know as much as you would like to wave a magic wand and be like poof you're over it, you know he has to do that on his own but it's not fair for him to drag you into. That negativity either it's not fair for him to you know basically like I said stock you by phone that's not okay um. How do you feel like emotionally when that happens so when he's texting you constantly sending you pictures, you know, whatever it may be. What kind of state of mind does that put you in."
13406.0,Patient,"It kind of makes me likes. Comments like. Just because. Not understanding and I don't know what else to do to make you understand and he's just trying to like manipulate me and make me feel sad but we're not together, but I don't feel sad. i'm happy together and i'm happy with like who i'm with like, yes, like the guy that i'm with like he understands everything and, like me and him like we communicate and like we tell each other, like how feel without like us fighting or arguing she's like we like work things out like. uh huh on the people who shouldn't work things out."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13406.0,Patient,"Until it kind of like just makes me like angry and I like tell him like this is your are sending me pictures exactly makes me worried get back together with you. Yes, every single picture, but he seems to me there's bad memory behind that picture."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm but he doesn't say that he just sees. It looks like.
13406.0,Patient,"The two of us together. But what's behind that picture is what matters to me because none of it's a happy memory. Like he sent me a picture some like i'm new years we've fought for entire new year's day you play video games, the whole entire day uh huh like none of it was a good no worries at all and just doesn't see it."
706.0,Provider,So far as. What do you feel like your plan is moving forward.
13406.0,Patient,"and Well, if this sounds like send me pictures and honestly just walk him deleted Member because it's it's just annoying and mature and if he if he still wants me in the slides to be civil. Then. he's going to need to stop doing he's doing uh huh because I will still have him in my life and have us be civil, but not in the way that he thinks it's going to be. If you think he's gonna win me over. it's not. it's not like that."
706.0,Provider,So um. Does a part of you feel responsible at all. For the way that he is like the way that he's acting because you did sugarcoat it for so long.
13406.0,Patient,"yeah so like. So I could find day keep going back every single time burka that he wouldn't think that he can just wouldn't be back like uh huh. Because when we break up like get back together and things would be good for a day, and then it just go back to the same ways, and I think after broke up he didn't realize how serious I was. Like. Like I told him like if we break up our time like this, is it like we're done I don't think he realized that was beautiful and being honest about it being done, like us, being over. And so I think like me sugarcoating a lot of things and going back to him every single time you go about. making things like oh she'll come back like to always did. But now that I he really is like i'm not coming back like well then, like. What am I supposed to be there uh huh."
706.0,Provider,"Well, I think that part of it probably is control he's so used to controlling you and now you're not letting him. So I don't even know if it's so much he wants you back, but he wants to control the act because it sounds like when you were together, he controlled everything. And now that you're not with him, you are independently, making your own decisions, especially deciding to be with somebody else and to be happy and he doesn't like the fact that you're happy without him. You know, and that that has to do with him as a person, that has to do with some issues, and he has nothing that you can fix. But for you, you just. need to know that you deserve better than that, and so, when you move forward that you attract people that are positive that aren't toxic and it sounds like you found somebody that you're pretty happy with. yeah so that's good I mean that's a positive thing it's it's good to surround yourself with positive people because you would do have some trauma, you know from your past, and you know your mom and drinking and you know there's just there's a lot of stuff there. And that's why the last time we talked I said, you really need to put down some boundaries with your mom because it's not. it's not Okay, for her to retry monetize you and the only thing that you can control with, that is what you do to prevent it and it's the same thing with this relationship. It sounds like it was pretty toxic and there's some trauma there, so the only thing that you can do is to do some self preservation and prevent any more return return retry monetization from happening. You know by the things that he does you know, and so, in order to do that, you have to take steps that's what you can control the steps that you take to mitigate that versus what he's gonna do you can control. So. If he's just a toxic person, you know, then you know you tell me the toxic person you don't want. In your life and and if it's something that and I don't know like when you have a conversation once i'm on the phone just from what you've told me, I feel like when you're trying to say things he interrupts you and he's like. My baby don't you remember this and don't remember that and don't remember how good we were you know blah blah blah. And so maybe it's something that you need to like write an email or a text message, or like the old school letter and stick it in the mail and just put all your feelings out like hey we weren't good it was toxic I wasn't happy, I was sad more than I was."
13406.0,Patient,I can't hear you.
706.0,Provider,Can you hear me.
13406.0,Patient,yeah alright.
706.0,Provider,"So yeah so I mean just maybe writing it down like an email or text message or. But old school like letter put it in the mail and just be completely blind like with all your feelings and don't hold back. You know, tell them you weren't happy you tell them you wanted to break up with him, but you just didn't want to hurt him so therefore you kind of pushed him away so he'd break up with you, I mean just be very blunt and honest. And that you are happy with somebody else, and you have moved on and there's no way you're moving you're going backwards, so if he wants to sit and you know basically. wait for you he's going to be waiting a long time because it's not going to happen yeah um. That you don't want to talk to him, unless you run into him somewhere and then you'll be subtle you know just be very blunt very specific and very, to the point. And they feel like if you can write it down and send it off to him he'll read it, or he won't, but I have a feeling, he will because one and and what it says. But you then can get out everything that you feel without having those interruptions from him. And those manipulations and those reductions, you know where he tries to spin it around on you to make you feel guilty or say i'm going to kill myself. To make you feel like you're going to be responsible for his suicide, you know to manipulate you if you put it all in writing and send that he can't do those things. So that might be something to. Maybe mitigate that communication, but still be able to say what you need to say, and then I would just put at the end you know now that i've told you, I hope you can respect my wishes. But if you continue to send me messages all the time from what from other numbers, or whatever pictures and you just don't you know respect what I want, then i'm going to have to have a restraining order because I don't feel like this is healthy."
13406.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, and just be really blunt. And it sounds like you've tried to but you're just you're a really nice person I think so you're like trying to say it, like the nice way but. I don't know if this is the time to say it, the nice way I think you've tried the nice way and now it's just needs to be blunt like. I don't want to hurt you, but I don't love you anymore there's not going to be in US i've moved on. You know, towards the end I didn't even want to continue the relationship, you know, it was a toxic relationship look at the whole on your wall, I mean like be really specific within the whole look at the whole on your wall that will tell you how toxic our relationship wise. You have a constant reminder, you know what I mean. So, and maybe that will help you to just get it out there, and if it's out of you at least that's off your shoulders. that's what you can control is just those feelings out of you, and over to him what he does with those that's not on you. You know, especially if you contact as mom and say hey he's threatening to kill himself, you have done your duty to warn you have told somebody. That can step in and if he is going to hurt himself prevent that and if he is going to hurt himself, it has nothing to do with you there is other things psychologically there."
13406.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So. So yeah so move forward be happy live your life keep putting down the boundaries to you know, protect yourself. You don't want to over protect yourself, so you don't let people in but you also don't want to have any boundaries, where people can just walk in and walk all over you and I. kind of your history is you know I just will let people do what they want and and then what that's done is it's just kind of stumped you down, and now you need to build yourself back up again. So. So what do you think."
13406.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean I don't make sense I guess i'm gonna have to. Actually, like put my foot down to him and like not be like super nice like I have been to so maybe then he'll understand more mean you probably hate me but i'm like who cares me hates me like."
706.0,Provider,"The problem i'm leaving you. alone, though."
13406.0,Patient,yeah like during the bother me.
706.0,Provider,"forever because people grow and people change and people mature and five years from now, he might look back and be like oh my gosh I was such an idiot. i'm so embarrassed at the way I acted you know what I mean, but right now in maturity wise, you know, sometimes people just can't see it. yeah, but I think also when you write it down like in a letter email, etc. You can be quote unquote more mean without having to deal with how he's like reacting towards it, whereas if you were on the phone time to say it. it's harder because he's going to start to cry or he's gonna threaten to kill himself or you know tell you, he loves you or he sorry or he's changed, but if you're writing it down, you can be really blunt and explain exactly how you feel with no interruption and I. Think I think that'll be easier for you to do."
13406.0,Patient,yeah I think it would be a lot easier uh huh.
706.0,Provider,"And I think all the things that you told me how you feel about that situation is exactly what you should say you know because. Just don't leave any room for any hope or any doubt, so that hopefully that triggers have to move forward. So sounds like he's been a big stressor for you lately."
13406.0,Patient,yeah. He just. he's just crazy.
706.0,Provider,"you're gonna find some of those hopefully not too many, but they're out there. Oh yeah all right well we're out of time for."
13406.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,Do you have another therapy appointment set up.
13406.0,Patient,And I don't plan to schedule one.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to schedule with me, or do you want to call into the virtual clinic."
13406.0,Patient,I can schedule you okay.
706.0,Provider,So. I we once a month or every couple weeks I can't remember.
13406.0,Patient,I think I think it's. Every week or so ago.
