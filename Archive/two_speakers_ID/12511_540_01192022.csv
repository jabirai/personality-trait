12511.0,Patient,"i'm I am I am like not doing that great like I feel like I was doing better, but then I just like to I just like. decided to be like really self sabotaging and, like, for the last like two weeks I have been smoking weed and just like hating life and being super depressed and feel like so overwhelmed with everything and now i'm like feeling so awkward to like. Like I tried to stop like one. One time and then they did it for like today, and I just felt terrible and then I am trying again today because it's my day off and feel like maybe I could handle that better if I don't have to go into work, but like I just am like so mad at myself and just like feel. Like Mike didn't even want to come today and. Like just. Have like a totally terrible attitude and outlook on life now like about things like so quickly with that and they don't even know like why. I just like half delayed self sabotage myself when things are like going good or being finer I just like or just like I don't know like I was like."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so let's rewind a little bit, so what happened, where you had the opportunity of smoking weed, and so what brought you to that my."
12511.0,Patient,"Just like. I just like was feeling like kind of weird like I told you about, but I think like sometimes. Just wouldn't like the week before my period I get really like emotional and weird feeling and just like nothing feels right and I just like didn't allow myself to try that out and started like. Being like really impulsive with like spending and then like just like be weird and kind of like. sneaky from my friends and just like instead of like telling someone I was feeling like this, or like. or like hanging out with someone I just like. was like thinking in my mind like okay i'm just going to do this, like one day and like was not having like a good day at work or something instead of just like pushing through this I was like. you're just going to do this, one time and then I did with that I just ended up like I do this thing where only buy it, and then only the road away and then buy it again, like the next day or something and then I. I don't know, I was like just stop doing that, but I didn't because that's like not how I operate, and it was just like me like plotting in my mind and telling my rational thoughts are not like be at the forefront."
540.0,Provider,So what do you feel like is going to be the hardest part of stopping smoking weed.
12511.0,Patient,"Just like the first like three to four days that I need to like push through to get back like into like normal like sobriety life because it like the the first little bit makes me feel like so like sick or tired or awkward or like I just like can't like confront life anything. In I there's just like some things that i've been now putting off for like needs to take care of or need to like look at her like pay or whatever, and it just like makes me not want to do like anything at all, and feel so awkward like. I don't know like i'm if I just like. I know I haven't been like doing it long enough or enough that it that I can't like non stop I just like you know, like a it's they always say like it's easier to stick stay stops and stop again, you know when I like eight feeling so. Like. Just anxious just. Like it puts me in like an anxiety cycle of like meeting it to not feel anxious, but then once i've been stopped for like a while, and I can deal with things better I don't know."
540.0,Provider,What do you think would help you the next four or five days that you need.
12511.0,Patient,"Maybe I was thinking if I like told. Either like one of my work friends or like my friend when and like talked to them like for those day is it just like. called. lay my friends it wasn't like isolating and. checked in with people. Because like I feel like I knew I was going to tell you, and then that could be like accountability and. I feel like maybe if I put like one more. person and i'm not just being like secretive then."
540.0,Provider,No help.
12511.0,Patient,"yeah the support. And maybe, just like. I don't know trying to take things, maybe like in steps of things that I needed to do and. Like trying to accomplish some of those so that I feel like i'm not like so behind that I like get into like really all or nothing thinking and i'm like you ruined everything you have to keep doing this."
540.0,Provider,So what are some of these things that you have to get done.
12511.0,Patient,"Like like I need like I need like I went to go pick up my medication at CBS and they were like. it's not like being covered by your insurance, right now, then I didn't know if not meant to my insurance was out or if it was just like that new year, and they needed like a new like provider thing, so I need to like do that I like. Like. haven't looked at any of my like credit card payments or anything I like scheduled this handyman like a long time ago to like come help me put up like pictures and curtains tomorrow and I haven't like texted him back in the super long time I. Like need to either like order contacts or. or like call this doctor good to get different contact perception I don't know like. Just be like normal and sort my life out."
540.0,Provider,"So what's the start of it, so what do we need to do in order to start the process of sorting your life out."
12511.0,Patient,"Like probably me like turn on my phone which I now like put on the charger before we talked because I literally just been like avoiding because I like. use this this other phone that I like got there like bought from someone randomly online and so like. it's newer but it doesn't work with my carrier anymore it's all just like play on like wi fi on my phone and then not look at my phone that I communicate with people with for like days and like not charge that one and stuff. And then, like and I like showed up to work, one day, I like did that, like a different. time than I thought I was supposed to and I just like i'm like not caring about anything, and I know that, like. I was being happier and on a better path, when I was just like even when I was like struggling through things when I was like being sober and doing that and but. you're right right now I just feel like it's like there's so much i've like taken steps back from or whatever that it's like too overwhelming to do that so maybe I will like turn on my phone and then. I don't know like. text one back or write a list of things I should do, or. I know."
540.0,Provider,I want to make it through. Growing so you know that the weed is going to be one of the biggest things to act snake.
12511.0,Patient,"yeah and. I just feel like everything is is like literally like ruined now. And then i'm like too awkward to come back to like real life, and like why and just like so angry with myself. Oh wait."
540.0,Provider,Have you thought about going to a.
12511.0,Patient,"I definitely do that or I definitely like doing a zoom meeting or something, just like. Because pretty much like. Even when I was just going to iot like once a week or once a month and, like talking about it, it was like a good. reminder and just like kept me. I don't know thinking that that like remembering the thought wasn't a good option."
540.0,Provider,"I wouldn't want, so what happened to iot when was the last time you went to IP."
12511.0,Patient,"Maybe, like last month because. I don't know I just like. I just stopped, making it a priority, and like on my days off, I just wanted to like be lazy and sleeping instead of like. And every time when I would have a good experience and be happy, I went and then. I would just like be like i'm so tired, by the end of this work week that I don't want to like wake up and go to it and then eventually like. I think they like discharged me because they couldn't like me there anything anymore, but I had been going there's it was like you go, like every single day for 30 days, then you go like for two days for 30 days and like three days like every like every one once a week for. 30 days or whatever, but since I bought a job, I was only going once a week anyways and then. So it's taking longer, but I had like been going there since June, and it was very good and helpful, but I just don't want to like restart that or have to like not go to. Work or whatever like that feels like getting farther back so I just want to like stop this and find the easiest like path back to what I was doing and not like be myself up so much that I don't do it and not like keep moving forward with it, or whatever."
540.0,Provider,"So all or nothing thinking, remember, so we got to get rid of that the. You may fall off the horse to the marijuana but it's getting just back on to everything that was helping you remain sober so reconnecting maybe with the iot program to say like hey. I started smoking weed i'm afraid of like where this could end up because it just takes one bad day to say or a you know, a drink sounds pretty good."
12511.0,Patient,"yeah well. They also will let you come like as an alumni like anytime and you can just like go to the. Meetings if you've ever been there, so. I could do that are like. Call or text my counselors because I because I could just like tell I was like plotting in my brain to do this beforehand, because, like. I wasn't like responding to them and usually I would and they were just like trying to reach out to me and like feel like we're just trying to check on you and stuff and I was like. nah not responding to people okay."
540.0,Provider,"So you can feel it coming I think you brought it up a few times, though, too, so you thought about."
12511.0,Patient,"Do the things to like catch myself and stop I usually let myself keep going further into it, you know."
540.0,Provider,"Well that's the things that we learned from right so it's the the thing about making mistakes is, we can make mistakes and sometimes obviously they overtake us if we allow it, but if we allow ourselves to learn from it that's that's what matters about the mistakes."
12511.0,Patient,"No. you're right, I think I was also just trying to do that thing, where I was like okay like things are kind of like. Like comfortable and now I need like to skip I don't know just skip the next steps and because it's only instantly happening like. Everything feels weird this day and i'm just going to go with that, instead of like when I know, like my feelings will get different if I wait them out and stuff or just like lie low or waiter if I had just like literally like. called any of my friends and like said, though, like, I felt like that they probably would have been like it's fine like you don't want to do that, right now, we're like like reach out to you or like anything I just like. don't know why, like, I would like literally be like brain don't think don't like my brain will come in with like you shouldn't do this because this reason i'll be like don't think like any of those thoughts and just like really super Liam like. impulsively just like do it, and then feel terrible about. afterwards. I just. I just."
540.0,Provider,"Playing so playing the tape out so you know where the tape leads, so you have to start playing the tape out before and not a lead, allowing it to brew so. But it's getting back on the horse and doing what you need to do in order to just gain the sobriety back and if it's being uncomfortable for a few days, you may have to be uncomfortable but knowing it's temporary."
12511.0,Patient,"No, I think that's good because i'm gonna feel because I do, I definitely am going to just have to be okay with being uncomfortable for a few days yeah. And then it will get better and."
540.0,Provider,"I mean I am I do think that ever since you're you took this job, I think that it's added some pressures to you that you didn't necessarily need so I don't know if maybe with the new year, making that a priority is trying to find something that's more suited to what you want to do."
12511.0,Patient,"I mean, I really have liked like having friends and just like talking with adults, but I just have not and, but I just don't like the job itself and, like i'm. i'm good at it, but i'm not like ever like happy to be there, whereas at least like. When I was nannying like there was always points during the day that I was happy to be there. If not, like all of it, but I just didn't do enough like. Balance of like having. Other things going on in my life like Besides that, and I think that that is also what's happening right now, like there's nothing. going on in my life, besides like work and I don't like love that and that's not like fulfilling to me outside of like the people that I get to interact with their that are like my coworkers it's not like a huge interaction that I just like. will be like you need something whether it's like growth or destruction like something to switch things up for you. And I hate when I choose like destruction, but I just like next time, where I get when I get to that stability, I need like do the next thing or like. I don't know what it is, I don't know like find a new job or take a new class or something that's like productive for me that's not just like I feel antsy so i'm going to do nothing, or like smoke weed."
540.0,Provider,So our first step is going to be to get rid of the weed do you have weed. yeah.
12511.0,Patient,"it's like yeah it's like buried because I told me like not to that I wasn't going to do it today, but I still need to dispose of it."
540.0,Provider,what's the best way of disposing of it.
12511.0,Patient,I don't know he has all got like weird and crazy and try and go seek it back out so like maybe like flushed down the toilet or like. Both throat in the dumpster sign.
540.0,Provider,So why don't you go flush down the toilet.
12511.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,Okay.
12511.0,Patient,Do you think it will clog my.
540.0,Provider,How much how much weed is it.
12511.0,Patient,"Well, I thought we did like a little like machine cartridges thing."
540.0,Provider,Okay okay.
12511.0,Patient,So not. telling me I was thinking about telling my one friend from work he was like really supportive and just seeing if she like wanted it or wanted to throw it away for me just till the day like I had another person like a new one that I wouldn't have to like have it anywhere by me you.
540.0,Provider,"will obey when you hear it. So it's what is it what form, is it."
12511.0,Patient,Like vapes.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
12511.0,Patient,"And then i'm like an idiot because I need to just pay off. My credit cards, when I went impulsively shopping button, so I just kept like Cree buying weed and vapes and like they're not cheap and I would just like throw it away and then i'd be like. i'm thinking about it all day and be like you have to rebuy it then you're thrown away tomorrow, which is just like. So wasteful. But then I do this thing to myself, where i'm like well you just need to finish it to not waste it, and so, as I was, like maybe just gonna tell my friend, and I was, I think she's off today and I feel like maybe. She could just have it and because I don't know she liked texted me and was like is everything Okay, because I feel like i've been so like. depressed and like not myself at work that people like have noticed, but like people notice before I do, I feel like i'm just like faking it, but everyone like it's like. asking if i'm okay so like I don't want that to be. How I am and i'm just like not interacting with the world i'm just like. interacting with myself and my mind and being like I don't like it."
540.0,Provider,"So then contact your friend today start working and getting rid of it, what do you think is going to help you actually stay away from it, so you start thinking your head starts brewing, then you start going towards it."
12511.0,Patient,"I think like. I think like if I. If maybe I told someone I felt out or got back into contact with any of my like a friends or like I O P people or maybe even just like email G, or if I just I forced myself to Journal and write like just like getting some of these thoughts out instead of like. I don't know like ruminating on it."
540.0,Provider,No absolutely Am I frozen.
12511.0,Patient,yeah I think.
540.0,Provider,"My face is frozen. um. yeah, so I think that always having that accountability and that support around you is going to be beneficial um. I would like to see you get to a in person, a meeting."
12511.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,"Crime, whether or not this week or next week, something I think that getting in person is going to be good for you to be able to get out of your House and."
12511.0,Patient,"yeah it's true and I should just find one that I go to right from afterward is that they already have like. makeup on and i'm already out and driving and I can't like convince myself to like that I don't need to go or i'm not looking good enough or whatever. And then, because that's what I used to do like when I had like a routine and I like to going to a I would just go to these specific ones, right after nannying. And then, it was good, but since I, but since everything changed, and no one I didn't like finding to go back I haven't been consistently. And then i'll always convince myself like oh you're not looking right enough to go out, but if I go like straight from work, and I could do that so maybe I will make sure I find one to plan to go to afterward in the next like couple days."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so make that this week's goal is to I mean today it's to get rid of the weed and then get to in a meeting. OK."
12511.0,Patient,"And then I. What else is going on is really quickly that like also. Member like there was a guy that I was like hooking up with periodically. And then I like and then you're like you don't need to hook up with him because he's not like the type of person that you want to date, or whatever and i'm like that's true. And then we hooked up maybe like a timer to again after but i'm just like was not into it, because I kept like thinking about like. What you said you just always just like just like not we just do not want the same thing, and like and he just like would always talk about other girls, I would just get super annoyed. And then he, like the other day he, like showed up in my house, because I haven't been texting him back, either because I just want to like. not hang out anymore and i'm not being like straight forward with that and he just like wants to. He just like keeps bugging me and like wants to a delay not want to do that and I just am like seriously, just like don't want to do things I don't want to do anymore, and then. He, but he, like will not drop it and then he, like and I haven't been texting him I either because i've been texting, no one back and then he showed up at my house. The other day, like on Saturday, when I was trying to get ready to go to work and I was so thrown off and was like what are you doing here. And then I did not want to hook up or anything it because I had to have all that time to get ready to work also and I was just like never texting him back, so why would you come to my house. And, but I think I just need to text him back and like be straightforward that they don't want to like hang out anymore. But I also like feel mildly good about it that I didn't like up with him or that like or that I just like do not want to like I never. I never am the one who was like I want to choose what I want for me and not do this, you know I don't know if that makes sense, but. It was just really weird and I did not like that and I didn't know, I just want to like have it fizzle out but I don't think he's gonna like allow that job and but. I just like. feel super awkward about that, but feel like I need to stand my ground about it, because obviously there's a lot going on, otherwise, then, that I need to deal with first."
540.0,Provider,So what about him do you feel like is pros like what What about him.
12511.0,Patient,"He. He is like very like. very nice and caring and like. It is like the type of person who would like. I don't know do any like help you if he needed help or like whatever and. it's not someone like I particularly like love. hanging out with that much but he's also like super Nice and he's talkative so I don't have to like make up all the conversation and. he's like. Not do she. Just rare. But other than that he just like talks about how all these women, women like love him because this, and this, and this, and this and i'm like don't really. feel that way or care about that much matter feel like you see, I but I don't know it's like. We have good sex a month like it kind of for me."
540.0,Provider,felt like that inside of me.
12511.0,Patient,"I would like him if he didn't want. To like be polyamorous and talk about all these other women and what and like wants to have like multiple like. Women. I would probably like him if he just liked me and he didn't like press that all the time, but i'm not into that."
540.0,Provider,So what is he trying to press the animal.
12511.0,Patient,"or and and just like being with me but also having a bunch of like other like girlfriends and like people that he's with. And like I feel like I never have guys choose just me and I always like end up in these like talking to these guys who want to like have these like open relationships, where they like. have multiple people at night just don't want to do that anymore."
540.0,Provider,"So what would be. The negatives, I want you to list all the negatives of him."
12511.0,Patient,"The negatives, is that. I don't like the way he has like kids and I don't like some of the stories of like like. I just don't I judge mentally subconsciously don't agree with all of his parenting styles. I laid he is trying to like push these things on me when i've already like straight up told him know that I don't like that enough and it's hard for me to be assertive and I already like explain to the reasons why about these things. And he keeps doing it, he made us order food one time at like two in the morning and like made me pay for like $60 of this disgusting pizza and then give me $10 he is like kind of have bad breath sometimes he i'm like kind of like. roses me i'll because he, like likes to cook and like tells you all these gross meaty dishes that he makes he just like stops by my house and expects that i'm going to be like ready and wanting to have sexy time. He tells me about how cool he is and like how all these girls want him in like all the girls that have ever wanted him in his life and that's annoying and. and He doesn't live very close to me. yeah."
540.0,Provider,So big and negative less.
12511.0,Patient,yeah you're right there's way more negatives and positives. Just taking up time. I see him.
540.0,Provider,What do you think that you're trying to find within him. So why do you think that you're continuing.
12511.0,Patient,"i'm like. Babies just still get. Sex at attention. Like. me trying to find I don't know I think more than that, I just like not like companionship like some days i'll be home and i'll just like come home from work and make I don't want to be alone right now and then i'll like. text him, but I don't like like him enough that I like while i'm around all the time than I, like text him all the time, but I think like I probably could just go see some people in some way and or have people over talk to people. Other than him but it's just like easy that's like a super easy way for me to like fill a loneliness void is like. All and I but i'm always like expect my expectations of him or like to I do and i'm always expecting. More so I don't think. I should probably just be honest and like not lead him on."
540.0,Provider,"To you, so do you think that he keeps coming around because you're leading them on or do you think that he's just being pushy about staying."
12511.0,Patient,"I think both, and I think that he, like. I think that i'm also like. easy and convenient for him because I like have my own apartment and. That I like some some things and some of her time together, but so then he thinks that he can like probably prob enough that he can get everything that he wants out of me, you know."
540.0,Provider,"So how do you think that you should know about, maybe this relationship dynamic."
12511.0,Patient,"Just being like. i'm sorry that they haven't been contacting you, but I also do just don't. Just like you're a great guy but I don't think that i'm going to want the same. Things as you and you should have someone who wants to do all those. Things like you want, that person is not me. I don't know it's gonna be really awkward I wish you would have just gotten the hint when I started avoiding him. But now he, like has this sense that he can just because once. Once upon a time, he was like you should give me a key to your apartment so I can just like sneak in at the night when my kids are sleeping. which also is weird like what if there's a fire your House like your kids are just gonna like deal with it like he doesn't want that close and. Then I was like actually don't do that because you keep pushing this ain't no and i'm not going to do that and then. He was like just decided to like start showing up bread is anyways and just like knocking like not that often, but I still don't like this, because it like. If the flashbacks of when I was like an escort random people would show by my my house I hated it like you're just like not ready for people to come if you don't know they're coming you know."
540.0,Provider,So he has a key.
12511.0,Patient,"No, I never gave it to him, but you just like comes and sees my car is here."
540.0,Provider,"Okay. And then, what he just knocks at your door."
12511.0,Patient,"yeah and like i've time I was like happy about it, but also that I think it's when I stopped when I don't like text him that much and. cuz then not time I was like oh I hey I was gonna never taste you again those mad at you, because I didn't like that you like said this thing when I already said no, or something and then. That time was fine, but this time I just felt literally so awkward I wanted to die, I was like please just leave my apartment because i'm trying to get ready for work."
540.0,Provider,"And so, how frequently do you talk to him."
12511.0,Patient,"I mean, I think he would like it if it was like every day, but like definitely like the last month not frequently because I kind of like stop texting him when I was going home, too, but I feel like he's trying to like make it come back now that i'm back in town like sometimes I would. I know if I texted him every day was mostly because I just didn't want him to be given texted me for like four days man, maybe, like the phone works both ways I don't know."
540.0,Provider,So. So what do you know that you've been like ignoring him mostly like that's what you're attacking.
12511.0,Patient,"No, you froze."
540.0,Provider,"Sorry, so the ignoring is not working. But do you think that you truly want to end it yet so is that something, are you trying to keep this."
12511.0,Patient,"I don't know, maybe I just like wanted to have it all. on the back burner, but then like. Then I had to maintain. It but I especially don't want him like I feel like he wants to like talk to me and also like see if i'm Okay, and I don't want to talk to like him about any of my. Like feelings or problems or pastor like anything so but I want to have. Like a backburner like. Sexual partner and like someone who gives me intention. But I also just don't feel like I feel really I don't know like I started also just like it like binge eating and eating more like. bros just like. No, like, I want to be with anyone. Right now, but then i'm like But what if that changes in the future, but I still don't think like I just picture like I don't want to like him that much because, if anything, if things like did go further than I don't think I would be happy with how. How like the all those negative things that I listed like keeping. Your ratio probably just admit now."
540.0,Provider,"they're also I mean. Ending it sooner than later, is going to be easier because the more and more that you stay in it, the harder it gets to get out of."
12511.0,Patient,"I think you're right like I just hold on to it like for like a comfort thing that's like I don't have to like. I don't know because I still like ultimately just like want. To date, someone or like how boys attention, but I also don't want to like waste time with it anymore and or like be putting that first of it's not like me like what needs to happen most in my life right now. And I don't think he's like me that person, but I think I just have like that. Like internal clock like fear that I need to like have some kind of. Like die or partner or something like always but that's like not also just like him sneaking over at night, like random times it's not the kind of. person. But he was like I was going to see if you wanted to like if you do have to work if you want to go out to eat for breakfast like I don't want someone that I don't like that i'm like not comfortable with just like watching me like get ready and then. Like me, not knowing about this. This plan."
540.0,Provider,"So. I mean if you told him that, like you needed a time to be able to just focus on you that, like you, can't be in a relationship right now and then for the foreseeable future, do you think that he would listen."
12511.0,Patient,"yeah I think that he. Like would value my honesty, but that also. He might try and be like. He might try and be like well, we can just wait and we can do things like slowly, how you want to do them and stuff but then he said that about like me not wanting to do. No, and also because, like I number one just don't enjoy that number two like I just feel like I should be able to like. Do that to a guy and then see if they like that, and then, if none if I again like peg of them, and they can do it, you know to me. And three like when I was with davi and he would like hold sex over my head and not like not have sex with me and then sometimes would like. tie me up and like or just like a totally like rate me and hold me down and he was also like super huge and like very strong and I hated it and stuff and he only ever wanted to do that. And so I just don't want to do a frickin angel and I like told the guy like a condensed. version of this and then he was like Oh, I will you know well, I don't want to do anything doesn't make you comfortable in that time he showed up and I was like I was never gonna talk to you again because I don't abuse and you're pushing me. And then he was just like we won't push you and stuff and then it's literally been like a couple weeks, and he was like you should give me this for my birthday and then it was like when's your birthday and he was like in February knows like. know so that I just wanted to ignore it, because it's gross like stop pushing me to do this, just go find if you want to have a bunch of other girls friends anyways. And just have one be the one that you do that with and it not be me and you stop talking about it, you know. So I feel like that's a fair thing to like be like I don't we're not seeing eye to eye about this, and it has obviously turned me off like to the point of me like not wanting to like that's like a gross turn on for me if that's all you want i'll let him know like. Like attractive to you, otherwise if that's just like that's gross know like if I wanted that then."
540.0,Provider,What did. He say back to you when did you bring up the pegging to him.
12511.0,Patient,"I didn't I was the one point I didn't say, but I feel passionate about it because, like. I because, like guys they're actually have like a pleasure sensor there, and also, if you want to know, like the intense pressure of that and how. Like some girls like done that's cool but like for me it's like no it's an awkward uncomfortable feeling that I do not like, and then I want to know if, like. I don't know. I feel like men get so like offended by that and feel like so a mass utilize or whatever, because, like but I don't know like when I was asked what there was a lot of people who wanted to be like. Exploratory with that and stuff but then it's just like if it's not if it's something that you're doesn't make her partner link comfortable my virtual do that I don't know."
540.0,Provider,"Why, I mean. Especially that he it's different if he wanted to but respects the fact that you don't want to."
12511.0,Patient,"I know I. Like the only way that I would want to do this with people i've already thought about this is like, if I wasn't like all long. term relationship with someone who, I was very comfortable with and felt like like I like had gotten to that point not like oh it's been one month since I told you know now my mind, is completely changed about this. it's like and like it's not like he has like wooed me to the fact that, like I wanted like do things for him, but I also like. hardly ever say no to people, so I would just rather like avoided until it's not like finding me anymore by, but I feel like I have to like hit this one like straight on."
540.0,Provider,"How do you think you can best go about it, what do you think you need to do in this relationship with them."
12511.0,Patient,"I think I should just text him so it's not in the back of my mind anymore, and just be like hey it's like if this is this is how I feel, and then, if if it ever changes i'll let you know, but for now. I don't think I. want to hang out anymore, but then I have to force myself to hang out with other people to buy like monthly hang out proto. I could do that if I start going."
540.0,Provider,To be manly. Maybe men right now we've talked about it.
12511.0,Patient,there's a lot of other things I have to want to focus on besides that anyways so.
540.0,Provider,"We talked about before even maybe even trying to find like a gay man to be in like a friendship with so that you can build those boundaries and start. Trusting yourself to be with someone who is of the opposite sex, knowing that they aren't attracted to you that you, you can't have like that connection with them."
12511.0,Patient,yeah I really like also like my one manager co worker. who's gay like I really miss like I always used to have lots of like gay male friends doing theater and stuff and. I feel like that would. you're right That would be good.
540.0,Provider,"So, what are you going to do this week so you're gonna get rid of your weed today. Go to an A meeting."
12511.0,Patient,"And then I feel like I should like. contact people back or like get my house set up for like this handyman to them tomorrow and just do it and stop thinking about it and not be so awkward about it and then i'll have. This group tomorrow and then i'm off tomorrow also and then maybe I can just like. Maybe I can just try and like relax today and tomorrow and not like. Like overwhelm myself with trying to do too much, but also maybe like make a list, make a list of people I should contact or. or like talk to, I was also thinking like maybe I could find, like some of my. My like assignment that I had to do, for I O P, or like that i've had to do like for a sponsor whatever and maybe I could like read one or two of them to you because not all of them, I like presented or anything and. you're right, it was like really helpful when I read that letter out loud to you and then maybe it could just like remind me some of the reasons why I like. choose to stay sober or like I don't know some of the impacts of that or whatever yeah maybe like look back on that because I always like save. No, no, things or articles or like assignments or things that are good and helpful to me, but maybe I can look back over those things and just like be reminded, because I have like a ton of like. packets, or like things I filled out there, like things I can do, instead of this, you know, instead of relaxing or whatever, and because, and because i'm like giving my house like. A little. Make over when this man comes I like started organizing my stuff so that at least like feels good that they have like a clean environment, but maybe I could look over those. Things. I oh."
540.0,Provider,yeah so maybe next week have something ready to read to me.
12511.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like that would be good, because now, I feel like it's like Dom reading this. One to my mom when I just did this, but like that they're like some other like I think I have like a goodbye letter to like wheat or something that I never read or presented like in my op that maybe I could just like. yeah I don't know read ground and."
540.0,Provider,I honestly don't.
12511.0,Patient,"I also just really like. I like like fluctuate between way a lot just do like these, like cycles like binge eating and then like. Eating nothing and stuff and right now i'm on this binge eating one and I just really want to like. I don't know only way closer starting to fit tighter and it like makes me feel so like self conscious, and so I and they just like started making us were like button Downs to work so now, I feel like my work outfit is just ugly so I just want to like move or like. eat better or something, but then like. I don't know why I just get so worked up over everything when it's like the first like the first like try of doing something like it's like. If I like if i'm in like I don't know like when i've had to go to rehab in journal like when i'm in the cycle of journaling every day. And I like it, and like it's good, and I do it and but mostly it's because someone else is going to see it, or like benefit from it, or read it or judge or whatever you know, but then like when it's me like I. are like now that I told you like, I feel like I can like stop but then last week. When like we did it me I was like Oh well, here's a great little secret excuse for me to keep going because she'll never know there's not someone else that like is going to be judging or caring about it for me and. And, and so, then, like the first one, like the first journaling for myself or like the first like. going for a walk outside where people might see you or you might be uncomfortable for two seconds is like seems like such a huge buildup thing if it's not like for someone else I don't know how to like. make my cell phone and do stuff for myself and be like you're not too awkward or like weird to just do it."
540.0,Provider,So. Which one I want you to.
12511.0,Patient,thing that I try and do like the first of this week.
540.0,Provider,"So what we can do is, we can have you start journaling and then you pick like the like journal every day and then or maybe every other day, to make it more like less taxing. And then you read them to me in therapy."
12511.0,Patient,"But it could be really good that could be very insightful to a week because or like for when I was in rehab they will just be like I mean, I guess, there was some. different formats, but like one of them was like you just had to write a half a page or or it was like a half a page or like 20 minutes, whichever came first, but I would usually end up like going longer than that because, like, but I have a page doesn't seem intimidating. But then usually like okay."
540.0,Provider,"I should, so I may be able to. Can click on it."
12511.0,Patient,"But the thing is, I think we should say that I, maybe like read them to or not because I don't want my mind me to be like okay well Downs like cathy's gonna hear them don't, it has to be really good and profound and like something, you know that, like would sound good if you read aloud."
540.0,Provider,"So I want you to do this. So this is what I used to do in residential and I would I would literally print this out cut I mean you can probably just like write them on pieces of paper put them in a jar and then pick them out. Some of them are very short, some of them are quotes to write on confessions yeah. It makes journaling a little bit easier."
12511.0,Patient,mm hmm when you have a little prompt or you agree yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Maybe try to do at least once a week, maybe do this and then, if you can do more than that, but maybe just at least right now trying to do, once a week."
12511.0,Patient,"It just seems and sounds so simple, but I know like when I think of it in my head i'm like you need to make this the best piece of like writing that has ever I don't know how to take that pressure off that it's like not."
540.0,Provider,"So, usually what what I would suggest is like putting on music. Putting on music and then just zoning out and allow yourself to that's what I think the prompts allow you to do because, like. It can just be like if you're listening to music and then it says, like the most terrifying moment of my life was and then just right. Just right. And maybe more moments than one is going to come up, but just, if you like, if you focus too much on like the substance of it stop stop yourself until you're ready to you may have to pause yourself and then start over later so train yourself to Journal in a different way."
12511.0,Patient,Or you just have to know myself like without judgment in that it's not. Just like a free ride on it okay.
540.0,Provider,"And if you get if you get too fixated on it pause and then try the next day so maybe that's what we're gonna do is, if you get stuck on it too much."
12511.0,Patient,"I just say also like the first little bit of like. Stopping something even though, why like no, it was like not being good for me it's like i'll tell myself, like the first days like Oh, you are so much more comfortable. Like when you were smoking weed like music sounded better everything was better, but then like I don't like do that same like list the negative list you know and like outweigh it cuz. Overall, like those, like the good things about it, just like pale in comparison to the. negatives and me not caring about like anything like yeah I don't care about my weird feelings, but that I don't care about literally anything else, or like moving forward or paying bills, or like. Whatever."
540.0,Provider,"So start small we got to start small okay okay. Because that's where that's where we're gonna make the changes is when we can start to figure out like these little I guess it would be like quirks that you want to work on. You can't just abruptly change we can change ourselves as a whole, but we can change those little things that we need to work on which will again change other things in the future. No, I."
12511.0,Patient,"Say that group we had to say, like what was like something that we like grew from or like learned over this period, and I feel like. That has been like really helpful for me in not like giving up and like trying to make things. Smaller like usually, I would like, if this happened just not talk to anyone for a really long time like including you, and just like make it so like dramatic and go on for forever and be like the biggest deal real up, but then, but I don't know like. I don't know doing just like the like the littler things have. made more of a difference than me thinking about and wishing for like the biggest change ever and not be figuring out how to do it, but there's still so much like I don't know little things I feel like I haven't done or mastered."
540.0,Provider,The time.
12511.0,Patient,"This one but that like I don't know like six months ago, this would have like broken me again. and And now I have at least like the adaptability to like just I don't know try and keep moving forward, even though I don't like what I did."
540.0,Provider,Because you can either let yourself drowned and just look this take you down or you can learn from it continue to grow. And just because you make a mistake doesn't mean that has to be devastating it doesn't have to be a devastating. Okay.
12511.0,Patient,"Thank you, I want you."
540.0,Provider,"Throughout this week as you're getting sober I want you to keep on saying, like in your head my voice saying like it's temporary so things it is temporary, the discomfort is temporary, and you gotta get through these few days in order to have a better life."
12511.0,Patient,"Right you're right Thank you. Welcome okay. I know you say i'm making it like centric or just for free in my head, but I knew, you would have a way to make it like I don't know sorted sorted out a little bit more, and that it wasn't as big of a deal, maybe as i'm making it, but I appreciate that. And just knowing that."
540.0,Provider,"it's not a big deal, but it can lead to a big. yeah okay. So you're catching this and you got to catch it now. Because if you keep on allowing it, it will become a big deal."
12511.0,Patient,Now you're just.
540.0,Provider,One day yeah so we're catching.
12511.0,Patient,Not too late to come back from it now right okay.
540.0,Provider,"Not too late, not at all."
12511.0,Patient,"Okay, well, I also appreciate you helping me like see what the first steps, I do are into making everything feel of equal weight and not even like knowing what everything is."
540.0,Provider,But the best don't yeah don't overwhelm yourself with everything that you want to do just try to figure out a few things that you can do that are going to lead up to it.
12511.0,Patient,"Okay, all right perfect."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so I know we're running low on time we're going to see each other, next week, but I want you to get rid of the weed today, so you get on that as soon as possible, no saying goodbye to it, no puffin for the last bit okay. scared of it. And then. A in person, I would like to see."
12511.0,Patient,OK.
540.0,Provider,"And then, if you can journal, once this week."
12511.0,Patient,"Yes, I can do all those things, and thank you for. Putting them. In a like a doable banner for me."
540.0,Provider,"Oh yes. Okay, all right. Oh well, I will see you next week."
12511.0,Patient,"Thank you so so much. Have a good weekend. Okay, thanks you too bye."
540.0,Provider,"All right, for transcription That was my individual therapy session with Emily milburn seems like we've added in some new goals for her i'm looking at her know from. Two weeks ago. Let me go back to it so we're continuing on with all the. goals that she has in place. But we have to add on a few more. I think this relationship dynamic that she has where we have to have that be a long term goal of her getting rid of that relationship. still keeping long term goal of finding a career job, and she wanted to get back in the theater so keeping that as a long term goal. short term goals is going to be quitting weed so she's been smoking for two weeks now, so we need to get her away from that so just identifying things that are going to help. Her. So, in the next two to three weeks, I just want to continue to monitor that. And just have her be open, if she's had to continue are having a hard time getting off the marijuana. So i'd say maybe that goal is going to be put a month from today is hopefully we can get her sobered up away from marijuana a, I would like her to go at least weekly. And person if she could so that's a goal. For the next well this I guess is a long term goal to sustain that but short term goal is to implement it so getting to a meeting this week, would it be implementing it, a goal for us. journaling trying to do, once a week journaling so I sent her a link that has about 150 journaling types or prompts so that's going to be another goal. and continuing with all the other goal goal, she has. But other than that nothing else for transcription she doesn't do any urine drug screens because she's mental health. Primary with us so that's really it. All right, thank you."
