298.0,Provider,tiffany.
9197.0,Patient,How are you.
298.0,Provider,No complaints um it's Friday afternoon i'm almost kind of giddy. Let the fun begin.
9197.0,Patient,Most of our students don't have Friday school it's just a few of them on campus and it's like the party atmosphere on Friday afternoon so like let's go let's go everybody let's get done.
298.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's what i'm feeling i'm watching the clock, a little closer in a couple of weeks I won't be working Friday afternoon speak at but because what i'm learning is my heart's not in it on Friday afternoons i'm like I want out of here to."
9197.0,Patient,totally understand that that's why my my schedule it's supposed to be a half day on Fridays because.
298.0,Provider,And I worked so hard the rest of the week. It just makes sense that I. need to yeah take a break so what's working for you what's not working for you what questions do you have.
9197.0,Patient,"um i'm doing pretty good right now I am really realizing that a lot of these kind of really high extended moments, and then low extended moments, a lot of its grief is what i'm starting to like. Oh you're aware of it's like the grief rolls in, and then I have to just regroup for about a week and then i'll. i'll be good for about a week and then sometimes it'll roll in again, and so the unpredictability of that is frustrating, but I think just trying to keep everything else, stable, like my MED stable everything kind of will continue to help with that hopefully like in the long run to."
298.0,Provider,It yes and. Can I ask what you're grieving about.
9197.0,Patient,yeah we lost I lost my dad right at the start of covert and then I lost my best friend in May. Okay well.
298.0,Provider,"And both of those I was a hospice nurse, for a long time, and so I did a lot of training. And it's just a lot. Oh sorry that we have a glitch. Those deaths, probably took you by surprise."
9197.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"And they're harder to get through, if you would had a year to accept, you know what was going to happen that'd be one thing, but when you get blindsided like that. there's it's so much harder to work through the denial anger bargaining depression finally acceptance and what i've learned is you can bounce you know one day you're in denial and the next day, you know you're somewhere else."
9197.0,Patient,"And not only balance. of around those but, at the intensity of all of them to like."
298.0,Provider,Some days i'm just.
9197.0,Patient,Like sad like I missed you dad other days it's like.
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
9197.0,Patient,"So I think. Just time, I think, time will heal a lot."
298.0,Provider,"Everybody I don't know what how do I say this. The closer, they are to you the deeper it feels and the more that I mean it's like a knife in your heart it's just like you it's a physical pain that I just can't even understand it's. so bad, so I agree with you i'm not trying to get you all teared up here. sympathizing with you. So it looks like it's time for a refill on all of your medications can we go over to see how much you're taking."
9197.0,Patient,yeah perfect.
298.0,Provider,"Your xanax are you are you using it, not using it."
9197.0,Patient,"um yeah i'm using it. I i'm using it when it's the things it has kind of gone to the level of panic. Okay, I did end up in the hospital the emergency room let's see last Tuesday. Because basically their takeaway is your you're very stressed and you need to find a way to to not be stressed, because my my blood pressure skyrocketed and it was I got 177 over like 121 25 or something like that."
298.0,Provider,"too, they give you a script for bentos."
9197.0,Patient,"No, no, no, they just gave me. Was it they gave me benadryl through the IV and then they did some sort of diabetic for the blood pressure, so they just get. It was all just through the IV and then I think there was an Anti inflammatory that she said they were using to but I didn't take home anything or i'm not to stay, like the whole night or anything they just waited until they got my blood pressure, back to normal and then released me."
298.0,Provider,Okay. Good deal that's kind of scary. Just.
9197.0,Patient,"Well, I went. going there because I wasn't feeling good, and I was like something's wrong like it's just off, and then they take my blood pressure and they're like nope you need to go straight to the er right now."
298.0,Provider,"yeah cuz emergent care can't do much. yeah anything. anywhere near related to heart bye bye. you're here Okay, are you taking the transit down."
9197.0,Patient,"Yet i'm still taking the 300 at night. As needed it's it's such a bad groggy kind of hangover that it takes me like almost an hour to each time so really only on like a Saturday Friday or Saturday night. Because, then I can it's hard to teach with that. Like fog that it takes a while to go away."
298.0,Provider,presenting two milligrams that are you taking that.
9197.0,Patient,Is that the the like rest of us late one.
298.0,Provider,I know that's been to a trophy and presenting is for night tears.

298.0,Provider,"Okay, and are you taking the restless leg one."

9197.0,Patient,"yeah it does it helps with so much, especially my mood lately."
298.0,Provider,Oh no.
9197.0,Patient,that's normal but it's it's helped me me like when I kind of start towards these negative or just hard feeling moods it does help me kind of stay away from that.
298.0,Provider,And I probably told you this before I use this medication for depression also. Because it works on. It works on dopa mean and so people who I can't do regular. antidepressants because I might send them into manic I can I can try and work at it from this angle of a stimulant.
9197.0,Patient,that's cool I never even would have thought about that that makes a lot of sense.
