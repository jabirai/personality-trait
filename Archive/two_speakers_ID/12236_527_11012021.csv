12236.0,Patient,"But I don't I was already having problems not sleeping. That was part of the reason I had got a hold of or got an appointment with chantel. Okay, see because I was already having too many ups and downs with them on the medication, so I figured it was time to increase it."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
12236.0,Patient,I don't I don't really think that it's the medication why i'm not sleeping or why i'm sleeping too much.

527.0,Provider,"wow you've got some intense dreams, or something going on, it sounds like."
12236.0,Patient,And I don't I don't remember any of the dreams.
527.0,Provider,"yeah or I mean obviously your body's needing to release some emotion so it's finding ways to do that. yeah Okay, what about during the day, and he crying episodes during the day."
12236.0,Patient,"Just I do it pretty much all day long somebody could say something to me and i'm not even knowing why i'll start crying and i'll turn away, though I don't really like anybody just see when i'm crying. So i'll turn away or i'll just. Go to the bathroom and cry and then come back out. So, but yeah. Okay i've definitely been having it throughout the day."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, what about anxiety."
12236.0,Patient,anxiety hasn't been as bad.
527.0,Provider,So we kind of. flip flip flopped a little bit more depressive episodes okay.
12236.0,Patient,"yeah my anxiety, I feel like it's gotten better. I mean compared to what I was feeling. I don't feel so pent up."
527.0,Provider,been just.
12236.0,Patient,Like I can't yesterday we went trick or treating I had no problems being out around I mean there was a lot of people a lot more than I expected.
527.0,Provider,Angela.
12236.0,Patient,"That I didn't I didn't have any problems with it, the only time I had a problem with with because my gallstone problems started hurting themselves. yeah I was reading some. home after that."
527.0,Provider,yeah wins your surgery on that.
12236.0,Patient,I don't know they still haven't called me with an. Appointment i'm going to try get a hold of them today because. They told me would take two weeks it's been about I think a month now.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I was gonna say it's been a little bit with that. yeah okay yeah. Okay yeah definitely stay on top of that, for yourself yeah. Well, good for you what so what would you do to manage yesterday."
12236.0,Patient,"um I just I think I was just focusing on what my kids were doing and watching my daughter's trick or treat and making sure they weren't wandering off, especially my younger one making sure she stayed with the group me. You know, mean K was with us. Okay, I was just. Really occupied with her."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like you were also just really like connected in in that moment to like being present with the situation and what all was going on. yeah okay good good."
12236.0,Patient,yeah I. haven't had any problems going to the store lately I haven't felt like I needed to hurry up and get in and get out when there's a lot of people. Okay last I want to say this last week. Okay okay with it.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah yeah and I think it's just you know it's continuing to build that confidence within yourself like that you know, having having more of those positive experiences. You know, you can keep adding those into your book of okay i've done this like well like this week and I can do it again this next week and so get you know building building that confidence versus you know shooting yourself down like oh yeah here we go again. Well, you know, is there anything, particularly triggering the depression, I know it's you know. I know it's the holidays are starting to roll around and."
12236.0,Patient,"The holidays don't really bother me i'm not really big on the holidays, as even before like my mom passed away and my nephew and stuff i've never really been big on the holidays. Okay, so I mean I prefer to stay home and spend it with my little family I have. Rather than being around everybody else. it's a lot of drama around my family."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12236.0,Patient,But I just I don't really get set during the holidays usually.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12236.0,Patient,"i'm just i've never really been one, the only reason I celebrate your do anything is for my girls. Otherwise I wouldn't. I wouldn't do any of it."
527.0,Provider,How are things with your boyfriend.
12236.0,Patient,"Good um we had a pretty good argument last week, I think it was last week or the week before but we had a pretty good argument and. I ended up, he said that I don't talk now so he doesn't know when i'm having a bad day because he thought that I was mad at him because I was shut down and just not talking. I guess that's when it kind of started with just I was already starting to spiral down. Okay, and. He just thought that I was having problems with him or that I was talking to somebody else or something. And he said that I was distant and so that's why he assumed maybe I was talking to somebody or just it crossed his mind. Okay, and. So I just when he said that I completely melted I mean it was. It the way I respond it wasn't the right way, I just blew it out of proportion and just kind of. You know, had a moment, it was more than a moment, it was a few hours, I didn't talk to him and talk to me, I was real short and rude and then we turned off the lights to go to bed and he's like I can't put a bit like this we can't put a bit arguing. and So he just kept trying to talk to me and I eventually kind of talked to him a little bit just over here you got to give me time I got to be left alone I can't and he's like well you never want to talk to me because I talked to my therapist I want you to talk to you. whoa you know you have to tell me to so I know what's going on, you know. I said, I know, but like it's my personal feelings I don't really like to share when i'm thinking or you know. what's going on at the time and he's like but that's not fair, because then I don't know if you're upset with me or something happened and then he starts to worry that there's something wrong with me and. So I told him I said I understand that, but at the same time it's hard for me just to be like Okay, this is what's wrong i'm used to just keeping it in not saying anything."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so is that something that you feel like we need to start working on working continue working on, because it sounds like he. Obviously you're in the relationship with him Angela and you guys have been together for a long time so there's a lot of feelings that that you care about each other, you know deeply both sides. And so I guess you know. Trusting that this I mean this relationship is much different than the last one."
12236.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"It sounds like you know you are definitely in a different place to make you know, have made a better choice in you know. A person to be with an abusive relationship and so. yeah I mean what was that, like hearing you know it's not fair, I wanna I want to be a part of your life, I want to, I want to know. I want to know more about you."
12236.0,Patient,"He was a baby and he needed to get over it. I told her, I was in the beginning, I told him that I would that. I mean I explained to him when we first started talking how I am and I told him never expect anything different because that's who I am and I, like me, I don't want to be different, and so I kind of just told him to suck it up and get over it."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12236.0,Patient,"And then I was thinking about it, no well that's not fair to him, I mean after I had, I felt like it was just a manic episode. And because I mean I was really just I was done, I mean okay I yelled I almost broke a plate, again, I mean it was just. Okay, she was really upset late, and so I just kind of feel like it was a manic episode me. Afterwards, after I settled down like I think it was just me like a day, or so I really thought about it and. Okay, I was able to kind of process it and I realized that I do need to talk to him more, but it is hard because being with. I know we've been together a while and let's try and tell them I know we've been together for so long, and you expect me to kind of change and be able to talk to you and. But with from a prior relationship with my kids his dad if I said anything about what I was feeling or anything, it was just kind of held against me or made fun of things like that. So I learned to really even with my mom and my especially my mom my mom would do the same thing to me yeah so I just learned to keep it in there and not talk about it, because nobody needs so what's going on, if it's just gonna be brought up later or."
527.0,Provider,yeah throw them back in your face. yeah yeah okay.
12236.0,Patient,"yeah or i'm just being made fun of, for whatever reason."
527.0,Provider,yeah because you have feelings yeah. So how is how is he in receiving that from you.
12236.0,Patient,"And when I told him because I actually told him that, and he didn't know that part of it. So I did talk to him a little bit about it, and he understood more. me okay that's all you have to do is tell me even little bits here and they're fine, but you do have to tell me."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12236.0,Patient,"Well, I still feel like I don't have to tell you it's kind of my choice to tell you."
527.0,Provider,Where. It is it is.
12236.0,Patient,"I mean, so I told him, you know I am trying, but at the same time he tells me well, no, I know you and I know how you think in, but I am trying that's why I talk to you."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12236.0,Patient,"it's like yeah but you're later on you'll. come up with another reason or you know you'll you'll say something else to kind of counteract what you said and or there'll be another day, this will happen, and you won't say anything you'll shut down, and I said no i'm actually trying now and I said yeah but I know how you are. woven what are you saying I don't know how I how myself. He said yeah basically."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I think I think for for both of you, you both need that validation from one another, that to recognize the feelings of one another, like him feeling like maybe rejected in a sense, or. And then you also feeling like you're being judged. And so, like those are pretty intense feelings right there, which puts people's walls up real quick, you know, and so I think it's a place that you both go can go to with with yourselves, but i'm wondering what it would be like for both of you to maybe just. pay attention to the feelings more with one another, like be able to kind of identify those when they come up like when. You know, when he came to you and said, you know it's not it's not being fair to me. You know, free, instead of the automatic like i'm going to shut down or i'm going to just explode like to maybe just pause for a minute and and recognize Okay, I hear he's got a feeling he he shared he sharing with me, can I can I share back with him. Or at least even just acknowledge like you know i'm i'm sorry you're feeling, and this is unfair and i'm i'm wanting to work on this with you."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I noticed when he tries to share his feelings with me I tell them to suck it up and not to be. a bitch and. He gets upset and then I. Think about. Law I need to stop doing that because that's kind of I mean that's how it was for me basically."
527.0,Provider,Well that's. yeah I. Say yeah.
12236.0,Patient,"I just kind of do it to him and i've noticed like when he's sharing his feelings kind of he thinks I don't care because I blow it off or I just tell them to suck it up and deal with it you're a man don't pray. And i'm blunt like that. And he upset. so sure, and I can see where he gets upset."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good good."
12236.0,Patient,"As I do know how it feels but at the same time. I have moments, where I do that, and then I feel guilty later when I realized what I said and then, when I want to apologize nope I want to apologize I just leave it be."
527.0,Provider,"So Are there things. yeah well, I mean it's clear that's a that's a pattern for you. You know and you've learned that so it's it's easy for you to like switch it around and put it on somebody else, but at the same time, if it would, if he would come back to us saying the same thing. That would definitely be very hurtful for you."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah it wasn't even he knows he told me, it was the other way around, you know it would be a lot different you wouldn't do what I do and just kind of take it, you know."
527.0,Provider,You say.
12236.0,Patient,You would completely melt and it would be a fight and you'd probably leave.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12236.0,Patient,"I know, and then well I didn't tell him, I know I told him no I wouldn't. yeah again, I know you more than you know yourself."
527.0,Provider,Angela he really wants to be a part of your life what's that feat what's that feel like for you to.
12236.0,Patient,"I don't. know I it's hard I don't trust it I don't I know who does he says he does all the time, but at this age, for me, I don't really trust that okay it's hard."
527.0,Provider,But he's still here like what what keeps him here then Angela.
12236.0,Patient,I don't know and that's what i've been trying to figure out I poke at everything and try and figure out Why is he still here.
527.0,Provider,Are you poking to push him away.
12236.0,Patient,"Sometimes I think so, and that's he said that he's asking."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
12236.0,Patient,yeah I get afraid to be cloaks.
527.0,Provider,"I know you do I know, but what what holds you back from allowing yourself that opportunity to be with someone that can be kind and gentle and love you."
12236.0,Patient,"am afraid, once I actually let myself be happy with them that it's going to change."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12236.0,Patient,"i'm afraid he'll change i'm afraid that he'll change and just you know, once he knows everyone's i'm if I can like talk to him and things like that i'm afraid that his attitude towards me is going to change."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, to be what."
12236.0,Patient,"I just I don't want to end up in the same situation, I was doing with my kids is dead. Now that scares me."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so did that relationship start out okay initially."
12236.0,Patient,"No, no, it did not. work out okay. Okay, starting it out terrible and I didn't realize it until I was about because I was with my kids his dad when I was 16. I didn't realize it until I was about 20 just how bad it was. Okay first had met, I mean we were we were I guess together for about two months, and then I started having bruises on me and I had a bite bite marks on my like on my breast and all my arms and."
527.0,Provider,wow yeah.
12236.0,Patient,"Okay, I did have a scar for a long time scars finally went away. But. And then he would ashes cigarettes on me, but the cigarettes on me things like that. And that was just in the beginning."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah okay. yeah there's definitely a lot of trauma right there for you, with that."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah and I know he would never do things like that I just worry more about my emotional state with him, because I know that he would never put his hand and I fully trust him on that there's no way I would ever think he would do anything to hurt me like that."
527.0,Provider,Good I.
12236.0,Patient,And I want you worries me.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I and i'm glad to hear you say that, like that you trust him on that, because that is huge, to be able to just."
12236.0,Patient,"him on oh yeah and i've never really i've never trusted anybody like that, but. him I do I know he would never. physically hurt me. Okay, and I don't even know that he would. Like I don't know that he would emotionally hurt me on purpose. I don't think it's something he would actually do but i'm still I still have to have my guard up, I still feel like I should."
527.0,Provider,"Okay. And that's you know I think part of that is you letting your emotional guard down with yourself to you know you you keep that pretty well protected inside yourself. And so you know i'm wondering what it would be like just to. begin to kind of take take the wall away of you know that guard that guardedness you know little piece, at a time. And in thing as Angela you don't have you don't have to share your whole story with him until you're ready to do that and and you share and what pieces, you want to share, but I do think. Excuse me, I do think it might be helpful for. The two of you to maybe challenge, some of those vulnerabilities with each other, like just to recognize, you know what feelings, he has. And then, what feelings, you have like and what it's like to experience that care and support from one another, because you need it, just as much as he needs it to like you need to be able to trust yourself."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah he says that I get mad when he tries to tell me how he feels or what i've done that bothers him and he said that I get mad I don't notice it, I mean. spaghetti."
527.0,Provider,"person. Well let's let's think about that what what is. He says, you get mad what's the feeling that comes up when he shares how he's feeling. Over you."
12236.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I feel annoyed when he's trying to, especially when he saying it's something I did to him, then I just I get annoyed. Sometimes even when he's just trying to share something. Just when he comes home from work and he's trying to share his day at work, I can just blow it off okay. yeah. I mean, I try, especially when he's if he's in pain, or something like that then i'm definitely more loving and caring than I am when it's when it's emotional. Okay, but if it's physical i'll take care of them, I have no problem."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so so obviously I mean that goes back to just how your emotions were were allowed or not allowed in your family growing up what would it be like to share with him what. What you're working on, as far as your reactions to emotions like what, what do you feel comfortable explaining to him at this point of you know, when here's here's why I struggle with emotions, because this was my experience, you know dada dada dada Where would you start."
12236.0,Patient,"I don't know i've never thought about it i've never thought about having to share that with anybody, I mean talking to you is easy, because I don't have to live with you. And then that's it. I don't we don't live together so it's just it's easier um i've never really thought about sharing those, like those experiences or anything with them."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. it's not. yeah it's not necessarily going into depth with them at this point Angela but maybe just helping them understand. What you're working on you're working on. Being able to identify your emotions and express them. But the pattern of you know, but your pattern has been in the past that you're they were used against you, and so you know it's, for they weren't validated."
12236.0,Patient,"I kind of explained it to him, the other day when we had our will last week when we had our. argument that was kind of one of the things when the lights were off and everything like that I kind of explained to him, you know make fun of but you know wasn't like. yeah if I had a feeling I just stuffed it away because I learned really young if you share your feelings you get made fun of I mean it. wasn't my mom doing it. Then it was my kids is that. And so I just learned just to keep them in. mind I told him it's really hard to share those. yeah really, really hard for me to just tell you hey i'm having a bad day. You just expect me to now and I said, well, I mean I don't expect you to know, but you can you obviously can tell there's something wrong with me and I don't feel that you should take it to heart and think that i'm upset with you."
527.0,Provider,"So what what could he say to you in that moment, that would be more helpful. To help it to also help reassure him that it's not necessarily directed towards him because that's kind of his negative thought process like what did I do i've done something wrong and. she's mad at me like to help both you know both of you kind of stopped that negative cycle of going back down that path it that is so easy to go."
12236.0,Patient,um well that's What if he asked me what was wrong and I told him nothing i'm just having a bad day just having a day or no I didn't even say that I said nothing I kept saying nothing. I was having a bad day.
527.0,Provider,He would have left me alone okay.
12236.0,Patient,"I was more clear on that he would leave me alone. Instead of just keep asking me and then finding is it something he did or and that's when he said, do you just expect me to know if it's me or if it's just you or if it's a bad day for you. That I can't do that I can't read your mind I don't know."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12236.0,Patient,"All right, and, and so I guess if I would have just said i'm just having a day. Okay, that OK. That one for."
527.0,Provider,"Sure okay so so one of the things, maybe, is my Internet. Being a stinker this morning. Oh, can you see me now or hear me now Angela. yeah yeah I had my internets I don't know what's going on. What would happen if that's something maybe you worked on, as far as you know, being more aware of your own emotions and what's going on and being able to verbalize like what you need in that moment. With."
12236.0,Patient,That it yeah I would work on that.
527.0,Provider,"yeah because I think that's yeah I mean I think that's that's very a very good place to start just even saying. Because something was wrong like that, so you weren't you weren't even validating yourself that was that something was wrong, you were dismissing it for yourself like by saying nothing, nothing when yeah their evidence, there was evidence, there was something going on and so. You paying attention to that."
12236.0,Patient,"And I don't know when i'm having days like that I don't know why they just happened and I don't know what it is that causes it I don't know where I go for that to happen, I don't know. I. In when I have like my manic days they just happen and I don't I don't know exactly where it comes from, they just happen. Okay it's the same thing with when i'm down or when i'm just I can't sleep for. I just it just happens and I don't know what it is that causes it I don't know if it's something that I seen read. Okay, just kind of triggered things or. Sure, something that maybe he said or is you know just anything. Okay trigger and I don't know exactly what they are when it happens, and then I just find myself in a slump."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, and so, how about if we just. Just just identify like I don't have to figure this out in the moment like what What if we kind of took that approach with it angela's like i'm not sure why i'm having a bad day i'm just off and and, and so one of the things that may be helpful i'm wondering is if we can kind of. Maybe do some mood journaling for yourself like kind of checking in like. Where their changes, you know what was there anything I did differently today how did I sleep, you know, did I get enough nutrition for the day did I you know. Did I hear something, but maybe even like backtracking to like you know, because sometimes the trigger isn't in that moment, it could be. If I think about it, you know it might have started three days ago, when you know the kids didn't do their chores or something or. You know, and then we gotten a little tip over that and and then that just kind of escalate it, you know, then I started. You know, second guessing myself as a mom and then you know, then I snapped at the kids and I yelled and then I felt guilty and. So it may have been something that happened, you know, a few days prior that has gotten you, to the point of where you're at, and so it may be kind of trying to track some of those thoughts and behaviors for you."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah i've been journaling a little bit when i'm feeling when i'm having days like that. Last week I journal like not being able to sleep. And a journal some I didn't know, like every day."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12236.0,Patient,"But then I noticed when I went back and read see if I can see, maybe if I put something of what may have triggered it. I feel like it's when he comes home and he just instilling starts picking the kids. And I know it's not nitpicking to him it's stuff like he'll tell the kids you know clean the room and it's just they won't do it, or they have their room was still be dirty by the time he gets off work and. You know he's already told him or he just told him, you know don't have soda don't have cups in your room don't have food in your room, and that is a rule that we have in the House. And I know that sure right, I tried to make sure they don't sometimes they'll get past me with stuff and. A lot of times it's. Not that big of a deal to me as long as I make sure it's out of their room. And him it's a big deal okay so he'll come home and he kind of I feel like it's nitpicking. But it's not nitpicking to him and so just kind of jumped down their throats and then that that kind of I feel like i'm always having to protect my kids. yeah because I don't want him screaming at them, or just telling them that they're doing this wrong and just feel like they're always being told they're doing stuff wrong."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, which is, which is probably a trigger button for you too. yeah i've never. Ever feeling never feeling good enough."
12236.0,Patient,yeah and that's not what I want them to feel it.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12236.0,Patient,"So I just feel like i'm always protecting them okay. yeah sees it, that i'm always taking their side. Like my kids are not supposed to be in trouble, or something and try and tell them they are, and he says that i'm too i'm too relaxed with them, I let them get away with everything and especially my youngest."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12236.0,Patient,"And I try and tell them oh my youngest you can't tell me anything about her, she does nothing wrong. My own teenagers So yes, they do things wrong. yeah when it comes to my nine year old she does nothing wrong she's perfect. Okay, but I mean I do, and I know I do, but I just I always feel like i'm having to be there shield or just kind of step in and be like that's enough, but I don't say that's enough, I start fighting with him. Okay, if I make sure I get the attention turned away from them to me, so I just start the arguments. And then ends up into a bigger argument, because he thinks i'm just letting the kids get away with you know, keeping the room Messier. know not keeping up with their house chores and stuff."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, so how, how do you want to reel that in to maybe take that piece off the table for yourself. And for the kids."
12236.0,Patient,"i've tried talking to him about it about coming home every day, not giving it a break, I get coming home every once in a while and that happening, you know I mean i'd be fine with it, if it happened three days out of the week, instead of every single day weekends, including. You know, it would be nice, but he thinks that i'm just I don't know if it's the way I say it, I don't know if I say it right, or what but he just thinks that. i'm just Okay, with everything and I don't you know he he just thinks that i'm trying to argue about it and let the kids get away with stuff. He doesn't understand that I don't want to scream at my kids all the time. And I don't want to hear them being screamed at."
527.0,Provider,"So what So what do you think a fair compromise might be then Angela for that, like obviously they need to know their responsibilities and and you being able to reinforce those. But I mean what do you, what do you think is I mean it sounds like you're you're. You want to be on the same page with him as well, like you're like the rule is no food and drinks in your room and and so. that's just kind of a hard and fast rule for the House, so how, how do you want to reinforce that because i'm guessing the girls know how they know how to walk on YouTube."
12236.0,Patient,"They do they do yeah they definitely know that they can do what they want, and I won't really say much about it, and then, when he gets all it's going to be. And for the most part they try and have it they'll leave everything alone and right before he's going to get home it'll be done. But sometimes it's not like that, and sometimes they'll leave something or they'll just take it and they'll forget what time it is and they'll have something in their room and he'll think it's been there all day. Sure um so it just. I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"So what what could you do to like reset that for yourself like you know sat down with a family meeting and say all right. we're we're really you know we were going to review the family rules chore list, and you know starting you know Monday, whatever this is this is what's going to happen and if it's not done there's going to be consequences to you know you lose privileges for the day you know."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah I have to stick with the consequences we've done this and I let them flight on it, I don't stick with it, and he that's where he gets upset with me because he says that. He says, sometimes i'll do it i'll stick with them, but then he's like their days I just don't want to deal with it that's how he sees it, is that I don't want to deal with it. And so I just let them do whatever and we'll get on to them about keeping stuff our room i'll let them have their food in there, or whatever, and some days he's right I don't i'm too tired to deal with it, even though i'm not doing anything i'm too tired."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, but we also need to build your confidence to, as Mr."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah I always feel like i'm like. He judges me on that part because he had a way different upbringing than I did it was really strict in you know you do what you have to do, or you don't get anything. yeah and so you know he had that and I didn't I didn't have that kind of structure, I mean I think his was just kind of me, but in a different way than mine was but I didn't have that I just you know was kind of left alone, unless they want somebody to pick on."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah which was not fair either. yeah. And I think you have to again you have to agree on what the consequences and make it match whatever you know the. The chore or the rule is to like not you know if it's something that that you can't follow through with is it is it a reasonable consequence than. You know so like if there's if the if they know you know no food or drink as loud in your room, you can only have it in the kitchen or whatever, then you know. They need to you know that they need to reiterate that back to you like Okay, no food no drink in the room, with, we can only eat in the kitchen or whatever, and so they need to repeat back to you guys like what. What the rule is to, and you know what are the consequences if you know if they have stuff left in their room and you're doing her you know, a room check and find something. You know, like what you know how, how do you want to approach that because I think it's also okay to say. You know, to come at them with you know, there was there was food and drinks in your room today, you know what do you need to do like yeah or what, what do you, what do you think's going to happen and and just kind of put it back on them. You know, is it well, you lose your film privileges for the rest of the day yeah."
12236.0,Patient,"And that's that's how it's supposed to be. that's supposed to. But I noticed with my middle daughter he doesn't get on to her as much either she can pretty much do whatever she wants and there's not a lot of consequences for her as to with my youngest daughter, the game will get taken from her for like a month and. Then the she. rocks and then my oldest daughter he really doesn't feel too much with her, but he is still mean to her and rude to her because of how she was treating me and I understand he's still upset with her about it just for the way she treated me. And at the same time it wasn't him, she was doing that, too, it was me. So I. You know, he needs to just kind of back off, and let me handle it because I mean man her doing better we talk she still pistols a says that she's treating me like he doesn't like how she talks to me."
527.0,Provider,Or how she treated me.
12236.0,Patient,"And he says that i'm not paying attention to it because I don't want to be said, I don't want to see it. But I feel like he picks on my youngest or why. They kind of feel like that about every but."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah. And I you know he doesn't have any kids of his own right Angela.
12236.0,Patient,"No, no."
527.0,Provider,yeah so he's trying to figure out how to do parenting with. kids that aren't his. yeah yeah.
12236.0,Patient,"I mean he's been around kids and he knows how his mom raised two sisters and. he's the oldest of four or three oldest of four. So he watched his mom bring up his younger siblings and stuff and so, and he helped a lot with his younger sister. Who does know like how it is, but what he witnessed, as you know, he witnesses mom being a good mom and you know and then having structure and things like that, so when he comes to me and expects me to be strict and things like that it's completely different. Because i'm not that way yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah but but at some point being able to both of you be able to come together. and support one another and feel confident about that, but, but I think that takes you. You know, letting him in a little bit to to understand your feelings on things again kind of continuing to go back to that for you guys like being able to. You guys have conversations to practice that with each other. So tell me what it was like was it easier having that conversation in the dark with him. Ah."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah I couldn't talk to them until I thought he was actually falling asleep or was asleep when talking to him, I was kind of hoping was because he wasn't really talking why."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, but he was laying there listening and then he started responding and I kind of got thrown off for a second."
12236.0,Patient,"But then I just sat up and was talking to him. Okay, he just stayed laying down didn't move or anything he just laid there, while I was talking and he listened usually he puts me off when I try and talk and he actually just listened. Time and then waited until I was done before he had anything to say and. It wasn't really anything he said he just said he was sorry for you know, keep for him just kept asking and asking."
527.0,Provider,And he was sorry for saying you know just asking if I was talking to somebody else like.
12236.0,Patient,"He said that wasn't accusing me he just asked, because I was being distant. So he didn't think it would hurt to ask. Sure, and he said he felt like I was pushing them away and. So he he doesn't he's he didn't want to be hurt himself, so he just figured he would ask me because he knows that I would tell them if I was I would be fully honest."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean it has that been an issue in the past Angela."
12236.0,Patient,"No i've never. Okay, I know he thinks that. He thinks that I would because he did that. I think we were together for like two years and then he ended up talking to his ex Okay, so he thinks that because he was stupid that I would be to. He said that that still kind of ways over. Okay, anything that I would leave at any time because i've told him I was. afraid of coming home and me not being here."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so it also sounds like he's still trying to work through his own guilt, maybe to with."
12236.0,Patient,"His actions, he said it's my fault, he hasn't because I bring it up a lot. And I mean when he said that when he asked me if I was talking to somebody else I instantly went to that I actually went to i'm not you."
527.0,Provider,know.
12236.0,Patient,"i'm not gonna do that, even if I don't want to be with you, I am not going to talk to somebody else and. The only way I would do, that is, if we were not together and it had already been a few months that we weren't together and why wouldn't just go to somebody else."
527.0,Provider,and
12236.0,Patient,"I mean when I started talking to him, we were friends and I was still with my kids is dead. And he knew that. And I told him just friends that's all because i'm with my kids dad and shortly after when I broke up with them, I told him I was like Okay, so I started talking to him more. And like he so he knows that i'm not going to do anything like that, because I wouldn't even do it to my kids his dad and he was you know piece of work can. You say the least."
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure. yeah so a lot of things you guys are holding on to. That maybe you need to at some point, you know find some closure with each other, excuse me, find some closure closure with each other on that and be able to let that be in the past."
12236.0,Patient,"I think it's more me that needs to let that be in the past and I can't wait, I still feel like even may talk to her just because after. I found out that he was talking to her, he was still doing it after he said he blocked her number and everything like that, when he would go to work he was still doing it until icing the messages. That he was still talking to her. yeah and I guess in part of it bothers me because he deleted the messages and said that they were between him and her they weren't my business. And so, and I was like Okay, well, I guess it's not my business, but at the same time. it's not really fair on my part, because then I don't know. If you were talking to her about you know, seeing her or whatever. And then I also she told me that they did see each other. So I just I don't know she ended up messaging me. And so I just i'm like okay I blocked her and. So I still don't know if he actually went and seen her or she was trying to cause more problems. You know and there's just I never got answered really never got any answers from it and. So it's hard to just kind of let things go if you don't know."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, I mean is that something at some point you feel like you need to have a conversation with him about like here's."
12236.0,Patient,"think he would really have a conversation about it with me, I really don't. I think he just kind of well, it was my business paper. And that's fine it is that's what I told him your business I get it, you know, but if I was to talk to somebody and you know if I was doing that you would come up and ask me, and if there is deleted messages and. You knew there was deleted messages. You would be upset and you would want to know, and you would get in contact with that person and you would find out what was said. You know you wouldn't let it be so for you to say it's Okay, for you to do it, but not me I just don't see it's fair yeah I don't see how that works. And it bothers me more too, because it was his that."
527.0,Provider,"so sure. yeah well, I mean it just kind of hits to your your trust issues and self esteem and confidence within yourself like that, and so, then I I put the wall up to not get close."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah that's another reason why I don't that's what I know he won't physically hurt me but. I don't know emotionally and i'm willing to chance, something I just don't want."
527.0,Provider,"I don't want sounds like he doesn't want either. yeah sounds like he doesn't want that either Angeles, so you know that at least that's a mutual goal you both have is how do we work on trusting each other's emotions with our and within ourselves to. So what would it be like to let him know like that that conversation the other night was very helpful and that that may help you to share things is maybe we start talking in the dark in a in a. In a place that feels comfortable to you both. You know that you feel like is kind of a safe place for you. i'm wondering if that might be a you know at least a way to start that you know, because you know there's all kinds of all kinds of ways to begin communicating with one another, you know, sometimes. i've had people that they have a notebook and they just write back and forth to each other, because it's you're not having to think in that moment when you're face to face with someone. Or if there's some sort of protective I don't want to call it, you know it kind of a protective barrier, but it it's also allows you to be a little more vulnerable because it feels safer to you, and so that may be just a way to kind of start opening that door for for both of you."
12236.0,Patient,yeah I we can I can talk to him and see. I can try that yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah and I.
12236.0,Patient,"forgot about it until right now I had another episode, the other day, I think it was Monday or Tuesday Monday I think. It was over my video game. left a cup of water above it my cats knocked it off the counter that was about my game my game wasn't working. And I mean, I had a complete meltdown and said a lot of things, because he was at work when I had my meltdown, and I said a lot of things through tech. And then, when he got home he came home on his break on on his 30 minute break got the game took it back with them, and when he brought it home at lunchtime it worked just fine. And, and so I felt bad, but I never did apologize for any of it, I just I did feel bad I didn't feel bad that day, I felt bad a couple of days later. Okay, but that day and then that's when I noticed that I think that was the last day that I had been on a like a binge of staying up. Okay, and then I fell asleep and that's i've been sleeping kinda since then."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay. So I think also working on just that accountability for yourself like recognizing the behaviors and being able to apologize and do do do it differently, the next time, like, I think, for you it's going to be. Building that you know building that confidence up it within yourself to Angela that yes, I you know, I was way overboard on this for and I need to I need to acknowledge my actions so that I can then be accountable and make changes. And i'm being accountable to someone else, not just not just myself but to to him to your girls, because you know you need to also learn how to model. Appropriate behavior and and healthy relationship behavior for the girls to like that you know and know that they can feel confident about themselves because mom feels confident about herself to like making that a more positive shift in the family to for you, for you. yeah yeah. And and it's going to help I you know I can guess that it's going to help the relationship to because he's going to be like. whoa wow like thank you, you know, or you know I appreciate that that you recognize, you know that that was way overboard or inappropriate and so. You know part in part of it is you're learning to do things differently Angela like you you've got such a pattern of behaviors that have functioned for you, for so long, but now they're. they're kind of feeling all over the place, because you're trying to change them and then another one pops up another trigger of. Okay, where did that come from and so and and I don't know where that one came from, and so kind of exploring that for yourself too so it's just going to kind of continue to be a. process, but you definitely have brought some really good points to the table to work on for yourself like i'm really proud of you for that."
12236.0,Patient,And then I tried to explain to him to that when the medication I start to feel different and so i'm still getting comfortable being me now. I feel different and i'm not even. i'm not even comfortable in my own skin.
527.0,Provider,"Sure, and yeah."
12236.0,Patient,"So me being able to start talking it's gonna be a little longer than you know he is not just overnight like he's expecting or wanting because I still have to get comfortable with them like I said the medication. I was he told me he was you know you told me, you were happy being who you are right, your mood swings you're happy being that be. comfortable that's me I. don't want to and. that's why i've always had a problem being on medications. But so metal is a lot easier it doesn't make me go completely numb."
527.0,Provider,It doesn't.
12236.0,Patient,"You know, take away all my thoughts i'm not blink sure I can adjust to this one, it just going to take me a little bit because I start to feel different."
527.0,Provider,"yeah definitely definitely yeah and the and the goal is that you don't just stop it, because you feel differently, like. Right, you know, is this going to allow me to function and feel better within myself but also you know have better relationships with my significant other or my girls, or just friends in general, like really being able to stand up for myself."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah little muscle it it's a slow process, I feel it's more slower, instead of just taking it and the next day just being numb and like i'm not there. yeah with them after I noticed that it kind of it doesn't do that at all, it just kind of mellows what i'm feeling."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm good okay good. Any you know I always want to check in and you suicidal thoughts self harm homicidal thoughts.
12236.0,Patient,"No i'm so far in the other one I was having a manic episode I kind of cut my wrist a little bit with my nail not like trying to hurt myself it wasn't even my wrist is the side of it. Okay it's the side of my hand, I know, but it's on the wrist area and I kind of just kept digging until it cut and once I seen it break the skin I stopped, and then I ended up doing it again, but then I stopped and I haven't done it since, but it was when I was having my medical so."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay. yeah just needing that release you think that emotional release or. yeah okay.
12236.0,Patient,"yeah cuz after I felt better I wasn't so like I I felt like I was just so angry and just so upset that I mean my chest, everything was hurting and it wasn't like a normal anxiety it wasn't my anxiety attack it just I was so worked up. And it just I felt like my head was gonna. explode and. Okay, I could feel my heart racing and I was so worked up, and it was for nothing. I mean, he bought me the video game and it's not it wasn't I don't play it that often I just had to pick it up."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. Alright, so let's think about you know what are some ways like do some journaling as far as you know, just moods. You know, things that you're keeping inside that we can continue processing whether it's you know negative thoughts feelings, you know past traumas that you want to you know we can work through as well, but also, you know, being able to. Maybe find that time you know if it's in the dark in that feels more comfortable for you to have a conversation with him or share something that feels safer in that moment, you know definitely trying that. For yourself, because that you know being and being able to, I think, each of you validate each other's feelings I think it's going to be, you know, a huge step in your relationship to build that trust there for both of you. yeah okay good and then I was looking i've got your next appointment on the 15th at 6am is that still work for you Angela Okay, and then do you want to go ahead and schedule another one out that will put us in the first week of December. Do you want to do, Monday December six."

527.0,Provider,"yeah okay so December six i'll put you down at six o'clock again. Okay perfect. Alright, and then we can schedule the next one that's your next appointment, then, will always kind of do one out for you so perfect good job. Good work today Angela i'm really proud of ya like you're really, I can tell you're really trying and challenging things for yourself."
12236.0,Patient,"Especially after I know it's hard. arguments and stuff that i've had with them on my episodes I I try I at least I recognize them after I mean I know it's after but. that's Okay, for I wouldn't even recognize it. ruins, it was happening."
527.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
12236.0,Patient,or I wouldn't even know it was a manic episode or whatever I would blow it off.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah I think that's a huge step for you to like i'm glad that you're recognizing and you know what it's after the fact, you can always go back and evaluate it and go, you know. i'm sorry like i'm really working on this and it's just taking me some time to recognize. You know that that wasn't appropriate, and you know i'm i'm gonna i'm keeping track of that so that I can catch it sooner, the next time yeah yeah yeah good good deal all right lady, will you have a good rest of the day and. They see to. In grew up okay here. All right, this is to wrap up the individual session for Angela harass continue to see her twice a month i'll keep her at a low suicide risk assessment.
