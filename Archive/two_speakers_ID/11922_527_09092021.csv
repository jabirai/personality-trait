Okay cuz i'm you my friend, we were walking around town and we saw that my elementary school that I used to go to like the gate was kind of open. So we started walking around and stuff. And then we like we didn't want to take anything that wasn't our intention and we found like one of the auditoriums open we started looking around in there. found like a. Like a drawer full of candy it's about all we to the only took like a handful. I guess we tripped one of the alarm. at school, so you know they had to take us in spent the night in jail and all that. Okay, I have a court, the October 27th. Okay, and my friends, is the day before. and I just don't want to do, I called like the Defense attorney that like came in the mail and it's a lot of money. and yeah I mean I guess some good news is I might actually have a job I took my food handlers test and I."

11922.0,Patient,"yeah i'm i'm hoping like. I don't know i'm hoping I don't get any jail time that's what i'm like I don't care if I get community service or fine or anything I just don't want to. You know, do time. And i'm hoping that doesn't happen because i've never been arrested before i've never had. Like anything like that happened before."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so what was going on, that you guys. wandered in there."
11922.0,Patient,Knowing that oh. yeah so.
527.0,Provider,Knowing that that you probably weren't supposed to be there.
11922.0,Patient,"I don't know I just get like I just get really excited and. You know I knew it wasn't a good idea of it was like yeah like this place is so cool like I missed this place i'd love to show you around like all my old classes started walking around. will get it wasn't open, there was a plastic hangar in between like where the thing was supposed to close. I don't know what that was about that. I mean obviously i'm in there, but. I just wanted to look around and kind of reminisce a little bit. And then, Simon is playing."
527.0,Provider,"What time of the day, was that when you guys were there."
11922.0,Patient,"It was. Like two or three in the morning, we take like night walks sometimes. Just during that time we were like having a lot of trouble sleeping and stuff."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. You talk, did you talk to the lawyer."
11922.0,Patient,"No, I only called to. You know they asked me like what I was charged with and what evidence, they have and they told me like i'm I do jail time but to actually get the lawyer i'd have to do like these money payments, which are like way too much."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,I guess I need to call somebody else but. yeah i'm afraid that i'm like the the appointed like attorney that you'll get like when you're in court isn't really going to do anything that's what i'm most afraid of.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're me mean your public like public defender."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah I don't really know how this stuff works, but i'm Okay, and I know like if you can't afford a lawyer, like you can get. Like one appointed to you or something. yeah that's what i'm afraid of. Like might not work."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, but it certainly sounds like you need to get somebody whether. So you know it might it might be worth just calling and seeing if you can get connected with a public defender and have a conversation with them and get a better understanding of what. role they play and. You know what they would do to be able to help you through this process. So also one mom say about all of this because you're living back with mom right."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah um yeah she wasn't too happy. Just telling me like. Remember what she said. yeah she just like like you Fuck that you tell the judge you fucked up and everything. And she's like you need to arm the column attorney and, like all this stuff that i'm already doing. So you know she's she's gonna help me out as much as she can she can't take me to the Court date but she can at least help me get an uber there. Well, yes she's not happy, but which is not like.

11922.0,Patient,yeah I tried getting one up closer but that's all she had a blue ball.
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah because you know she she's not going to be able to know what's going on with your meds if you're not taking them. Correct yeah okay so she won't be able to.

11922.0,Patient,I should let her huh.
527.0,Provider,His mom home right now.

527.0,Provider,Okay yeah because I think probably haven't mom supervise your meds for a while um do you have any old medications.
11922.0,Patient,them know. I bottles out like this little place at walgreens I could put my.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I was gonna say if you had old medic all medications maybe getting getting those disposed so that they're not around the House either."
11922.0,Patient,"I think. The ones I take in the morning, like they won't hurt me. The sleeping pills I don't even get anywhere in the last time I went to walgreens for them was like a month ago, like I don't even take them that's why I don't even know where they are. Okay, goodness."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're gonna mom do your meds for a while. Okay."
11922.0,Patient,And I usually go with her to get them so. Okay.
527.0,Provider,Does she know that you've been having the suicidal thoughts.
11922.0,Patient,"um she knows i've had them before, but I don't know if she's I don't really let her in on what's been going on this past week. Okay um well she didn't know if frickin punched a hole or she saw that."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you need to get do you need to fix that."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah well, she said don't worry about it, but I want to. Like when I get my first paycheck help out with that."
527.0,Provider,Probably here.
11922.0,Patient,"yeah cuz she's trying to get the House fixed up again now, now that the boyfriends gone. So."
527.0,Provider,So what else do you have I mean Do you still have your safety plan that we put together faith.
11922.0,Patient,"I don't even remember that. You know. I remember the last time you told me like I start journaling and all of that, like I just I haven't i'm really screen myself over here, well, I even got like a little mini journal. I just haven't started writing it yet. They have the safety plan it's what did I say it was just gonna like walk away like listen to music and take a walk or something."
527.0,Provider,"Now let me pull it up, because I. Might check your email because I sent it to your email."
11922.0,Patient,"Oh, here it is."
527.0,Provider,"That might be good to maybe print off if you can face so that you have a copy hanging maybe in the kitchen, so that you can see it easily or mom can see it so she can remind you to look at it, or use it."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah no I really need to start writing these things down. Okay, like i'm missing appointments and all the stuff."
527.0,Provider,yeah I was gonna say it looks like you're you're. Not doing so hot with your. schedule as they've got you want they've got you needing to go to group three times a week it looks like.
11922.0,Patient,Three times.
527.0,Provider,We went huh yeah because you've missed because you've missed appointments.
11922.0,Patient,"Oh, every time i've. made an appointment like these past few days, I just remind me to go on Monday or was this something that was done today."
527.0,Provider,"i'm now, so it looks like because there's been. Looking to see here. yeah so once you have so many no show appointments that you miss, then we look at increasing your intensity of care. Because usually that's kind of a sign that you're struggling a little bit more, so we you know, try to get you in more groups during the week to to give that extra support so they're called care intensity groups, so you probably need to hit a couple of those."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah nobody's told me about those so far. i've only been reminded, about Monday."
527.0,Provider,"Groups okay so you've got month your Monday group and then. yeah so you might want to call or get Ahold of the virtual clinic and and find out when. When the care intensity groups meet which ones, you can you know what whatever works with your schedule. I know I run one on Monday, but you already have group on Monday so. But I know that other therapists happened during the during the week too so. I know there's one on Wednesday. So yeah that might and that might help you just to have some extra support right now to faith, you know it's not it's not a punishment it's recognizing that that you're struggling right now, and so what can we do to help support us so. So that might be something to. To get in place for you, for you, for for a few weeks, and in you know, since you've got a lot of things going on."
11922.0,Patient,yeah honestly.
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah. yeah so they they can. yeah they can tell you what the care intensity group schedule is at the virtual clinic. Okay okay yeah and I don't know if they can email you like the group's days and times as well. But they'll they'll be able to help you with that. Okay. Alright, so let's print your print your safety plan off so that mom has copy you've got a copy, you know hang hang them up wherever you feel like you need need them, or have access to them, so that so that. You know, those are reminders for you. yeah okay. All right. So. What what do we need to be working on. To help you stay on track with things."
11922.0,Patient,"See. I don't know I just need her. I feel like I just need to write stuff down like I was saying, I need to because i'm I get like not distracted but it's hard for me to keep track of. Like even just one or two things honestly yeah. So I think that would honestly help with. My behavior even just a little bit."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,Not being so like stressed out and confused.
527.0,Provider,Do you have I know you said you have a little journal. That you're using but. What about maybe getting like a daily planner for yourself. fail like going like going to the dollar store or something like. here's here's kind of a here's what I have this is what I have.
11922.0,Patient,yeah I saw the planners like right next to the.
527.0,Provider,"Next, one up. yeah, and so this one, you know it's got every day it's also got the whole month. But i've got it like hour by hour, so that I can make, and they have all kinds but i'm wondering if that might be something you know, to help you stay on track with things like do do a daily journal or daily planner. yeah and that way you can keep all your bright heart appointments in there, your groups. Any you know anything else that you need to do."
11922.0,Patient,yeah cuz I have everything on my phone like I changed the little ringtone so.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,"You know i'd probably like recognize it better, but even then i'm still like Lawson over it."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,So yeah I really do need to have things like. In my face if i'm gonna remember.
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah I mean the phones Nice and maybe that's like your backup reminder for your for your daily planner but if it's something that you can visually see and that helps you better than let's try that. yeah. So it sounds like you've got some things to follow up on as far as the legal stuff you know checking in with the public defender.
11922.0,Patient,So yeah so I can just call like my county and no appointment to me and start talking to them or.
527.0,Provider,"Not yeah i'm not sure you probably yeah I would say just contact the courthouse and let them know that you are, you know you've got a court date such and such and then and you would like to get connected with a public defender, you know and how do I, how do I do that. Okay, so, and they should be able to help you with that."
11922.0,Patient,yeah so the fender. flatter.
527.0,Provider,"All right, do you have a piece of paper and something to write with right now."
11922.0,Patient,"um no, but I have my notes on my phone that I can go like or i'll go find a paper like right after."
527.0,Provider,"We went to go grab one right now and we'll write these things down, while we're talking about them."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah give me a minute, though, because I have no idea where."
527.0,Provider,pencil it okay that's fine. i'll give you i'll give you a minute go grab some paper and a pencil or pen OK OK.
11922.0,Patient,"OK, I didn't know that would close the APP."
527.0,Provider,that's okay. alrighty alright so we're gonna make a list of things to follow up on so you're gonna call the courthouse and ask about a public defender.
11922.0,Patient,Right.
527.0,Provider,"you're gonna take your meds every day. And mom's gonna mom's gonna hold on to your meds. The other thing I thought of two phases, maybe you know if you go to the dollar store or something maybe get like a pill dispenser. You know yeah a week thing."
11922.0,Patient,That thinking about that too.
527.0,Provider,yeah that that your mom can use so if she goes to work she can leave just your medications for the day.
11922.0,Patient,For them.
527.0,Provider,"You know, for the morning out in just one day at a time for you."
11922.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,"So that she doesn't have to leave the whole bottle out. yeah Okay, so that that can be an extra safety measure with the medications. Okay Okay, and then. Oh, get your daily planner."
11922.0,Patient,Oh yeah I got that down to.
527.0,Provider,And then sounds like now what we talked about earlier is you know figuring out a plan with David to to move.
11922.0,Patient,"mm hmm because um we already do like have a plan it's just a matter of money. Well it's not a plan plan it's just. You know, he doesn't plan on staying. it's just you know restart but yeah I will go over that with him again."
527.0,Provider,"At this point I don't know that it's helpful for you guys to be living together is my is my thoughts. I mean you, you have a lot of things to work on and living together is not it's not allowing you know that to happen. Yes, just it's you know, things are things are continuing to escalate, so we need to stop that cycle."
11922.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,Is he working.
11922.0,Patient,i'm not at the moment we both been trying to get jobs. Sorry. um well shoot I guess it doesn't help that we're trying to apply for the same things but. there's like nothing else in this town.
527.0,Provider,"You know at this point, faith, I know it's not. Maybe the most ideal situation, but maybe it is best to stay with mom for a while until you get a little more stable."
11922.0,Patient,yeah we are with mom. what's.
527.0,Provider,New for you to stay with mom and he moves somewhere else.
11922.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,yeah i'm worried about getting a car right now that's what I need before I can even move out. So i'm gonna be here for a while.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I know that's hard, because you guys have been friends, for a long time, but you know, maybe, maybe your friendship needs to work better when you're not in the same same House. yeah mm hmm. yeah because that's not that's not helping helping him, you know, trying to help you and things just escalate. into more aggression and."
11922.0,Patient,"You know it's been hard for us to get along lately, especially. yeah when all these the stress stuff comes up."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah.
11922.0,Patient,"he's trying to help out as much as possible. it's. I don't know it's just hard to say, like a separated. When we're mad at each other. As we just want to keep like going. Mostly me too."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11922.0,Patient,"So it's kind of hard for us to both like step back, I guess. Well, we both know that you know what. You know relationship we have it's like really toxic, we do need space and stuff. So it's not like we're trying to. Like stay together. Leah."
527.0,Provider,"Well, good i'm glad i'm glad that you guys see that it's not it's not working for the two of you and and individually. getting things. manageable so definitely need to work on some anger management skills."
11922.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah but also I you know i'm I know that depression, can you know also show in anger too. So that can also be a symptom of depression and I know that that's something that you're struggling with as well, so it kind of kind of has a bad mix right there. yeah and trying to figure out how best to to manage that so. And yeah we definitely need to assess the medications and get a good picture of what's working and what's not working for you. But definitely being able to manage those impulses for you."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's a big one, because. I feel like if. You know if I hadn't got so excited about like seeing my old school I wouldn't have frickin gotten the rest of that night. Because that week, especially like I was having a lot of trouble taking my meds that's why we're up out late at night. yeah. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so. When you got excited to see your school, you know what kind of thoughts went through your head at that time."
11922.0,Patient,"um well we went up to the the fence and I just started like pointing out at stuff and we got to the front office that's when we saw the hangar or the plastic hangar in between the the gate and the lock. And we're like you know no way this is open and I said he's like Do you really want to like go inside like I don't know if he was serious but i'm like yeah like let's do it, like, I want to show you this place. him and I weren't in good like mental state, we still aren't so."
527.0,Provider,i'm really done any substances.
11922.0,Patient,We only smoke marijuana. that's like the only thing that's been able to call me down but it's hard to get my hands on this and I don't have a job. Now i'm. gonna ask my mom through with me.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah so you knew it wasn't a good idea, so what what kept just following through with i'm going to go ahead and do this, even though I know it's not a good idea."
11922.0,Patient,"um. It was just on the back of my head, but it was a bad idea, I was just mostly like because every time we walked by there we've only like seen like outside the fence and stuff like That was my first chance like they can actually show them like on the inside stuff. Like I don't know why I was so excited about that, like really anything. Like."
527.0,Provider,"I mean what was what does that school mean for you, though."
11922.0,Patient,I don't know it's more like nostalgia because i'm you know I didn't have them like I never had like best friends from that school. I was always like kind of by myself in my own thing. So it wasn't like happy or anything that. I guess it was just kind of cool seeing an open and seeing all the new stuff.
527.0,Provider,What was it just a reminder of you know better times in school for you.
11922.0,Patient,"Yes, I guess yeah that makes sense, actually. I was actually doing good in school."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,"Like you know I got all my work done and I know I said I didn't have any like best friends or anything that i'm like at the time, I used to think I did. I played all around the playground and stuff. yeah. When it started getting like to middle school that's when I started getting like really depressed sort of cutting myself for no reason I didn't know what that was about."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,started having like these. kind of like the breakdowns I have now just way like we're mild just. crying really hard yelling If anyone was around me. yeah and that's that's also the year when I started. or when I couldn't like. or when I was having trouble finishing all my schoolwork and stuff.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11922.0,Patient,And then just from there they're worse. So yeah I guess it was. yeah it was like an easier time at that school.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay. yeah when you know i'm wondering if part of it was you know it just for your reaction, you were excited if you know that you could think about some good times. because things have been more of a struggle lately, so it was a way just to impulsively react and feel good for a minute, and it came with some pretty big consequences."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah it was amazing what what we're inside like I don't know I felt happy i'm. Just showing a long way oh we're all my old classrooms where are like you know where we use the lineup for lunch and everything. yeah yeah yeah it was almost like he for a little bit. Those are really thinking about like we can get caught or something, and the reason we got caught this because the auditorium was a lot and like we went inside it and. We opened like a back door, or something like those metal doors. And chips an alarm. Yes."
527.0,Provider,So what do you need to be honest about with the with your lawyer.
11922.0,Patient,"Well, we really didn't have like any intention to steal anything that's, the main one, I think, because we literally just like the COPs found those with like pockets, full of candy. um. We found the gate a lot. No. cuz i'm not trying to make it look like I didn't do anything wrong. Because you know I did. Just that I was really excited about seeing my old school. And then I wanted to show my friend around. We were just looking through doors and stuff yeah. I think there are cameras in that school and. You know my friend was like pulling the doors at the auditorium like oh let's see if they're open and i'm like they're not going to be open and all of a sudden, like I open one in my face is all surprise. So I don't know if that. would mean anything."
527.0,Provider,"So I think you have to prepare yourself for any consequences that may come up this. yeah and you know I don't know how lenient they'll be if this is the first you know first time charge or you know if the school is going to. really want to come down hard, or you know I just don't know what what's going to come of this, and so I think it is. Just asking a lot of questions to your to your lawyer, that you can you know, and if you need to make a list of questions that you have certainly write those down, so that when you have your meeting you can go through those. yeah okay. I hope that they look at everything, and you know, maybe you know because, because the felony on your record is going to really."
11922.0,Patient,You know yeah it looks bad.
527.0,Provider,yeah you know I don't know how much that's going to affect you getting jobs and things like that.
11922.0,Patient,"i'm just lucky that i'm. The day after I came back or like literally yeah the day after I came back from Dale mcdonald's called me back and they're like hey we want to have an interview with you. So. it's not like it's in the system, yet or anything like my bail was zero until. The Court date came up. Okay, so after October i'm. yeah that's what's going to happen. Because I want to go to I still want to go back to school. i'm not going to university get like I want to start with city college. yeah I don't want to work at mcdonald's forever like literally just to get me a car, I was even honest about my manager about that and she's like yeah like you got to start somewhere."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
11922.0,Patient,yeah I don't know. he's even oh yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Oh go ahead, faith sorry."
11922.0,Patient,that's okay um because even the COPs wanted to let us go they were like we're not going to regret like letting guys go tonight right. yeah they call the school and they wanted to press charges.
527.0,Provider,"Well, the other thing too is if you're going to be starting a job you definitely need to make sure you know that you're working with shinto with your medications because. You know I, my concern is if you're not able to manage yourself well that may cause you problems at work to get along with other people or customers. Because that can be you know, a stressful situation, especially you know, during the busier times of serving you know breakfast lunch, and you know dinners and you know when it gets busy at mcdonald's you know people kind of get on edge and irritable. You know, trying to trying to race around and get orders, then so you know I think probably coming up with some tools that you can use at work, whether that's trying to practice your breathing skills, you know counting counting to 10 in your head, if you need to. You know, those are some things that you can do, and nobody really knows that you're doing those things. yeah so."
11922.0,Patient,"yeah cuz when I worked at walmart. I never get mad or anything, it was anxiety that was a bad thing for me like whenever I dealt with. like mad customers and stuff like um I just start getting shaky like i'd want to cry I can't think."
527.0,Provider,And stuff.
11922.0,Patient,"And after I get my manager like to come deal with it, I burn off to the bathroom start crying. Okay yeah. yeah I just have to work on my anxiety for work and my ADHD if. that's what really like ruins me."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, are you on any medication for your ADHD."
11922.0,Patient,"i'm taking wellbutrin but it's like a starting dose it's only like 150 milligrams. Okay chantelle said it was supposed to like help me. Like start getting up and doing things that's what she thought. Okay, like what helped me but i'm attention it's the same or it's not they're actually."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. Alright, so let's get consistent with your meds and that way she'll have a good picture in the next couple weeks of what's working and what's not working, and I want you to I want you to use your Journal and do do some like mood journaling you know. What like daily like. You know and. You can do it whenever you want like just kind of you know whether you want to just kind of do a check in with yourself throughout the day and write some. Some comments down or how you're feeling, or if something triggered you or you know how you reacted or how you handled it well you know, maybe, maybe doing some of that and then. You know that way we can kind of see you know what's going on throughout the day and where where your mood is throughout the day too. yeah okay."
11922.0,Patient,yeah it's hard to like figure out where. You know the anger starts. Like by the point it gets bad I can't even remember.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so so that's what we're going to use your journal for we're going to kind of over the next, and I think I see you next week anyways so I want. will check in on it next week and see how you're doing with it Okay, and then.
