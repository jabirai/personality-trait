13987.0,Patient,I need to wear a mask that's that might be the only thing.
214.0,Provider,"wow the mass may be the same. Reflection is destroyed because we kind of feel it's impeded, but we know it's not we feel it's restricted, and may it may help. At the same thing. Okay, all right, what else."
13987.0,Patient,"I could do the three sites to sounds in one smell. yep need to i'm going to take a break every 40 questions use the restroom get some water yeah make sure, make sure I didn't really read each question take my time."
214.0,Provider,Oh girl. yeah not not see that's a plan right. Whether you're going to exclude to the campy and get the best to what. But have a strategy of what you're gonna do before because everybody waits till they get the exam and all those strategies go.
13987.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good. that's a great plan. Great plan, I think. I don't know how you feel about it, you may want to do, do not disturb on your phone from the onset of waking up. yeah just and don't even make it the immediate context, like because I don't you know, I know, everybody is room for you i'm super confident I am but like it, it takes the one friggin message like you're shifting the yeah how to do that yeah so I don't know it's just a thought."
13987.0,Patient,Oh yeah no I like that i've done that in the past.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I do that well I do that when i'm driving I do that you know when it's family time no electronics only so it does this is my routine, this is what I do when I do it. And it it, you know. it's like oh just give me a second, let me look at it, I won't even do that because the phone doesn't go off and then everybody knows. I mean the with my family i'm driving and you know you just not gonna get a hold of me right now, and I think. Just for tomorrow, I think that that's employing, this is the game, this is your game right. Right, we got to put we got to make this one here and we got to put the primary to the testing is primary this is secondary right just focus focus focus focus focus I think you're going to be spot on."
13987.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm i'm excited to you know. Like i've been getting good scores on these practice exams I think i'm prepared and i'm looking forward to like being able to breathe for a second.
214.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely. You got to feel like the whole like a you probably feel like you can't even articulate the cartlidge it probably feels so restrictive, you know. But the belly breathing would be good for that you know. Is it just that expansion yeah and listen, this is that everybody goes through this how they manage it, and I think you know. I would still do the straw, because you could do the strong when you go to the bathroom for the break like I would still have it in my back pocket, I would still utilize that as a coping tool like break glass in case of emergency."
13987.0,Patient,Right right true.
214.0,Provider,"But I think you're spot on man like I I I am stoked. I am stoked for you, because you've done so well."
13987.0,Patient,yeah Thank you.
214.0,Provider,"Think about just think about. How how you may have felt how difficult this was, I mean you're going into you're going into a profession, where the attitude has to be way above everybody else's."
13987.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Like you're not you know you're you're not pushing numbers you're not doing spreadsheets like. very admirable position in today's society, the accomplishment alone is is super important but that brings stresses and I don't want you to feel that, but I know when you slam this test you're going to be like shit I must have lost like 170 pounds."
13987.0,Patient,"it's gonna feel really good, and you know, like it's gonna be a confidence booster."
214.0,Provider,"All fish listen it'll be one of those like you know wizard of Oz you know you get. This mass you know you get this document and the guy could start doing mathematical equations that's what this is going to be this is going to be that validation for kyle i'm so pumped man, I think this is like. Really i'm very excited about it, I really am."
13987.0,Patient,need to.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good good and and now, what we need to think about this is always primary. And we need to figure out what are we going to do secondary like how are we going to continue. Monitoring or managing secondary that'll be unnecessary ain't gotta worry about that now, but what's the long game, you know what's the long game on what we're thinking and how we're going to manage this, you know."
13987.0,Patient,yeah yeah. After I take this it'll be like another feather in my CAP it's like i've been there i've done that. I managed my anxiety through it all.
214.0,Provider,Absolutely.
13987.0,Patient,"I know, like if another challenge comes like I have more tools to cope with it. I have the experience you know the confidence that i've done it before."
214.0,Provider,"And that's how you got to go to your plus box don't let the negative box run it say wait a minute wait a minute i've been through this. I got this I already I already I already dealt with stuff like this and and and that's it so that feather in the cap is really a good visual about. All the things you've overcome and how you continue to overcome them right right right nothing gets nothing sweeps you off your feet or deflates you, to the point you don't want to operate actually you're more stimulated and motivated to get through it today than you were before. Another feather in the hat like you got many feathers and a hat. I mean tomorrow is going to be the ultimate peacock feather for sure, but shit man you got a ton of feathers from the time I have began with you to not like you've rocked it man you you a Rocker and I really appreciate. your dedication for you, because that's awesome because sometimes people just can't get in them pull it out."
13987.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean it's really important to me that I manage my mental health like i've seen what happens when I don't take care of it, I don't want to go there again. So yeah it's important to me."
214.0,Provider,"I go listen I know it's important to and again it's secondary not primary and we need to keep shifting that down on the totem pole virtually we won't even see it on the screen. We know it's there but we're not even going to reflect it anymore that's how we got it so manage and that's what I want to see because, once you take off in your career, you won't have time to deal with that shit you just won't right. You know your onboarding I don't know how long onboarding is in California New York is anywhere between 12 to 18 months before you even start. an actual rotation so it's just it's more schooling, unfortunately, but what the hell, but it's another it's another marker in that marathon race right I wouldn't stress it, but I think you're doing good so beaches, a great one. Great start off the day. Just don't change anything."
13987.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Too late too late to get to the architect say listen up, we can move this wall it's perfect. Your game plan from the time I started today has been perfect so let's just stay with that yeah."
13987.0,Patient,like that.
214.0,Provider,rockin.

13987.0,Patient,"And they held in San Clemente like 30 minutes from my house, I wanted to go, but I decided not to just like kind of studied and stay home watched it on TV, but it was really cool to watch. But it wasn't sure if, like news made it adds in New York, and it was there."
214.0,Provider,"yeah now we we you know we're very you know if it's not from New York we're anti. I mean i'm not unless i'm a i'm not a sports guy so I wouldn't have done it anyway, but New York is just very bias and prejudice. If it doesn't come from us it's, it must be terrible island it's the cultures that it is what it is, you know right wrong or indifferent, but i'm glad, and I think. You know that, again, so another feather in the hat instead of thinking, this was a need, it was more of a one and you were like I don't need to want anything if it's not a need i'm not doing it. This is my need I need to be right here, because i'm making that my primary so like to the last day you rock this i'm super stoked for you, I know i'm not even worried about it. This is great, but I think the beach. don't alternative and don't let nobody old to your plans, please."
