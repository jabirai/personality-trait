12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,Not what has happened. Right it's what might happen. So it's creating a scenario in your mind. that's not true.
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and so what happens is like you get in this place of fear, because you start thinking about the water."
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,And then that's when the anxiety increases and then that's when the panic grayson's. yeah so when you're in a car. What do you feel might happen that where your mind goes.
12362.0,Patient,"yeah I kind of weird I kind of zone now. But it's hard to explain what what I see in front of me, sometimes I think it's just gonna disappear and everything would like Tom black."

226.0,Provider,It he play tennis.
12362.0,Patient,He my brother or what.
226.0,Provider,Have you ever read any books on anxiety.
12362.0,Patient,not really.
226.0,Provider,This is a really good book.
12362.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,And it's a workbook too. And it's a really good way to understand like have a deeper understanding of anxiety. yeah and it gives you. Like assignments kind of like these work site worksheets that you can. You can do on your own. talks about panic attacks. And it talks about keeping a record.
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So you're really tracking. What is happening. So when you track what happens, you see a pattern. When you see a pattern. It gives you a better idea of what you need to address gives you a better idea of what is probably creating these panic attacks, even though your specific, you know that open spaces and you know that driving a car gives you a panic attack. know. For you it's about really diving a little bit. deeper into this stuff to try and identify some of the. underlying issues. So. There is a talk about really deep abdominal breathing. And these are some things that we can actually like you and I, when we meet, we can work off of this book."
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"It also talks about likening the anxiety scale. So what does that do that helps you. It helps you to. learn that early symptoms like of a panic attack, so it doesn't go into a full blown panic attack. yeah it just creates a lot of self awareness like okay. I feel things creeping in here, what do I need to do. that's where the coping strategies come in. So I think that we can we can work off of this. As. As we do this. And if you like it if this feels like this really resonates with you, I would recommend you get this you can order it on Amazon but let's work let's work through some of it just to see if it's something that you would be open to doing. Because it can it can just it can be like you're like your book, you know, like you're going to. So, here are some techniques that they're describing i'm counting backwards from 100."
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,Take a cold shower.
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,listen to music.
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,yeah so that's going to be really like these coping strategies that are going to be really important for you is these coping strategies are what is going to really save you. yeah. So. When you do. The grounding exercises tell me tell me what you do like describe what those grounding exercises that you did.
12362.0,Patient,The. thing. Or maybe. Even. yeah.
226.0,Provider,Did you did you find it helpful.
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So here's something that I also want you to do when you're doing a branding exercise, I want you to feel both feet. On the floor on the ground, wherever you are. And then I want you to start to like move your feet move your toes like scripture toes and scrunch them and move them around. And then I want you to focus on really feeling your feet on the ground, like you can feel both of them just solid on the ground, so you have solid earth under your feet okay. And then, after you feel your feet on the ground, I want you to feel like your butt in the Chair. Okay, wherever you're sitting now I want you to know like is the is the Chair comfortable does it have fabric. Does it have armrests. My back against the back of the Chair."
12362.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"And then, once you do that, I want you to be able to name five things you're trying to do. You just keep naming those things."
12362.0,Patient,Like.
226.0,Provider,You can.
12362.0,Patient,See the screen people now. speeches.
226.0,Provider,"And you can just keep going around naming each of those things So what does that do that brings you back to the present moment right now. Because remember. When you're having an when you're anxious or having a panic attack your way in the future. you're thinking about stuff that hasn't happened. Yet probably not going to happen, so you want to bring yourself right back to this moment to Center yourself right in the moment. And then. Also, something else you can do that will bring you back is to hold ice in both of your hands. Okay, so if you're really feeling like you're. Having a panic attack and anxious, you can do that. Okay, you just feel the ice like melting in your hands. So these grounding techniques are going to be really important for you. When. When are you agent to identify. went like can you feel like a panic attack coming up on."
12362.0,Patient,Usually yeah. I know.
226.0,Provider,"So. The goal is to be able to stop it in its tracks, or at least stop it before it goes to a full blown panic attack, because what happened tell me what happens when you're having a panic attack."
12362.0,Patient,Problems breathing.
226.0,Provider,You can.

12362.0,Patient,"Where I have to go if I, if I have to go somewhere probably want. To try. As hard, because at the moment i'm living kind of trying to avoid different things."
226.0,Provider,and
12362.0,Patient,To not have to panic attacks. If I if I lived movie normal life i'm not sure how many folks have. let's say like two or three major ones that we.

226.0,Provider,"And then, once it passes, do you feel better or do you still feel a little bit out of it."
