5201.0,Patient,"about a week ago I relapse for about five minutes. And then I realized I didn't want to do it, I start crying and I didn't have no energy, because I was so sick. I know how to use but."
386.0,Provider,"You know, it takes failure in order to succeed, so this is something we can definitely work on what did you use. is rated pharmacies, to the correct pharmacy for you located at. four to five. For the knowledge that you're experiencing you can always use ginger as like almost like a supplement if you have ginger capsules or if, like sugar ginger snaps that the cookie. That should help with some nausea for you we're going to definitely get you medicated I just have to review things here for you, but. In the meantime ginger should be able to help with the nasza unfortunately there's not much you can do with you know hot sweats cold chills. Make sure you're hydrating make sure you're drinking plenty and plenty of water getting electrolytes in. For the diarrhea to stop and then severe like pain and you can always for like any additional pain, I know that withdrawal symptoms are slightly different obviously. But you can always utilize like a bathtub using epson salt soaking in just lukewarm water and epson salt helps with that muscle relaxation that's always an option for you. Just open up your enquiry here cuz I know I message today. alrighty it looks as if currently we have you enrolled in our program and it is for opioid use disorder. And currently your care intensity recommendations are currently you're going weekly to group therapy and then twice a month for individual therapy. But what is being recommended because of the know shows that have happened what is requesting is that we recommend you be seen for group three times a week and then individual therapy stays at twice a month, so. That is what the recommendation is as of this moment, and so I do see here that you are are our own already I cannot talk i'm so sorry i'm scheduled for Mondays Thursdays and Tuesdays and that will take care of that for you. Okay, were you able to go to your care group today."
5201.0,Patient,I didn't have group today oh wait till Tuesday. To. know I didn't know about the Tuesday and Thursday. So what time is Tuesday and Thursday.
386.0,Provider,yeah so Tuesdays is at 3pm Pacific standard time which is at 6pm Eastern standard.
5201.0,Patient,Of what am I.
386.0,Provider,Your Eastern standard so it'd be.
5201.0,Patient,606 so. I haven't had it yet.
386.0,Provider,"I was looking at the three and then the Wednesday is scheduled for. i'm sorry i'm sorry it's Thursday and that one is at. noon Eastern standard time. Okay, and they have you scheduled mark down for those groups. Okay okay. So if you need like meeting ID number or anything like that definitely log into the care navigation vc they should be able to give you that information and the timeframes again. This should also send you like a confirmation email um in terms of that the appointments it looks like your your last checked in appointment was back in September so September 20 and that you're scheduled next on the 11th outside of care group. So I see here the 11th you have group, and then the 14th but you also should have group on Mondays so that is next on the 11th. But what the prescription recommendations are at this moment, because of those missed appointments is that it's recommending that we get a printout for you, for two days only. And so it would be a two day script. With no additional refills and then, when you go to the Thursday group. You can just on you have you should have my number Now you can text me, and I can get another two day bridge out for you just to get hurt okay."
5201.0,Patient,"I do got one question about that. Because I you know I just came back from the doctor and she gave me a shot. And i'm I don't i'm scared i'm not going to be awake for for six o'clock tonight, can I start small."
386.0,Provider,"You can't start tomorrow, but you can definitely start on Thursday, so I think."
5201.0,Patient,there's yeah absolutely I can I can bridge you for the two days for the.
386.0,Provider,"Today, and the six and then on Thursday, when you go to care group message me on either right afterwards I just need to confirm that you checked in and went and then I will be able to do a secondary bridge for you."
