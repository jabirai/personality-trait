I think it's just juggling like my family my. me trying to fix things and the friendships and then school and. So far, so good, we talked about last night, like two nights ago I knew, because I told her i'm calling an hour and she got upset which rightfully because of what I did like she's like right it's like three months now i'm not gonna it's not really going to be like this, I think I just. So that's where we're at we're good she's waiting for me to finish my therapy session wait outside for me to finish it because I told her I opened up to her yesterday because. Yesterday, my dad I saw my dad my stepmom and my little brother and they wrote me a card and they all say me happy birthday at a pizza place called suffers and. That moment I started crying when I looked at all of them smiling at me, and that is me like it's going to want to cry i'm like. I didn't want to be here two weeks ago, and if I left like I wouldn't have been able to celebrate with that. And I was really thankful. And I told my partner. And she's like when did you think about doing that I was like like two weeks ago and she's are from when we broke up and I was like yeah a lot wasn't healthy when it really want to like mentioned that to you know, like but that's why I reached out to a lot of people at. limit their pizza likes see what's like to fix it or like to see what I could do. And yeah me and she's like i'm glad you did it she's like i've been there when you the next day. she's like. she's like no not really but you know what I mean is that I know she's like I really love you and i'm thankful you're here to. Make yeah and I think at that moment really made me realize a lot more of like wow. You know, like a because I had a lot of issues with him up he said i'm smart when I was younger and they said a lot of like main things and they wrote me a really nice card thinking that they said that i'm stronger than they think smarter than a thing. And it really made me like cry a lot and then my little brother card. And then, because I always tell them, no matter what I like if i'm far away, I always think of you and I always still love you I always tell them that you're sure him so he knows, and he told me the same thing, for the first time in my card. And then they just know that I always love you even though you're not here."
705.0,Provider,But it's just so sweet all the way around. yeah wow so you had your birthday already happened.
7560.0,Patient,yeah on Sunday.
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah well happy belated birthday, and you know I mean this year has been a lot of growing for you it's like maybe got all that out of the way and then now here's to a new year."
7560.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. Like i'm just wondering if. I think what i'm i'm scared of now, not that but, like i've been really hyper focused on my weight, but i'm checking myself. Because like I would only eat like a meal a day when I wasn't tessa which isn't healthy reflect like reflection wise it's not good, because I was trying to get like shaking hands and stuff. out because I thought fine I wasn't hungry and then. I weighed 221 within that week of all that, while. That while right I lost an entire pound and then Now I will way to 22.8, this is the heaviest i've ever been they look in the face and i'm like oh my God have Vanessa really does love me and she's like you know it's just late and it's okay. Exactly yeah."
705.0,Provider,"something about it Alex and that's what you're trying to maintain a healthy weight, because the other other like not eating is not, as you know, healthy and you don't feel good."
7560.0,Patient,"yeah. So that's what. I saw lady doing passed on take talk now that I want to do that and I thought about it and then she's like if you have an eating disorder don't do this. Last year, they Okay, but she says it maybe not so because i'm like I think like getting a juicer a vitamix timeline wants the most expensive things I don't know why. But i'm also. I think i'm a little more. In tune, I guess, because of it, so really wants to like like if i've done it yet or if I need to do it. But besides are asking me it's because i'm. yeah it's just noises or life but for me like i've always been like that, like I can't stand certain pitches I can't be in a room like that or, if I have to be in it, I get really angry and they get irritable and I get pissed off so that's why I worked your plus. And when I work. around the House and my mom's house, I feel so much better their lives just quiet I don't have to hear anybody I don't have to hear anything I don't have to deal with that are like when my house I just go upstairs in the bathroom i've noticed I do, that a lot I just I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"You know that about yourself, though, like you saw the issue you know that you're like since hearing sensitivity. And you found something that's working for you. yeah sounds like good news to me."
7560.0,Patient,"lead to. yeah. Other than that isn't very good. Have a house Keegan. And I have the clicker to get in and out so she's in the Texting while she's here, so I can click her in. And look at the babies they bought and."

7560.0,Patient,Oh yeah they're both yeah they're both like they're only like five months old but they're like they grew so much.
705.0,Provider,"yeah wow. You know Alex you have just been like he said, and that roller coaster and i'm glad that you know, sometimes we're pushed in a direction where. This can be looked at it like maybe the opportunity for you and Vanessa to grow as a partner, you know partnership. wouldn't be there had this not happen, and then now you're working on yourself she's working on herself and then coming together as a partnership and seeing if maybe this can even be better than it was before."
7560.0,Patient,"yeah that's the world before. We even made a new playlist for us because we had a playlist and we were long distance and show, should we made another one for a new start for us to listen to and i'm gonna ask some songs do it super millennial I know it's like an updated version of the CD the CD gift or the tape."
705.0,Provider,"yeah the eight track tapes. Yes, and."
7560.0,Patient,"I was very transparent because I didn't think about it, so my teacher bought it up. About he's like you know, I was like oh shit yeah I didn't have a place to live for a couple days I literally had like. All my stuff crammed in the car and I still have to go to school, that I still had to. I had to take care of my sister, and then I felt so guilty with my sister and I sit in the front seat, but I literally threw away all my patients I just threw them next to the. trashcan at the apartment complex that my mom so so people can get him, but I was just so overwhelmed and then I had to clean it I cleaned it out and I impact everything before my mom said I could stay with her as an art."
705.0,Provider,You new mom would come through.
7560.0,Patient,"yeah cuz it's only right now, three of us in the one bedroom again, and so, but Vanessa said, like this is my home so i'm. Slowly or just taking it really slow and i'm not gonna be like oh yeah can I come back after what are you not me.

Friday Saturday Sunday. Thursday night Friday Saturday Sunday. And just rest all the fun things until we grow and build the Foundation."
705.0,Provider,Is there any discussion on couples counseling.
7560.0,Patient,and That is my job to find some I don't know to do that.
705.0,Provider,The couples counseling. You know I have seen before. yeah i'm pretty sure what the therapists that are like specialized in couples counseling I can put in an inquiry that's just how we communicate within to see.
7560.0,Patient,"And then i'll ask Vanessa because she likes infrared therapy and i'm like. Okay, so i'm going to just try and see i'm just because I know that bright heart health, it would be like Nice and convenient be like so i'll see what she says."
705.0,Provider,yeah there's usually two I mean you can call like the Center you're in La no pasa dina. dina I know la.
7560.0,Patient,"They have like a like a thing, where it's like $100 per session and i'm like Okay, we could split it 5050, but I just wanted to see yeah like I found two so far, but I. isn't a lot."
705.0,Provider,I will check on this and to it's good for you to get you know different resources and then you and Vanessa choose which one you feel like is the better match for you as a couple. Where it's not just her way or your way it's like well let's talk about what we like. or don't like.
7560.0,Patient,"Trying to do i'm. Schools good I love my classes my teachers are great I wrote them an email with the knowledge going on and that's i'm playing catch up this weekend. And because I have done literally I wrote out the assignments on my notebook I have them on Google docs but did I turn them in yet no because my mind's been racing with all this other crap my head. And i'm just like like my best friend jazz and wants to hang out with me and then I was like I gotta go to pasadena and then by foreigners like why hang out with your best friend, you have feelings, for her, I was like no I don't because she's never met JASMINE. And she's married to my sister, and she was literally my sister. my sister and her were together for like seven years um I know I was like I think this is escalating I think we should talk about it over the phone too much like it's a simple question Alex. Yes or no, and I said no, I don't like my sister in law, so I think other than that, like Vanessa gets like kind of feisty when she's mouth. But we talked about last night, and I really like kind of hurt me your little feisty like not that question, I was like that's fine well when I told him like i'll call you beforehand and she's like you're not my coworker you don't need to make a schedule of me just call me I was like. I was like I told him like I think you're mad, so I just didn't respond back to that and I told him I would do you know what i'm trying to say I was like I was trying to let you know that hey. Like just a heads up to make sure that you're not busy slide but you know my staple I just want you to be more. An issue take the initiative she's like that's what I was trying to say I said Okay, but yeah so she knows what she's like yeah I was being a little feisty."
705.0,Provider,"And you're like okay so we're working this out, but that's you know now that you're like coming back and you're like sharing with her about what's coming up for you, is it a different experience now and engaging in this partnership."
7560.0,Patient,"Oh yeah because before I wouldn't even mentioned it, I wouldn't have said anything as like I guess, not because it's the may create a bubble, and my hair like whatever like it's like all this education that's not really unnecessary, you know, like might as well just try to talk about."
705.0,Provider,And the space gave you time to reflect and think about what's important and.
7560.0,Patient,Get.
705.0,Provider,into high gear.
7560.0,Patient,"I think like I think my body's just naturally anxious I don't know what it is, because every time I wake up from a nap. I always get my heart my heart rate is beating fast because i'm like I have been sleeping is less than home. I don't want to look lazy but like she doesn't care she literally doesn't care, but I do, but I was like and I woke up at two o'clock for my nap and I was just in a panic and i'm like Why am I stressed out I don't know why. But i've always been like that, and I was like what. Can I just enjoy a nap Well, I can I wake up the stressed out, oh no. that's one thing that annoys me about oh."
705.0,Provider,yeah and I heard the word that you use lazy and i'm wondering like who who who said you were lazy before was this something that you took and.
7560.0,Patient,"yeah like you're lazy to the map you why didn't you clean the House like you should it like it's more, but I guess it's like. I guess now that I look at it like. sociologically like it, it makes sense because of the atmosphere that you're entering your parents parents and, like my family my parents my parents were both born here but it's more like that attitude of like you can't ask but that's what breaks your body down when you don't rest."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
7560.0,Patient,"I think that's where like like I understand that my head, but I need to decarbonize my own brain. I think that's."
705.0,Provider,"Even the way you just turn that around you just did cvt. That cognitive behavior therapy, where you just switched it around where you said you were lazy you went through all that you had the emotion you reframed it where you're like I guess I just get this because, maybe, where they were coming from. And that you know my body's needing it. So, if your body's needing it and you're taking a timeout. To pay attention to your body what's the new emotion."
7560.0,Patient,Like it's like acceptance or understanding and like it's okay.
705.0,Provider,amazing it's like amazing how you did that quick turnaround and I don't know if you know you're doing it like even um it seems like more automatic.
7560.0,Patient,"I think it's because of therapy with you, to be honest, because it I didn't really get to because there wasn't a session for certain have to keep on canceling a lot of sessions and rescheduling so I didn't really like open up a lot. So I think that's why like with a lot of things you've helped me with because I did read the like I use the feeling's mutual."
705.0,Provider,"Good it's not empowering because it's just like what i'm pointing out may not be the feeling that I, you know because i'm going to happen, because that was accepted it's like no i'm gonna own feeling hurt."
7560.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm doing now um. yeah I think that's my favorite tool, so far, and then they shared my like the action plan thing with my best friend JASMINE. Vanessa hasn't texted me she hasn't texted me and shared the action plan on like on an gave her the phone numbers to on what she could do because she's also going to therapy, but she has tizer. It she's going to do, like a group therapy session, not one. and Jessica she's been going through a lot, because they actually had to give her heart medication for her anxiety. And so I was like here let's do this. Yes, here's the phone numbers."
705.0,Provider,yeah I think I sent you to Alex that anxiety workbook because that is a PDF you could pass along you could just forward it to her. And then the two of you could have friendship over looking at the chapters and start looking at like cognitive distortions and things like that.
7560.0,Patient,"Very cool I know I like I really miss my friend Mr. she's like she's gotten better a lot. I said. Well, we pawns bad she told her that toxic. toxic. toxic. So toxic at the end. tosca yeah and so that's why i'm like let's not be like them or JASMINE she's like well i'm saying is that her thing. From tick tock like has this helped you today, have you been help partner says, like our partners freeze them is trans is great, and he, like. he understands and so he's really patient, although i'm like I gotta stop asking who's who's this person in this home and like dongle fit like sometimes it can be cute other times like if you keep doing it is, it was pushed by patients. Where you say that I just like here let's send us tick tock Let me give you this action plan."
705.0,Provider,isn't it nice to know too that you're not the only one with like relationship issues that pretty much people are lying if they say that nothing like everything's just smooth sailing honeymoon period for like years hmm.
7560.0,Patient,"Like it's a lot of work. But it's a good thing, but i'm just like doing, because my parents have been divorced, and so like I don't really see like what work in a relationship is or and i'm just like. You really got to talk things out and work things out in community take a step back and all these healthy things for it to work. So when I watch real housewives of beverly hills on like if they just want to therapy classes, they wouldn't have all this drama they use the feelings, will it would be better."
705.0,Provider,"See. I know and it's probably a few brought up a filling to them, they would be like I can't identify it because they haven't even had those skills they're like I don't know."
7560.0,Patient,"So i'm thankful i'm thankful, thank you. Absolutely. The nine minutes ago i'm just thankful that you gave with a safety plan and they did it. accidentally now and I just been extremely anxious and that's it."
705.0,Provider,thoughts on Alex I just don't want to skip over that part no other thoughts you haven't had any thoughts of harming yourself or.
7560.0,Patient,"No, not since then it's more of like frustration like just so overwhelmed it I just like I did until my on Wednesday until my Professor she there so hot Dr Anna winget she has a PhD she's wonderful wonderful. and they're wonderful what was I gonna say oh they're like yeah so how's everything and then like it all just went in my head i'm like oh yeah i've been going through a bunch of shit. And I I self inflicted myself to basically not have a home and then I had to go back to my mom's house and then i'm trying to work through though my partner i'm in between homes because myself so that's where i'm at right now. cell phone playful self inflicted. sabotage stupid brain issues feeling issues trauma issues and. yeah that's where i'm at."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, what if we kind of go back and challenge all that thought. Right. it's like now, with all that stream that you just said. have some grace for yourself. What could you do to just and against I call it automatic negative thoughts are ants is changing it into automatic neutralizing thoughts. So it doesn't mean we have to make it all happy all the time it's just neutralizing. Where it's more of a balance."
7560.0,Patient,that's i'm going to therapy.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
7560.0,Patient,"I can't do anything to be honest, because it's just like it's really what my issues are and i'm just like. it's annoying. But i'm help."
705.0,Provider,"Myself exactly Thank you i'm that's where you know, even if you come back to i'm entitled to make a mistake i'm also giving myself permission to forgive myself and to keep moving forward."
7560.0,Patient,i'm just glad.
705.0,Provider,That one. Are you not buying that one you're like oh i'm just gonna.
7560.0,Patient,Like it's good yeah I think I just have to really sit down and say to myself i'd have been doing positive affirmations. that's one thing I thought they would never do but isn't helping me a lot.
705.0,Provider,"Is in creating that list of each day what you did right what you feel good about and like just start feeding yourself, like all of us like hey This is where i'm at in life and i'm going to own this. write it down and keep track. And we're going to feed her so i'm like I have stuff all over my walls, you know dare to be different Gandhi, I like to i'm like which one this is be the change you wish to have in the world, I can't remember which one's my favorite because I have too many, but i'm working on that. yeah it's just about self improvement and meeting ourselves where we are."
7560.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Have you been in a long term relationship before this.
7560.0,Patient,yeah it was really toxic cleaner. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Would you say, then you learn from the first toxic relationship."
