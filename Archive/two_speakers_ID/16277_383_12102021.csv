16277.0,Patient,"Well, I I. Have a split up right now with my husband he just moved out i'm. just been really stressed out for the last couple of years and the pandemic didn't help. But he's bipolar he's disabled and he's very selfish and finally just came to a head that I finally realized that you know this wasn't going to that I was in a toxic. relationship so basically my goal is to actually get better right now, because. i'm a bit depressed."
383.0,Provider,How long were you married.
16277.0,Patient,24 years.
383.0,Provider,that's that's quite a long relationship.
16277.0,Patient,"yeah we We broke up twice. Before and. For like the first time I think Oh, is that a year, and the second time was a year and a half, and I, I said to him after we got back together, I said, if if we can't make it work this. This next time I don't want to do it anymore. And he agreed so recently he decided, he was going to leave in Nice. I was fine with it, I was at peace but. Of course, you know, of course I don't want that to happen, but. I don't know what else to do if he's not going to participate in trying to make the relationship better. So um so that's kind of fresh right now, because he just left."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, when when did he. Did he leave like the last day or two."
16277.0,Patient,He left on the less. He left on the first. December.
383.0,Provider,"And who do you live with, do you live with any anyone or are you living by yourself."
16277.0,Patient,"And my my friend and his mother moved moved in so we'll be living together for at least a year until I can. Until we all decide, you know where we're going to go, so they just sold their house and they needed a place to stay until they buy a house over here, so I was fine with them staying with me since. I knew my husband was leaving so I could use a roommate at this time. kind of keep me. from being completely alone."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. Have you been in therapy before.
16277.0,Patient,"yeah the last time was when my husband and I broke up, I was in therapy for a year. And I was trying to get back to her, but she's so booked up everybody seems to be booked up."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16277.0,Patient,A lot of people want meeting therapists.
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. When this your you and your husband breakup how long ago, was it."
16277.0,Patient,That was. yeah so that was. Like eight years ago.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Right. Do you are you working right now, or what is your."
16277.0,Patient,"um I am on temporary disability. My doctor felt that I needed to take some time off because my dad very stressful on top of you know the situation i'm going through. Plus with health problems it all kind of like came to a head and. So she asked me to get into therapy and I, you know, it was very helpful for me last time, so I thought it was a great idea. And she said that if if the therapist feels that I could use a little more time she would go ahead and extend me so we'll just work with that, as it comes. I think that yeah because you know I don't know what's gonna happen this might not be here tomorrow right."
383.0,Provider,yeah. Do you want to maybe share with me a little bit about what was helpful in your prior therapy or what you found helpful in the therapy that you were in before.
16277.0,Patient,"So the first time that we broke up I didn't see a therapist and it was really difficult that time because we broke up. I that we were going I was going through the recession, at that time I lost my job and I lost my home and my relationship have fallen apart, so that was pretty pretty hard, I never did anything to get help I just ignored it and kept going forward and then. I guess we had split up for about a year and a half, and then we got back together, so it just as you know, it just kept going so Finally, it came to a head, where I just said enough and then. I started seeing a therapist and what was helpful was the fact that I I had never actually been alone. Because you know if I wasn't being a mom was being a wife. Prior to meet prior to this married I was married once before, for 13 years so. The therapist helped me to recognize well, I was also going to al anon because my my my husband is also well, he was an alcoholic and he's supposedly recovering Now I know. yeah he doesn't drink anymore, but you know he still does whatever he whatever he thinks is is helpful to him, which he feels that marijuana is helpful to me, and I do not so that was an issue but I tried to let it go and I couldn't and. I did try to let it go, though I really tried and I never brought it up and. It to me, he was getting worse, even though he was saying that he felt better on it, but he was like at the end, trying to he was accusing me of things that I wasn't doing. And so you know it just got really bad, but she helped me to see that you know I could actually have boundaries which well so did Alan on that I could actually put boundaries down because I was a reacting kind of person. So I learned that I don't have to react, I can think about what I want what I don't want, and I can put my foot down and say no, this is not going to happen here. So I learned a lot about that, plus the other thing I learned was to be comfortable being alone. But then. We ended up. Sorry, but then we ended up getting back together because I don't know we We talked We talked a lot during that time and it just seemed like he was very. He seemed like he was up, for you know the the challenge of changing with me, and that was it was definitely not. Sorry i'm in it, so it was definitely not the case, I felt like he basically just wanted to get out of his current place and he was just telling me whatever I wanted to hear and that kind of went on for six years. Seven years sorry yeah No six years, because it was a year that we were apart, and then we got back together. But that's basically what I learned to do is you know to just. be comfortable in my own skin without having him in the picture."
383.0,Provider,Where do you feel like you are with that now. Being. And and. there's no right or wrong just what is it like for you now to be alone. Apart from this individual.
16277.0,Patient,um well I doesn't feel good cuz that's not what I wanted. Okay.
383.0,Provider,"I think that this is probably going to be, you know. me it's an ongoing sort of endeavor to build. A relationship with yourself in the present moment, as it is you know. Without another person there. or without this person, you know there so that is little things from. The very first thing when you wake up in the morning. You know there's a grief, that is going to be present for a time, especially in the beginning, even if you know it's kind of as what has to be. Because you gone gotten back together in the past, you know, two times. I can see there's that tendency to sort of maybe perhaps to want to. To to be be in Union again, you know. Sometimes, out of the difficulty of what it is to just be by yourself."
16277.0,Patient,"um. I am. i'm gonna file for divorce and I don't want to get back together anymore. I mean, I feel like I. I. I feel that i've done everything I could. And I don't have any more left. I met be and. I do love him, but I won't call him I won't. Make effort anymore. I just I can't because. I told him before he left it, I always feel like he's up. So, as long as I give him what he wants. it's Okay, but as soon as I start putting boundaries down he backs away and that's not what he wants so basically you're he's just in this relationship get what he wants. I can't I can't do. It I can't live like that. It wasn't always this I mean it wasn't always like that, but then again, I met him when we were both drinking, so you know. It was a. It was about. A. Just a little over eight years ago that I. I started to get closer to God and. Also, I was going through the llm program so. yeah it helped a lot but. I didn't put I guess enough boundaries down because he still continued to I guess I just felt like I didn't do everything that I could to save a marriage. And that at finally at the end I just I threw my hands in the air and said I don't have any more suggestions to make this work, so you come up with them and. He came up with some you know some story, but it just never stuck and never did. So. In the end, he he decided, he was going to leave, and I said okay. We just can't seem to live together, because. I feel like he's when i'm with him in the same House I don't I feel oppressed. You know, like. he's manic depressant so when you're high i'm high when you're low i'm you know and it's a lot of work. Man I just I can't when I when he would go when he would go back to. to visit his family he's from England. When he would go visit his family, the last time he went for like four months and. I was getting along just fine without him there. Of course we weren't broken up, but. I found myself like like that year that we were apart, I found myself doing things that I wouldn't normally do you know, taking care of myself, whereas when i'm living in the same House with him I don't care about anything."
383.0,Provider,hmm.
16277.0,Patient,that's why I said I can't get back with him.
383.0,Provider,Are you attending Alan on groups.
16277.0,Patient,"um I do so, I do sometimes but I I go to church. A lot, I will not alive, but I try to go at least three times a week and I have a lot of friends in at my church, not a lot that I share my business with but. I do have some. i'm trying to like do that more, but it was easier for me to convince myself, not to go, then it was to go. Because of how I was feeling. i'm. enema going to say that it was all just him my job is extremely stressful and they just kept adding on more and more work. But I wasn't getting training and I was being thrown into meetings that I couldn't answer the questions for the providers and i'm like you can't keep doing this to me and not tell me what to do you know."
383.0,Provider,"What kind of job, what kind of work."
16277.0,Patient,"I work, for I work for my insurance company. My Blue Shield so I I actually bring providers on as to contract with them and, but I was given was given to. Two new. networks which one was behavioral health and the other one was for adult daycare so I was, but I also did all specialist as well and. They just kept throwing more work at me and then putting the put in putting me in like claims situations, and then the last one was. I was going to be a now a collector because the providers owed them money and they weren't getting the response so we needed to reach out and get the money from them and i'm like that's not my job title. And like you guys are giving me all this work and i'm like not even doing my job. But it doesn't matter because people kept leaving even my manager was. I think I only had her for six months, and then she resigned because the stress of it all just she couldn't take it anymore. wow yeah it's in her case. I used to look at our calendar and i'd be like, I would ask her, how can you do that, because she would have meetings from eight o'clock till five o'clock and I said, and then they expect you to do your job to she said yeah and i'm like. Well wow and so six people left during the first during the year that I went to that department, because I was in a different department before that. But when I got there six people left and every time somebody leaves they add more work to your plate, but they haven't hired anybody so it's like I can't keep up with this. Especially the parts that you don't train me, I mean, I know how to do hard work and i'm okay with it. But if you're not going to show me what to do, or you know where to find the answers, and how can I do a job, you know that I don't know what i'm doing. No be held accountable for it as well, it doesn't anyway, my point was is that. Between that the pandemic and my husband and that at right around the pandemic time my son came home to live with us and he's also bipolar. But he came home because him and his girlfriend broke up and he had been with her seven years and they have a child and so he was extremely depressed and he had wanted before tried to commit suicide. And so I was a bit worried and I took a little bit of abuse verbal abuse from him but. He finally got better and and he went in I encouraged him to go get help and he finally got on medication, he has a therapist and. He story so much better today and I I was trying to encourage my husband and tell him look he has the same thing you do I mean there's different personalities right. But he went and got help and look at him he's doing so much better, but my husband's the type person that. When he doesn't want to tell the doctor anything like if the medicine is not really working and i'm like the doctors not going to change your medicine, if you don't tell him what's wrong. He never listened to anything I said so between him and my son and the job and the pandemic it just all caught up to me."
383.0,Provider,"And now, your son is still is he's still residing with you."
16277.0,Patient,"know he moved out a while back. He moved out and then my husband took over that room here, then we basically didn't sleep in the same bed, we have we didn't have sex for. Eight years and then all of a sudden, he started smoking marijuana and he thinks that he can now you know have sex, so we tried he couldn't and i'm like yeah it's not working so. We just stopped doing that, too, and they slept in the other room, but there was more than one reason why because he likes to sleep with the TV on, I do not, I, like the fan on he does not he smokes I do not, and I can't stand the smell of it."
383.0,Provider,"Well, thank you for sharing all of your this with me and helps me to know more about you and what you're going through on. If you one thing that I think might be helpful, just to kind of brainstorm or so daydream about. kind of creating the life that you want. And what that looks like you know what that might look like. You don't like smoke, you know um. You know just what what are your interests, what is. How do you want. Your life. As an independent person."
16277.0,Patient,"Well, at this time I am applying for other positions because because of the pandemic it's giving me the opportunity to possibly change careers. I kind of emerged out with it, but i'm so i'm thinking, let me try something different, and and thankfully right now, I think it might be a really good time to try something different i'm just waiting for for to get my hooking to somewhere. So um. So I have my resume out and. I even got a call from one from one recruiter stating that she had a job for me. And it was going to be remote and then I would go to the office when I asked her where she said North Carolina I told her I live in California and she goes Oh, but your resume says nice it's yeah but I was only there for a short time. And I was applying for positions in North Carolina to see if I could you know get something, but nothing came through so I just. went ahead and came back to California and I got a job here. Because I was staying with a friend over there for a little bit well well my husband and I were broken up, and it, it was very helpful for me to. You know, it was very helpful for me to get away from everybody and everything because i'm also growing up in an alcoholic. Family they're all my family's alcoholics except for me so i'm i'm i'm you're codependent."
383.0,Provider,Where did you grow up where did you go.
16277.0,Patient,Where did I grow up.
383.0,Provider,yeah we were.
16277.0,Patient,In California. yeah in. The long beach area. I see Los Angeles.
383.0,Provider,"yeah so you mentioned that you're looking for perhaps a new job, but right now you're on temporary disability. So, in a way that kind of gives you an opportunity to maybe look and see what's out there. For you do you. struggle with motivation to do these kinds of things."
16277.0,Patient,"yeah it's been really hard. it's like I said when being in that in that whole situation for the last couple years. Like I said it was so much easier for me to convince myself that you know I didn't need to go anywhere do anything, and all I do is just work, you know, and I was working I would work from eight o'clock till seven o'clock every night every day. um."
383.0,Provider,Was that due to. The job needs or just kind of escape your.
16277.0,Patient,"Well, I think a little bit of both yeah we're definitely job Nice, I mean there's yeah so backed up on yeah so I mean I was taking on way more than I needed to but. I think it was I was just trying to get away from the life situation in the House, because I mean i'm there 24 seven so and he's there all the time cuz he's on disability, so it was just not a good situation um."
383.0,Provider,you're working remotely.
16277.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. Okay yeah yeah but recently they told us that they sent a letter out saying that everyone has to be vaccinated or I guess we're not going to have a job if we don't get vaccinated."
383.0,Provider,and Does that mean that you're going to. need to go back into an office and I mean you need to be vaccinated in order to go into the office. yeah okay. And is that is that something that you don't don't want to do or. I see.
16277.0,Patient,"I don't want the vaccine I The more I read about it, the more I look into it and where I don't want it. yeah I have my thoughts in i'll break it down as simple as possible, I feel that it's like a flu shot a it might work it might not and I don't want it. I don't take the flu shot, why do I need to take this vaccine I don't know if i'm going to get it and i'm just going to get it. yeah i'm not going to take the vaccine, so I will when i've talked I have talked to a couple of recruiters and I guess, the first thing I asked them is if Do I need to have a vaccination and they said no, well, some of them do, but some don't if you're in healthcare, yes, you do. So, like I said that's that's a motivation right there to look for something else. But I I don't think that it's good I think eventually they're. going to stop trying to mandate it because there's a lot of people that don't want it. We shouldn't be made to take it if we don't want it."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. well. that's definitely probably a factor for you and looking for work or in creating your life, you know as you start to envision it. Because you're going to have you know you're going to have your you have this opportunity and that's also a way to look at things when, if we look at how we're looking at things you know and kind of reframe reframe your situation and and see that well it's an opportunity for you to. To create a new life. Do you feel like you are committed to the area that you live in and you have friends in that area, and you are wanting to stay working at from your home. remotely if you can where you live."
16277.0,Patient,"yeah i've never had a problem, working from home that never was an issue for me, I used to do, years ago, before the recession hit I was, I was in nursery cruder so I worked a lot of worked a lot of startup companies and I I just learned it really well and. So I started working with startup companies and they did well so some of them, I would have to work at home because there they didn't have an office yet. And so I never had a problem, working from home. As a matter of fact, I work more when i'm at home than I do when i'm in the office, because they only let you stay, you know, a certain amount of time in the office. So yeah no I won't have a problem with it, but I don't mind going into an office either you know I don't mind doing that. And i'm open to either I just i'm not going to take the vaccine, so if if it's going to have to be remote than then i'll be fine with it."
383.0,Provider,"I see. And in terms of your location of where you live in southern California, is that you have your son nearby is that area geographically speaking, an area that you I mean you don't want to move to North Carolina. or something. else in them okay."
16277.0,Patient,"yeah no I like it in California. I like the weather there's much better. My son lives there too, he lives in not with me anymore, he has lived with me for almost a year, I think he he lives nearby those and he has a daughter she's about to turn five and she's just my joy. yeah So when I get to see her it's all about her. And I have a brother that lives nearby as well and i'll go visit him like once every every couple weeks or once a month. And I have a close friend that lives around the corner from me like about five minutes away striving and. And the other people my Church is like 10 minutes away so you know I can meet everybody there. Because they have a lot of functions, especially for women like women's Bible studies, I love that and I know, everybody in the group so it's it's nice to just see their faces and. chat with them and all but also be doing a study."
383.0,Provider,yeah. that's something that you're participating in ongoing the Bible study.
16277.0,Patient,"yeah so. So when I wasn't feeling the way I feel I was. I would do my study I would do my because they give you a book with like you would do your homework and then we would go in and talk about it, everybody would you know give their answers and stuff. I found myself doing less and less of it and just just sometimes going sometimes not knowing like I said I was I could convince myself, not to go very easily. And it was getting like too often. yeah it's."
383.0,Provider,"You with that now, how are you are, you still. empty space."
16277.0,Patient,"i'm still going, but I find myself, maybe going once a week, if that. A lot of times I just do it online, which is not the same. mm hmm you know it's not the same being around other people."
383.0,Provider,yeah. How are you in terms of just day to day. schedule and routine maintaining you know sleep schedule and getting things done around the House and. How are you yeah so that's one of the things that I knew right away was.
16277.0,Patient,I I was looking in my I was looking around in my Room one night one day and. I saw. My dresser was just packed with stuff and I had paper plates and napkins sitting there. And that's just not who I am so I knew I was depressed at that point. But just because you know it does me know how to get out.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
16277.0,Patient,"or. You could get out, but you need help."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well it's good that you reached out for that help. You know, I think. Do you do any journaling do you ever write or just kind of."
16277.0,Patient,"I used to. I used to I used to do a lot of stuff but yeah yeah, I think, just like I said when I when I live with him I don't do much of anything I just feel. Like his depression is just weighing on me and I feel depressed over it, you know so it's kind of like it's kind of like this dark cloud that follows me around. And um and he just recently left so you know i'm still trying to get out of that cloud."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. So I think little things like. Maybe, looking around you can tell me if this sounds like you know, please feel free anytime with I make a suggestion and you're like that's not really me. cuz i'm just getting to know you and. But so some of these ideas you know you could take them or leave them. But doing sort of a looking around your room and or your living room and just kind of seeing do you want to move anything, do you want to like get rid of a table or get some new pillows or you know get rid of some old magazines, or just start to do some changes in your environment. and start to do some like picking some stuff up and getting rid of some stuff and pressuring are getting you know, maybe. Even you know if you're on a budget to Stephen going to the local like target, I would not target but tj maxx I just went to her, and you know just getting a couple of new whatever you know. To kind of create some freshness and and change and in your physical environment, what does that sound like to you."
16277.0,Patient,"It sounds really good, and so I definitely Am I was looking around in the living room and I thought I would like to get rid of some things and change up some things my bedroom is my bedroom that wasn't. His. It was mine, so my bedroom is fine, I have everything I want in there, but yeah the living room was definitely ours, and he took some things and I want to get rid of some things so um. yeah it's a good idea."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah good.
16277.0,Patient,"I just haven't like done it yet, because you know, like I said it's just it does happen. I have to convince myself to get on it and get up and go and do."
383.0,Provider,"Well, one way of making it maybe a little more less drudgery is just go to the go to tj maxx you know and just like look around and like just think too, so you do need a new. Tell or maybe a couple of pillows or maybe there's a picture that you like or an inspiring you know that this like inspiring little just things you could put on the table, or. You know and see if there's anything that kind of grabs you and and let yourself get a couple of things you know and then go home with those things. And then you can start to maybe take some things down, you know and replace them with one or two of these little inspiring little items that you've got. Another really great thing to do, sometimes I know it's a lot of work is like to repaint a wall or something like that. And just to kind of start to initiate outwardly something that correlates with this change that happened, you know if it's to get a couple. of new plants and put them, you know by your doorstep or so that it's not a change just a loss and letting go, but a change of like a new beginning."
16277.0,Patient,yeah that sounds great.
383.0,Provider,yeah so shall we make that like maybe goal for you or like a little homework assignment that you can. turn our next appointment.
16277.0,Patient,Getting rid of stuff yeah definitely but painting now.
383.0,Provider,I know that's a big nah.
16277.0,Patient,"yeah and, eventually, I will get some new I actually have some paintings that I done in a long, long time ago that I haven't even put up so that would be nice to just put my own stuff up. yeah so I definitely could do that but I mean, as far as getting rid of some stuff yeah. i'll work on that."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay great do you want to focus on any room or hallway in particular or.
16277.0,Patient,Particularly the living room.
383.0,Provider,living room okay yeah.
16277.0,Patient,"So the other, the other bedroom is. being taken by you know the roommate so. yeah that's that's basically the only room that I need to work on and the kitchen is just the kitchen, you know it's not there's not a whole lot in there it's just the toaster you know microwave that kind of thing."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay good. And then do you want to commit to. Maybe to. support groups of your choice a week. Like whether it's Al anon or the Bible study group I know you have a group with bright heart health as well. So you've got that.
16277.0,Patient,"I definitely am going to continue going to church and at least once a week so. that's one, and then the group with you guys is once a month. And the Ellen on I can do that also online I can call them and they have phone meetings or zoom as well. Right now they're. Right now they're doing zoom."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, you know i'm seeing here that your group frequencies weekly."
16277.0,Patient,"right they they Okay, so when I first got when I first. spoke to the girl about the cost of money for with my co payment. I was told that it was $30 for the group, but then, when I went into the group I was charged $60 so I thought it was a mistake and I called in, and they said no. it's $30 for the nurse and $30 for the therapist and I thought that's just ridiculous, because here, I have one on one with you for 30 Why would I pay 60 for a group there you know, a group meeting it doesn't make sense, I can do that and that went on for free. So I told them that I would not, I would not participate weekly I could do it once a month or I will just not do it, because then they agreed that I could do it once a month."
383.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and who did you speak to about this."
16277.0,Patient,jet jet area gee what's her name her chair jarrod think her name is she's one of the girls who takes the payment.

16277.0,Patient,Yes.

16277.0,Patient,"And then I see the nurse. Once well, I was supposed to see her yesterday, but she was I by the time they got they got me through it was already too late, so. They rescheduled me for the 12th of January, so I won't see her again until then, but I will see her in the group meeting on Tuesday so that's when I can talk to her about it."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, I just encourage you to since you are only going to group one time per month that when you see her. That you really get all of your needs met with regards to your medication refills and that squared away for you, but."
16277.0,Patient,"Right and that's what they told me to ask her in the in the group to refill my medication, so the doctor or my my primary care physician already had me on was beautiful and and all she did was. tanya all she did was up the dose, and so I mean that's why I was letting them know and I don't even know if it's working right now I can't really it's it's not been that long said I would know, sometimes it takes a little while before you know if something's."
383.0,Provider,working right.
16277.0,Patient,"You know, trying to get yourself out of the depression is not. You know, you might feel a little bit better, but not really so right now I don't think I could actually answer the question is it working or not. I know it helps a little, but. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well I think if you add some of these behavioral things like you're going to be committing to your other support groups Allen on once per week and your Bible study once per week. So you've got those other support groups weekly and the made a commitment and you're going to attend and then i'll follow up with you, so at least you have that you know know that there's someone that's going to that helps with accountability sometimes. and And then you're going to kind of think about this as your new life and think about kind of some changes, you want to make in your external environment to correlate with that, and then I just want to ask you about sleep, are you able to sleep at night or is that difficult."
16277.0,Patient,"um yeah I don't not well. um. yeah it's, no, no, I don't know I just I can't and before maybe that's why because before I just had too much on my mind and I couldn't sleep. Even in the day, if I wanted to nap or whatever I couldn't I might literally pass out for five minutes, and then I wake up again, and so we didn't really call that a nap but. It just kind of was so tired I fell asleep for five or 10 minutes, I guess, and then, but my sleep habits at night or bad really bad I wake up a lot, and I mean I drink a lot of water, because i'm a diabetic so I drink a lot of water and. I know they everybody tells me when don't drink so much before you go to bed and i'm like yeah but I can't I am thirsty like i'm always thirsty always want water and so. Sometimes i'll get up like before I go to bed and, like every 10 minutes I go to the bathroom but only for like three or four times till i'm completely empty and then i'll take it, but a drink of water and come back to bed."
383.0,Provider,it's like it's like my throat just needs a.
16277.0,Patient,yeah just need a little bit of water in there.
383.0,Provider,Right right right well it's important that you keeping yourself hydrated. yeah well.
16277.0,Patient,My sleep habits are really bad. Then they've not been good for a while.
383.0,Provider,Are you exercising do you have any exercise that you do.
16277.0,Patient,"No, I mean you know when you're feeling like I do that's gonna you know it's too easy to just eat whatever you want to eat, and you know and the doctors telling me I need to like watch what I eat now that so i'm i'm trying to it's you know. When you're feeling the way I feel it's kind of hard to do those things. But i'm trying. Okay, I think that, eventually, I will get there, but right now. i'm not gonna i'm not going to beat myself up over it, because it's just going to make me feel worse."
383.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think getting a journal, and just jotting down some of your feelings and the journal might be helpful. Even if it's just listing them you don't have to write sentences, you can just write the date and then just jot and then just right just bullet points style and you're feeling like this, and this is what you're going through or you know words you know. and If you have any little insights you might jot that in there just seven opportunity to kind of process which you're going through emotionally. On the page. So let's add that that you'll get a journal, between now and our next appointment, maybe, maybe jot a few things down here and there in the journal, are you okay with that does that sound like."
16277.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'll yeah i'll try to I haven't done that, I mean not for a really long time but. i'll try to do it."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good because you're in the process of grieving a loss."
16277.0,Patient,And yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and starting a new a new chapter so there's both grief there's probably a lot of grief and there's a lot of probably feelings in there that we can get into more you know feelings of. regret, or you know many different things you know fatigue and maybe even some little bit of trauma. But, so we can get into that more, but if you write it down at least you're acknowledging what's what's up for you. yeah so it's not all about like Oh well, let me just eat better and then you know that kind of thing."
16277.0,Patient,So it's more of a feeling things. yeah day by day.
383.0,Provider,Processing what's your feeling what you're experiencing and then maybe I can be to therapy and talking about it.
