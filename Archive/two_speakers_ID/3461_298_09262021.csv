298.0,Provider,"I am well I feel like I have missed you, for months now."
3461.0,Patient,"I know I was about to say I know it has definitely feels like that, especially. I ended up not seeing you and I wanted to apologize for that, by the way, there was a miscommunication about the appointment, I was under the assumption, it was tentative that we were we were holding that's hot in case we weren't able to get in touch, but then. miraculously called in the prescriptions for me and I reached out to blame to thank her and I didn't I didn't think of to mention that the appointment could then be moved back or something I it just was an oversight on my on my behalf, so I apologize."
298.0,Provider,"No worries and it happens to me all the time is somebody will ask me one of the care gaps will say, can you see such and such a patient at this time and then I don't go see the patient. And they said why. Why didn't you go see the patient, I said, because you never confirmed that I was going to see the patient. I wasn't there, so I get it it totally happens. So catch me up to speed, what are you doing in your life."
3461.0,Patient,"Alright, so right now i'm actually i'm full time classes i'm taking 12 credits at DC."
298.0,Provider,No way yeah. wow.
3461.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that was that was you know definitely a huge adjustment, but it's such a great structure and it's a great positive. Environment for for me know, socially, unfortunately, only one of the classes is partially in person partially on zoom the restaurant soon, but it's still a great experience and. i'm taking all classes that both line up with the business i'm trying to build and the possibility of transferring to you see so i'm taking intro philosophy voice and diction which is like a speaking class public speaking. Which is a huge fear of mine that I just decided to take head on, because you know it just seemed extremely relevant to me especially you know i'm here every day doing my physical therapy and. it's essentially my physical therapist and serving two purposes, you know, two birds one stone, and that is it's kind of a silent sales pitch you know, because people can watch. What it is that I do, and you know I don't i'm not selling them on anything because it's just you know you're either interested or you're not and it cuts out a whole a whole. major aspect of how business develops, you know i've handed out over 500 business cards here in two months. wow yeah, and these are like these are, I mean a membership care costs $450 a month to. wow yeah So these are, these are the clients that I would want to get to build a business around, and you know everything i'm doing is with this idea of building a life and the version that I want in five years. yeah you know i've acknowledged that it's not it's not just my programming that has left me. Days didn't bewildered you know it's our society is programming that it's really made us think that we can do it all have it all. We can do it have it all right now, you know this it's really worked the way that I find I think about things, and I see other people thinking about things, but um yeah it's all of my effort has just really been going into. deciphering the vital few from the trivial many and putting my energy and effort very actively towards those things you know things that are in line with my overall goal of bettering myself. super super active dependable member of my household shouldn't really nice i've even heard those words come out of my parents mouse, which is. crazy absolutely crazy. And you know midterms just passed and I had two b's and a's so. i've never done that, before so. And yeah I mean it really just involved a total reassessment of my actions and habits and my goals. I noticed that the majority of my life was tailored to know me myself from my life. And that is everything from my relationships to my medications to recreational drug use to you know everything. And it's not really possible to try and like here's a couple of things to change in a myriad of mad behaviors and expect that. Anything surely going to change in the Grand scheme of things, so I really broke down and everything cut out everything that it means not. helpful to me, you know I set a bunch of strict ground rules like I don't stream anymore, so now I get up at like seven or eight in the morning and I just. I have time and energy to direct my will towards it's incredible it's really been it's been a it's been very eye opening and life changing. One big thing I should fill you in on that I wanted to last time was after speaking with my psychologist I realized that. My I believed my depakote was actually hindering all of this, because I think that that dosage that 1600 is really geared towards helping me deal with a life in a world that I didn't like it to deal with, and now everything's kind of the opposite. i'm sure you can everything's kind of the opposite in terms of very much want to be the only and so active participant of my life and build the best life that I can. So I dropped it down to 1000 and what I still didn't feel like much change, I went down to 500. And that actually I feel like I found my sweet spot and it's it's basically a level where I can feel things a lot more, you know, and I can tap into and harness those feelings that a lot of witches all admit uncomfortable feelings, but it's uncomfortable because i'm not used to. The normal regular social anxieties and you know just everything that people deal with on a daily basis, because I haven't been feeling it so i've been on that. 500 now for about 3030 or 40 days and it feels like exactly where I need to be you know it's not. it's enough that it's not all over the place, like a roller coaster but it's not so much that I feel like I don't feel my emotions it's really about it's. been that tapping into that passion that has allowed me to really be able to consistently apply this effort and energy into all realms of my life."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, I hope I mean anytime that we go down on your meds i'm like. Two thumbs up to you."
3461.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm also tie treating the suboxone dose because I get everything you know. Small bits just but you know just trying to take down, you know milligram and sustain that for a couple weeks and then see if I get to a little bit more. Again, just because you know i'm trying to try to create a life and condition myself in a way that I deal with life head on and not running from it. Then you know between the public speaking the just. A lot of. A lot of my mental state is reflective of my physical state, especially because back in everything. You know i'm still I just got the MRI done a couple weeks ago waiting till tomorrow and orthopedic place opens back up so that they can reschedule me just to be able to read the MRI. So i've really been doing this whole process by myself, I never was contacted by this i'm lucky that I. trained in that realm. But a lot of you know, between noticing the severity of where my body was at so that's the physical aspect to public speaking and just being in so many. realms that I haven't been in before or recently. has definitely Let me move, you know pro into a little bit more anxiety than i'm used to, but I think it's all positive and essential growth. yeah. best time to plant a tree is years ago second best time is right now. I love that yeah and i've been operating the exact opposite of that slogan so i'm trying to do everything I can to operate with it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay let's talk about your medicines, do you still want them or. 15 milligrams at bedtime. Yes, how about that."
3461.0,Patient,"Oh, so the god pan I was hoping I don't know if they have higher dosages but I was hoping to increase it and one of the two ways either a higher quantity. or up the dosage a little bit just because that's been very, very helpful between the muscle spasms and dealing with anxiety, without having to necessarily use xanax. If that's if that's if that makes you uncomfortable don't worry about it, I just wanted to, I just wanted to ask if that was a possibility, the only reason I even contemplated, it was I remember you saying that you're comfortable with that non habit forming and everything, but if. You already feel like where i'm at is enough Soviet."
298.0,Provider,i'll go up on it i'll go up on it and. i'll go to up to 803 times a day.
3461.0,Patient,"Okay, that would be great Thank you so much."
298.0,Provider,and
3461.0,Patient,"Then depakote can stay at 500 but go down to 30 now, instead of 90. yeah and then everything else, the same that's okay."
298.0,Provider,"It is, I mean at some point, I hope that you get motivated that you want to go down on yours xanax."
3461.0,Patient,"Yes, that that you know that's the next logical step in my mind, but between trying to lower the lower box and already and lower depakote I don't want to overload myself but yes, that is around the corner and I could feel that coming, so we will be there soon."
298.0,Provider,All right.
3461.0,Patient,"i'm excited to get there trust me i've just I know myself, and I know my tendency to want to take on more than I can handle and that, ultimately, ends up wrecking all of the objectives. So i'm just trying to. set an aggressive pace, but one that I can logically and reasonably keep up with."
298.0,Provider,yeah you are a. Different person than you were a year ago.
3461.0,Patient,"hey I, I think, so I really do think so thank you for saying that I feel like i'm a different person than I was the day before every day when I wake up and it's such a gratifying feeling."
298.0,Provider,I will email a copy of all your meds so that we don't have to. Get getting you know how what is.
