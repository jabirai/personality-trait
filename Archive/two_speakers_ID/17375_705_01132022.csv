And from from what i'm getting it's basically childhood trauma and like dependency not not being there code codependent issues. And so I don't know this is just what the people over the years have told me professional non professional by you know just just their best opinion of how to help and it's I don't know I just. feel like i'm getting to an age where my mind is slipping and I don't want to be a threat to myself or others."

705.0,Provider,"Wait but that to me again Damien is the more that you get to know like Okay, so now i'm identifying that I have this behavior that I tend to do. here's where it comes from, but. likely, you are to do something different now because you understand it it's like you can see now let you know what I want to change that let's see if I can learn to trust people let's see if I can do things different. mm hmm yeah and we'll go over to a codependency because there's so many different different definitions, though, will work together, and you can come up with your own definition that fits you. sounds good i'm so glad that you already have things on your mind where you're like I want to work on this this and this.
