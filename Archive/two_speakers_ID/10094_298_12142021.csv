10094.0,Patient,"Well, I will be my primary doctor she normally prescribes me. My hydrocodone um but now that I see amy for pain management, she told me just to go through her. I spoken her day and I was like kind of disappointed because I told her you know, especially during the winter time my muscle spasms up. i'm always in more pain, you know when it's colder. and I told her you know it is take as needed but she gives me. Only seven a week. Which is like taking one a day. You know, and I told her that lately like i'll take one in the morning because i'm so stiff and it takes me longer to get moving you know and then at night I normal you know i'll take one. So, but she said that I guess she said, we had an agreement which the agreement was from my understanding is that she would prescribe it as long as I was compliant and came to the group therapy. So I was just a little disappointed because payments. When she know I had to go to the pharmacy they still haven't texted me that it's ready for."
298.0,Provider,She had to then at around 251 yesterday. yeah yeah.
10094.0,Patient,"I had told her, you know that, unfortunately, I was out of my pain medication and. Like the last two days you know i'd went without. She wasn't willing to. Give me no more than seven so."
298.0,Provider,"I i'm impressed she can even do it. Like like i'm just impressed she can do it because I didn't think we could do something like that I realized she's a regular doctor but. It used to be that bright hurt health would not do full agonist opioids so that was kind of a surprise to me but that's okay. Not my department, but let's. Talk about. Your sleep your cymbalta gabba your meds let's talk about your their meds."
10094.0,Patient,"cymbalta my been taking it every day, I still feel like i'm going."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
10094.0,Patient,"I take my flexible to my tries to don't I have not still been able to sleep and i'm taking. Like two and a half, at one time, I took two i'm sorry not to three, to see if it helps because the two and a half didn't work, and I still could not sleep."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so. How much of this cymbalta are you taking 60 milligrams."
10094.0,Patient,My cymbalta. See. Yes to 60 milligrams.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and my concern with you taking three of the transfer down is that it would. It would that or is it 300 milligrams or three of the 50 milligrams."
10094.0,Patient,and I that was of the 50 I did take like one of the hundred and one of the 50. Because I was finishing out what I had left in the 50 milligrams. uh huh that yeah.
298.0,Provider,The problem with that is is serotonin syndrome and it feels like it's a it's a hot fever it's it feels like flu symptoms.
10094.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Now, when we're looking at pain. They recommend 60 milligrams on the cymbalta for pain, but when we're looking at Depression and anxiety, you can go to 120 milligrams on the cymbalta. So. that's something I want you to consider. Now let's look and find a replacement for the transfer down. That is something else, so that you don't feel that you have to keep taking, of course, the thing."
10094.0,Patient,"Right. No my testing pills so like i'll take my like cymbalta. You know when i'm eating breakfast because the treasure don't take at night, you know we try to even a mouth, you know."
298.0,Provider,"mm hmm I hear you. They say that's good because of the serotonin thing, but if the transit zone is not working for you, for sleep then don't take it it's just not working. um. yeah like."
10094.0,Patient,"Like three. three to four and I haven't been taking it just because I wasn't falling asleep like it wasn't helping me. sleep at all, but I was just so uncomfortable because I had any pain meds it. painted down my legs to my feet. And so I called my podiatrist office to because I don't. I just I was just so frustrating, I cannot sleep the pain was just like shooting you know, and it will not go away. And even with me flexing and stretching my my layout."
298.0,Provider,"So I can't give you like. Control controlled meds for sleep, but what I can do is. We can change your medication. We can change your medicine to do you want to look up Doc suppan and see if that interests you some people swear by it for sleep it's not going to be. it's going to be stronger than the transit down but it's not going to be like. A controlled bed. And I can't give you a minute."
10094.0,Patient,"You said, do X API no."
298.0,Provider,that's right. that's right.
10094.0,Patient,"Okay, so just looked it up well that that helps with sleep, because it says antidepressants and nerve pain medication."
298.0,Provider,"yeah we use it for sleep also. If it's used for insomnia. Depression and anxiety disorders neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia and anxiety disorders. Finding the magic dose on this one is a little bit of a challenge. And that I don't know what is. They say start at six milligrams 30 minutes before. 30 minutes before bedtime. And I mean what i'm thinking is at least we should try it, it has some good things about it. But i'm not you know I i'm not sure it's going to work crazy, you know. really well no way to. um."
10094.0,Patient,"I mean. i'm willing to try is just I stopped taking transit on because I didn't want to keep taking it I didn't know how you know I didn't want to up my nose without your permission I know before you said it, you know only wasn't working take two or it could take half. yeah but I was still up to like five six o'clock and then I started to doze off and then by like 7:30am i'm up again, so I just felt like exhausted."
298.0,Provider,"Right, I know you're really struggling. And on the cymbalta at the 60 milligrams because docs the pen um. I oh. I don't think it interacts with the cymbalta. But your doctor the pharmacist he'll alert you if Doc suppan is not allowed for sleep will alert you on that, according to my book here it's okay."
10094.0,Patient,i'm sure I asked them.
298.0,Provider,yeah you would go ahead and ask them to make sure that you can take docs open at night time for sleep and. Do you need it doesn't look like you need a refill on the cymbalta and I want to wait to see how you're doing before we do anything with the cymbalta again. Okay. i've got to go is there anything else you wanted to talk to me about.
10094.0,Patient,No okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you christy."
