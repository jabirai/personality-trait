Yes, just realizing I need another light i'm sorry. OK. So my understanding of today's meeting is that i'm going to be doing a level of care assessment for eating disorder behaviors and or eating disorder treatment and. And that we've kind of done some initial paperwork in terms of surveys and kind of a sense of eating disorder type behaviors so i'm going to be using that, as my frame of reference and. i'm happy to answer any questions you have all go over kind of any treatment history, but really going to be focusing on. what's been done to if anything to manage mood concerns, as well as food concerns and or anything else you think might be some contributing factors."
15873.0,Patient,Okay. So this. More for or her or Do I need to leave do I stay.
107.0,Provider,"it's up to you guys that is really up to you guys to have that discussion and decide if it's appropriate for you to stay because this is an assessment it I need to get as much information as possible, so it just depends on your comfort level if you want mom to stay, then. Then that's fine if you're not comfortable or you feel like you're not going to be completely truthful with me if moms around then mom probably should walk out at some point so it's going to be up to you what you want to do and what you guys. How you want to proceed, but i'm happy to answer any questions first to review any concerns before we kind of get into it, if you want to start there."

Okay alright so in reviewing your different surveys that looks like for the depression survey, you have a score of 18 which would be. Moderate to getting on the higher side, and you have an anxiety score of 14, which is in the moderate range, are you. Does that surprise you, or does that seem like that kind of registers with your sense of kind of where you're at in terms of maybe you feel sad, are you feel stressed out most of the time. Okay, and sometimes for women and for girls being sad can also kind of come off as being stressed out or worried does that kind of resonate with where you're at a lot of times you know just sad.

Okay, so about eight weeks or eight months or six to eight months. Okay. Do you drink water yes. How much water or fluids, would you say you have during the day. Like a big bottle or a little bottle."

So that's twice the amount of time that you, you know, should be doing for your body. Do you ever chew your food and spit it out. Okay, do you ever make yourself throw up.

15873.0,Patient,"um if I make. Like red meat she wanted that. Oh calm my. My other son he he doesn't eat meat, so I buy. Like the incognito burgers you know that. She wanted that either. yeah."
107.0,Provider,"yeah they think they are weird I don't really like them, I agree."
15873.0,Patient,that's pretty much her go to foods is either lasagna or fish or chicken. scratch i've seen that she'll eat.
107.0,Provider,"You have to work extra hard to make lasagna lasagna on a regular basis, my goodness. it's probably pretty tasty, though. that's awesome well okay so has red meat always kind of weird to do out or red meat kind of a new thing."
15873.0,Patient,You think.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, is that because of stuff he researched or. what's what when did, why is red meat. And why why now. Just because one day it just was weird it out, and now you can't eat it. So. Over the last six months. How much weight, would you say you've lost."
15873.0,Patient,Any.
107.0,Provider,lost 30 pounds in the last six months.
15873.0,Patient,it's like about 26 according to her doctor.
107.0,Provider,So how do you feel about that.
15873.0,Patient,me.
107.0,Provider,Either one of you.
15873.0,Patient,"Well, I noticed that she was losing a lot of way that's my about it to her doctors attention she was refusing at that time every everything I would make tea, she would leave the whole plate she wouldn't she was an eating. So that's how we got to hear."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so when did she start eating again."
15873.0,Patient,i'm starting a little more after we discussed it with her doctrine and found out. about the eating disorder and what was going on. After she talked to her doctor and studying a little more.
107.0,Provider,"Okay. So I have the she's, five, six and 110 pounds Is that what you understand things to be."
15873.0,Patient,priceless because i'm five six so she says she's talking to.
107.0,Provider,You guys are the same height. yeah it's exciting.
15873.0,Patient,"But yes, that sounds about right."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you feel like you still need to lose weight. Or that you're still fat. Are you sure. So at this point, are you willing to gain. 10 pounds. What about 15 pounds. About five. Okay what's gonna happen if you gain 10 pounds. Are people not gonna like you. Okay, so you're not trying to lose weight, because you want people to like you. you're just trying to do it because you don't like you, if you are more than five pounds over your current weight. So why does size matter to you. Who are you who were you when you were 130 pounds. How would you describe yourself. You were happier when you were 130 pounds. you're not very happy right now. So why do you want to be this way if you're not happy. What is the advantage to staying at this size, what are you afraid, is going to happen if you are a different size. So part of the problem with losing as much weight as you've lost is that your brain doesn't work well. So this is a really good example of your brain not working well. Because I know you are able to answer these questions and you can't give me answers. So regardless of what else is going on in your body your brain at this at this point is malnourished. Does that make sense, do you understand what i'm saying. So you're going to have a harder and harder time in school you're going to have a harder time being able to keep up with what's going on around you and with your friends, because your brain isn't is is working slowly right now. Because you don't have enough nourishment in your body to keep your brain happy. So it's not going to help you, with your depression and your anxiety which you have a genetic predisposition to having with your brain being in this state. This is only going to make things worse. So you have to be willing to do something different, and if it's hard for you to do something different, then we need to talk about you getting into treatment, where they can help you have a different experience and that may mean going to like residential treatment. Where you go live somewhere. And do your schoolwork and you work on getting better and and and nourishing your brain. and dealing with your perception of what you think is going on with your body. So it's pretty serious. What do you think about that, what do you think about the idea of living somewhere else, while you work on your mental health and your physical health and your brain health. You kind of like that idea is that seemed a little scary. Man, what do you think what do you think needs to happen."
15873.0,Patient,"There surely did try that they had referred us to Stafford the lucile Packard for children. Okay, it was denied."
107.0,Provider,Oh just recently.
15873.0,Patient,"Just recently, just got the letter in the mail really yes."
107.0,Provider,"Once again. Did they say she just didn't meet criteria or something. or they just Okay, do they have a partial hospitalization program where she can go for. 20 hours a week or something where she can be there in the part part of the week, they have anything like that, or is it just residential."
15873.0,Patient,"I think they were going to determine whether it was going to be for her to actually be admitted to stay there, or it was kind of like a Inpatient or outpatient. yeah yeah but. They do yeah."
107.0,Provider,"So when they when they did that they didn't offer outpatient service. They just said, one or the other."
15873.0,Patient,"Right, they just do united completely."
107.0,Provider,"interesting. Let me look at something. Sorry, I. had to note up, but then it went dormant so now, I have to log back in. Sometimes there's kind of some basic math numbers that need to happen. When you get up do you ever get lightheaded or if you stand up really quickly, do you ever feel lightheaded. Okay, how long has that been going on. Like in the last month or so or before that. If you stand up really quickly and get lightheaded. Okay, and did you talk to them about that. Okay, so that's called ortho static, which means that your blood pressure, changes quickly and you get like a light headed. And that would suggest that you are, that would meet criteria for residential treatment."
15873.0,Patient,"They were going three times a week to her doctor in that there they do check that Okay, even with that they they wouldn't take her. We go to the nurse nurses visits and they have they. Have her laid down for two minutes, and then they check. Out of pressure maker stand up for two minutes and I checked it again and she's right now borderline is what the doctor said. yeah so. They they said no."
107.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness well at the very least, you should do outpatient because you're struggling to deal with food. you're not going to listen to your mom obviously you're kind of struggling to connect why it is that you're doing what you're doing, and you need to talk to somebody i'm glad you're seeing a therapist once a week, but I don't think that's enough. I think you need to go several times a week, you need to be around other kids your age and you need to start learning what's going on with you so that you can make different choices. So I would I would advocate iot if not partial the differences, basically, the amount of time, so it's you know about 15 anywhere from 15 iot is 11 to 15 hours a week. and partial is more than 15 hours a week so guess just what they have available in your area."
15873.0,Patient,"yeah so when the transcending or two is about two hours away from us. Locally here yeah and with the temperatures, you know medical doesn't well not."
107.0,Provider,"All right, well, and then the the residential is at the same place it's about two hours away, is that the same Program. Well, I will do my best to advocate for her to go in for that, because it's not practical for you guys to do outpatient and travel to your point two hours one way to do every couple of days, and maybe she could do 30 days of impatient and then. Do something kind of remotely at least to kind of stabilize so. it's unfortunate that medically you know she's kind of on the edge so, but obviously cognitively there's some struggles and you're also struggling with even understanding why you're doing what you're doing. And that's Okay, but then we really need to get that figured out because if you don't make some interventions now you're physically putting yourself at at a pretty high risk to to fall and hurt yourself, or you know being. physically you're going to get potentially really sick. nuts, we want to avoid that. Even if it's hard for you to imagine that right now. So that will be my recommendation at the very you know i'll really try and push for the residential because timing it's too far away for you guys to do the outpatient services and she needs to have some regular. program care in order to develop some better understanding about what's going on. Is your therapist right now is do they have any experience dealing with eating disorders, or no."
15873.0,Patient,Not that I know of no.
107.0,Provider,"yeah I mean there's some nuances that's different than if you're just kind of dealing with mood stuff, which is important, I mean it's it's better than nothing, but it's not, I think it would be really beneficial to go into a full program for a little bit."
15873.0,Patient,"yeah there is more of the depression, anxiety side. yeah yeah."
107.0,Provider,Well that's good i'm glad that that's happening at least. yeah okay. Well that's going to be my recommendation any other questions concerns any other information you think I needed to know.
15873.0,Patient,"wasn't it because of. My one of my son. She has a baby she had like a chubby neck. That was part of it i'm not sure that the whole. right thing, but if you know they said call to show a baby neck, and I guess."
107.0,Provider,She never seen added to it yeah.
15873.0,Patient,"Okay, other than that. I don't know if there's other things that she's not willing to share, but that was just one."
107.0,Provider,yeah no I appreciate that is there anybody else in your family that you know that struggles with food.
15873.0,Patient,No.
107.0,Provider,No and.
15873.0,Patient,It sounds battle we we like to eat.
107.0,Provider,"All that's good food is good. and ashes our bodies. And our brains, we need brain nourishment right. and any Okay, and in terms of for your understanding has has there been anything else in terms of the family dynamic any kind of big life changing events any moving around or. I don't know any kind of event, where it was really scary or or witness any kind of violence or anything like that. No okay all right just checking. Okay, well, I think I have everything I need to make my recommendations and. The only the challenges is we're kind of in this in this middle area, so, but we will do our best to advocate for residential just because the reality of travel. So. Okay, any other questions or concerns for me, before I let you guys go today. All right, well consider eating more food, and please consider drinking more water. You know you're going to do what you're going to do. All right, well was lovely to meet both of you take care. Have a good night."
15873.0,Patient,"Thank you, as well."
107.0,Provider,"Okay bye. Okay, so let's clarify the recommendations, so we are going to need to recommend residential treatment. Unfortunately, I mean it's such an absurd thing to say out loud, but the BMI is 17.5 and so it's not going to meet criteria for residential she is or the static 17.75. She is worth the static, which would meet criteria for residential the fact that she's lost 30 pounds in less than six months is a problem, she really doesn't understand why she or she won't speak to why she's behaving this way and why she's worried about gaining weight. she's claiming that it has nothing to do with other people that it's only her perception, but then she'll acknowledged that she was happier when she was at 130 pounds so. There appears to be some awareness that life was better without the eating disorder, at least the behaviors of eating disorder and yet when challenge to eat more to get back to that place she refuses to do it so. She does appear to have signs of brain neurological mal nourishment and I would encourage further health assessments to look at neurological function to potentially be. A reason for rez residential treatment The other issue is that in order for her to do any other kind of treatment in her area, it would be two hours one way. So it is not feasible for her to do any kind of an outpatient program because it's too far, one way for her to go so she really does need to be. In the program residentially for at least 30 days to get stabilized and then she can set down to an outpatient type of Program. where she can potentially see somebody remotely even a couple of hours a week, and that would be much better than her just seeing. Her current therapist which she started about a month ago, that person is helping her manage her mood issue which she is moderately depressed and moderately anxious. But that person does not have any eating disorder experience so they're not going to be able to work with her on these issues and i'm really concerned about her ability to stay nourished. This is not a good indication of where she's going, this is a pretty fast acting disorder at this point, and I think she needs residential be stabilized before it gets any worse. And I think that I. kind of checked all the boxes there all right, thank you."
