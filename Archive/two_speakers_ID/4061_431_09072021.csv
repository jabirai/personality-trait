431.0,Provider,"day it was on Wednesday, he sent in an eight day supply, which would have lasted you until now, on top of which there were refills with it without prescription. should be available to you. On the. On on Canada state monitoring website for some reason, the last time I see a filled was an August that doesn't seem right if you've picked up even you know. Last week and a half, so so last dose you said was a few days ago, a couple days ago."
4061.0,Patient,yeah like one or two days.
431.0,Provider,So on the week over the weekend Saturday Sunday. yeah.
4061.0,Patient,Probably was today Monday or today's Tuesday. It was probably Sunday night.
431.0,Provider,"Sunday night okay. yeah so she walks on does last about three days and so within three days there's still usually about 50% left and people's bodies, but that said, people can start feeling a little. off already because it's running lower than normal. So why don't I want to give your pharmacy a call right now i'm going to disconnect from audio but you'll see me is that OK."
4061.0,Patient,"that's fine. that's fine. can see i'm talking to a doctor's office in your state. don't work in the kitchen. every night every night. me. Every everything. And then my daughter she saw my doctor said. Three refills and to last me for the rest day long. I didn't even know that. No, I didn't get them.

4061.0,Patient,yeah I can hear you can you.
431.0,Provider,"hear me I can't hear you. Oh. Now yeah yeah um so I just spoke with Bob the pharmacist at your CVs and he said the medication has been ready for you, since last Wednesday. For an eight day supply. So it's ready, but let me double check while you I have you here with me um. Do you have an upcoming appointment, then."
4061.0,Patient,For Isaiah yeah.
431.0,Provider,"You do okay I OK, I see."
4061.0,Patient,Not Isaiah but a group groups or Monday.
431.0,Provider,"groups are Mondays but. there's a note in here that I need to get a quick clarification on can you just hold on really quick, let me do a quick reading and then i'll be right back with you i'm going to mute myself, while I look this up."
4061.0,Patient,"Yes, why. i've been so busy I. I must style now."
431.0,Provider,"Sorry, my computer is moving super slow that's why just give me a second okay. Okay hey Katrina. Yes, so what I am reading here again I had to go back a few more days it looks like so your current prescription at the pharmacy right now again it's an eight day supply. With three refills so you'll be able to get medications basically through the end of the month from what i'm seeing here that's that's actually a medication Isaiah has put in, as a an essence a long bridge prescription for you to find. An outside provider. Is this something you're aware of, or received any letters or communication."
4061.0,Patient,"And Isaiah told me that gap First it was um he said that it was going to be that way, but he said that the him and the team, talk, talk it over and. I had he said, to make sure I did my drug test and through the mail. And all my point appointment. yep yeah and he said that. Just to make sure I was compliant so that I wasn't terminated."
431.0,Provider,"yeah so he's right, I think we just have some certain program requirements, obviously, because we're Tele health, we want to make sure we can monitor our patients safely. So surveys medications just regular check ins with a therapist as well as provider, so they know what's going on with you, and it look like. So I do see a know about you know the reason why I think these discharge restrictions were put in last week because of the Miss appointments and then Has anybody reached out to you to provide some outside information about local providers."
4061.0,Patient,um no I don't know.
431.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and i'm sorry if this is again coming from me in a weird time and i'm just reviewing this information and just kind of relating it because I don't want anybody to be caught off guard, so I think here's what i'll do all right. medication wise your visor ready and the pharmacy pick them up, just so that you don't have you don't have any withdrawal symptoms okay so take them as instructed again two and a half films a day. What I will do all my and it's just let them know that you've. reached out and actually how did you come over to this virtual clinic did you have a direct link or did someone send you."
4061.0,Patient,And I went through the virtual clinic and did surveys and then they sent me the ID number.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so virtual clinic You see, because they must have seeing you and some of the same notes i'm looking at i'm not sure how back how far back they read. um let me figure out internally what we're going to do is do you want to remain with bright heart program or are you also already looking elsewhere anyways."
4061.0,Patient,Though I want to stay with you guys.
431.0,Provider,Okay okay so being part of being with us is that you have to come to your appointment so.
4061.0,Patient,"I know it's just been it's been really hard, because I mean everybody keeps fell and drug tests at work, and then I have do extra hours and i'm working at least seven days a week anyways and then, when I get home i'm exhausted. yeah and it's just i'm trying to juggle everything at one time my sister she was helping. So Okay, and it just that time it's not that you know i'm purposely or. You know appointment."
431.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Okay. I hear you I think it's you know with work and scheduling you can be challenging but. Because you have so many appointments where you didn't show up, I think, at some point they won't there they're going to start feeling unsafe press continue to prescribe because we can't monitor you. So I will put in everything you've told me please go pick up that medication right now that's available um you do have an upcoming appointment. On the I believe."
4061.0,Patient,yeah I yeah I scheduled that.
431.0,Provider,"See. yep the next appointments on the 13th. So please go to that, and then I will internally just figure out, you know what's the plan and touch base with Isaiah and so somebody either Isaiah himself or whenever care navigators. will be in touch, but I just want to let you know that what i'm seeing right now is actually an discharge initiated That said, we totally work with patients, you know. If they want to remain with us, and then, as long as we're clear on expectations typically it's not a problem, but this is again it's not up to me to decide, so I just want to put it up to the care team. Okay yeah i'm."
4061.0,Patient,anything like Isaiah i'll also talk to Isaiah Monday and. My appointment is that what the therapist.
431.0,Provider,"of your appointment with a therapist is on the 16th so that is on Thursday, so you have an appointment with Isaiah on Monday, the 13th. And they're having an appointment on the 16th right now on Thursday. That it's scheduled okay."
4061.0,Patient,yeah i'll talk i'll oh no.
431.0,Provider,yeah I think that's the best plan forward but as far as Meta concerned there's one ready for you to pick up now.
4061.0,Patient,"Okay. I appreciate that, and thank you for. letting me know about all that and calling the pharmacy for me."
431.0,Provider,"yeah no problem that was easy go get your meds feel better and then, when your minds in the right place definitely talk to your care team about you know what it looks like long term."
4061.0,Patient,"Okay. All right, I will definitely alright."
431.0,Provider,"Have a good day. Patient Katrina Fitzgerald was assisted unscheduled in the billing rx vc from. Patient came in requesting for medication stating that she has been out of suboxone since Sunday evening, as her last dose experiencing with sprawl sometimes including temperature changes feeling hot and cold nausea vomiting and insomnia. per review patient did have prescription sentence by provider Isaiah cruise on September 1 two patients prefer CVs for a quantity of 20 which is eight days supply and three refills. Call to CVs pharmacy and spoke with Bob the pharmacist and confirmed the medication has been filled and it's ready for patients to pick up. oars or the Ohio P and P was also checked previous to this current prescription patient last. filled medication was on August 23 for a four day supply so there's some clear, we were patient was receiving her medication so she ran out of in any case patient does have a supply it is ready for her to pick up. review with patient information about this church and deferred patient to discuss with the clinical team on the heart plan within right her health if she can continue or be discharged to a higher level of care. At this point, there are no further medication related needs for the patient and the patient again will check in with provider at the upcoming appointment on Monday September 13 with Isaiah Cruz and half a therapy appointment with the therapist on Sep tember 16 Thank you."
