15310.0,Patient,No i'm a couple years ago. I drank a fifth of whiskey within like 10 minutes and tried to kill myself and they brought me to the hospital I stayed the night there and they let me go the next day that's about the extent of anything criminal as far as like drinking or drugs.
408.0,Provider,But you were not arrested at that time.
15310.0,Patient,"No, no Well, no, I kind of was because I was throwing a fit and they had me in handcuffs but it wasn't it was more of like trying to restrain me because I was like blacked out drunk."

408.0,Provider,And where those voluntary admissions associated with suicidal ideation or self directed violence of any kind.
15310.0,Patient,yeah suicide oh.
408.0,Provider,Tell me more about what that was.
15310.0,Patient,"Well, I just I feel like I can't get away from it and I just I was afraid that I was going to entertain the thought to the point where I was going to actually try something. I went to both of these places, and I kind of came out feeling a little bit better because I realized. I wasn't as bad off, as some of some of those people that were in there and."
408.0,Provider,"Did you have any actual treatment with medication or behavioral health. therapy, while you were impatient."
15310.0,Patient,"No, well, I mean we had like classes about like how to handle our emotions and stuff like that, but no medication i'm not not typically want to take medication and I cannot take antidepressants I wouldn't even dare to take them now because i've taken. Over the years, probably five five different ones, five or six different types of antidepressants or anti anxiety type and every single time I take them it's everything's worse everything's way worse I don't even dare to take them ever."
408.0,Provider,were at the time you did trials of those psychotropic medications were you also consuming other substances.
15310.0,Patient,Not during the time that I was taking the medication.
408.0,Provider,"Oh, so there wasn't a kind of a mixed up between, say, the prescribed medication and the unprescribed medication or something."
15310.0,Patient,"yeah there was nothing you know I gave it a good shot every time. I don't know I think I I think those medicines left me for the worst after I you know I don't I think they put me steps down every time i've taken them, it was like. Just things are a lot harder to deal with after being prescribed those medicines, every time."
408.0,Provider,mm hmm can you be a little more specific about what the effects or when you say they were harder to deal with and. Can you be more specific.
15310.0,Patient,"Any negative feeling that I had the medicine any anti depressant or anti anxiety, you know low dollar Prozac or all those ones that I was on it made all of those intense intense anxiety mostly anxiety made my anxiety far worse like it almost tripled it with paxil. I was on that and I if I didn't stop taking that I think it would have killed me because my hands were like stuck like this, and I was seizing up felt like I was season up with the anxiety or something and the doctor wanted to increase and I was like I can't take this. I can't do anymore. So."
408.0,Provider,"i'm sorry that you are not able to get benefit from the medications you've tried so far, did you ever have a trial of zoloft or risk or doll."
15310.0,Patient,risperdal. uh huh yeah.
408.0,Provider,That that that's a totally different type of.
15310.0,Patient,"medication yeah it did not do well, is, I think that one it was I felt nothing different like as if nothing changed, so I just stopped taking it."
408.0,Provider,"So it didn't your centers didn't get worse, but they didn't get better either."
15310.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and that must have been the one I know that there was one that was like that, but if it's not doing anything it's no point to take it, when I look at it."
408.0,Provider,And what about cymbalta or a sector.
15310.0,Patient,I don't think i've tried those I think I was offered them but. I won't take any depressants I won't do it.
408.0,Provider,"um what did that. God geodon or olanzapine. Okay, because some of these are different classes of psychotropic meds that are not considered to be standard antidepressants."
15310.0,Patient,"yeah well, I guess, after all the years of taking them and this net I have situational depression, I mean I guess it might be a chemical imbalance this point. But I don't see it ever getting better it's just going to get worse, the older I get i'm i'm right now i'm trying to get disability for agoraphobia anxiety and depression. anger. My Angers and words it just sits inside of minutes just spitfires and that's why occasionally on those occasions, I will smoke marijuana because there's nothing else that can take that anger away."
408.0,Provider,And do you use nicotine or. caffeine.
15310.0,Patient,"drink like a cup or two a day. I don't usually drink more than that because it gets me jittery I do smoke cigarettes. smoke cigarettes today, but my lungs are bad, so I can only smoke like a couple drags at a time."
408.0,Provider,"Well, just I know we're not in the treatment phase, yet, but just a little piece of information as a caution to you is both caffeine and nicotine are psychostimulants so for persons who have agitation or anxiety, it can make it worse. Right yeah also persons who have bipolar disorder, it can make hypomanic and manic symptoms worse in some individuals so just be aware of that."
15310.0,Patient,"yeah I want to quit I do have the nicotine gum i've cut down a lot of my coffee just because i've noticed the difference. There was one medicine, I was taken like five years ago I don't know what the anti depression medicine was but I couldn't even drink coffee on that I was taking that medicine, I couldn't even drink coffee at all. Because it was it made everything intense all my anxiety was intense being on the medicine, and I think just that extra with the coffee was just just pushed."
408.0,Provider,Our extra stimulant kind of a tipping point chemically you right already ever been on wellbutrin.
15310.0,Patient,No. I don't think.
408.0,Provider,Some some individuals who. Do not get benefit or have adverse reactions to standard antidepressants sometimes can benefit for wellbutrin which is not in the same chemical class. and other as other antidepressants.
15310.0,Patient,As well as wellbutrin chantix similar.
408.0,Provider,Similar yes.
15310.0,Patient,Because I do know that wellbutrin had been prescribed to help people with cigarettes.
408.0,Provider,And it does help a smoking cessation yes.
15310.0,Patient,But i'd taken chantix before and I don't think i've ever felt.
408.0,Provider,"Checks chantix is used for smoking cessation but it's not recommended for individuals who have other. Mental health diagnosis, because it has been associated with increased suicidal ideation. And maybe depression worse, whereas wellbutrin has not. yeah so both are used for smoking cessation but chantix has had some adverse. They are different, yes. Are you right now, having any intent or plan to do self directed violence."
15310.0,Patient,No.
408.0,Provider,"All right, do you on an ongoing basis have. ideas of self directed violence. yeah about how often."
15310.0,Patient,Always it's always there in the back of my mind. You know I just.
408.0,Provider,So daily.
15310.0,Patient,Oh yeah every day.
408.0,Provider,Okay um has there been a period of time during your life when it has not been daily.
15310.0,Patient,"yeah. About 10 years ago, I think it wasn't like that all the time. I have a son and soon after we had our child she filed for divorce. That I didn't see much there. I don't have my son, right now, but when I do things are so much better I usually get him every weekend I didn't get him this weekend, because I think I came in contact with somebody that had coated."
408.0,Provider,Years ago.
15310.0,Patient,"He was a while it was like 10 months, he was 10 months old when we got divorced, he said so, he was around one ish 10 110 months to one year."
408.0,Provider,That was less suicidal thoughts. Less than a satellite is.
15310.0,Patient,"married I was married, I had a child, I was working you know everything seemed really great. I had a lot of issues, you know just with life and stuff before that, so I was just so happy that I was in that situation, and then it just all went away and. I didn't see my son a lot there at first, and I thought I was never going to see him again, and all I do is worry about him, I have no reason to worry about him he's in good hands but. That rules me all the time, like i'm just always worried about my son."
408.0,Provider,So that's not coming from reality that's coming to me your anxiety disorder. yeah okay all right um let's talk a little bit about your family history what kinds of health and mental health conditions has have any of your first degree relatives suffered from.
15310.0,Patient,"A my biological grandfather. I think he was becoming schizophrenia or something because. He was. He was envisioning things and then he went and he stole from a store to get food for his family, but they had plenty of money and he realized that this was happening, I guess, and he didn't want to do something to hurt his family, so he drove down to Texas, and he shot himself. i'm my brother he's got a he is technically half brother, but we had the same mother. She was my mother was diagnosed with bipolar and. So she's got some issues, but she isn't really addressed them so it's all in the back of the closet. But my brother and I we do we, you know we're trying to get on top of it."
408.0,Provider,Were you raised by those individuals.
15310.0,Patient,My mother yeah.
408.0,Provider,"So what happened to you as a child, when she was having a manic or depressive episode."
15310.0,Patient,hold on just a second. I live with her so it's kind of difficult.
408.0,Provider,Oh you're right now. yeah okay.
15310.0,Patient,yeah it wasn't great like I pretty much had to raise myself. I don't know if you heard that last part I was trying.
408.0,Provider,"I did I did, did you have any times when you were abused or neglected."
15310.0,Patient,"know we always had food. got spankings but uh. One thing that happened in my childhood that stays with me and I can't seem to get rid of it. We had a babysitter he was 16 at the time I was. I think I was five five years old and, at the time, you know I didn't think he was doing anything. Bad because, like me and my brother, we would urinate in the toilet together, you know and we try to hit each other's P streams I don't know it's just something you know we did remember as kids we were like you know. And then, this babysitter brought us into the bathroom and I thought he was just pain into the toilet but he wasn't years later I realized what he was actually doing if you know what I mean."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, yes. So he wanted you to witness. masturbating. Yes, yesterday. And, did you touch anything to you."
15310.0,Patient,"know well, he did say something, but you know I just started paying a toilet you know, so I didn't think a big deal of it. But he took me being the oldest and brought me downstairs into the cellar. and opened up where the fireplace or the furnace was the wood furnace opened it up and it's all on fire and stuff and he's like if you tell your parents about this i'm going to put your brother and sister in there. And I had reoccurring nightmares of my brother and sister being inside there on fire yelling my name. happened quite a bit that dream."
408.0,Provider,"How often did this occur, do you have any any idea."
15310.0,Patient,which was one time that I know of.
408.0,Provider,"You only recall one time how old, are you."
15310.0,Patient,Around five.
408.0,Provider,"and five, so how old was your brother and sister."
15310.0,Patient,let's see he was. Three my brother was three and my sister was too. And my other brother wasn't born yet.
408.0,Provider,"Okay. um now, and when you gave the family history, a minute ago you mentioned. That you and one brother. Both have diagnoses and mental health conditions, what about the other brother and sister."
15310.0,Patient,"No they're actually pretty good my sister she's had a couple of bouts of anxiety, but she got into drugs and little bit there for a while and I think it was when she decided to stop taking them and she was detoxing or something. because she just had that panic attack and. We had just recently got away from like drugs I don't know what it was I don't know if it was like."
408.0,Provider,"All right, what advice, what about your grandparents aunts uncles or nieces and nephews."
15310.0,Patient,um well me on my grant my biological grandfather he killed himself.
408.0,Provider,don't have one you already told me about right.
15310.0,Patient,"Now they're pretty good. And I think my grandmother might have had some anger issues, but she had seven children too so. Now I don't think there's really. I don't know my father so. yeah."
408.0,Provider,But he doesn't own a father at all.
15310.0,Patient,"No, I don't even know he looks like. And then my brothers and sisters father, he was the only Father I knew, since I was one year old, and when I was 11 my mom divorced him. And he looked at me and said you're not my real son you're not my child I don't have to pay for child support do your crap anymore, and it was strange because I didn't. I didn't cry about that, until I was an adult like. I was in this weird placid State after that divorce like I don't remember feeling hurt by it, I don't remember feeling sad or upset I did remember seeing a video of myself after that time and I would just stare blankly off into space and I never liked did stuff like that, before. So that affected me some somehow."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, but you didn't feel it at the time looking back on it, seeing the video you think maybe it affected you."
15310.0,Patient,"that's the first time I cried about it was when I saw myself as an adult and I rewatch these home videos and I watched myself getting off the bus and I picked up or cat and i'm patting the cat but i'm looking off down to the ground and i'm just i'm like somewhere else. And previous videos I hadn't seen me do that. So it was like witnessing. You know, it was witnessing witnessing myself as a child, something that I couldn't understand, then, but as an adult I was able to. And that's when I find you know, I was 2020 or 21 or something when I watched that video again and I actually. cried about it, but the thing of it is he wasn't saying that to me he wasn't saying I just don't you you're not like he wasn't trying to hurt me he was trying to hurt my mom. Oh, you know what I mean like keep I don't think he was a bad guy but uh he ended up dying from an overdose to. But no relation."
408.0,Provider,And you didn't. Obviously you didn't visit visitation with him after the divorce.
15310.0,Patient,not really. called support wasn't being paid so he couldn't come around I guess.
408.0,Provider,But your brother and sister did go visit him.
15310.0,Patient,No mom. My mom wouldn't let him around until you pay child support.
408.0,Provider,"See, I see Okay, and so did you ever have any behavioral health treatment, meaning psycho therapy or counseling."
15310.0,Patient,"No. Man talk to the guidance counselor couple times, but I was just always happy and laugh like when I was at school, I was just having fun joking around I was the class clown you know. I don't know just try to avoid my own emotions or something."
408.0,Provider,"So tell me about your experiences in school, including academically."
15310.0,Patient,"Well, like, I was saying, you know, I was pretty much class clown i'm always passed my test, but I didn't do homework, it was pointless I didn't want to wait, I was learning, you know, but I would fail like I would fail my classes, because I wasn't doing the homework. But."
408.0,Provider,"So you didn't acknowledge that you had any obligation to do the homework, unless you thought you needed to."
15310.0,Patient,"know I I would talk, even as a kid I would talk to teachers and I would have them if I need them, I need an explanation you know. Because i'd be like i'm failing they're like why i'm like because they're like because you didn't do your homework i'm like isn't that practice for the tests. yeah i'm like how am I tests and they're like you're passing i'm like so I know the information how, how can I not I know the information. You."
408.0,Provider,say.
15310.0,Patient,You succeeded in teaching me know like sorry. Like sorry we can't pass you because of the homework i'm like that doesn't make any sense. But that's the way I was.
408.0,Provider,"Did you learn from that experience and change that behavior in order to be more successful in school. No, it didn't learn from that experience."
15310.0,Patient,"I don't do well with authority. Okay, like. As far as this being in the clinic here and taking a soapbox and i'm playing everything by the book, you know i'm doing what i'm supposed to be doing. But granted if there was something that I wanted to do I would do it, but I would also tell you guys, you know, like, I talked with chantel and she asked if I had relapsed and I was like yeah once you know. Because I run out of meds trying to just you know get my meds in the right dosage or whatever."
408.0,Provider,"So i'm on if you were when you were in school, though. elementary school middle school high school, did you comply enough with the authorities and the rules and the cultural norms in order to complete your education. Okay, so you were not able to complete high school."
15310.0,Patient,"No, I dropped out. my grandmother had passed away and they were sending me to the office because i'd forget a pencil and all that stuff so I just got sick of. them punishing me because I was going through a depressive time they didn't do anything to accommodate me."
408.0,Provider,Did you obtain a ged. Did you share the problem with any other adults that might be able to help you to explain to the school what was going on.
15310.0,Patient,"No, I just gave up on it."
408.0,Provider,You didn't have any adults that were raising you at that time. They go to school.
15310.0,Patient,kind of I mean she was there.
408.0,Provider,"you're talking about your mother. yeah but she never. coordinated with the school, on your behalf."
15310.0,Patient,No. All right.
408.0,Provider,So when you dropped out of school What was your plan for launching into adulthood and becoming self supporting.
15310.0,Patient,"Not just working I always work I just go out and get a job just fill out applications everywhere there's always a job to find people say oh I can't work now there's a job out there. And I never really cared about a lot of money, so I just worked regular jobs, had a little apartments the stuff I enjoyed doing is cheap, you know what I mean like I like to watch movies. I like to play some video games, those are both relatively cheap compared to like hobbies like boats or four wheelers or something you know."
408.0,Provider,you're able to follow the rules enough to comply with a landlord or with a lease on an apartment.
15310.0,Patient,Oh yeah if it was logical things are logical and it makes sense to me i'll follow it. You know what I mean but.
408.0,Provider,And so what was your favorite kind of work that you did to self support.
15310.0,Patient,"Well um for the most part, I did PCA work. For most of the years since I was a kid I had a few jobs before then, just like telemarketing. What else work to hancock lumber lumber mill. But my favorite job was a Deli work I worked in a Deli for around six years to different places, and it was a you know, like pizzeria you know you get your pizzas hot cold sandwiches you know. convenience convenience store Delhi."
408.0,Provider,And what did you like that that.
15310.0,Patient,"Just that there was so much to do and I like getting better at it like. When my arms did work and stuff because i've got real bad problems with my arms now, but I just loved being able to like I called myself a Deli ninja because. I could do the job of two other people didn't matter who other two people were there, I could do that job, just as fine and they took advantage of it for years, because you know why pay to people if this one guy will do it all by himself. And yeah I enjoyed it but, for the most part. And till dinner came and everyone came at the same exact time and that that would agitating."
408.0,Provider,"Then it got too busy so you like, to be busy but not pressured."
15310.0,Patient,"yeah no, it was just the fact that everybody eats at the same time, it just annoyed me so much like when i'm hungry I eat there's no specific time I sit down and eat. I eat when i'm hungry and it's just I just found it it just annoyed me so much that all these people are coming into the store at the exact like everybody eats at the same exact time and, like. Just sounds so robotic like I wouldn't want to ever be considered to be in a be like, I guess, I would be embarrassed if I was like that I guess I don't know."
408.0,Provider,So it wasn't that it wasn't anything about the work load or the pace of the work it was that you are judging other people.
15310.0,Patient,"For their choices, not so much judging like I didn't think I was better than them because of it, I just it just annoyed me that everyone was exactly the same. You know what I mean like I appreciate individuality, you know when people act exactly alike it's just something that annoys me I don't think i'm better."
408.0,Provider,Did you ever develop any understanding of what external forces might be at play that would. bring more people to work to eat a certain times than others.
15310.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean that's just the way the whole world's organized people get out of work for or you know five. And then you know they want to get their kids fed and then they go to bed, you know I understand it's part of an organized saying you know but it's just weird how everybody's got the same exact time thing just bothered me."
408.0,Provider,do other things like that bother you.
15310.0,Patient,"i'm agitated nonstop because of the way the world is, I do not like society at all, every time I go out to the store, I just want to forget everything about it. cuz I go out in public and my anxiety rises and rises, you know people, not every time you go out there, you see, almost the car accident, because someone just is not paying attention."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, tell me a little bit about your the sources of your pain, you said a minute ago that you couldn't do Delhi work anymore, because something happened to your arms."
15310.0,Patient,"um yeah I guess it damaged nerves in my elbow elbows since I don't remember because I asked him he's found I went to get tested for carpal tunnel. And he found that I had carpal tunnel, but I also had damaged nerves, and that was like mind blowing in a way, because. or no I helped explain some things because when I was 19 years old, I just be pulling boards off of a line and that's just you just gripped the board and slide it it's not really that much. But after like I was like month or month and a half of doing that my hand stopped working. And it would keep me up all night long that was at age 19 I think that was the damaged nerve and carpal tunnel. But i've also got arthritis going on in there and I got something going on in my neck i'm going to get an x Ray on it, but it's causing ridiculous empathy down into my right arm, so my right arm is almost completely useless. And I gotta."
408.0,Provider,Get also from an occupational injury.
15310.0,Patient,"I don't the neck, I think the neck was when they tackled me that night I tried to kill myself when I drink that bottle of liquor because I remember being on the ground and all my stomach and my neck was being pushed up so much. And I do remember that part of the night, and then there was another instance, years ago, when I was wrestling with a buddy drinking and he had me on my back, but with my legs over my head and then my neck was forward and I heard a pop. And I just think both of those just came back to and now it's acting up even more."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, have you ever had any concussions or head injuries."
15310.0,Patient,"No i've slammed my head up against the wall, because I was so frustrated at my mother. Like really hard like you know when you feel your funny bone and you get that electrical feeling on your arm. I hit my. And I do you know where the hardest part you know we hit a soccer ball and guess I didn't want to hurt myself but i'm slam it so hard, I felt that electrical feeling all the way through my whole body."
408.0,Provider,Was that one episode or or.
