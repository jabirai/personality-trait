8750.0,Patient,"he's doing good um she's loving school like she loved it and. she's definitely get more of like an attitude I think it's because I have that some like I kind of have like that attitude talk and I explain it and i'm like great she's just mimicking me but i'm like how do I. i'm trying to figure out how do I fix that because this morning i'm like do not speak to me like this, like I know i'm or I don't know if that's normal or like okay I don't know."
214.0,Provider,It is. But you do have to try to.

8750.0,Patient,Really.
214.0,Provider,So how's it going.
8750.0,Patient,"Good better i'm the girl actually is starting to. be better, and the more that I have taught her trained her it's she's it's finally clicking and things are going smoother. i'm not so much over there i'm doing what I need to do so it's been. Good I just also unlike trying to communicate as much as I can, because we can't you know have things be Mr pastor but my. My boss she's back and so she's going to her for the questions, a lot of it, which is good because she needs to learn how to you know to so like I can't just be the only one who knows anything i'm still learning so. it's going better it's a lot better. The. Like. Co parenting is going really good right now she's awesome it's been kind of weird. But he's communicating more and like just not giving me a hard time about last minute things because he always makes a huge deal out of every little things so. I feel good, because everything seems to be going Okay, and like, but again that's right now so."
214.0,Provider,that's about.
8750.0,Patient,"I think I just. I I don't know I think i've been telling people no to hanging out and not like reserving my own time i'm i'm taking care of things and sort of letting like fascinating. Because I do that sometimes I like procrastinate and then also ramble URL scram and then like try to but i'm trying to stay on top of all of it and i'm trying not to think too much, but just do it, so I don't know. I don't like. Okay."
214.0,Provider,"it's no it's a change for him, but like is there an ulterior motive here like that's something to the whole time I know you."
8750.0,Patient,"Well, he. Like ever since his girlfriend had left him and stuff he did say and I didn't believe half the time, but I just thought he was feeling lonely he didn't actually give me a sincere apology, but. Like I felt like their results are turning them motives like I thought he was just lonely and like one I just tried to get yeah. yeah and so is to go to grant us all, I was like you know what that meant a lot to me they actually acknowledge what you did to me. And like you're actually seeing the reason I left like it never was like he understood why I did what I did he never it was always blame blame blame. But the same time he's still that same person, but he did i'm like you do like I think he's starting to realize that my best interest is what's best for zelda. not me. I think he's starting to see me as like a person and not. Like. gotcha so maybe he used to be in love with her, I don't know, but you know to be obsessive I don't know, but I think he's realizing that. I know a lot more about children than he gives me credit for, I mean I grew up with them raising them, you know and just. You know, whatever, but I don't know if it's. Growing I don't know what he's doing I don't know."
214.0,Provider,Why. i'm. So how's the mood medication.
8750.0,Patient,So i'm not on anything other than the role and the lexapro. i'm. Right now.
214.0,Provider,how's that feel to.
8750.0,Patient,"I feel good i'm not sure if it's just because of all the stresses past or what, but I do feel better um. I don't. I don't know exactly like. What I don't know, but like I said, like i'm having like I feel up right now so like I don't know if this is me being on that moves things like I have cuz i'm like this, a lot I don't know if it's because I just went on a date I."
214.0,Provider,"don't forget the day. it's all good it's all good for you, then so here here's the thing you should realize something. And this is just. This is just adult talk right you're a single mom with a daughter, and on top of a Korea you still have other things going on and right so those mood swings. something you need to monitor because it may be things that you need. That you're you're saying their mood swings but they're really not right it's actually a little bit of being lonely."
8750.0,Patient,"yeah I know. I think, and it went really well actually went twice already, but I just didn't get because I did I hope. um but he's super respectful of my time because I am a single mom and he's not like. He also is good at communicating doesn't go all day without texting me he literally is like how's your day how's crystal he's not. he's not asking for anything other than to get to know me. i'm not doing that so good luck, because if that's what you want, you can go on to the next, because I definitely have messed up in. Having sex with people too soon, like because you know you're human you know, and I definitely have noticed that if I keep doing the same like not. Not like on the first date but, like you know sooner than I should, and sooner than i'm comfortable doing then like it ruins it and it's like and then also be with the right person and I don't want them to be like. not really what I really want and give myself to that like I don't want to do that, like i'm just I know what I like what I don't want I know what I deserve. Now you know and it's taken me a lot, and you know the last guy that the linemen dude it made so much sense like when you were telling me like well, you have needs to like you need someone that's gonna include a long time, like I would use downsize or not downsize but. Anyway, yeah like I don't like and then i'm like you know what you're right it's really not that hard to send a text, if in the morning, or why should I have to ask for that or why should I feel like I shouldn't have to somebody should be like zoned in on me."
214.0,Provider,yeah I agree.
8750.0,Patient,"And I I want that, and so, so far, so good so. Good. And, but yeah but i'm a little nervous because he's a gem."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but let me ask you, but, but when everything's just another outlook is when everything seems to be fitting and everything's going fine we're good."
8750.0,Patient,yeah like i'm fine i'm happy i'm good.
214.0,Provider,it's my point. But when it when it starts to when it starts to get a little fraction we get a little frazzled but.
8750.0,Patient,"I, but the difference is is i've been taking care of myself, so I have been yeah so like i'm. I wasn't you know what right before my birthday was you know i'm off track like i'm super super off track like my nails are like they haven't been done like i'm neglecting my self my time for myself. To me i'm like. Just simple things like I, like my living room to be clean and perfect and then like you know, like just. I don't know how to explain it like I just wasn't taking the time for myself, I was eating like crap. And like i've been trying so hard not to binge drinking more water only drinking one cup of coffee in the morning, so I don't need any more than that, I just like it, because it's a comfort thing for."
214.0,Provider,me.
8750.0,Patient,"I just like warm and I just liked it i've always done it. But, like, I have noticed that it affects my endometriosis tremendously. sure. And i'm another lot of pain, so the days i'm not in pain, I feel great like i'm not like gasoline today. wasn't it causes extreme bloating and like inflammation and it hurts, and like some days I feel like crap because I literally at the end of my day look like three or four months pregnant if I learned it out. And it's like I don't I have um I have a stomach like and it just bothers me and then I start thinking on that, then I started thinking like you know. So I just i'm trying to like i've been re. zoning in on the whole crystal like I said I said I was going to do i've been getting my subscriptions I missed my birthday, there you know I missed that one, but I think it's just because it was my birthday and work had decorated and."
214.0,Provider,"I did not know. But then just remember and it's just something to remember that some of the conversations we had early on, are making a lot more sense now. yeah right and and I think you know when I when we were talking, we still need to talk about crystal time you really have to figure out whether it's snails hair a date. Whatever it is you have to figure that out because yes zelda is your world but here's the problem there's two worlds as an adult world and there's a mom world. Both have to be fulfilled, and it gets it gets really aggravating I think and that's what I was going through."
8750.0,Patient,"Yes, I did something really big I took this Sunday, which I don't ever take away from his older I took this Sunday and went on a date which I never do. I never i'm like no I can't I can't like i'll be like Friday night and then it's like you're limited to what you can do, but because my birthday was Tuesday and I had ran into Tuesday night and. He was like oh my God Happy Birthday blah blah blah whatever everyone knows everything and. He was like lofted you know take you out for your birthday like whatever you want anything you tell me, like you, let me know what you want to fully do we'll go do it like I was like Okay, I want to go to the beach. I want to do, I love the beach I need like I normally go every other weekend, if I can like this, this weekend we're after excel because I went. Without her and she overheard my mom's day how was the beaches you just started falling so she's so funny she's still like crazy how she's just like Oh, can you go without. But I think that, because you know I really think the way i'm feeling right now I feel really good is because I was able to be completely 100% myself silly goofy crazy smart freakin just completely crystal because I decided, you know what screw It is like it oh freakin ball. Because I can't be anything other than me. And I try my hardest, not to just be myself, but sometimes I do see myself kind of go, you know figure out what they like, and try to like like it or try to learn about it, and you know what. that's good to do, but like I don't need to change and obsess myself like just need someone to take interested in what I like as well, like. So, and he really, really digs my personality and he's like it's crazy like you're so goofy you're fun you're you're inside matches your outside and he's just like a lot of fun so anyway. For like."
214.0,Provider,"I just want you to remember when you when you feel like it's all. Getting traction you got to go back to what makes you not fracture which is taking care of yourself and really you're not abusive with taking care of yourself, you give you still give yourselves. You give yourself but it's. The bare minimum."
8750.0,Patient,yeah I know.

8750.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah that's right my greatest my goodness. yeah and I also just like for a long time, like I kind of just was like thinking like. i'm just just means i'm good i'm fine. it's like obviously. i'm not you know so."
214.0,Provider,"it's just not enough. I know, but she's listen you're either going to find a significant other or you're going to go through a couple of significant others, but she needs to learn to that being an independent woman means you still got to go out there right you definitely not."
8750.0,Patient,"I did explain that to her because. She loved me and lose that broke up she was just like. You know, like what happened i'm like sometimes you know you're not right for somebody sometimes you have to date and see. If that person's right for you and sometimes it doesn't work out and that's okay like that's fine it just or you know mommy deserves I know what I deserve and if they can't do that for me then. I stopped the right person I explain things to her, because she asked me like it's crazy how smart she is and how I try to keep stuff from her. But she picks up on it man she's little ease operate i've been trying to be very careful. Because holy moly. This girl here what i'm saying and i'm like okay. i'm more.
