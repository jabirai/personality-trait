298.0,Provider,"Okay okay. um if you would like to do some research on how brain chemicals work there is. On the Internet there's something called braver man assessments if they ask you questions it teaches you about neural chemicals it's pretty easy to understand and it would help you to understand. Just a little bit about serotonin dopamine gabba gabba which you know those are all really important things, and you under this constant stress at home that's hard on your body that's really hard. If you would like to do some research my recommendation to start with the a serotonin medicine and see if it helps. I would like it to see you about once every two weeks i'd like you to make an appointment to see me check in with me and. If you cannot do two weeks to three weeks, but at least check in with me, and let me know take my email address down if you have if something changes if you have negative side effects if anything. comes up That would be good for me to know about. And I want to know about it."
15225.0,Patient,"So kind of like what Dr packers group is like I feel left out in that group because everyone's taking medications and Oh, do you need a refill, and all this stuff and i'm like. there's no refill for methamphetamines that's what he said so. What about my mental health."
298.0,Provider,"I don't want to make you do to two groups, unless you wanted to see what a mental health Group looks like. it's very different I From what I hear but that's that's just anyway um I just know that I think that you've got some untreated mental health problems, and I would love to help you with that. Okay, you ready to write down my email address."
15225.0,Patient,As soon as I can find it i'll just wait for the home.
298.0,Provider,Or would it be easier if I just sent you an email right now.
15225.0,Patient,I love the way you think.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I will send you an email i'm doing that, right now, so that you and I are connected that way and i'm going to write down some suggestions. The suggestions I have is zoloft. or Prozac. Those are very they're called serotonin medications. and I think anything would be an improvement over what you have. Yes, a mood stabilizer would help with irritability, but I think there's so many things under that irritability I think you've got some probably trauma going on from childhood you've probably got some ADHD going on, which is untreated and. Those are probably the underlying things and then add on the stress of your life that's why you're irritable. Sorry, but you've got you've got some things to fix i'm hoping that your counseling will help you said you're going into counseling your wife in you."
15225.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Because I feel like she's neglecting to and actually i've heard of those medications before, because my wife is supposed to take Zola but she doesn't she she says it makes sure. Like. feel different like wrong, and I feel like a lot of this could have been avoided, has she been taking her medication, but."
298.0,Provider,that's possible medication can be very strong and. yeah. So do you want to let me know if you would like to take one do you want to do research I you drive this bus.
15225.0,Patient,i'll take a look up and do a little bit of research and then maybe what you said to me. yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Well, no, but you can email me back. You can say. And you can email me I can get you started. But then I just want to check in with you also like get a visual on you just see how you're doing okay."
15225.0,Patient,yeah go go crazy on the medication you're prescribing.
298.0,Provider,yeah I mean there are side effects to medications if you can usually power through the side effects the benefits outweigh the the side effects of the medicine.
15225.0,Patient,Can you give me one example.
298.0,Provider,lowers your. Sex drive that's when. The main reason that men won't do serotonin medications doesn't always do that now.
15225.0,Patient,"It doesn't know why my wife said it lowers your libido so. I. I concur probably. You know, could be."
298.0,Provider,"lower. Your age. So. It it's not that that would happen to you i'm just putting it out there, that that is probably the thing The other thing is is you have serotonin in your stomach. And when you take serotonin medicine, you can upset your stomach a little as it gets to your brain, but after a couple of days it goes away and and that's, not to say that that it would happen to you so don't get hung up on the side effects."
15225.0,Patient,"All right, definitely definitely look into it and I look forward to seeing you."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, take care. bye bye."
