455.0,Provider,Hello.
14123.0,Patient,hi.
455.0,Provider,"How are you well, my name is I say i'm one of the nurse practitioners, can I have your name and birthday."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah yeah um my name is elle sun and we met a couple weeks ago. yeah. my birthday is June 10 1988 sorry i'm a little bit worried because I didn't realize this was being recorded and and I, and I, and I that kind of sends warning signals off my head, because no psychiatrist appointment should be recorded because it's not hipaa compliant right."
455.0,Provider,"yeah you're understandable, so it is hipaa compliant what happens is we report it so that way I can talk to you and not have to chart So it goes to a transcriber and they transcribe the note and then I signed the know so that way you know i'm not typing while we're talking. So. that's that's how we think about things you're not the first person to to."
14123.0,Patient,"Because I i've been to a couple of psychologists appointments and I, you know that's just not the process for you know. When. We have those appointments either and. that's."
455.0,Provider,"yeah if you don't feel comfortable with it that's fine, we can you can take some time to think about it call us back, do you want to continue or or not I don't want to pressure you either way."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay um I appreciate that well I you know I, I would like. Access to to the to yeah to care um. yeah so. I don't know if you remember, I guess i'm the Do you remember our first meeting or."
455.0,Provider,"Yes, yes. What What about it did you want to talk about."
14123.0,Patient,"um. Well, so um. You know I had talked about how I was. going through Depression and anxiety and. and I had you had prescribed me zoloft. um. And that actually. I had a really negative reaction with that i'm. Sorry, my moment. um so. yeah so I. It actually I had a negative like reaction with it gave me more anxiety. and i'm actually with my friend right now who's been helping me through these through some of these things. And yeah and I I was actually thinking that. What I had tried before zoloft was wellbutrin and that might be a better. fit for me i'd love to get your opinion on that I to right now, what I have is like extreme. anxiety and depression and so i'm not sure. I thought zoloft would be a good fit but I actually sent me into like a panic attack. While I was taking it yeah."
455.0,Provider,"that's um that's not unheard of that's why we started the lowest dose so in your symptoms of depression, anxiety that kind of intermix. Depression that they the symptoms kind of related to each other and then which one costs which does the anxiety cost of depression depression, causing anxiety. I believe we talked about ssri zoloft there's several in that category are really the first line treatment for anxiety, but you're not the only one to say they kind of causing anxiety so best. The people who taper up very slow tend to do better with anxiety and it tends to take a little bit longer than depression does with that said. wellbutrin wellbutrin is a great depression medication and typically it's not used for anxiety because it can cause anxiety. But with That said, I have had a handful of patients who just have the opposite reaction and wellbutrin does work for their site. So the what there's different categories that we use and different reasons why use different kind of precedents wellbutrin is often used for the people who are so depressed they sleep 20 hours a day. They can't gamble and because it gives you a little bit of energy increases your domain gives you that little energy."
14123.0,Patient,yeah.
455.0,Provider,"But because it gives you energy it can kind of cost me anxieties impacts kind of like taking caffeine, if you take caffeine and kind of get your heart rate recently or your lunches so i'm more than happy to try so well your turn with you, if you had success in the past. But with That said, it can cause some anxiety, but like I said before, people sometimes just have a different reaction to it and that's that's what your body needs and i'm happy to give that one to try. Beyond that, we do have other ones. All of that all of the ssri guys are approved for anxiety. So tell me your anxiety tell me your symptoms, that you have. that are most troubles."
14123.0,Patient,"I have extreme panic like in the mornings it's very hard for me to get up and face the day that's for sure I am sleeping a lot, or I just sleep to kind of numb out the day. that's kind of also like I get to your point i'm co mixed with extreme anxiety that I have right now i'm unemployed, and I have a lot of anxiety about that. and I. I I get into these panic attacks that are very actually quite bad, which is why i'm actually staying with a trusted my trusted friend right now who's here. i'm attending just you know just do yeah. i've yeah i've had some experience with my family with my mom thing here of her and then she has she's gone through thanks and and i've been i've you know i've attended. psychiatry sessions, just to kind of gauge sure what's happening and it'd be another point of you know of support as well. yeah so lstm a house and and the company seems to really help and and give her sense of grounding. yeah but without that like I I do get into like such panic attacks and anxiety attacks that I can't function. That I literally just can't get on with my day I can't face. And I think one of the manor ne ne ne late so she was having a really hard time sleeping at night, sometimes i'm. Also, I have um I had told her like you know I I don't want your body to be a chemical lab you know cuz I mean, I know how the things are like just like you just said, like. it's ultimately there's no that man just know now the brain and like people can't throw drugs are people and i've seen it happening, and they try this or that and i'm sure too much all the strategy sort of thing like. And you know, hopefully low dosages are not that intense but i've seen my mom going through you know back and forth of different drugs, and it can be really taxing to the body and to the spirit. was an essay, and I mean what happens. What what's the I don't know if he was there is there a combination like I before I was. My other psychiatrist had suggested that I like take wellbutrin with some kind of like anti anxiety specific like klonopin or something is that a combination that or some kind of anti anxiety is that a combination that you've heard of or that you would suggest."
455.0,Provider,yeah no good question so first off it sounds like you're lucky to have a good friend and I was lucky to have you as a friend so.
14123.0,Patient,"I think yeah. These panic attacks, I mean like right now, like it's it's really it's been really life saving actually. i'm to have my friend here into to be here with my friend it's um it's very yeah it's very stabilizing and I find that when i'm by myself, like just the panic and anxiety can get really like just it renders me non functional. Yesterday you have this thing, where you, you have this kind of shakiness thing oh yeah and, and so I had been taking the like. So when I first started taking the zoloft. With the 25 milligrams to go for a couple days, and then it just I was isolated and it just spent me sent me like spiraling to like this very discombobulated feeling and and I started getting like kind of. The shakes are like body tremors and like rocking back and forth, and then yesterday when want to with it, with it, with a little jog walk me she told me that at some point she felt like. Like she visual style blur like like yeah follow yeah and I had a period something and I had periods, where. I would be walking or jogging like yesterday, like so, then I stopped taking for a couple days and then at the you know I tried it again, but half tabs this time so. Not the 25 milligram ones, and then just half of that and I took it for like three four days, but then same thing happened where. i'd be walking or jogging like yesterday I couldn't I was feeling really just agitated and and panicked like I was, I was probably I was having a panic attack, essentially, and so my friend went to her you held on pretty well how can I say hey thanks yeah. I appreciate that yeah that I like as we were jogging there'd be moments where. I would faint or like it's almost as much as this if my subconscious would like fall asleep, and I would like almost like fall asleep for a second and then chill back like awake have you heard of those symptoms before."
455.0,Provider,yeah so we call that like a disassociated simple. A lot it comes it people experience it slightly different some people will be their lives in a third person as if they're watching a movie some people will feel like that I got out of body experience. And typically that's the third. Most most common symptoms with panic attacks so it's very common in a panic attack to feel that way.
14123.0,Patient,"But there's almost as if my subconscious fell asleep and I like. just dismiss yeah I mean it, I was completely agitated completely panic I couldn't stop like shaking back and forth like this. And then, like, I had to go out like side and started running, but then it was like it was almost like I was narcoleptic like my body like my body and like I just lost consciousness for a second and then jolted back awake and that happened several times. In the span of an hour, so I did, that is, that something that is common during I guess during panic attacks."
455.0,Provider,"yeah it is, it is a fairly common symptom and like I said it, it shows itself in slightly different with everybody. So I want to say the words not not something to be worried about, but it is common you're not alone. way, obviously we want to get rid of these panic attacks that's our number one number one goal here so back to your. earlier question about wellbutrin combined with the anti anxiety medication so first the first line treatment for anxiety is that ssri X zoloft and paxil Prozac select one of the now those take about six to eight weeks to start work so that's not going to help you now today. So what second line treatment will be an Anti anxiety like a subpar it's non habit for me. So it's a good alternative. As far as the quantum pits that's a whole class called the benzodiazepines Are you familiar with that class of medication."
14123.0,Patient,"Not not so much, except that i've i've i've had friends who have been on klonopin before and say that it's free but also it's something my psychiatrist at also suggested before as an Anti anxiety, but what is it is it habit forming as you're saying."
455.0,Provider,"Yes, so benzodiazepines are scheduled three yea control medication any they have a high risk for dependence habit forming and a high risk for us and diversion so. yeah but. With that said they do have their place in medicine, we still use them, so we have to wait pros and cons, so what it does, is it activates the same receptors as alcohol, so if you familiar outlaws are pretty good at math anxiety medication. yeah and."
14123.0,Patient,"I will be I will be I i've had a lot of panic attacks recently and i've been extremely anxious, and so I have been self medicating with alcohol. yeah. yeah well yeah I mean if I know that I think about those couple receptors I would I mean, I will be kind of like I would try to not go in that direction, maybe you know, is this a drug that has the same as association that can like. We know, I mean, I also have friends that have dealt with alcohol multiple times and i've been with them and stuff and I. there's like a point where like you create these dependencies and these things can trigger you and then your body ask for more of that. And I wonder if, like those type of drugs actually a similar type of receptors couple like a whole you know is that something that That to me is a little bit you know. What when you volume. On. me because i'm curious about what word so yesterday, and when I was having the extreme panic attacks and anxiety attacks and I took a half of evaluation bill, and it really."
455.0,Provider,calmed me down yeah.
14123.0,Patient,yeah it really helped and do you know why.
455.0,Provider,"yeah it's the same category as o'clock there, though benzodiazepines so you had xanax, which is a very short acting typically use for panic attacks. Because it starts within 510 minutes but it's out of your system quickly and then the in between ones are out of no value there's kind of mediocre as far as how long the last year system, and then the longest acting ones are. The conference, but they all do the same thing and so like I said with that said they do have their place and that's. What what the with your not recommended to be on them for more than a month or two at a time because of the habit forming independence for it so. What we typically use them for is for panic attacks, while we get you on something else, whether it's while we start to on your trip. While we start you on a different united precedent, because it's going to take a while to get there, so like I said, mostly never precedence take about six sometimes eight weeks to start working so well we'll start somebody on a. volume or Alabama for that time and then slowly taper them off six weeks later."
14123.0,Patient,"Five years later, something so it can be like a temporary kind of. First, a thing I mean yeah I took half yesterday."
455.0,Provider,And it helped.
14123.0,Patient,"I mean yeah and you weren't like. You are totally knocked out, you know I mean you were your eyes yourself afterwards so yeah I grew up in a very. Very abusive chaotic environment from five to 18. Sexual abuse physical abuse mental abuse emotional abuse the whole lot of attitude agitation, so I know that I am naturally easily. agitated and prone to a lot of anxiety and the panic attacks have gotten worse over time, and all this stuff kind of resurfaced over time so. um I think I right now i'm I have a lot of anxiety and it's it's easier when i'm with somebody that I really, really, really trust right, but like when my by myself, sometimes it's almost a manageable the anxiety yeah It makes me literally nonfunctional. And it leads me into a panic attack mode. So what you're seeing right now is like me extremely supported right right next to someone that I really, really trust I have known. For over a decade, but when i'm by myself it's literally unmanageable at this point, and I have just stopped avoiding everything like I can't i'm not doing emails right I can't. i'm not functioning normally so um yeah whatever it is that could help with. That like extreme anxiety that renders new nonfunctional would be really great whether it, it sounds like maybe Prozac. My fear is doing something like zoloft again, which sends me until like a rocking state of like non functionality, but if Prozac is something that like calms people down, maybe that maybe that's something that I would consider. or. I mean certainly don't do work and it wasn't. Because, all I would have it would be things like you try and see which organism works, how you just had an empirical test on how that worked on you and and and to be fair. I have been drinking alcohol every day or I had been i've stopped as if, like yesterday and today, but to curb the anxiety, but i'm not. I mean he's been around his friends who've been like extreme alcoholics I know i'm doing it to self medicate my extreme anxiety and I would much rather like obviously be on like a medication for the extreme anxiety. yeah she doesn't have the typical I go holic kind of thing where like they will drown themselves, you know, like with extreme amounts of alcohol guess i've seen it firsthand. And although something that worries me, I can see that is related to her feeling the pressure and trying to you know get away from that sure. So yeah it's right now it's just when i'm panicked when I feel extreme anxiety, you know i'd like to have something for that and and and depression so whatever you think. is good for."
455.0,Provider,"You so, first I want to say we call medicine, a practice for a reason like he mentioned. Sometimes we do have to say let's try this see if it works or try this, we were not God you don't know everything there is to know about the body. In people what what works for me may not work for you, and vice versa, so we do have to try things and it's not fun it's not fun being the guinea pig. So we tried zoloft, which is in the ssri category, so the Prozac paxil are all in that same category I would rather switch to a different category it's called. So the ssl ssri work on saratoga with the S stands for this medication called effects it works on nor epinephrine and it's also one of the first line treatment for anxiety. So my idea is you tried the serotonin replacement and that actually did the opposite of what we wanted so maybe your serotonin levels are good let's try to tweak the norepinephrine levels, which is the counterbalance to Sarah tonia to see if that is the issue."
14123.0,Patient,"As well when I when I tried wellbutrin that seemed to kick me out of my depression. Okay, Nice."
455.0,Provider,"wellbutrin works for me, which is Those are the three main in a depressant neuro transmitters that we were that we use so i'm more than happy to try. dope as far as well. My thought is like I said it could cause anxiety. But if it's worked in the past let's go ahead and give it a try."
14123.0,Patient,"Is there something that. I can use for anxiety, while going on that."
455.0,Provider,"Yes, so. um. yeah so let's get you on an as needed I would rather use an event it's similar to value. and use it only during panic attacks, the idea is one we don't want to get you dependent on it, but it's going to stop that stop him cuttack it's slightly faster acting then value so it'll work a little quicker. But it's not as dangerous as as xanax reason I don't like xanax is there's a lot of overdoses because it works so quickly that it hits your body really hard."
14123.0,Patient,"I see and and if we were to say like. My first thing is anxiety, I will know, I mean I wake up and I feel no hope in the day. I feel. want to face the day I want to go yeah I just want to block out the day I have very little hope at this point. Yesterday, like being with my friend, was the difference between. Being here and not being here, you know, like I don't have much hope for my future at all. Sure um I really don't and I, and I know that that's depression, but I also have extreme anxiety and so I. So. I don't know if, like we should try what you're saying would be like the norepinephrine if that's known to work for like extreme anxiety and depression. You know, or if it's like wellbutrin I don't want to I don't want to like I, for example, have been on. An anti psychotic before, when I, but that was because I was you know. I don't know I just. was your main concern was my main concern is having a reaction like I did with those all off always when I was I would love. risperidone before as an end like I literally went like. into this mode right."
455.0,Provider,"So so there's no way for me to know if. If well mutual do this for you or if you'll have the same reaction with effects, Sir, but we can give you this enemy that will stop stop the panic attack so."
14123.0,Patient,"Do you have anything so if I take wellbutrin Can I take that I guess, with the advent, but I just I want something because. I think they will be trimmed did work for. The depression. To what I recall, but I know I have just an extreme running of anxiety and from my mom I know that my mom my grandma and my mom sister on they were all. They all had hypothyroidism. Okay, so that's that's just something that my mom mentioned the other day that I had no idea about you know, but I don't, I just wanted to give you that information, just like. You do my fight is just what you're inside it is actually what what happens is that it will gets into kind of like this recurring thought that kind of starts to spiral and. And that's the type of thing like you know, like you, will like open an email do something else, and you will do. and use your thing that worries you, and then you go into that, and you know you're kind of like will like circle count like that. So I don't know if that's an indicator of any sort but yeah I mean what happened with the volume is it brought me like I think because of I have is i've gone through a lot of trauma and abuse like. Last night, you were by coming. be a value right. Now you were to elevate know that I know like you were yeah I was calm I, yes, yesterday I felt common like I could face things but usually. These days, without like a grounding effective I I know i'm so lucky that I have that i'm with my friend right now cuz I know other people like don't have that but, like I just lose lose every sense of self right and I just spiral into this like anxious non functionality. So I don't know if it sounds like you're saying what might be good is wellbutrin plus something for panic attacks, but is that do you think, do you think that'll also solve like. My like kind of like baseline like and my mom also told me like she had a lot of anxiety to as an adult like a young younger adult and you think that'll solve the anxiety and. Also, like, I have a lot of trouble focusing it and I was diagnosed with adult ADHD like do you think that'll also help with that."
455.0,Provider,"Well, you tryna is a treatment for ADHD so that is so, what we want the end goal is. for you to get into counseling for you to retrain your brain so when you have those fixated thoughts, you can say okay now we're going to think about this. change those thoughts and and that way you can control your anxiety and without medication that's the end goal if you need medication to get you there were more than happy to help with that. But but it's really. The counseling that's going to make the difference walk."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah I think yeah. and i've had counseling in the past, before I think right now things ideas pretty chemical to."
455.0,Provider,cookie.
14123.0,Patient,"I yeah so I understand that, like you'll get to that in a moment. of crisis little bit yeah yeah so so um so wellbutrin plus what were you saying."
455.0,Provider,"out of it. is also called lorazepam and that one's going to be an as needed. medication, so if you don't have a panic attack you don't need to take it at all."
14123.0,Patient,"But is there, something I could take just constantly for consistently for anxiety, while i'm on lobby trend or this."
455.0,Provider,"Yes, let's hold off on starting what i'm thinking is boost as a medication called boost far it is. It is an anxiety medication and studies say is just as effective as a xanax but it's not habit for. But I hesitate to start you on several medications at once. Right, if you have a bad reaction you don't know what it's."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah I have a good question. If you do, the one that i've I forget event know what's the one that's like as needed what's. The like like how many times are we at that will be a threshold where you're like this is too much yeah because I have anxiety, every day, so I know i'm gonna like feel I. mean i've been numbing with alcohol, because of the anxiety every day so so maybe the wellbutrin will help with that maybe you know, maybe. Do you think the wellbutrin will help with like the feelings of anxiety."
455.0,Provider,"Yes, that's the goal yeah."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, and then Okay, you can like so she will be taking this like this combination and check in with you and how long. You."
455.0,Provider,"In three weeks i'm going to be gone, I would say two weeks, but i'm going to be gone that week so three weeks. If you have something in the come up in the meantime we, I do have somebody covered so you will be able to talk with somebody."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay. So what what is, I mean to to end, thank you for saying that and to to know was point if I take them up between and then I have the advantage as needed. What is a good like level that I can take because I I imagine that you know, I have a lot of anxiety and panic attacks you're seeing me right now super regulated with some, but like when i'm by myself, I literally just. can't deal with that very well, so. yeah like that she can also be functional herself, because you know she's staying with me, but I also have you know it it's God like impossible to 24 seven you know here for me to. i'll do it, I know, right now, and trying to be as much as I can um but. yeah that event what's a what's a like normal weekly consistent dosage that I could take that like would be. Good for me."
455.0,Provider,"I was planning on giving you one a day with the goal of you, having a couple of days, one or two days, where you don't have to take it at all."
14123.0,Patient,"I see I like that it's fine to be viewable I think that would be like yeah the weekend, where I don't know I mean like dealing with thick or something. I mean yeah I mean like right now she's been here for like 10 days 11 days off and you only took something like that which was the half volume yesterday. But yeah yeah before I was yes, you were self medicating with alcohol yeah every single day so that's yeah but ya know every single day. yeah. Okay, well, I mean it's good to know that you have that resource and I think, because you know. yeah I. I think that once you don't want a few days, once you feel like if you feel good one day, then the next day, you will be sure to feel better to not feel. Good when you are inside one day the next day you likely feeling excited and anxious to unless unless the wellbutrin starts working rush I know. yeah yeah I think that I think that's great I think that would be a great start if that's at all possible suggestion, thank you for all these patients and the time and being you know, thoughtful and you know listen, as you."
455.0,Provider,Sure sure happy to help I do want to address your counsel how often I want to counseling.
14123.0,Patient,I have an appointment set up for tomorrow.
455.0,Provider,Wonderful wonderful and did we schedule a group therapy appointment.
14123.0,Patient,"yeah so what happens in those group therapy is we're kind of curious because it wasn't very clear really where the process, and you know. Everything is online and it's you know just weren't quite sure."
455.0,Provider,"It is it is and you're not the first one to have questions about fruit, a lot of people hear the word group therapy and kind of it brings them anxiety because you have to talk in front of people on. The that's anxiety driven right there so it's therapy lead, so the therapist will you typically have a topic to talk about coping skills anxiety control. And you're on the Wednesday at 10am one that's a mental health, only one, so we have addiction ones we have mental health, once we have all women's once we have. a mix of we call it dual diagnosis mental health with addictions, so that one is a mental health, only one, so I think it's perfect for you. And the therapist will typically check it say hey i'll tell me a high in the low you know what's something good that happened, but something bad that happened. And then they'll move on to the next person and then they'll have an educational copy all right let's talk about when X, Y Z happens, this is what What do you do what, what do you think you should do. Okay it's kind of educational most people like I said kind of freak out when they see here the word group there be, but by the end of like one month, they look forward to it that's their highlight of the week because. You find people like you know i'm not alone there, there are other people having panic attacks out there, that that it's hard to function in life i'm not crazy i'm not alone and it's a place to kind of event and and feel supported."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay yeah Okay, I see and, what is this like what is this, I heard about like the prescription being refilled after the group therapy."
455.0,Provider,"So yeah so typically. We do. One or two weeks, at a time, and then we fill it at medication checking because i'll be at the group therapy as well i'm kind of in the background, doing medication stuff so that it's set up more for people with addictions that's. kind of how it was set up. And it spills over to the mental health it's not as valuable for the mental health groups, as it is for an addiction."
14123.0,Patient,"I see. Do you think that, for this for this session, you can prescribe me with like a month's worth of wellbutrin and add event."
455.0,Provider,I will do will do. Three weeks.
14123.0,Patient,Even.
455.0,Provider,"Because will check. yeah we'll check in three weeks, I mean we can do a month if if that's It makes me no difference three to four weeks it's the same for me."
14123.0,Patient,"that'd be for me just to not feel like oh God like you know i'm it's going to take like six to eight weeks to take effect and I I don't know why i'm you know not being given like them, even a month dosage basically."
455.0,Provider,"Right yeah. So yeah we'll check in. With you so at the group therapy that a person can tell, is going to be taking my place like I said i'm going to be on vacation the next two weeks. She will be recovering for me so she will answer any of your medical questions it she'll be able to help you I will be back on the 29th and you'll see me there. ahead and say hey Al how's things going past the medication working. In a side effects, and then we can. Change around the dose stop the medication start something new, do something like that. Okay we're just gonna keep going. And i'm excited for you to get into therapy, I know you've done it before, but I sounds like you're slightly more motivated now because it's it's really affected your life and. yeah this is really a good thing, this is a good starting point so with That said, I do just want to give you one more reminder that this man is. Has a potential for abuse So be careful with it in this is a temporary thing, no more than two months and we're going to keep her you off for your own safety. and hopefully by then you will have better control with counseling with group therapy and with medication in there from all three."
14123.0,Patient,Okay okay great.
455.0,Provider,work.
14123.0,Patient,And are we supposed to set up my next appointment with you during this session or.
455.0,Provider,No i'm the care navigators handle my schedule so bill they set up so you'll call the virtual clinic and they'll set you up with. All my schedule.
14123.0,Patient,"For this prescription so. She I think when she started. Working with you guys she was in southern California, but she's in Berkeley now in the Bay area, so I wonder if the zip code with with the pharmacy that she'll be assigned to yeah can you send the prescription to a CVs it close to where I am now."
