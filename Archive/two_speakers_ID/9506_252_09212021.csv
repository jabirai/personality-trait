Wait When did the lady come in, I mean it was Monday, no she came Monday, so it was Sunday night I was up till two in the morning. Then I got back up at six in the morning to try to get some cleaning before school at eight. And i'm still not recovered from that i'm like man i'm not as young as I used to be, because I i'm still white i'm like my kids were late for school this morning because I was too tired, to get out of bed."
252.0,Provider,yeah. it's amazing when you get older.
9506.0,Patient,"Big deal yeah it's a big deal. And I got less done than I wanted to, because I was running on nothing so my tank was like Come on, you could keep doing it no. yeah we are. Really, for not I mean they don't really even inspect it like I thought they do you know it's just an appraisal, so they take pictures and that's about it. really good to see that my paint job is crappy because I cannot paint but yet Nick constantly wants me to paint things the cabinets we painted the bathroom we can you know, we have the walls and I can't do the cracks worth and dawn its texture walls, so they suck. So we're selling your House. No, no, we just want to lower interest rate."
252.0,Provider,Oh OK OK.
9506.0,Patient,"yeah we're thinking about selling I mean it did it prices for 650 we might just do that so even though where we live, the market is so high right now it's ridiculous."
252.0,Provider,yeah it really is.
9506.0,Patient,"It is so like yeah we can pocket that extra hundred and 50 grand but then wireless unless we're going to move out of state which. It is California there's benefits and a lot of negatives to, but we were born here, we were raised here so it's hard. And our families here what little we do have."
252.0,Provider,"it's like Where would you go and what would you do, you can go buy a you know, a piece of property in Montana or Colorado or someplace."
9506.0,Patient,"is seriously like, but he changes like it was Idaho then Idaho got to populated, then it was this one, but it got to whatever and then it was this one now it's on Montana utah. it's always making plans to move out of state but he's a boy and or like that in his brain."
252.0,Provider,So funny. yeah don't forget the winters.
9506.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and he's just really he doesn't want the kids to get the code vaccine either, and you know now they just approve that. So yeah that's a lot on his mind or some younger yeah five to 12 can now get it, or something and. I don't know he just doesn't like the fact that it's not actually part of the virus the vaccine is a man made you know thinking it's not actually they didn't take the virus and. Put anti bodies in a virus they made a chemical and made it like that, so that's him i'm like i'll take the vaccine, I could care less i'll just assume if something happens. In that month."
252.0,Provider,"But if you look on when you go and you, you have to sign a piece of paper before that you get the vaccine. Oh, and that paperwork states in there, that if there's any anything happens any side effects they're not responsible."
9506.0,Patient,yeah my mom did have an epileptic shock when she got it they had to give her. The EPI right there. Men catch her whole throat soiled up and she couldn't breathe.
252.0,Provider,yeah i'm.
9506.0,Patient,"not sure about the different things are happening, you know they had heart problems they have this and that. And Tory some."
252.0,Provider,yeah either which way and I think the thing the one debate. That I hear a lot about is the fact that even if you get the vaccine you're still you can still get covered.
9506.0,Patient,"My aunt did she got the vaccine in attack Cobra twice. Since getting the vaccine. yeah and her friend blog he's been in the hospital he got Cobra twice, even though they gave him a vaccine it's weird yeah it's supposed to lower your chances of getting it, but it doesn't."
252.0,Provider,make this less.
9506.0,Patient,yeah I guess.
252.0,Provider,"You want a few of the symptoms lasses what, if you read, if you read that fine print that's what it."
9506.0,Patient,says okay.
252.0,Provider,That it makes some of the city makes some of the symptoms less severe.
9506.0,Patient,"Yet different people have less severe symptoms when they get it because of how their body reacts it's a big thing it is it's big but. Why not enough, because you know, there is no right or wrong answer, I think, to that it's just a personal thing, and the fact that the government is trying to make it not personal is bullshit whether you choose to take it or not, is not their business it's not for them to regulate."
252.0,Provider,yeah I don't think so either.
9506.0,Patient,yeah We were worried because. Because our daughter went to Hawaii and they were having an outbreak she had to be co tested before and now Nick is making her go get a covert test right now. As he yeah he wants to make sure so yeah I don't like I don't care as long as you don't have the symptoms it's whatever but i'm a little he's he's a little more uptight than I am.
252.0,Provider,"They say that. You can spread the coven without with having any symptoms. Is what I heard, I mean there's just a lot and it's like what do you believe what do you don't believe what do you think what do you not think you know what what direction is it that you should go right, so I just choose to stay in my own book."
9506.0,Patient,"Right right yeah, the problem is is popping bubbles."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
9506.0,Patient,"You might not have a job or be able to go the grocery store. Because they want your bubble to be popped for them, so I don't know. yeah that gets less states aren't implementing it, you know because they feel it is against our constitutional right so."
252.0,Provider,I think it is. You know. I think you should be choice.
9506.0,Patient,"yeah it definitely should be a choice, especially because we're Americans damn it. hey fucking choices what."
252.0,Provider,Was the have to meet them.
9506.0,Patient,Did you guys right we're not freaking China we're not in Korea. isn't our leader. So yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah that's a big thing that causes so much anxiety for people, you know."
9506.0,Patient,"It does it does it not me personally, well, it does because nickel go started, because it causes him issues and then i'm like well baby but i'm sorry that it does, but because I don't pay attention I stay in my bubble and that's not affecting my bubble I got enough issues in my bubble. kids and dogs and cats that's my bubble and house that's too much responsibility for me."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9506.0,Patient,Being an adult sucks.

Okay it's a commercial yeah YouTube you know the little show ins and he doesn't know how to do the remote. Oh, the fact that they watch YouTube on the TV."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you know one good thing is, you can see what they're watching you know."

252.0,Provider,"Oh no, no, no. yeah because we live in a small town Rio vista so we don't worry, you know."
9506.0,Patient,"I mean it could happen anywhere but we don't worry is me, you know."
252.0,Provider,As much yeah.
9506.0,Patient,"yeah so. You want to add for that. I don't know how parents do it when it's when it's bad, but I guess if you don't know any different."
252.0,Provider,Different. That is exactly right.
9506.0,Patient,Because I was raised in a bad area in bad schools. But I didn't know any different I thought that was just the way life was that your gang banger and data dead in. The venous blood our trip was normal.
252.0,Provider,"Right there's no more to life, but that."
9506.0,Patient,"yeah right. So yeah. yeah. Yes, well then, in Florida, I was in a very nice neighborhood and yet one of the girls in high school still had her baby in the bathroom yeah then abandon it in the garbage can."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
9506.0,Patient,"She was in my class and she left the room, because she was having stomach pains. Know Mike and i'm in a nice area and that still happen so. um. But no i'm good i'm good i'm not being, as you know. it's just been been taking when you have when you have things you have to take care of you don't have time for self wallowing so. yeah there I have felt like i'm not enough because i've been ignoring my kids to get my house done and then it's like mom can you play with me and i'm like i'm so sorry but I can I can't play I have got to do this, so now i'm going to try to play more this week and get on that."
252.0,Provider,"yeah you get the responsibilities done, you know and think about it this way to what you're teaching them by doing your responsibilities and then playing afterwards is exactly that the responsibilities have to be done, and then we can play afterwards. Right."
9506.0,Patient,"yeah I need to give them more responsibilities Nick keeps telling me they can do it themselves, they can do it and i'm like well, they could do it, but then I had to go back and do it again because they didn't do it, the way it should have been done. yeah so. yeah yeah stead of all the toys that were out from under the bed, I have to go back after they've cleaned it and take those toys out from underneath."
252.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly exactly. But at the same if you think about it in a whole nother way you think about it well they're trying to do their part, is it exactly how you want it, no. But they're trying to and that's what matters they're learning how to pick up after themselves it's later on yeah. me."
9506.0,Patient,My gosh that's a ringer for you.
252.0,Provider,"that's the ringer. it's when you get when they get older, when you say OK so. The exact way you clean your room is your toys go there you close go there for dirty and they get put away right. Right little it's like they'll clean up your toys up they'll put pick them up out of the room for mom, that is what your tour is today. that's your responsibility and then they're going to go do it and they're not going to do it, the way that you want them to Of course you got to expect that right so. Putting that value into them."
9506.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,"You know. You get you get your responsibility done mom gets her son, and then we have free time."
9506.0,Patient,"You know okay gotcha and the problem is, though, then I tell them that they didn't do it right, and then they feel bad and then they don't want to do it."
252.0,Provider,"Right and so not telling them that they did bad. What i'll do with my granddaughter is i'll go and do it one time with her. Okay, look. Where did you get the toys from. The Toy box, well then that's where the toys need to go back to oh. And so, then she'll say as long as i'm there and put them in the toy box where did you get your shoes from this morning. i'm the shoe Rack. Can you put them back in and see."
9506.0,Patient,"Okay. hey yeah I think I need to redo the room, they have. You know the cubbies from Ikea. They have so many bins and so many choices to put their stuff. And I like it all separated by stuff like this is for cooking this is for dollars, this is for babies that it gets to be an issue and they can't do that. You know they are, they could but they don't have the tedious and whatever the patience, for it."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
9506.0,Patient,You know it'll take me two hours to get it organized how I want it and it takes them five seconds to do it unorganized and yet so maybe I just need a toy box here just put them back in the box.
252.0,Provider,"Totally and you know really think about it, lowering that expectation for right now with them. Okay, you know that lowering that expectation is going to alleviate stress for."
9506.0,Patient,You okay. You know it's just them doing the actual act not how they do it it's them doing it. Exactly okay.
252.0,Provider,"I can do later on later on that's when you teach them the actual. Exactly how it's supposed to be done, but just getting them to do and praising them after they've done it, you know what I mean."
9506.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,"Because they don't want to do it, because what they hear is they didn't do it right, instead of you get that out of there, and you just praise them for doing it. Okay, give a mama time man mommy done."
9506.0,Patient,"yeah minor bit of perfectionist when they're doing certain things they break down like my son was trying to write the letter b yesterday, and he didn't do exactly how we wanted, so it was a good. 10 minutes of crying and screaming at himself, because he couldn't make the be the way he wanted it to."
252.0,Provider,"I know we're like it's okay you try that's the important part, you did it son no all right."
9506.0,Patient,What do you do for that.
252.0,Provider,I tell I would tell if I wish I had that problem. I would just practice it.
9506.0,Patient,yeah practice makes perfect you gotta keep try try try you'll get better in the but it's not in their brain it's like I tell them but. But we're all hard on ourselves so.

252.0,Provider,cookie.
