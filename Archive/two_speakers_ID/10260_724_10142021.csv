If I I got locked up did three years and then I got out on the mental health diversion. that's two years long so all my charges are pending right now and I got out to crossroads and basically part of that was. To get a therapist or whatever. I ended up getting on the spots and Program. which you guys, are the ones that control that so I just ended up you know getting with you guys I guess."
724.0,Provider,A pride heart controls the. subject. Like for the for like the local area or.
10260.0,Patient,"No there's those Dale or that controls for the local area or chantelle so. Okay there's two people so. I ended up just going to therapy there and. You know, and just working out I guess."

10260.0,Patient,"I mean they actually believe in other pretty relaxed that everything i'm supposed to be. You know, part of it was supposed to go through crossroads, or something like crossroads, and so the have a therapist which they're supposed to provide but they don't."
724.0,Provider,crossroads.
10260.0,Patient,"know the county. Okay, and then. I have to check in with him three times a week. I have to drug test with them as many times they want, but so far, it seems like the only thing I need to do for them is call them on Mondays and Fridays. and check in with them physically on Wednesdays and give them a drug test on Wednesdays so. And I also have probation which I see on Wednesday so just kind of works out I guess."
724.0,Provider,"So you're you're compliant up to their standards currently. yeah okay all right well that's good um. So did you always have Holland, you have a. Chemical dependency problem with narcotics, how long was that for."
10260.0,Patient,"pretty much my whole life, you know started smoking weed at 12 and drinking a 12 and. You know in high school moved up to do an ecstasy and. crank and all that good stuff and then heroin and you know. I mean the last six months before I got I got arrested was like honestly the cleans have ever been which I was just smoking weed and drinking at that time, so you know, and I had been clean off dope for like all those six months so. Then I went to jail and. Oh, or a fiver been there it's pretty it's pretty shitty so."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
10260.0,Patient,"I mean, whatever drugs came in, you know I do for sure. And when I got out, you know just already planned on not doing anything so. Just worked out, you know. You know."
724.0,Provider,"that they have a suboxone program while you're incarcerated. I know, yes, some place did you get on that program while you were there. yeah okay all right, so, then you just continued when you when you love all right. yeah what's your what's your dose at currently."
10260.0,Patient,"it's for. Four milligrams four times a day. But. that's why i'm prescribed but I mean sometimes you know, sometimes I don't need that many, sometimes I do it's just whatever you know."
724.0,Provider,Did you do you ever get like a timeline for how long you want to be on it for or like an expectation.
10260.0,Patient,"Oh no I don't really have an expectation for just. it's just working for. It just doing what it's supposed to be doing for right now, you know. I mean I don't know i'm I don't plan on being on the rest of my life for sure, but. as of right now, it just it's it's helping. it's no it's just helping."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
10260.0,Patient,there's no any you know so.
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean like you know the the chemical makeup of buprenorphine and you know the. locks on stone doesn't shop like whatever it was designed to do it doesn't.
10260.0,Patient,well.
724.0,Provider,You have any any cravings or any desire to use or you're just completely over that.
10260.0,Patient,"I mean. Right now, just with with how this box and then like I don't really get cravings. I mean you know. At some point i'm sure I will once I started going to lower and lower doses and stuff but. As for right now, you know just. doing the job."
724.0,Provider,"Any any mental health concerns depression, anxiety and the history of trauma."
10260.0,Patient,"I mean everyone has trauma in their life, you know, but I mean i'm diagnosed ptsd you know and. that's supposedly why whatever happened happened. The doctor say I guess and. No. No."
724.0,Provider,Did you go to like keep like any kind of like like therapy for like while you're incarcerated or post incarceration or was it just crossroads and then this.
10260.0,Patient,"Essentially uh. yeah I mean it's just it was just crossroads and then this i've been out for about six or seven months and. that's the whole point of the diversion is there, supposed to be hooking me up with the right people to see, and all that, but they are not basically. I don't check in with them."
724.0,Provider,"You know, have you asked them to. provide you with the the means for the additional like ancillary services like that to talk to like a mental health professional or it. Because it sounds like like like there's if you're not asking they're not offering so it's like you know. what's going to work any harder."
10260.0,Patient,"Like a person i'm the person that i'm meeting with on Wednesdays is supposedly my therapist. Okay, but she doesn't really it's more like when I show up like she's like is there anything new that's happened in the last week i'm like not really it's just working on I just like okay cool. Is the drug test. i'll see you next week."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you guys aren't doing any real clinical unpacking if you will. know all right um well, I mean if you want like you and I, like living you and I will we be individually individually we're supposed to talk and do like real therapy, but the group therapy is really. like an opportunity for people to you know express like again like how how things are going for them, currently, you know get some insight give some feedback all that kind of good stuff the group that we're in currently people aren't very. Like they don't they're not jelling so much to where they constantly provide each other, like emotional support or peer support answer like what the groups are for arm so it's unfortunate that that there isn't more Community in that group. Because that's ideally that's what it's intended for but you and I could talk about like like trauma and all that kind of stuff I got a history of trauma."
10260.0,Patient,To the other groups actually do that.
724.0,Provider,"There are some groups where they gel more you know they're more tight knit if you will. But then they're just subgroups where it's like pulling teeth sometimes and that's across like all all clinical levels that i've ever worked, you know, sometimes it's just that's just how it goes. And as people come and go, you know the the dynamic sometimes shifts and like have a more positive productive way and then sometimes it even gets worse so. It helps when there's like a community and a group is that's why it's important but."
10260.0,Patient,Being.
724.0,Provider,That too much in that current group that we're in.
10260.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'm not really much of a you know murli much of a person who's been trained to unpack is you know. You know his feelings, especially in a big group of people, I have no idea who they are."
724.0,Provider,"yeah and really that that's not where a lot of that. That you know therapeutic value is supposed to happen, you know as a whole but they're supposed to be a little bit more like given take. But really like that the real progress is made like when you. You go like one on one with like that therapists like that's where it's really supposed to happen is you don't want to air out all your dirty laundry in front of. Like a bunch of strangers, because you can't trust everybody to knock you out outside of the group report what they heard now so a lot of people guard, especially like trauma groups and depression group stuff like that things that are where people get. Vulnerable yeah they. do that too much in a big group but. The expectation is that. A little bit more than what we currently do and I group but. it'll happen potentially supposed to happen organically but yeah I mean like you and I over time it's like as we continue to meet one on one like this, we will build like like a rapport and. You know, like anything else, like things will come up. Through natural conversation and then like we talked about it like that way you know i'm not going to be like tell me about when you were eight years old, you know, like us to hold. Your breath for a lot of people, so I tend to be the type that goes like free forum conversation we talk and then naturally things will come up and then we'll just. we'll just talk about it and I got like a real setting like how most people should communicate i'm not like Robin Williams from Google haunting i'm not that type of therapists. goal orientated and. Realistic I have like like like i've been to war and i've seen light like this shitty side of like the world, and you know my my perspective is. A lot different than like other therapists unless they come from, like a similar background. You know, so I mean so like I have reasonable expectations on people and and how far but, like the push them and. When they're willing to give it up and when they're not going to like scale back, like the intensity and all that kind of stuff it's just really it's more natural to be goal orientated. You know solution based you know I tell people like. You can't really change your past, unfortunately, you know you can't pick your family, unfortunately, you are who you are can pick what's skin color you are it's not up to you, you know what I mean, like all these little things so unless you have a time machine. can't go back and undo it as much as we would like to So how do we move forward, you know, with the consequences that we've caused. that's more my that's more my move, you know what I mean like, how do we fix what's currently fixable and then what you can't fix it's like. We can address it, we can talk about it get comfortable with it and learn to accept it and then try to move on. You know a lot of people like to be stuck you know, some people are really good at moving on from past experiences that they've done or been part of. And then, some people prefer to stay stuck so if you're not that type of guy and you kind of want to move on we'll talk about. Some of the old shit and then we'll just move on to present day, and how do we, how do we move forward, how do we stay compliant with. You know this program, how do we stay compliant with your P O, how do we avoid you from having to go back you know behind the walls you all that kind of shit, how do we keep your job, stable, how do we get your finances stable. that's more of my like that's more my methodology, if anything like i'm not going to use big fancy words i'm not i'm not that smart and honestly like I don't. Care enough to remember. Like all that stuff I. Am solution based so like if you've got a problem we can talk about the problem and then come up with a mutually agreed upon solution and try it out and see if it works and boom keep it moving like that's how I operate."
10260.0,Patient,"It seems as if, though. I don't know like when i'm i'm sitting there in the group therapy like i'm hearing all these people that like have these problems that like are just devastating for them, and like from a third person perspective, like. Being where I was like that's not really devastating it's like I don't know I just like. Like there's there's a lot of shitty things that happen like I don't I i'm fucking you know, obviously have a roommate and i'm fucking on a bunk bed or whatever, but like. Like i'm thankful to be here, instead of where I was a year ago, you know. Right now, I mean this isn't quite on my own, but i'm I mean within the last seven months I went from not even owning my own pair of shoes to. I got a closet full of clothes that track tools just pretty much almost everything I need really I mean on a basic level yeah you know i'm taking care of my bills i'm just moving forward, I mean i'm sure there are things in the past that like kind of. make me act certain ways I guess like you know. No, I mean. You know one thing I have noticed is that. Like i'm not as outgoing. Like. actually looking for like a relationship that's. You know which. Everyone, you know everyone enjoys relationship keeps them company I shit but i'm just like we."
724.0,Provider,seems like your focus is you right now. And yeah and so much more energy for for somebody else.
10260.0,Patient,"yeah I mean that's that's what it is, but also me I just i'm like Okay, which is being alone. You know a lot of people want to go out like hang out people i'm just I just I don't I don't."
724.0,Provider,know and that's.
10260.0,Patient,"I kind of feel like that is not. By not like the healthiest thing 24 seven but it just feels right it's almost like. that's kind of what I was programmed to do from get locked up just. know. yeah yeah. I definitely feel like a jail and prison, and all that good stuff is kind of. dictates, a lot of what I do right now but I mean you know it's a it was a correctional facility, and I feel like I took the right things out of it. yeah like I did a lot of fucked up shit there yeah for sure, just like any anyone does you know it's California politics, you know you know survive, but uh. You know I keep like keep everything I have organized. All my shirts and pants and stuff are hung up. Dirty clothes in the basket. bed domain yeah I was just I got yeah I got a lot of discipline from and. You know it actually helped me grow up a lot. yeah I mean it sucks that I got three years taken away from my life but uh. I mean I wouldn't if I have to go back and change I wouldn't yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Well, I mean. The response in the change lives within the name it's it's corrections, you know what I mean like. You know what are two things happen with people that are in corrections they either come out. mildly marginally exponentially corrected, you know they picked up like all the good habits or they come out and they picked up all the bad habits and they just reoffend they just go back you know what I mean so. They don't get corrected like, but the goal is like anything else it's the you know. In this country you commit a crime okay should happen circumstances whatever once you serve that time you're supposed to be given like your second opportunity that's like that's how supposed to work that's really it is I worked in corrections and I know that's not the case. You know I know for a fact that's not the case yeah not even close not even close like I worked in a in the. At the time, was the largest. State run work release program in Florida, we have like. 350. In Mesa within their final year of their sentencing they've come to us. They still had to maintain dlc policies, all that kind of good stuff. But we help them get back into the Community get jobs. pay bills restitution all that kind of shit. What I learned was. leave their. it's really hard right so."
10260.0,Patient,They have to take these bs.
724.0,Provider,Because they're. selling or whatever their record.
10260.0,Patient,Show.
724.0,Provider,"It really hard to buy a house or rent a house right they have to go to. section eight low income housing. Low income jobs, you know I mean so they put them right back into into the community that they just left prior to getting incarcerated. And then we expect them to do something different, you know what I mean like it to a certain degree, it sends a lot of people up for failure, it really does, I saw that like firsthand like it's frustrating. So I know it's. it's hard it's it's beyond hard and sometimes it's it's on achievable so some of the expectations that's what on people when they come on up here."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. That was a. That was like one of the biggest let Downs I had was that uh when I got out. of landing an awesome job as a solar contractor like it was honestly. Like they're decades for firing me, but like if they were to hire if they had offered me a job, again I take it. It was something I saw myself doing, you know as career it made Hella good money benefits everything that people were good work with you know everything, but secondly found I was a felon they're like Oh well, we can't we can't have that in our. In our company, so you know it was actually a very first time I was a guest discriminated against, for being a felon and no yeah. let's just set up."
724.0,Provider,"Yes, it hurts it hurts on a lot of levels hurts your hurts your pocket, you know here's your bottom line and it hurts to like your. Your morality five, most importantly, you know what I mean look at this thing because it's like it's not a reflection of who you are it's like a mile mile reflection of what you bench, and I mean like to assume that people cannot change is pretty ignorant know it's pretty. Now. If you remain compliant with your P O, and all that kind of stuff do you lose the the the felony record, or what what's what's the conditions."
10260.0,Patient,"Now I mean i've been i've been a felon for 21 years 1011 years 11 years. Since 2010 so I have, I have you know, a couple felonies on the board right now. For 2010 I could probably get that one expunged right now, from 2016 i'm on probation for a couple of felonies and. Actually i'm eligible to get off probation in November on those so those will still be on my record, but after I get. After I do the mental health diversion all the all the charges i'm on the mental health diversion for get dropped. Okay, like they never existed so and then I mean years down the line I can go and you know, obviously, after I pay my fine and stuff I can. You know, try and get my. felonies reduced to misdemeanors and expunged and stuff like that, but you."
724.0,Provider,"You got some you got options, you know their long term options, but they're they're not exist, so."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no i'm not gonna I mean. i'm. i'm smart enough to be able to navigate around being a felons. You know i'm not gonna lie i've been a felon stop me, and I can go work at fucking mcdonald's you know anything like that, like right now, I have a job that pays just as good as that solar contractor job. But he knows the whole get down. Basically. After that solar contractor job I got hired and let go from like four different jobs, before I even set foot and got to clock in because I was a felon. So basically I went on craigslist I post my resume and a short little paragraph of like who I was felonies I had you know just basically my past a little bit, and I was like who can Fuck with it i'm a really good employee."
724.0,Provider,Right.
10260.0,Patient,"And then Sure enough, this guy's son actually saw me his 16 year old son saw me on the CRATE on craigslist was like hey you need to give this guy a shot, so I went for an interview, and it turns out. Basically, you know he owns this company and we're all birds of a feather they're all they all had drug habits, at some point they're all like 20 something years clean lot of them been to prison but not like the last 20 years now they're all just changed their lives around so. You know they gave me the opportunity to so i'm just. i'm blessed to be able to be around them. No."
724.0,Provider,"Good yeah I mean there are there are like communities that do exist within that world like this really got like a website where it's like hire felons COM or some some stuff like that, but. You know, they were like nonprofits I believe that, given people like a second chance in a second opportunity. So i'm glad that you got something with that that's that's a positive for sure. um."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah you know it turns out that uh my boss actually. used to go to the same church or my my dad used to go the same churches him, I guess, my dad's church yeah you still the same church together and stuff so. it's pretty close knit I guess."
724.0,Provider,"Oh good, are you religious."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I don't really. Go to church just because. I really got the time for right now, but I do practice privately for sure you know, I definitely have a good relationship with God and. I usually pray every night, and you know, keep in touch with them and stuff so."
724.0,Provider,Good all these things don't matter. So outside of the the post traumatic any other concerns anxiety depression anything that you are you like medicated for or. A therapy for things that you're dealing with.
10260.0,Patient,"I mean i'm on. wellbutrin. And gabba penton for anxiety, I guess, because anxiety does play a big factor in a lot of things i've done. You don't. For a long time, I mean. Even before math I was a pretty paranoid person like. I tend to. Think, the worst and people, you know uh but it's fucked up because it's usually the right answers. You know."
724.0,Provider,So you like your judge of character you got like a like a like a low sniff test for bullshit.
10260.0,Patient,"yeah well, the thing is. Like in certain situations i'm like Okay, this is what this guy is going to do, and people like, how do you know that's like because that's what I would do."
724.0,Provider,"Okay. Reflection when I look like what what's the word i'm looking for. He has a word for another fancy word that I don't remember, but I know what you're talking about."
10260.0,Patient,"well. I still recognize those things, but I try I try not to be that person, you know I don't lie, you know I just. I just try to be the best person I can every day, you know. that's it."
724.0,Provider,"All right, good listen pretty informative. I mean we don't really get a whole lot like I said earlier, like like I don't really get too much insight into people like especially like in that group because a lot of people reserved. But then like when I do like the individuals. it's definitely better because now, now I get it, you know what I mean like I understand a little bit more we get I got patients and other groups, where you know they don't say anything and then, when I get an individual sessions I can't get them to be quiet. You know, half the time, so it makes sense that it's better that way um any any history of self harm anything like that any thoughts of hurting yourself."
10260.0,Patient,Now.
724.0,Provider,And nothing in the past month or so.
10260.0,Patient,No okay. No i've never really been that person.
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so yeah, how do you think how, how do we do like I don't want to keep you for too long, I told you that we can keep it like short and simple in the beginning, and as we we go on naturally things Oh, you know they'll go longer I don't know."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's a. it's it's not bad like i'm you know, like the program and stuff it's just like I said, like I just laid down after work and I just am lucky I woke up at 615 yeah like I just I didn't even know I went to sleep, you know it's just."
724.0,Provider,"It happens when you know I work where like a lot of you know, blue collar guys and stuff like that. You know I thought I was in the military, so I know I know exactly what it's like to like. we're saying, where it was like. You know don't stand when you can sit don't sit when you can lay down, it was like get your sleep, where you can get it, you know. don't run when you can walk all those little cliche saying so, so I know what it's like to like bust your ass all day and then sit down and fall asleep, and not even though. and have somebody else to wake you up so yeah I mean it's tough you're out there you're hustling it's bound to happen set alarms man it's like the best thing that you can do it's like the one failsafe that will I was reoccurring alarms."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah I mean yeah I don't mind the you know. Welcome, on the one on one you know it's not bad you're a good person you seen. not trying to smoke blow smoke up my ass or anything so."
724.0,Provider,"No definitely not know because I don't get anything out of that, and you know, on the flip side with people that. Like I started out in residential and I worked in methadone programs and. I used to have people like try to get over on me and I would tell them up front it's like look man like these programs out for me like i'm not here to get. therapy or anything like that i'll be here because I generally give a shit about people and I want them to get back on track is. I have belief in humanity, you know I mean like considering what i've seen and been through. it's like I believe that people can do better, you know it's within our nature to do cool things but it's also our nature to be like super giving and compassionate so. I feel like that cathartic Lee I get more out of that than anything so it's like if people want to bullshit their program like like they don't bullshit me man I get like it's. easy to tell it's like if you if you want it, you want it, if you don't come back when you do it's cool man like I got no hard feelings and you know not easily offended so you know. For for everybody, so. yeah We live in an interesting world and we're lucky to be part of it, you know, sometimes it's not always fair or just or anything like that, but it's still it's better than the alternative that's for sure no so."
10260.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
724.0,Provider,that's for sure.
10260.0,Patient,it's true no.
724.0,Provider,"Well alright so. um. i'll schedule a follow up with you and apply like a couple weeks and then i'll See you in group. So you want to do like this time again, this is work for you."
10260.0,Patient,"Yes, words."
724.0,Provider,"All right, let me see if I can find something a couple weeks from now. yeah when you get time like do your surveys I tell people like like on a Sunday night, do you work Monday through Friday with your work. On Sunday night. Take 20 minutes log into that that link wherever the survey is, if you don't have the link next time you call have them email. Like the link with the surveys book market Sunday night get into whatever they have in front of you, if it's the BAM whatever it is, do your surveys it's one less thing that we can hassle you on. They are important in the Grand scheme of things as far as state and federal regulations go, we don't just do it to you know. hijack people's medication that's like this, the one controlling thing that we have like over the patient and his level of care so like Sunday night get on do your surveys and don't worry about them until next. Next Sunday, you know a lot of people try to do it before the group and that's when you're supposed to do it i'd imagine that that would get complicated if you're running late for work and. got all kinds of shit going on with your week so pick a night where you're not super busy you get on take 10 minutes go dawn don't worry about them for a week pretty easily."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean I had that that that was my schedule for a long time. No looking. My skills, has been back for a while, but uh I mean I haven't missed I missed the group yet yesterday. yep no I didn't think about it at lunchtime, I was like I remember, I have this group, you know and even came up on my on my calendar thing, but I just. When I came down to it, the second I got off work I. forgot what I was doing yesterday, but if I can no, no, no, I fucked a big part of it, too, is I fucked up my knee last week and it got infected to her like my entire like late is sore so I went to the hospital on Saturday know Monday the antibiotics take ibuprofen for it and stuff and. We has just been. that's pretty much in my thought process for the last week is just a stupid fucking leg, you know but."
724.0,Provider,"yeah antibiotics you gotta be careful to man, because you know, on top of killing like bad bacteria kills the good bacteria in your stomach to and then people get all screwed up so tired."
10260.0,Patient,"Because the reason why it's as bad as it is right now is because I was just relying on my immune system to kill it off, but it got to the point where like I felt like my legs just be chopped off, you know. it's it's a little pet on my. knee but irradiated all the way of my growing it's like."
724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I can hear you talking about yes in itself in the hospital yep yeah it's like a. yeah you gotta be careful, sometimes they start out like a staph infection and then it turns into immersive and then it turns into sepsis and yes it's all bad news, no. yeah in fact that, like the one of the main honorees like in your thigh and then spread up like that's not good so it's good that you went to the hospital got antibiotics it's really good."
10260.0,Patient,"yeah I try not to because yeah, the more you use antibiotics less they work."
724.0,Provider,"Right, which then to like people typically will stop using the second that they feel good and then you know things get even more complicated. there's a running theory on why we have like antibiotic resistant like a viruses and stuff now is that. Soldiers when they're overseas and they got shot up and we're on the ground, they took in dirt and bacteria that wasn't common here in the States and when they brought it back. They they spread it that's why versus like really big and hospitals, especially in the va hospitals, so they blame it on the soil. Just yep."

Saving private Ryan that guy's got a canvassers is like Italy and all kinds of stuff and a lot of us are like yeah we'll just take take the sand from over here and say this is where we were in the right nope absolutely not for that shut up."
