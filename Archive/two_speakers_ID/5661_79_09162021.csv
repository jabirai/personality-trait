79.0,Provider,eat outside.
5661.0,Patient,yeah I can live on personally and the like. But I think we have sausage truth it looks like faking.
79.0,Provider,river her know that.
5661.0,Patient,Often.
79.0,Provider,i've never but it's just.
5661.0,Patient,Interesting yeah i'm gonna try that.

5661.0,Patient,Men put a. Big list of things like the veggies and. Things that I will need all of that stuff. and have it here so. yeah things that can be next matching. Too much fun.
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah no that's okay sounds great cool Okay, moving on them, because I think you've got a handled um any any concerns about when they are here, are you able to eat in front of them do you need to kind of establish I need to I need to ground I need to make sure that I. Know act activate little bit of safety system."
5661.0,Patient,"Eating and i'm going to be. Eating in front of them it's just sitting down and people. And only time I. Typically, do, that is, when I go out to a restaurant."
79.0,Provider,and A totally different than Nice.
5661.0,Patient,"yeah and they are going to fully expect sitting around the table for you and hope that everyone else will. Again, that will be difficult, because then it is focused on your eating in a restaurant it's more focused on visiting with either one."
79.0,Provider,"yeah I mean this is something when we very, very first met right was one of your goals is that you wanted to be able to sit with your family at the table. something you wanted, maybe this is just an annoying opportunity."
5661.0,Patient,When I kind of. I kind of let it go and we've done it a few times. Like yeah you did and it's not. We didn't force anyone to sit down everybody just kind of naturally came and sat down.
79.0,Provider,"And now, do you feel like you need to officially have everybody come."
5661.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, good because I I bet they'll be fine there they know your kids are older. When kids are older, they kind of come and go, you know a little bit. I don't really."
5661.0,Patient,"know, everybody should all families gather."
79.0,Provider,What is this your. I do moms.
5661.0,Patient,"moms we've always found an old and not with my dad and my dad we have TV trays. I guess, we did it together when we were both home together, but we thought in the living room with our TV tray and I think it becomes a problem when you're trying to force it just wasn't natural for us to sit down anymore and. Yes, force when we. did before so it's. Not the end all it's not going to end the family."
79.0,Provider,it's a different thing with little kids versus teens and young adults.
5661.0,Patient,"You know, try so much to focus on it now, it will that will be the role of the family. threatening to make everyone sit down if that's the goal and it can't happen."
79.0,Provider,yeah and you put so much effort into.
5661.0,Patient,That happy family.
79.0,Provider,"Yes. read it. yeah way to do the spirit of the law of it, you know that's a perfect example. yeah."
5661.0,Patient,we'll figure it out.
79.0,Provider,So.
5661.0,Patient,The only one here because everybody be gone from us moving.
79.0,Provider,"yeah envision like you're sitting at the table is there, what is available to you in that room to just kind of ground if you do start to get kind of. You know, on edge and uncomfortable as a way to kind of ground."
5661.0,Patient,That on the right side of the table that I can look at my.
79.0,Provider,"painting oh I love that. That yeah mm hmm perfect I love that and usually once you've established where you sit. People follow suit you know. yeah that's cool so yeah put your put your cut by that spot. payment. That sounds good anything else, like the four corners or. Deep breathing. time for medical mean."
5661.0,Patient,breathing for sure.
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah sounds good, I had a young girl in my office, two days ago cross country runner even. The girl doesn't know how to die for medic freeze I was like you have got to learn this this is causing some of your problems because she's. throwing up without you know, meaning to really anyway, and then like we got to get your diaphragm working properly it's not she couldn't do it for the life of her when you breathe, then push out her belly. And she cross country runs I was astounded."
5661.0,Patient,All three of my time and never. never worked with them on that.
79.0,Provider,seat.
5661.0,Patient,And kids all.
79.0,Provider,"And then they get side effects and stuff. So my my kids coach maybe he was just an anomaly, but he definitely work taught them how to die for matic padam lay down. get their belly you know going."
5661.0,Patient,To choir teacher.
79.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense. Anyway, okay let's let's talk about the mapping and. You know what what's the goal with this. What would you like, for the goal to be I guess."
5661.0,Patient,"would like to just. eat, what I want. What about thinking about it."
79.0,Provider,mm hmm and.
5661.0,Patient,"know that I will know that I will just stop because i'm full. not be worried about all. The things I never read a story about. A white thing and. where it came from. main. yeah now I think that'll ever. Fully go away, I still. don't think the freshest."
79.0,Provider,Wrong yeah.
5661.0,Patient,But just you know. Just not. refuse it if it comes by me.
79.0,Provider,yeah there there's a lot of. Things that could change about our food system that would be good. You know it's kind of the. not throwing the baby out with the bathwater accepting the imperfections and in the system and. yeah being okay with with how things are that we can't fix it all. You know I I don't think that's fair. I don't know.
5661.0,Patient,I let it just let all that stuff goes and eating the way I want isn't difficult anyone.
79.0,Provider,Can.
5661.0,Patient,"Take this going. I want things to be a certain way and if I can't get them a certain way or there's a distraction that something else is there to, then I don't and I neglect to even just what I want. and love all the vegetables and stuff and."
79.0,Provider,Can.
5661.0,Patient,"get a wonderful vegetables and all these things. But then, all these other things are screaming at me and i'm so that I don't even do that yeah and I wind up eating, something I didn't want to eat, which is silly because I could so easily meeting what I wanted, I will just. get it. Right."
79.0,Provider,"And it's serving up a check point purpose and you still need kind of a checkpoint. Right, like you, kind of need that so kind of what I wanted to do today, even though it's not totally nutrition, I want you to start on it is. How do you determine if your actions in the day, you know make you a good person and, what is your kind of moral code, so to speak, does that make sense, you know I want I want you to write down your moral code like an example, might be. tell the truth, you know be honest. treat people with respect you know all of those kind of things, it might even include some you know more religious pieces like. I don't know what's what's a religious kind of code that you, you abide by. kind of part of your. How you how you want to live your life."
5661.0,Patient,I think everything that's. Going on through working hard. And being time.
79.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5661.0,Patient,Helping where I can.
79.0,Provider,"So yeah I want you to get that written now, so that when it comes it sort of comes up that you feel shame or guilt or like a bad person because of what you ate that you can kind of see BT yourself and go hang on cognitively. I know that i've got a overlap here, that should not be here it doesn't really belong it doesn't make sense I need to. You know, is it true, you know. type of a thing so like if you ate the oh the pizza you had pizza last week. Right. And you start to feel. Bad and guilty. Then. You know how would you use kind of your list that's kind of your moral code, this is how this is. Not that I want you to totally judge yourself but we can't help it right. we're going to be do I feel okay about my actions in this day and look at that and go. With I you know, mostly honest and mostly kind. And yeah I can answer yes to this and, but yet I felt bad like a bad person eating the pizza. And to just be able to kind of see that. And reorient yourself, you can go that's just old. You know that's all kind of negative thinking that got attached to food, you know and to just clarify again no I I live my life, the best I could today okay. That makes sense kind of."
5661.0,Patient,don't feel like a bad person for not being.
79.0,Provider,A bad person.
5661.0,Patient,No fail at something and not rebound.
79.0,Provider,"Okay. So can we are still apply the failure piece. So you can feel like you're not a failure hey I did abide by my moral code that is my higher law right. You you completely understand that you can't be a perfect person like you get it you don't expect out of other people, you have a really good perspective about that. Except for around food I hate your really have quick judgments and associations with food and honestly, I think it was born out of necessity, the origin of it. Was. Something that in a moment, you could actually have a sense of safety for. But that purpose doesn't need to be served anymore so it's it's a good time to disentangle because. I mean. you're you're amazing you're an amazing courageous woman and i've made some decisions and. done some things to protect yourself and get yourself and safe space does amazing to me."
5661.0,Patient,"Apparently, I looked I looked more balanced. You went my lady told me I look more balanced now."
79.0,Provider,But one of your customers.
5661.0,Patient,know my landlady one owns the business that i'm going to work for because I did tell her what i'm doing in the afternoon I can't do movable.

79.0,Provider,We did.
5661.0,Patient,"yeah and. he's no longer than I have. adopted two children one of her children, you can drag on it. yeah and her husband came from an alcoholic family. Queen."

5661.0,Patient,"The first time I thought, when he came back into town. On the House and it took me a little while to get it through my head, not for. Not for TV. yeah and in."
79.0,Provider,fact it out at him. Know sarna.
5661.0,Patient,and his daughter is the math baby and. She will never be payments on her own. function. To that yeah but she but she knows about things like that. she's really she's a really sweet.
79.0,Provider,"yeah cool yeah hard hard things. yeah so that I mean that's kind of the purpose of having. The two kind of together as ago okay hang on the three orient we don't need this way of coping anymore, where food is a i'm doing good or i'm failing situation because food isn't that way food is just food like we just eat when you're hungry where these human beings that. have to have calories coming in every few hours, like in so many ways we are such a needy thing. there's not make things as needy as a human. You know, we really are a high maintenance. Incredible miraculous and but also high maintenance so on and food needs to just be in we've got enough, you know, otherwise work with. And so, with that that kind of the assignment that I wanted to give you was to practice doing that to catch yourself, when you feel like. Wait. You know i'm starting to feel like oh gosh I eat too much that was going to be those cheetos were the last thing I was going to eat and then go whoa this is, this is the opportunity that clean was talking about now it's my time to look at my moral code and go and let's orient. Am I kind of mostly doing these things. Then I don't need to feel like a failure food is just food and just practice. You what you're doing is you're you're canceling a brain pathway. And you're trying to create a new one and it's not easy it's really hard to even catch the thoughts. So just know when when you have that quiet moment which with your parents that might be even trickier. And, but just see if you can even once a day that was my hope was once a day be able to just practice that. Because that OK cool OK. cool and I want to see the copy of your kind of your. Your moral code your am I, you know doing all right kind of. The morality real religious spiritual peace i'm just next time we talk. So you don't need to send me a picture anything you can share. and i'm spacing on your assignment that it was for last week Oh, it was the mindful eating. How was that for you."
5661.0,Patient,"i'm fine, I think I always pay attention anyway."
79.0,Provider,yeah.
5661.0,Patient,"that's true Okay, the thing that I don't get into as much as my. Food itself, I think I always. feel it tastes and look at. yeah I don't miss anything when it comes. To stop thinking, but. I. I enjoy food."
79.0,Provider,And that's I love that you've kept that intact wow it's just yeah.
5661.0,Patient,"I just find the food ever raised to watch the skies would talk about. Your why we like, why do we like flour and sugar and butter."
79.0,Provider,yeah it's cool.
5661.0,Patient,stuff right there kind of. That you put it all together and it's just the way your your mouth receives it. You need all those things together. To the other thing that. We do. i'm not. i'm not against enjoying my.
79.0,Provider,"agreed. So cool awesome and so are you saying there's something you want to do about connecting with your body, a little bit works again there's reason why there was a disconnect right if there was a safety. piece going on there that's not going to serve that purpose isn't there anymore and it's not going to serve you well. To hold on to that. um is there anything you want to do around it, where you kind of were like Okay, I need to feel my arms touching the Chair What are those called the things your arm rests on armrest. I need to just feel that for a minute. You know, and just do some of that introspective or almost meditative type stuff."
5661.0,Patient,"needs to feel the connection between the food going from my mouth, to invite my body. And being comfortable with that. Knowing knowing when I have time enough. And there's not part of. Well, I get to have a thing too if I let my habit. And I thought, having it and then tonight again later on, but. That was mentioned earlier. yeah not having."
79.0,Provider,"Right and what you've just described is the vulnerability of hunger fullness and i've just being satisfied, it is such a vulnerable place and babies can do it because. When our abilities their thing right like they were born like that."
5661.0,Patient,"They are thinking about tomorrow, oh no, but we do know."
79.0,Provider,"And we have to be willing to go into that vulnerable space and feel safe about it. Because it is true, you know. it's. There is unknowns there right you don't know exactly when you're going to stop you don't know if honestly, you may not habit tomorrow right probably well you're an adult woman, you know you can probably have it again tomorrow but. It is it's vulnerable and so it's uncomfortable. Until you're used to it again and you're like hey I do this and actually. it's nice I like it and you feel safe in it as me I don't know i'm probably just talking gibberish does that make sense at all."
5661.0,Patient,"I can think that way it can happen in. No. it's part of your day, every day, is gonna sound like we live in. stark contrast. that's just part of the routine and maybe i'm telling john one knows about it."
79.0,Provider,yeah that's true with the routine how many hours you're going to work.
5661.0,Patient,"Well, for starters, I told her, I can only work from nine. To."
79.0,Provider,that's a nice start. yeah like that.
5661.0,Patient,"Pushing me to do a few Saturdays here in there. don't want me southerners I understand, nobody wants."
79.0,Provider,That yeah yeah.
5661.0,Patient,Though really and maybe that'll change to.
79.0,Provider,"Maybe maybe do a once a month. yeah like Saturday, or something."
5661.0,Patient,it's not just. One thing right now just by the weekend i'm done. But I want to be able to spend that time with my girl too. Much.
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's true. that's awesome. yeah. And I think. I think that's true the schedule will be a good thing. yeah it's Nice. Okay. i'm like i'm always surprised by the time how fast it goes i'm like I can't believe we have five minutes left. um do you feel like this is helping you like, I want to make sure we're not going down some some rabbit hole of mine, you know."
5661.0,Patient,See the thing that goes through my mind ignore. Work the moral code. already know what's going to trip me up so. Maybe that will change in the next few months.
79.0,Provider,"yeah We really do lead by our thoughts, but it takes time it takes longer than we realize. So your your thoughts will then change your actions and and, ultimately, how you feel really will you'll get that congruence that is just. Nice when when life is in congruence it's it's Nice and and you can have more on that so Oh, did we determine did you want to set a specific goal with like just you know the mindful eating piece where you're just swallowing. and tracing the food. You know. Having that awareness piece, there were I don't know what did you want to do around the kind of connecting with. The files or logical feeling of eating."
5661.0,Patient,"Sometimes I get full like right away, and I know that's not really confidential. Right and then Sometimes I feel like I could probably defeat forever. yeah. I need to find a happy medium there. Just knowing what it feels like people not even mean like completely yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. there's. there's a thing we can do with water, where you drink. Water till you're kind of like over full of water that makes sense kind of makes your stomach kind of not that you're going to drink so much water than it hurts and there's that kind of a it's a little. I don't know i'm really hesitating on this I kind of don't think it's a good idea to be honest. and But it is a very like in session, something that you know, sometimes is done. In eating disorder work. I honestly think that. You know your ability to fill your full. is going to come, you know you're you're eating more regularly than you used to that helps it. You are continuing to process through things your outlook is brightening of course you're going to have debt. right, of course, you are but I honestly your confidence is growing your ability to take care of yourself, is totally growing you've made some honestly amazing shifts and doesn't mean you're going to be perfect at it. But I just think the hunger fullness will come. To I think and again feeling safe the vulnerability. is a big piece to that, I mean you could do a little bit of tracking just the full you know with your food blog. Just. You know, say you don't you can do the numbers, if you want, you know the intuitive eating hunger fullness Gal or you can just be like you know eight. You know, half of the sandwich and gosh I feel so full, I know that doesn't make sense, you know because I hadn't eaten so many hours. And just try to kind of start logging just your experience not trying to make it perfect, but just kind of growing the awareness around the full so you really have good data of what you're experiencing does that make sense. You can decide if you want to do that. But the clinically where you're at right now is keep with the routine. Keep with the routine of eating have your three meals and a couple snacks no longer than five hours without eating ever unless you're unless it's during the night, you know. And the hunger fullness will come and start to settle as long as you're safe if that makes sense fight or flight hunger fullness yes. that's a joke. In if you're in fight or flight mode, most of the time hunger fullness is not going to be there it's just not important in that mode of brains based. So, but you do you notice it that you're more your lesson fighter flight."
5661.0,Patient,yeah right can often feel anxiety creep back up one thing.
79.0,Provider,that's so true.
5661.0,Patient,yeah I was always. Knowing that I have to move in that. way.

5661.0,Patient,"Just like eating. I want all of it. I don't need it all I don't. Like both ways I feel I want it, and then I can I don't really need it."

5661.0,Patient,And i'm like. Middles I got my kids. don't really need underwear.
79.0,Provider,kind of to her. yeah.
5661.0,Patient,"When my daughter was saying that the other day she was trying to say it was a good thing, I was thinking in my head, it was kind of bad because I thought you know it's kind of sad that I could literally live anywhere if it was legal. I adapt I make it work and she thought that was a good thing. doesn't have detachment."
79.0,Provider,I mean.
5661.0,Patient,she loves her stuff she has all these little trinket she loves her stuff but she couldn't walk away from this mom. required. And it wouldn't be that much.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and there's there's a healthy balance to that, and then there could be an extreme okay that's um wait you're not attached enough."
5661.0,Patient,"Right. When we had our last word laughter i'm a little, I could not figure out take. We had a little time to prep because we're going up about us. We had several hours in the night when this. couple of us were just kind of aimlessly wandering around like we literally know even with the packer clothes. Because they will probably need undergarments. We need your toothbrush but really. Nothing seemed to matter anymore."
79.0,Provider,yeah.
5661.0,Patient,circumstance like this is not a fire coming. I need to be able to get selected. I don't want.
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm yep how about most of your adult mind there but also have your little bit of a child childish childlike. You know, some things that are just whimsical and but I love this. It makes me happy. yeah a little bit of both, and it does next week same time. Okay, and it just depends probably a little. Something to me. Okay, so that is the 23rd 10 o'clock am Pacific time unless you know just email me i'm a little bit flexible on Thursdays, although. That we can less not as flexible that just happens to be busier but just let me know. Okay, good work okay hope all goes good with your mom and dad. I would be way overwhelmed if I were in your shoes just saying."

79.0,Provider,"I bet I bet. All right, take care bye see you. bye. Good patient is eating between 1400 and 1700 calories averaging about 1500 calories. Which is a little under her needs but patient did not have any days and no eating, which is good so and the goals is to write down the. The moral code and then also to. Another second goal. is to have body awareness, with the eating. Any other times, where she's connecting with her body thanks."
