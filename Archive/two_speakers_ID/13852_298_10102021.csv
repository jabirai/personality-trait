298.0,Provider,"Oh good good good and I noticed. You know, was it the blue sperone we went up on, let me see if I can. It wasn't the blue springs or the lexapro that we went up on. Both okay and you're noticing just a tad bit difference being on."

298.0,Provider,"that's a good plan. Would you ever want medication for insomnia, I need medicine to help you sleep."

13852.0,Patient,"Yes, it did help a lot."
298.0,Provider,But I give you some traffic don't asleep.
13852.0,Patient,"Yes, please."
298.0,Provider,"And if you want to take just a half a tablet see if it works, you can i'm going to prescribe one tablet, but if you end up needing to tablets that's okay you just gotta let me know what it takes to work. And you know you have had too much. If you just feel so groggy the next morning."
13852.0,Patient,"Then you know too high, of a dose."
298.0,Provider,And and that's that is a thing anything new in your life.
13852.0,Patient,"Unfortunately too bad things um I had a my best friend that i've known since we were 12 which is almost over 40 years here. her father passed which I knew for many years, also. And it was harsh, but the thing is that he was 91 for one and he was starting to get a lot of medical issue with those liver stuff so yeah she. She was saying, because he lived with her that it was probably a godsend so if she says it then I just kinda i'm supporting her, and then we found out that my ex husband's mother not mother passed away her boyfriend that she's had for over 40 years passed away. So you know the passion always always hard they were elder both of them and they both had a health issue, so in a way, I I kind of think more. You know, maybe it's better for them than to suffer but but still, it was hard and I to have to back to back and but in a way, sometimes they say in a death it brings people closer. my daughter, has not been very close to her dad's mom because he is very close to her and she's the one that the. boyfriend passed away so I told her because she was really hurting bad and she had guilt issues of. of him so i've kind of used a little bit of what bright heart has shown me to look and I talked about her and I go, you know i'm not saying that i'm a therapist nothing but it almost sounds like. The guilt is you not talking to your grandma and this might be an awakening to let you know that you need to spend more time with your grandmother she's getting older and maybe look at it, as the good the glasses half full, instead of half empty, so that kind of helped oh that."
298.0,Provider,"Was sweet, you were able to give your knowledge your life experience to her."
13852.0,Patient,"I gotta tell you that since i've joined right heart i'm. I feel like i'm i'm growing every day i'm learn more about what my underlying problems where I didn't even know, I was so depressed until I really kind of just lost it. and The depression part is really getting a little better. The only part that I need to really, really, really work on, is what I was saying that I really feel like i'm a major loser Unfortunately, I was kind of. My family was kind of a little helpful in that area, so you know things. Like i've been telling my daughter lately i've been learning, because when I talk about it and I hear it and it's out loud it's like oh damn that's what was bothering me. So i've learned that through bright heart and I like that."
298.0,Provider,I love that that is a success story right there.
13852.0,Patient,"All I. it's helped so much. But yeah the medication um yeah since we put it up it's been helping me deal with. The kind of the sadness and stuff it's only the stuff at night that just but i've had it for a long time, I always felt at night, I always have dreams, where. People don't like me and then it's like i'm trying to make them, you know come on i'm nice I am nice come on in it's just a dream keeps coming back with no no you're just a loser. But i'm working on it."
298.0,Provider,Good is there anything else that I can help you.
13852.0,Patient,"Know sweetheart you've been so helpful and thank you so much for taking your time to talk to me well, thank you for keeping."
