207.0,Provider,"Okay okay so that's Okay, so a goal is within the next six months to a year you're you're you're looking to make the transition to Florida right. Yes, so that's a good time frame six months to a year, because then it gives you the opportunity. To work on not just getting the job keeping the job and saving up. i'm to get the vehicle."
9052.0,Patient,"I have a vehicle now, but just not what I want you know it's not a little Mitsubishi I can't really be going around. it's it's serving its purpose, right now, but I need a truck you know i'm a construction I go down there plus I have a lot of context I lived in tallahassee. Excuse my lived in pensacola I lived in jacksonville and I lived in Orlando, I visited Miami so i've been i'm pretty familiar with it and I lived for a long time in fairhope Alabama right there for bama line."
207.0,Provider,"So then Okay, so the goal is within the next month or year that's what you're looking for over are the overarching goal is to move. to drive to make the transition from Florida from Michigan to Florida so that's your overarching goal that's the ultimate goal and so to meet that it is to. When do you start this on. we're."
9052.0,Patient,going to be the first week is all great is on the day shift and then I began midnight's as a supervisor third shift supervisor on midnight's.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's wonderful so okay so you're getting the job at least here they're working towards, at least that one goal of maintaining manchild while still caring for your mother, so how, how are you going to legitimately do that."
9052.0,Patient,"Well, these that's that's where this hospice comes into play, because they they just bend over backwards they'll have people coming in and have they come now anyway every day. But now, when I have you know they have workers that will come in and spend four hours at a time and and then I got all my sons one lives, right here in this apartment complex and for more live within a mile. So i'll have somebody always check in. Because if somebody has to be here. And that's. that's more that's not a goal it's it's it's a challenge but i'm going to i'm going to make it happen."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so. All right, well you're going to. meet for the. You have hospice coming in until you have at least some form of care for your mom um The other thing is like how long, would you say you will give yourself to work on the transferring from one car for you said. Maybe in the next six months. For the vehicle."
9052.0,Patient,"Oh, oh yeah. Hopefully, not that long it won't be that long."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, three to six months later, you got to give yourself some time to get the money so so three to."
9052.0,Patient,Share that's about right.
207.0,Provider,Sure we'll go with that.
9052.0,Patient,"So let's get you know there's there's a lot of stuff going on, you know so there's what you already know what's inevitable. be happening here and there is. there's insurance. You know i'm the beneficiary and that's probably going to long ways, you have to get out all your all your ducks."
207.0,Provider,"But then. But then, you know even with beneficent being a beneficiary will take some time for you to get whatever benefits, there are to get."
9052.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm not i'm not no rush i'm gonna i'm gonna take it, Nice and easy and just make sure everything's just right."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm so the other part of that is um. The other part of that is. You know, there is the you have to do your own self care, every day, and there is a mental and emotional support that you need because at the end of the day, even though. You know you're going to start working you want to move in all of these different things at the end of the day, there's still the process of so caring for your mom her being on hospice is almost. also coming to that place of you know. of men, giving her X amount of time. or less than six months. yeah here on hospice you're giving us this month to live. So and and so it's still at the want you know it's all said and done, given her age, she lives her life, and all this different stuff but there's still the you know you having to prospect and feeling by law."
9052.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Something to to work on, and so I would recommend you know still having beginning now is the self care routine like developing a self care routine for yourself. and making it almost ritualistic where every day, this is what you do, whether it's before you go to bed or some points in debate something to help you. To keep you on that path of you know hey within the next six months, this is something that can happen i'm no longer obligated I don't know I no longer have this responsibility and being able to adjust to now, knowing that you no longer have this this this. This responsibility to. Your everyday."
9052.0,Patient,Did you hear that alarm go off.
207.0,Provider,On a rocking chair.
9052.0,Patient,I gotta have that. she's got it she's she's still wants to be independent she'll get up and trying to get across the room. If I go to the mailbox you leave the room. Up she goes.
207.0,Provider,And then the fear of her phone.
9052.0,Patient,The right that's exactly what it is what it all is.
207.0,Provider,performing and then she does you know you have to. Get back up there in age ah. yeah.
9052.0,Patient,I have to cut this short I gotta take her to the bathroom.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem all right, I have your your stuff here, so you know what since you gotta go, you can just at some point today just told her to a planetary scheduled for the fall i've been exceptional."
