7519.0,Patient,Good morning.
383.0,Provider,i'm so glad you're able to make it.
7519.0,Patient,"yeah I actually i'm actually an easy Davis hospital right now with my son and we ended up coming here yesterday, or I got them from school his doctor called me. and told me that we probably should take him to the emergency room because of his blood work, so we came down here last night and we've been here they admitted in last night and but I mean the good news is that they have so far they pretty much Ruth rolled out him. Having any sort of cancer or leukemia so that's good. And that's what they were scared of because of all of his symptoms but now. they're kind of leaning towards looking at a rheumatologist for arthritis or an autoimmune disease of some sorts so."
383.0,Provider,i'm dealing with how open.
7519.0,Patient,Is it's my one of my. partner.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. wow how did you, you know. kind of come to think that there was something wrong or with."
7519.0,Patient,"So he's been having like fevers and these like reoccurring, like pains for like the past like year and a half. About and so, when I was little I used to get like random fevers like that, too, so I just kind of like Oh, maybe that's he's got like the same sort of thing that I used to get. And they never found anything wrong with me and then, but then he started getting the leg payments really bad also and at first, I thought Okay, maybe it's growing pains, but then after I kind of talked to his pediatrician about it. He or she said she wanted to do blood work, so he got blood work and there was some elevated something I don't know I don't know how the lab works, but something was elevated and those results. So that's why they were leaning towards. The the leukemia and stuff because that's those are signs of it, but then they also. They also can be signed to other things too, so what they've seen so far they don't think that that's what it is. But they still haven't like given me like a definite answer I know he's. probably going to have lots of tests. From here on out. But I just this was the quickest way to do it without having to wait months and months and months because he's already been going through it for so long. So she just she just thought that this would be the easiest way."
383.0,Provider,Good well i'm glad you got him down there that's that's great how is he doing.
7519.0,Patient,"he's he's. Good he's up and he's happy and he's jumping around right now. So a call came through sorry and. yeah and he's jumping around and he's fine right now, but he gets like that, like hill Hill, you know be on a good like city thing and then. Do the fever thing or he'll do his leg pain, or you know, whatever and then he'll be out for like three days with the fever and then he's back you know back to it again so."
383.0,Provider,Well i'm sure it will be to get to the bottom of what is going on with him.
7519.0,Patient,"For you right that's what i'm hoping that's what i'm hoping just because you know I mean what you know a few months Okay, you know I just was like. Like thinking, maybe it's some sort of sickness and then I know I used to get the fevers a lot, too, so I was just thinking like Oh, maybe he's like me, you know. But then, of course I I googled like all the symptoms and it was like you know the worst case scenario, but then you know hearing it from the doctors makes it a little bit scarier."
383.0,Provider,Sure right right. How are you holding up.
7519.0,Patient,"um yesterday was hard, but today I feel like just being at uc Davis like this is such a good hospital like I still like like he's taking care of here and like they know what they're doing and stuff so today is a little bit better. You just want to. figure out what's going on."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm yeah i'm sure you you feel better being a good hospital. yeah supportive and are you by yourself, or do you have someone with you to."
7519.0,Patient,Help yeah. yeah my needs to my knees actually brought me down here. So.
383.0,Provider,Good good i'm glad you've got some family support.
7519.0,Patient,yeah and then the kids are with their uncle and my sister so.
383.0,Provider,"Well, well i'm I know that you also, though, has struggled. You know, with the whole. ordeal of. Go bed have the coverage, while you were pregnant. So other health problems that have been stressful for you and cause you anxiety so i'm sure this isn't. True, this is hard on you."
7519.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,Are you doing anything to kind of help calm yourself down just any like just just breathing or how are you doing with just keep managing your own.
7519.0,Patient,"anxieties yeah I feel like like lately i've been able to keep it under control, I felt like my worrying is still there. But I just kind of like. I feel like like the thoughts like you know in my head like how I used to get are like like it's easier to manage a little bit more so i'm just trying to kind of like stay hopeful like I said yesterday was harder, but you know today's different and. So far, like we haven't you know so far, like, I mean I think he Carter is going to have like a long road ahead of them, but. I think it's gonna be okay. No come on going what you think."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well one one moment at a time, really, I think, is one way of kind of managing."
7519.0,Patient,"A crisis like this, all right."
383.0,Provider,Then it's just like. Staying doing what you need what you can do to improve the moment. Right so. With you know breathing or looking at. Focusing your mind toward positive images. Staying you know loving and present in the moment and recognizing what you have and what's stable in this moment. Sometimes that can be really helpful to not get too far ahead of yourself and start to imagine like worst case scenarios and not kind of thing.
7519.0,Patient,"yeah yeah look yesterday was really hard. And I kind of like had a little miniature breakdown, but then I like to pull myself together, and you know it's like I can't just like break down, you know cuz he. My other kids are gonna you know I had to go pick them up from school and I was upset and so, in my oldest is already like very like Oh, where things and. He can be pretty sensitive to things so I was just trying to like keep that you know, like keep it to like okay we're just taking him to the doctor like I went to the hospital, the other night on Friday and he, like completely lost it because we had to call the ambulance. until he was very upset with that so for."
383.0,Provider,You on Friday.
7519.0,Patient,"hey cutter stop yelling please don't do that were in the hospital stop. My blood sugar drops really low. Like I was getting. yeah I was getting really busy until I when I was pregnant with Bennett I had. Low or had gestational diabetes. So I I got my glucose meter and I tested my glucose in it, so it was very low at this point bill I don't think that it was completely accurate, but I do think it was low. It because it said I was like 27 and everybody keeps telling me if I was at 27 you wouldn't be talking like you'd be like past hours. But I checked it like three times within like maybe 1520 minutes and it went from like 27 252 and then back down to like 26 or something like that. But then when the paramedics got there, it was at 93 after but I had already drinking like a bunch of apple juice and stuff to try to get like to get it to be normal. And it's been fine since then so and my glucose meters been working Okay, since that too, so I don't know if it was just because I hadn't used in so long. I don't know what the issue was with it, but I do think it was like."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Are you eating. Well, are you taking care of yourself in that way."
7519.0,Patient,"So does those like passed to the two days before that I probably did not eat as much as I should, so I think that's a lot that had to do with it, but I still like I had a coffee like right before. Like right before I had gotten home and all that happened, so it shouldn't have drops even that low because I did have like some sort of sugar, so that was kind of weird. But yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Well it's important that you take care of your own physical. Here, especially right now that you're like not in the House, you know that you are eating. and drinking and nourishing yourself, you know, while you're taking care of your son. During all time that's super important that you take care of yourself."
7519.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel like I forget sometimes to do that, like a lot of the times, I will just not like our i'll just like grabs me small. Because i'm always taking care of the kids. Well i've been trying to like watch that."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, if your Cup is not full it's hard to fill other people's cups. Right so. You need to eat to need to drink, you need to. You know attend to your own physical health. Here, even if it's just that you know the baseline nutrition and. hydration and that kind of."
7519.0,Patient,thing yeah.
383.0,Provider,"But you can be there, you know and and I are you gonna make an appointment to see the doctor regarding what happened."
7519.0,Patient,"yeah I already did my follow up appointment actually and. She ordered a bunch of lab work and then I I told him because I stressed out about everything that I wanted to do like a scan on my brain just to like make sure that everything's okay like. With that area seven EG on Monday, the 20th and then I wasn't supposed to go to my bloodwork this morning, but because we're here I haven't done it yet so hopefully I can get it done maybe next Monday or this weekend, or something. Okay, I don't know, do you know."
383.0,Provider,"Do you think that maybe you should have an appointment with Chatel, to look at maybe if there's something that she could help you with for anxiety right now."
7519.0,Patient,"Maybe I don't really I don't know I don't really want to start another like medicine like I kind of like even with the otter all this like because i'm on with adderall they said that maybe that could be causing like. Like me, to not eat and that's why i'm that's why my blood sugar drops or something like that, so I kind of I do need to make an appointment with shauntel. But I kind of want to see about maybe like like cutting like slowly either completely stopping my adderall or just like cutting it in half. And then and i'm just always afraid to take medicine any like it like it is but. I don't know I don't know."
383.0,Provider,Are you still take the suboxone.
7519.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that that's the one that I don't you know I feel comfortable taking that and the adderall has been fine too, but then just since that happened I just kind of. All right, I don't know I just keep going back and forth with it now."
383.0,Provider,So you take it sometimes and other times you don't.
7519.0,Patient,Know i've been here but normally it's like I haven't stopped barriers prior was thinking like Maybe I should. Not. Take it or should.
383.0,Provider,"Well, definitely that's something to talk about more specifically, you know with chantel. yeah maybe after you get your blood work done also."
7519.0,Patient,"Okay, but yeah when I. When I talked to the doctor. I went on Monday I go I went yesterday when I talked to him yesterday. He. He said that, I should just like keep doing things like normally like I shouldn't try to like set anything off yet until we get the blood work back."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Tell me the name of your son, that is. Right now, I know you told me or your children's names again but. remind them."
7519.0,Patient,yeah this one is Carter. yeah.
383.0,Provider,yeah poor guy.
7519.0,Patient,"yeah I was, I mean he's not like he's not acting secrete now, but then he just has these weird like you know times, where it's just like down."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, and how does he again."
7519.0,Patient,"he's six he's turned six like you're gonna fall, but he you know he already told you cannot do that set up here. Well restless."
383.0,Provider,yeah How long do you have to be there.
7519.0,Patient,"Depending on that's what we just talked to the doctor not too long ago and they're going to kind of like like talk with their team about it and then talk to the. rheumatologist and see what other tests, they can do so they'll probably collect more blood from him and do some more like lab work, and the reason that they decided to keep us last night was just to like kind of like get the process of like what needs to be done, like quicker. That way we're not like you know, because if we went home and then we're going to have like a million appointments talk to come back to get all these tests for we're here, we might as well just get it done now, all the hard ones, and then go from there."
383.0,Provider,"I see. Well that's a lot on you. IDA and I just encourage you to. You know, keep yourself a prayer as well just in terms of like breathing eating well and knowing that you know you can only do so much you know he, like getting people to help you and also that you know you get home so sometimes it's it seemed like maybe there's a lot of stuff on john. Because you've been doing right and just being okay with that just reminding yourself it's it's fine."
7519.0,Patient,"You know it's not a big deal and that's what I struggle with to like that's why like that's what I have a hard time with it was like from here, I know, when I get home like there's going to be things that are out of place, and like i'm going to go nuts and like not. Not being able to like i'm like it almost it's almost like a half to like you know, like do all the dishes or you know fold the clothes, or like make the better, like all that kind of stuff I feel like that's what I need to do, just like I don't know but and I need. To not just be okay with like sometimes things are messy or the beds are made or whatever, but."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so just remind yourself that. You know it's, just like the day the little reminder that you are thought that you rotate around in your mind when you enter that room with the pile of laundry or the dishes or you know that. that's okay it's snowing yeah you know go get to it when you can you've been doing something else, and of course those things would not be done so, when. We just do what you can do. Right, I think it's because then you know when you see all that stuff you're going to start to get agitated which is not going to be good for you, you know. and So i'm glad you're you're thinking about that in."
7519.0,Patient,"advance yeah that's all i'm trying to like. You know, like think about it now that way when I get home, like, I know, like. But it's hard."
383.0,Provider,yeah I do we. Support yourself could be like you're going to get takeout you know you're going to.
7519.0,Patient,Go yeah.

383.0,Provider,yeah good.
7519.0,Patient,"And then the my doctor did say something about one of my one of my bloodwork tests was abnormal or something was wrong with it and I can't remember. Which one it was, but he said something about the muscles like being overworked there is like a muscle being overworked or something like that, and he said that could be caused from stress and anxiety, or it can be caused from a. lot of steroids and hey whatever the adderall is."
383.0,Provider,A stimulant is.
7519.0,Patient,"stimulant that's what it is. So I said he's redoing that test two and I don't know what that he said something about seizures I don't know what that means. he's like this is what he said, like this is what we've seen patients that have seizures. But I don't I don't know what that is."
