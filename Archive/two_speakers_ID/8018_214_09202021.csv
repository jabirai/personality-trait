214.0,Provider,"Okay, and our last conversation, which was about three weeks ago I didn't get to see you, but we talked about how I felt his mood he was happier and laughing and smiling more and you like yep I think so, what do you think about that now."
8018.0,Patient,"hmm. i'd say he's pretty happy, I think that it's just that the mood swings have come back more so he's pretty happy when he is happy, but then he's been just getting little episodes of you know, being depressed or. Being snappy whereas before he was more even toned."
214.0,Provider,"To me, have a conversation as well."
8018.0,Patient,yeah you can you can hear him saying yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So do we do we see any benefit, that we should reconsider picking up this medication."
8018.0,Patient,What do you think. he's asking if i'm should we consider picking up this medication like is there a benefit to it yeah. Why are you saying you don't want to you know.
214.0,Provider,He didn't say that. He. He said that he just doesn't know why he hasn't picked it up.
8018.0,Patient,"I think the. Personally, I think the Latina helps him a lot with his bad mood swings. And I assume the other one has been helping with his ADHD to to an extent because he's more hyper now. But I don't think that the ADHD medication was helping him enough."
214.0,Provider,"it's not going to because the other way it's so imbalanced. Okay, so right so there's this there's these weights and they kind of play, like this. Now they're like this. yeah one one can't do it all because it's missing the other."
8018.0,Patient,Any any other.
