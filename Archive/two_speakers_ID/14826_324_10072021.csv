324.0,Provider,tomorrow. A little. A little bit about. what's been going on. A little bit of history.
14826.0,Patient,"So. Think kind of like the over arching thing is that, like i've been like majorly depressed for like over a decade. I like have been on meds since like I was 15 or 14 maybe and i've been on several different ones, none of them like seem to work. and and I think, like in the more recent years like maybe the past like. Two or three i've been experiencing like some things that I believer like. psychosis. And that's never happened to me before like these past couple years. seems like I like I turned 20 and then all of a sudden it like developed like depression was no longer my worst problem. Like they were like other other things that were. Important. I. You know I can list all the medications that i've been on but I. can't remember how long or when. I was sick. But I can tell, I know which ones were like the ones that we move toward the end. And they were like all like anti psychotic medications and. i'm not taking anything right now and that's part of the problem and part of why i've been like. I will take any appointment, no matter how it really it is, I need to like get in as soon as possible."
324.0,Provider,"How long has it been, since you were left on my pension."
14826.0,Patient,"Well, I lost my insurance. Last year. So it's it has its had to have been over a year. The last psychiatrists that I had while I was seeing him he. Was prescribing me a medication and like was trying to help me get on disability, because he was like leaning toward me. Like chuck you know, trying to get on like temporary disability before he could like help me with that or like. sort of like clue me in on what he was thinking that was going on, he, like died I don't really know why, but they sent me a letter that was like about how he, like passed away. And then. I didn't really hear anything after that I got it so. yeah so that was like kind of when I just like stopped."
324.0,Provider,"and see what the process will be climbing for power man, Dr gerber lithium abilify. Any things. That you felt like was somewhat helpful."
14826.0,Patient,"it's it's really hard to say because my symptoms, right now, are so different from when I was doing. So. Even if they were helpful back then i'm just like I don't even think that like I can predict if they would help me right now."
324.0,Provider,Any history of ever being hospitalized. psychiatric hospital a question.
14826.0,Patient,yeah i've been hospitalized one time okay almost another time but they they decided not to admit me because my my mom was gonna take me home.

324.0,Provider,In college.
14826.0,Patient,yeah I haven't really done it anytime recently but i've had like more so trouble with like like. Like hitting my head. thing that's been like the more prominent self harm thing that i've done in my. adulthood.
324.0,Provider,"Okay, how often are you doing that."
14826.0,Patient,"um it's it started very recently, like. To I don't really know how to give like a estimate was how often but like."
324.0,Provider,"Are you like banging your head against the wall, or are you using like opting for your hands to like."
14826.0,Patient,"Sometimes i'll use like my hand. and Sometimes, like Okay, a lot of the time i'll lay on the floor because it like helps with like stretching and, like my joints and stuff and all like. Like bang my head against the tour sometimes end. Twice It is like. giving me like a. very obvious like bruise on my forehead. Like no one else can see it, but like it, I can feel it. Even right now."
324.0,Provider,In your household or environment have any bar.
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,"You mentioned. Earlier like psychosis. kind of describe that, for me, as far as like hallucinations are you hearing things things things are they. Practice problem, do you. feel things that aren't there father's father."
14826.0,Patient,"um it it feels kind of complicated to describe because a lot of the time that it's like indescribable there's just something not right with like. The day but um I think the ones that are like more obvious or like I grill on time, this is the only one that i've ever talked to a therapist or like you know, a medical professional about. That I like, as I have like phantom like smells like. I like smell something and i'll start like obsessively trying to find what it is and, unlike someone else will come over and be like there's there's nothing there's no like I don't know you're talking about and i'll start like waving my floor with like clorox wipes. Like wiping down every single thing with clorox bleach because they don't know what the smell is and i'm trying to get rid of it. that's that's not the that's not the most distressing one because that one only happens every once in a while, but like. i'm pretty afraid to go outside. I mostly think that everything out there is gonna like harm me and i'm still pretty lucid like when those things happen to me i'm I know that they're like. I know that they're like. Not real. But as it's gotten worse i'm like maybe, maybe, as I get older I won't know that it's not real anymore, because it's getting more and more intense. But like yeah I go outside and like i'll pass by, like a truck or like a van or service vehicle and i'll be like they're definitely going to try and kill me or they're going to like spray chemicals in the air that will like poison me or like make me pass out or i'm like. it's like a plane is like flying like lower than I might usually see i'll be like it's definitely going to crash and. i'm gonna like die because of it or every day, I think that my house is going to collapse because it's like a very like because I live on the top floor. I think that, like the roof is going to crashing on me because, like. it's an old house and if I pop my window open, I think that someone's going to like climb into it and every day check under my bed, because I want to make sure there's not someone under there and I also like make sure that there's like. they're like things in the front of like the bottom of the bed, but nothing in the back, so that I like if someone breaks into my house, I can get behind those things, and like. lander my bed. Also, like. I think I think the major one that like makes most people concerned, as though, is the like hallucinations part. Which is that, like I I have, I have vision problems so most like doctors will just like pass it off as that but. I since I was a kid I thought that every single person saw things like grainy. And I was like oh every like everything that I look at is not not clear, everything is green there's like really big particles and everything and and everybody just seems like that, and then one day I talked to someone and they're like I don't know what you're talking about. And I was like really surprised, and so I went to like a mom took me to like an eye doctor. In the eye doctor like. notice like a problem in my eyes, but didn't know why I saw like like that specifically. And then, like as I I got older it like progress more and more like I instead of seeing dots I started seeing like tiny like spinning like windmills in the air, and then I started seeing like triangles like a Kaleidoscope. And then I started seeing words recent More recently, like within the past year I started seeing words. and I told one of my friends and I was kind of like haha like. i've been seeing words in the air, and they were like. They got really serious and they were like if you ever start seeing them like telling you to do something, please tell me. i'm."
324.0,Provider,and inequality sentences or just random words.
14826.0,Patient,"Sometimes it's like short sentences sometimes it's just random words and usually there's like a trend, where I see like certain ones more often. When I first started happening, I was seeing the word 16 over and over again. And the only time it's ever. scared me is when like I started to sing like like kill me over and over again in the air. And that was when I was like. Okay, like I know this is not real but like what if it gets worse than us. And then even more recently, as in like within the past. week or two weeks i've started seeing like faces. But it's not like it's not like there's an act like an actual like fully. Like a full human being with flesh in front of me it's like. it's like a face in the air that's like made out of like the colors in the in the. Air almost like. I don't even know how to describe it, but it keeps."
324.0,Provider,Would you stop it would you say that you are saying the same thing constantly or does it come and go.
14826.0,Patient,"i'm. it's i'm i'm constantly seeing like the like moving grainy particles for sure, but like it. Whether or not it turns into something else is like it comes and goes, but it comes and goes within a day. So it's not like a you know something like a like. An episode of like a few weeks or something it's like."
324.0,Provider,"I know, and do you feel like you are actually thing I thought of the grainy figures, but obviously the faces of the numbers, the words is that every day."

I really love also who is like not here in person to have like people I could talk to, and someone who show up if there's emergency."
324.0,Provider,"As far as coping you know when you're under stress and especially. With like the hallucinations and anything goes, I mean that can be stressful What do you do the dangers of coke. Now I know alcohol is one of them, because you said that you use that to kind of help. With everything that's going on anything else that you do to help."
14826.0,Patient,"And I mean usually I like lots of people say that, like you're supposed to distract yourself. And so i'll try to distract myself but i'm not very good at it, because I have a really terrible attention span. Like I have a really bad problem with like rapid thoughts and like rapid movement. Like i'll just i'll get up to do something or get also back down i'll get it to do something else, like it's a problem that, like my friends have pointed out, because, like if we're trying to watch a movie i'll get up like several times within the movie to do something i'm going to. Do you want some water and i'll be like I was just thinking about this and, like a brain brain this moves really rapidly, for some reason, and so it's really hard for me to like distract myself without like someone else, so a lot of the time my coping mechanism is to just like. force myself to spend time with someone else which doesn't always work because that's also something that like drains me and like. Sometimes, like hurts me if I. were at the wrong. But. that's one of the main ones i've noticed that works, but you know the tried and tried and true method is like alcohol, which is unfortunate, but. Also, like. I don't know I feel like I I do all the things i'm supposed to do other than that I like. A I tried my best to sleep I get up I stretch to take a shower I eat food. I go for a walk every day. I like listen to like. I really like horror stories and like podcasts so I listened to those a lot of the time. and watch like videos that interest me. I like do chores to try and distract myself. And there's two cats in my house, who I like spend time with them. and"
324.0,Provider,The last five characters that you saw. passed away. medications that you pick not the years. did anyone ever give you an official diagnosis of what is going on.
14826.0,Patient,"yeah I think I think he was the whoever like read me my diagnosis. Before like they just like not told me. Because I guess, I guess, because I was like very like they just like didn't bother telling me, and I would tell my mom said. But. His official diagnosis was like major depression general anxiety panic disorder. and psychosis I think. But like. yeah I don't really know very much about about that. Like about like what his reasoning was or like. You know what each of those things like mean based on what i've said to him. That kind of thing and also like again like. it's it's changed since then so i'm like. Would it like what the diagnosis be different I don't know it's like it feels like i'm starting over."
324.0,Provider,"You ever experienced. manic episodes. And by that impulsive miss. excessive spending right the racing got. Go on, for days of not sleeping. Just excessive burst of energy that may last for a few days and then. It goes into. Depression. But that's a good mood swings either just high or low there's no really steady in between."
14826.0,Patient,"And I think I I have mood swings like within one day, but not likely. To be considered a manic episode. Like i've never i've never really the type of cruise on news without sleep and I if that in fact like i'm usually like the type of person who sleeps too much and and I know that ever like sometimes i'll stay up all night but like. Then i'll sleep for like the entire day like I don't like go without sleep or and or not need sleep. Sometimes i'll like. I have rapid thoughts, but it's like all the time, not like an episode. But I would say, and also like my. Previous partner who is like the person who is closest to me. I tried to ask him about it, and he is like no I really don't think that you have manic episodes ever so making. The ass like my best friend and they were like I don't really think so so seems like other people around me don't really observe there being, like any sort of manic episode, and I also don't think so."
324.0,Provider,"Based on what you have. kind of described to me. Because i'm you know i'm trying to ask me about like manic episodes. About bipolar disorder. A lot of the symptoms. When you talk about like the LUSA nations even sometimes like the paranoid thought. leans more towards. Either like schizophrenia or skinful affective disorder. And I will lean more towards the skin so effective because you have the depressive symptoms that are in there. don't want to. Do. In. There should be an. appointment. I want to keep going until he gets here. My question is, though. We have one minute for. You be able to see me in a couple hours at 11. Because I definitely want to. I want to, I want to I want I don't want to wait another week or you know set up another point to do I want to be able to. We can do to get you some help started today. To feeling better. You know because I don't like the idea that you're using the APP and I get it. Using the alcohol to try to cope, to try to math. that's what you think like the alcohol to drown out. Everything that's going on."
14826.0,Patient,yeah or just a good sleep I love you think so.
324.0,Provider,So i'm going to send a message I have a cancellation okay. perfect. um. Does that sound familiar. are lots of things.
14826.0,Patient,I think i've heard of either.
324.0,Provider,About that one is so similar to circle oil and gas and the weight gain and.
14826.0,Patient,I think the yeah I think circle was one of the closest to helping and so it's like with the end but they're like you know just the problems that. be good.
324.0,Provider,criteria. and definitely this has been going on longer than six months so that's one of the criteria has to be at least six months or continuous. Any delusions.
14826.0,Patient,and
324.0,Provider,"Is anyone do you need to just examples feel like feeling like anyone is working to harm or hurt you. And when you read a book watch TV or use a computer do you ever find that their messages feel like they're a message messages that are intended for you. or feel like you have special powers or ability and it might not apply but. The nation's. When you will wait, have you ever heard a voice different from your own. The others cannot hear. or seeing things that other people don't see and that's a big one yeah. This organized. disorganized speech. I haven't heard anything that you said today, of course, this is being disorganized. From your thoughts were completely linear you were completely able to portray everything that's been going on. To me, in a very organized manner."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah, I think, more so than being disorganized they're just like rapid."
324.0,Provider,"yeah. Are you are, you still currently restricting in Beijing."
14826.0,Patient,and
324.0,Provider,So how long has it been.
14826.0,Patient,"I would say, more so now it's like bingeing because i'm like trying really hard to like use everything I have to cope with what's happening. I would say it's been like. Probably like. Probably like a year now. Just like that, since i've moved here. To oakland.
