And that wasn't going to be an issue well the pharmacy held off a day or two from filling my script when they said that they were able to fill it so, then I talked to one of your advisors. And she's like okay well there must there's just a miscommunication and then I think we, you know we were obviously also worried that. You know, we want to make sure you were okay that you weren't just abusing them and this that and the other and i'm like no, it was in a store like today's the day that I should have had. Another strip for and i'm out, you know I mean or median strip and a half or something I said I was my first week in the program usually had a conversation i'd been on some before I was a couple days into withdrawal when I started the program things pretty straightforward, you know.
