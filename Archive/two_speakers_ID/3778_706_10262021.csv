3778.0,Patient,Probably.

706.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
3778.0,Patient,"Air infection or the opposite ear infection, or both, and then. She got it she got hand foot and mouth from daycare that was awful. She got it so bad oh my God it was horrible my son had it when he was younger and it was just like a couple little spots on his knee and and that was it."
706.0,Provider,"They said it's really, really bad this year."
3778.0,Patient,"All my on is awful she had that the high fever, can the sores all they were honored chins up on her. yeah. that's crazy. i'm sorry. Sorry. I can't hear you. Can you hear me."
706.0,Provider,I can hear you.
3778.0,Patient,hear me okay all right.
706.0,Provider,"Yes, there is a kid at daycare that was just covered my son's daycare and I was so scared he was going to get it my oldest son never had it and then braxton my younger son he hasn't had it but. it's really yeah it's nasty looking, and I know they feel like just crappy."
3778.0,Patient,"She was awful it said I didn't know it can get that bad I always thought oh hand foot and mouth it's whatever they're sick for a couple days and they're fine it out for like being a little over two weeks with her. And then everywhere that she had the spots on her hands for feet and then all over her face and in her mouth started. It took about two for the appealing to stop it was about six weeks after it all started. That was fun, but that was like a really bad in case I guess yeah and it's going around like really, really. Like bad strain of it this year."
706.0,Provider,"yeah that's what I heard, I was really glad he didn't get X, like, I said that when child was covered. And I mean you're just miserable from my. kids just just don't feel well."
3778.0,Patient,"It was horrible she just screamed for weeks shang eat drink and because she had. She had four sores right behind her teeth so her forefront teeth she had sores behind them so she can eat anything she can drink, out of a cup she couldn't run down one bottle when she couldn't drink out of anything."
706.0,Provider,"gosh. And so i'm surprised that she didn't have to get like IV fluids, or something, because when she didn't you get dehydrated."
3778.0,Patient,"yeah I think she should have. We took I took her to children's and. They. She had 103 or 104 fever or something like that, with tylenol so it was like really high and then. Her resting heart rate was 199. In or drank anything in almost she had like two or three ounces over the course of like 36 hours and she'd only P one time and i'm telling them all of this, like. She spoke she shouldn't be paying like six or eight times a day, and he wants in 36 hours oh show me okay we'll give her some tylenol and eventual drink. Okay let's I hope."
706.0,Provider,that's. That doesn't seem right that doesn't seem right though.
3778.0,Patient,"um when they said her heart rate and I asked her heart rates off the island doesn't usually happen when you get dehydrated and they said, oh no that can happen with a fever. Not 200 rushing."
706.0,Provider,Oh that's terrible.
3778.0,Patient,"But she got over that and then got an ear infection and then got a virus just some kind of Irish like she just it's been one thing after another, with her."
706.0,Provider,"Well you're lucky that your mom is home, you know, like when you go to daycare and stuff because I feel like that would have cost you a lot of stress. If you homesick and then you'd have to be home with her, because obviously the last time it cause you stress, because you weren't getting everything done you needed to get done but then also just being home trying to work with kids is challenge."
3778.0,Patient,yeah it was fun for like the first day and then after that it was like running to come back to work and begging my boss i'll just wear a mask i'll sit in my office and I won't talk to anybody come back.
706.0,Provider,"yeah well yeah I mean, because in a way work is kind of like an escape from your mouth. You know, because it's it's a different kind of stress. So you have linked into two separate you know worlds, and when you have to combine those two worlds that's never a good thing. Because, then you have no separation at all um. So yeah I mean like I said, for me, I I work from home, but I still have separation just because I have separate space in the home, that I will I will it separates it. I don't have enough space in my living space."
3778.0,Patient,yeah and you've got my office and. yeah not off duty.
706.0,Provider,yeah exactly. So how is your son is he feeling okay or did he get sick to throw this.
3778.0,Patient,"He said he was the one that got it actually first, but he was fine he got other than a fever, he had a really high fever. He was same thing, like crazy high like. For four or five days, but that was it, I was like so strange because he felt fine he had this horrible fever, but no symptoms, he was just sitting on the couch like perfectly fine just with a crazy high fever, it was the weirdest thing ever. yeah and then after like four or five days, he was fine and he just like not going to school for two weeks."
706.0,Provider,"yeah. that's crazy that one had you know they both got it and one got really, really sick from it, and the other didn't that's just crazy That just shows how different everybody's immune system as."
3778.0,Patient,"And I didn't get it my mom didn't get it like that was what was, I really was expecting us all, just to go through the House. But no, it didn't which I don't know how considering my daughter sleeps was like our eyeballs have to be touching so you breathe all over me. I didn't get it. Somehow."
706.0,Provider,"that's good, though I couldn't imagine as an adult having him foot in mouth."
3778.0,Patient,I wouldn't.
706.0,Provider,That would be horrible.
3778.0,Patient,"I don't know I couldn't figure out if I was thinking about that, like if it would be worse or not, at least, you understand what's going on, you know. You some orange yo but. With her it was just oh."
706.0,Provider,"I don't know like with chicken packs, for instance, they say, if you get them as an adult because you didn't have measure child's a lot worse."
3778.0,Patient,way worse yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So I don't know and like tons of you know, like your tonsils out as an adult it's a lot more serious than as a child so. I don't I don't know."
3778.0,Patient,"i've always wondered that like why it's so bad just that one thing, and you can have. An appendectomy you can have you know surgeon general surgery, you know at any point in time and have the same outcomes, but getting your tonsils out. Which is pretty low."
706.0,Provider,And it's pretty pretty mild procedure you.
3778.0,Patient,Know yeah.
706.0,Provider,You can have my tonsils out when I was 12 maybe but I mean it was.
3778.0,Patient,Like a.
706.0,Provider,hit they eat ice cream and popsicles I mean it wasn't horrible.
3778.0,Patient,yeah I didn't think I had mine out yeah when I was like 13 I was in like sixth grade or seventh grade something like that and. The first like the first two days were awful but then after that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah because have a sore throat, and you feel like your throat like closed up matt I mean."
3778.0,Patient,That and that's what. The quarter ization like peeled online I like got a scab because it kept bleeding. So I had a stab in the back of my throat that was just like freaking out for days at a time.
706.0,Provider,"Well, and then, just imagine you know how your little wins out with like those sores in her mouth like peeling."
3778.0,Patient,"On full I wish I wish I could show you a picture of it, she can be like on a poster for it because it and that's one thing with my son when he did get it, it was just the little dots like little pinpoint Dodds hers were the big sores with you know the fluid filled sores. They were all over she just looked horrible."
706.0,Provider,didn't leave any scarring or anything after it went away.
3778.0,Patient,"No, thank God that's what I was so worried about because she had them up to her like it was like level with her cheekbones and then all the way down and then she started getting them like on her jaw line and they started popping. And then they like burned and art so she would rub them and scratch them and also afraid, it was going to scar but no, thank God didn't she's got goods and."
706.0,Provider,that's good. You just had kind of a go of it lately. it's just one thing after.
3778.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. To add. insult to injury, then dealing with all of that, and then now. medicaid is like right around the corner at work so that's fun."
706.0,Provider,I remember when I worked at the clinic here in town and we started the medicaid program and it was a nightmare.
3778.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,It was a nightmare. it's just it's so complicated and there's just so many so much red tape and. it's just yeah it's very complicated so that will keep you busy. That you'd be busy.
3778.0,Patient,never ending list and checklist and yeah. This the quality improvement plan or this policies and procedures and this. is ridiculous.
706.0,Provider,"yeah oh i'm just going to ask you, so I think it was a couple weeks ago and group, you had sent me a chat that said something about you didn't get your medicine or something so you weren't able to go on some like work trip. travel with your boss what happened with all of that, I didn't quite understand through the chat what was going on."
3778.0,Patient,"So it was one there was one of the villains. The like normal fill in the. Factors though that's not seeing sell a home instead of doing a full week she just did for days and I was leaving on. That I was even on Monday and I wasn't going to be back until like Friday at like midnight or 11 o'clock or something like that really basically like into Saturday. But showing me meds until Thursday morning on Wednesday night Thursday morning and I am called in trying to like get it fixed before I had to leave I call the virtual clinic. And they said Okay, you know will send a message that are done it up, but then it didn't get fixed and then they didn't get sent and get all the pharmacy and and and. I called him at two sounds like my car office, I had to leave at two o'clock to get to the airport at 240. at two o'clock they said they still didn't have it and I didn't actually end up getting it filled until like almost four o'clock that day, and then it was still just four days. So."
706.0,Provider,"Did they did they say why it was just four days is there, something that was out of compliance or anything."
3778.0,Patient,"that's what she was wanting to understand. cuz she had mentioned it, that day in the group that it's just policy if you're on a week, then you get four days with a four day refill. summer have been done like that, before but Okay, and I don't know really washing my hands I wasn't paying attention and then I got a four day and i'm like. Why."
706.0,Provider,"So typically. You get if you're if you're on even if you're on a week, then you'll get a week's worth. Because in some people are in group, you know bi weekly now, and so, then they get a week's worth plus a week three file to get them through till you know, like their their normal date. For days, plus a four day repo is a week, but you have that refill in between and typically happens when you're out of compliance with something. So let me look at something quick."
3778.0,Patient,"I don't know I mean I had. I think, like the week before that so wasn't last week it was two weeks ago it was feeling that day or the Monday, before I had done my drug screen and had done the individual with you on the first, I think, or the 30th or whatever day it was."
706.0,Provider,"yeah let me block because that's the only reason that you would have. Because that's what she's been doing is what they call bridging because. People are not doing the things that they need to be doing so, like some people's duty SS haven't been done and months and months and months and months."
3778.0,Patient,And so.
706.0,Provider,they're they're really coming down on that now because that's against DEA regulation.
3778.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"We can get a ladder trouble for that. So i'm not sure, because it says everything's in the green our surveys are done 19 that's as of today. i'm. Your drug screens good. most recent mail ship date was the 14th so you'll be getting if you haven't already gotten one, you should be getting."
3778.0,Patient,My nails about like three weeks behind they suck.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so it says that the last drug screen, with some time for."
3778.0,Patient,"calling it either, like the end of this week beginning of next week I don't know why it's like clockwork it's always like two three weeks behind on everything Amazon even my own my next day Amazon. yeah extra for never comes next day."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh yeah."
3778.0,Patient,"I like I live like, no, no, so I think they just like push it to the back of the line."
706.0,Provider,"So, and you don't have. Any recommendation for a restriction on medication."
3778.0,Patient,"I don't know it was just like a mixer that she thought, because I was on a week it was because of like something temporary like some kind of like non compliance. And that's why she did because she made it sound like I remember her specific specifically said if you're on a week you get a four day with a four day like that's the thing and."
706.0,Provider,"That Isaiah is going to be out for quite a bit longer yet so there's going to be so there's going to be felons or groups that are combined or I mean we have to figure it out, but he's going to be out for. A while yet so i'm."
3778.0,Patient,"Like Okay, do you like hard or something."
706.0,Provider,"it's a family emergency I as far as I know, I mean that's kind of it but i'm but The thing is, is, we have to figure out is that i've got you know, three groups. with him so it's like we have to figure out how do you how can we cover all of the groups that he has when we don't have enough factors in the Ohio area fake because you that. So the problem that we're running. into is why we're having like. Factor cell cover is because she is licensed in Ohio so she can prescribe in Ohio. But if we. don't have enough doctors that can prescribe an Ohio then we run into the issue so it's just a matter of figuring it out."
