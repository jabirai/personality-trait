527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11798.0,Patient,"But. Then i'm. Everything all of that ended up making me drink. And then, then my mom got upset at me about. drinking and then talk to me about throwing me out of the House."

527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11798.0,Patient,"And then, that I heard going off on me. And said, if you don't stop it, then I might as well, kill myself, because I don't know what i'm going to do if i'm kicked out of the House, so I picked up a bottle of pills. And she's like if you do that i'm calling the police, and I was like will stop going off on me like this. And then I set the bottle down. As he walked away."
527.0,Provider,"So, have you been having suicidal thoughts lately."
11798.0,Patient,No just today.
527.0,Provider,Just today.
11798.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,So where's your where's your pills that right now.
11798.0,Patient,By my bed.
527.0,Provider,So do we need to hand them over to mom.
11798.0,Patient,"No. No, I should be fine. was just when she was going off on me about everything. Okay."
527.0,Provider,But what's stopping you from taking them.
11798.0,Patient,When she doesn't go off on me about everything.
527.0,Provider,what's what's stopping you today from taking them.
11798.0,Patient,"i'm usually. Okay, because I stopped thinking about. Everything now probably go for a walk and. just get some fresh air and. Try and calm down and. But it's just I usually. More freaked out when she keeps going off on me about everything."
527.0,Provider,"Well, my concern is that you're using seems to be increasing Vanessa and I talked with chantel about that."
11798.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And I know we talked about the last time, as far as you know, some referrals to treatment programs and sober living and I got those for you. Because that was that was something that we talked about. As far as you know, being able to. You know i'm you know. That your your uses increasing, which is not, which is not appropriate for this level of care for outpatient. And I know you've been hesitant about going into a treatment program but that's going to be, I mean that's that's what our recommendation is at this point."
11798.0,Patient,"And really don't want to, though."
527.0,Provider,"I know you don't want to, but but you're it's getting worse and the medical issues that you have the seizures are just getting more more and more compromised. And, and the mental health part of it as well, like clearly the depression is increasing as well. And so I you know it could benefit you being able to have some time and some more you know some structure around you and some additional support to help you work through everything that's been going on, I mean you've definitely had some pretty traumatic experiences recently."
11798.0,Patient,and I couldn't believe my friend. Well that's what happened. We didn't have helped me.
527.0,Provider,"Right yeah I mean that's a lot to that's a lot to carry and it's not your responsibility to be their therapist or take care of them, you know they need definitely professional help. And so i'm i'm glad that you called the police and got them involved because that was the right step to take, because that's way beyond what you can do as as a support."
11798.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean I was trying to stop them, but what I was saying wasn't doing anything for them sorry I told them that they didn't listen to me that I was going to call the police, and then they were telling me not to call the police, but they weren't. Listening to me, so I was like well crap i'm calling the police."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean that would that's the right stuff and so for sure yeah.
11798.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I, and I know you and mom are going at it pretty heavily. But she's she's very concerned about your increase in behaviors to."
11798.0,Patient,"yeah sure. yeah and she just had surgery for cancer, so I mean my behavior isn't helping support her trying to."
527.0,Provider,heal. and recover.
11798.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,So what do you think about at least going for an assessment Vanessa at this point.
11798.0,Patient,I really don't want to.
527.0,Provider,"I know you don't want to, but. But you're not at this at this point. We were we're not gonna be able to keep you at bright heart with with the with the symptoms that that are going on in the in the behaviors. You know we're we're recommending a higher level of care for you at this point. And certainly come back to us, you know, but we definitely feel like you need more structure and support at this point to be able to address the treatment needs. than what we can offer at this point."
11798.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,Because I know I know you're struggling I know you're struggling a lot Vanessa and. And you know I think being able to meet with someone face to face more frequent and having some structure and support around you will really help you delve into everything that's happened in the in the treatment in be able to work on the treatment goals for yourself.
11798.0,Patient,I just don't want to be like. And the House or something for 30 days or whatever.
527.0,Provider,Why not.
11798.0,Patient,i'm just really don't want to. I don't know.
527.0,Provider,"The other thing I, you know how how could it benefit you and mom at that point, you know it would give you guys each of break from each other for you to work through things. be able to do some family work. With her, and also for her to be able to take care of herself, you know emotionally and physically, I mean this is definitely been challenging for both of you guys. You know, and maybe it would help to get you guys back on a better track with one another. I know it's I know it's probably scary for you. And I know you're hesitant about it but, but at the same time with with the behaviors increasing it's it's a risk for us too, because that's you know. that's we're not able to monitor you as closely as we, as we need to and and stay on top of things to help you. And I don't know what the recommendations will be you know, once you complete an assessment, I mean they will they will certainly. make their recommendations as far as what level of care they feel is appropriate if they feel like you need impatient for detox if if you just need residential treatment if you need partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient you know that'll be up to them to make that determination. As far as what level of care what would be most appropriate. Were you thinking about."
11798.0,Patient,Just really don't want to. i've been. When I tried to. kill myself once before I ended up in a hospital for a while and. Just really didn't like it and I don't want to go through that again.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. But we also have to make sure that you're safe to Vanessa. Do you is your mom there today, do you want, do we want to bring her in and talk through this together."
11798.0,Patient,Now she start going off man. She wants me to.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think it's important for her to to hear our recommendations to Vanessa I mean certainly i'm not gonna. You know I can mediate this I don't want us to be arguing and fighting either I want us to be able to have a conversation and listen to one another and hear one another. and be respectful so that's not my intention is, you know if it's going to it's going to escalate to a bunch of arguing then we'll then we'll definitely have to stop conversation because that's not productive. I know I know this is very This is very scary for you, you know, but things are i'm guessing feeling pretty out of control for you right now. And I want, and I want to be able to help you get back on track with things."
11798.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"This isn't a means of a punishment it just means that you just need some extra help and support right now, more than what we can offer an art Program."
11798.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,"Do you want, do you want to go see if mom wants to come in for a minute and I can explain things to her as well. Okay okay. Okay, thanks Vanessa."
11798.0,Patient,hi.
527.0,Provider,hi sheila how are you.
11798.0,Patient,"Oh, I couldn't be better."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well, I was just talking with Vanessa as far as I had spoken with the rest of our treatment team which, which is her prescribers well she can tell, and so I just wanted to give an update as far as what our recommendations were at this point. yeah and I was, I was, I was talking to Vanessa as far as you know, this isn't a means of a punishment or anything it definitely. You know the behaviors and the struggles that she's having you know, have been escalating and increasing and just you know getting to the point of beyond what we can offer as far as bright heart. You know the support that she needs right now, and so, so I talked with chantel and and we're recommending a higher level of care for her at this point. Is and it certainly doesn't mean that you know I told her I said doesn't mean that she can't come back to bright heart, you know when she you know discharges to a lower level of care, again, but certainly we want to be able to you know we acknowledge that she's struggling right now and. Make sure she gets the care that she needs and, and so I did have our team pull a couple Inpatient facilities. For her, and then I also did get a couple sober living facilities as well. So I was going to email those over to you guys. Okay, so that you guys have that information I can certainly give it to you right now, as well, but I can also send it in an email, so that you guys have it, and can print it off to. So, because what I was telling her ice is you know, basically, what we're going to have to do is discharged her from our program because we are making the recommendation for her to to go to you know, an Inpatient facility at this point."
11798.0,Patient,You feel about that Vanessa she says she doesn't want to this is the big issue here. she's in tears right now but.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11798.0,Patient,"You know i've tried my best there's so many obstacles here in danville there are people that are keeping her sick. You know i'm actually like I said this morning tour. I believe, living in my own house i'm keeping are sick, because it's too easy you know. live. Here, she has a roof overhead everything her cell phone. You know i'm actually not helping at this point. But it's affecting my life. You know, and I don't want you to hang up right now and then i'm calling 911 which is almost what happened this morning, she grabbed her pills. yeah and. You know, in as soon as this show this is over i'm really concerned that she's going to run out of the House and be with the same people."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so and so yeah so one of the things I think needs to happen is. Is she's going to have to have an assessment Vanessa I know, and I know I said that, and I know you're hesitant. I don't know what the rock recommendation is going to be, you know that's going to be up to whoever does the assessment with you Vanessa. And you know whether they feel like you need Inpatient or residential or you know, a partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient like I like I said earlier, I don't know I just know that. Your mental health is very important to me and i'm very concerned, and I want you to get the support and help that you need. And, and I know it's a scary step to take, and I know it's a step that you don't want to take, but at the same time, I feel like it's a good step for you and your mom you know you both need. extra support right now, and you both need to to you know, maybe have some distance so that you both can regroup and focus on how do we make things better, and how you know how mom can support you better and how you can work through. These traumas that you've experienced I you know you are you're dealing with a lot of stuff right now Vanessa. And it's and it's, not that I don't want to help you it's just beyond what we can do on an outpatient basis at this point. You know I don't I don't i'm not just leaving you high and dry, I want you to get the help that you need, and I want you to be able to come back and we can continue the work that that we've been doing individually. And I hope that you can hear that, from a Vanessa that you know that some sometimes there are there are those times, where people need extra support and structure to get moving and get some stability and consistency."
11798.0,Patient,"So does she need extra support in the way of in addition to the substance abuse that she's doing right now, which I believe is both. I mean an alcohol related or does she need also a good program in place, I recommend it, I mean there's a lot of advertisements out there. you're going to give me good recommendations and least I said. You know 30 days is not a lot out of your life to to you know the old story love is blind right. When you're so caught up in the middle of a lot of stuff which I think she is and I don't even know a fraction of it. You know that it's really a good idea to step away into a clean wholesome environment. And this is what. You know i'm trying to help her with. But she keeps saying no to me. My hands are tied here, so what happens when a program says no. Then it all really is back on top of me again as her mom because i'm not going to let my daughter. fall into a black hole. is about to happen, I believe. yeah this is this the real scary part because we're online here with zoom but the reality is a 3D world here. And you know, this is the part that's got me extremely."
527.0,Provider,"Concerned yeah So how do we get her to to the hospital for an assessment today Vanessa it, are you know, are you. Are you okay having mom take you to the hospital today because the other alternative is is having the police take you and I would rather. i'd rather not have to go that route i'd rather i'd rather you go with mom and do the assessment and and just take that next good next right step for yourself."
11798.0,Patient,"Which hospital, do you have."
527.0,Provider,Hospitals open.
11798.0,Patient,"To Karen and you know anybody That takes me. She she keeps saying, she doesn't want to this is. The scary part of all this."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and and at this point, you know Vanessa it will you know the police will have to get involved if you're not willing to go. And so I think it would. I think it would help help you a lot better if if you just went How did the assessment and just take you know just take it a step at a time just take it a step at a time, the two places that they gave me was john muir and I can give you that phone number. Okay it's 92506744101. Okay, and the other one is bh see fremont."
11798.0,Patient,Which is it.
527.0,Provider,"b as in boy he isn't Henry C, as in Charlie fremont hospital."
11798.0,Patient,"she's already been there, I won't even take her there, to be honest. I will not take her into that environment that place couldn't even get her meds right she's been there before. Okay it's not a good john mueller is a good hospital on the east Bay does ucsf offer anything."
527.0,Provider,i'm not sure those were the two that they pulled up with her insurance. So that's Those are the two that they had.
11798.0,Patient,given me or is the best actor he say.
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
11798.0,Patient,"But they pulled it up, but will they take her in is the next question well."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well she'll have to go she'll have to have an assessment and then they'll make a determination as far as what the next steps would be for her whether they admit her whether you know whether they refer her to a different Program. they'll they'll determine that, based on their assessment once they see her face to face."
11798.0,Patient,"Okay, and you know, like I said and I told her before you know, even if I choice. No."
527.0,Provider,"Just which is Vanessa Vanessa Vanessa. I mean you do have a choice, you have a choice to go voluntarily, otherwise we have to get the police involved to take you and I don't I don't think you want to do that I really don't I think it would make things worse for you, I don't want to have more trauma."
11798.0,Patient,You don't want.
527.0,Provider,"me I really yeah I really want I really want you to think about taking care of yourself right now and. And I, and I know I know you've got a lot of feelings going on, I know that this is not as not a space, you want to be in right now it's not really a space, I want to have to be in with you either you know i'm. I don't like having this say you know you need to go to the hospital, I mean again i'm not it's not a punishment at all it's my concern is your safety your mental health your stability and and in your symptoms are beyond what I can help with doing on an outpatient basis. You know I don't know I don't know how long you'll be in treatment I can't say that you know that's going to be up to you, working with the treatment team at the hospital that's you know they're going to be able to best guide you in that direction."
11798.0,Patient,"And you know. Being in a hospital treatment they may put you where i've been trying to say you need to go. into a nice, you know private environment seclusion but you don't have access to drugs and alcohol and you're in a very wholesome environment with people like you, that have been struggling with a lot of different things going on in their head. But if you, you know. It might. Have Am I helping here or am I am yeah it's hard for me cuz she tends not to really want to."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah as a mom sure yeah and I think at this point sheila it's just you know, we just need to get her to the hospital for an assessment at this point, you know and not trying to. to beat more information down into our you know but. But we're doing this in a supportive manner here."
11798.0,Patient,"So. So, so what Andre and if i'm wrong, please correct me here. Sure, so what Andrea saying is, if you don't go voluntarily the police are going to show up here. And so I don't have a choice, no, no. So you're better off going voluntarily. You don't want the police to you. know they just doing an assessment right now it's not they may say you don't need that. But they may say Vanessa you need to be out of danville you need to be out of your mom's home and you need to be working in outpatient expensive so Dr shack or her psychiatrists all along had wanted and doctor she her neurologist. and extensive outpatient Program. that's and frankly I contacted you thinking Well, this is at least a good first pass maybe she'll be able to if you accept her work through this. sure. Doing as you guys do, and so that was just trying my best to compromise."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11798.0,Patient,"You need to do a compromise and now. On yeah fortunately. it's you need to a stronger step and that's what the assessment may say Vanessa at john your Vanessa you don't need to go in, but you do need an extensive outpatient program so don't get yourself hung up on you're going to be locked away. in jail on 30 day. that's not what's going on here see she tends to."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11798.0,Patient,"yeah really artistic I mean she really goes beyond what we're saying. she's always been that way, since a little girl. She goes into this minute. and creates this. yeah this."
527.0,Provider,"yeah hey Vanessa can you can you get on camera for a little bit, so I can see ya because I want, I want to make sure you're hearing thing, what are you hearing what are you hearing from me right now Vanessa."
11798.0,Patient,"choice, whether it be blocked away."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, where did you where did you get that conclusion because that's not what I said so, I want, I want to make sure you really understand and hear what i'm saying."
11798.0,Patient,Because I have to go to the hospital right now and get this test and it sounded like to me after having that test that i'm just going to be like. locked away somewhere.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, no, I know I want you, I really want you to hear what. What i'm saying what you're going to do is you're going to go with your mom to the hospital and you're going to have an assessment Do you remember the first time that we met Vanessa and I asked you a ton of questions and we spent an hour just talking about. You know, family history and your substance abuse history and your mental health history and all that kind of stuff Do you remember when we did that. Our initial appointment. yeah okay that's what you're going to that's what's going to happen and i've worked in a hospital Vanessa so that's what that's what they do initially you'll meet with a therapist or social worker. And or nurse and they're going to do an assessment like I did and they're going to make a recommendation, based on you know the symptoms that you're presenting with the. You know the information that they gather from you they're going to make a recommendation, you know the worst the worst case scenario is they feel like you need. stabilization in the hospital and they admit you and typically an MP, even for an impatient admission it's a short stay normally unless there's some sort of complications. You know, typically it's a three to five Max stay in the hospital because they're The goal is that they get you stabilize if they need to make any medication changes. need to make sure that you're safe, you have a safety plan that you're not going to harm yourself or anybody else. Or do any self harm behaviors and then they want to get you to the next level of care whether that's a step down into a residential program or an intensive outpatient Program. So so unless you know there's you know things once you, you know if they decide to met you and things come up as you're in the hospital. And they you know they'll continue to assess but typically an impatient stay is very short it's only for like crisis stabilization and then we move to the next level of care because that's where you really going to do. The therapy work that's what that's what you need you need you know more intensive therapy work and that and that's why we're making that recommendation. And then, and then my goal and my hope is that you can get in a much better place, and you come back and we continue working on those goals and. And you continue to make progress and and feel better about yourself too. And maybe they need to evaluate your medications and say you know, is this Is this really what you need to be on is this helping is this not helping you know it's just a good assessment. To see what what your needs are and how best we can help you Vanessa because you're you're really struggling right now you're really struggling and. And, and I want to see you get the help that you need to because you definitely have some good goals that you want to get to for yourself we've talked about those."
11798.0,Patient,"She was there, honestly, she was drawing again."
527.0,Provider,yeah I mean.
11798.0,Patient,"She was back on track and then all of a sudden, I was so happy for her and honestly I thought that finally she's got somebody that cares about her in the right way, which was adorable and then I learned, but you know I again I don't have all the information, then that went. South i'll say and then all this, then she's totally gone backwards again and and. yeah she does I you know it's really hard because it's just me here right now and i'm. i'm really concerned when you when you leave us what's going to happen yeah. alright."
527.0,Provider,"So. What is it. yeah one of the things sheila that I would like us to talk about is just far as like safety planning, because I know that she mentioned, she was having suicidal thoughts today, so you know, is it possible, can you monitor the medication at this point for her and."
11798.0,Patient,"I just think that we should be in the assessment for. You know I can always do, that I have a list of everything she's taking. And when. she's taking supposed to be. And you know. Once she's on I can do, that the answer is yes, I can do that. allows me to do that."
527.0,Provider,"yeah can you Vanessa can you can you agree to let mom monitor your medications for for a while, just so that you know we make sure that you're taking them correctly and that."
11798.0,Patient,I know it's just don't be fine.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, but Okay, but, but what you said to me is that you had your pill bottle in your hand earlier and you were having suicidal thoughts, and so I want to, I want to make sure that. That you are set my goal is that you are safe Vanessa and if it means mom monitoring your meds for a few days that's okay. But."
11798.0,Patient,Again we're doing here and get a little confusing. Are we supposed to be going to john here today.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, you are, but I want you to hold on to her medications anyways just as part of her safety contract we we did we did a safety contract. You know, a while back that she she has, but I just want to make sure that we have safety precautions in place if she's having suicidal thoughts, then let's limit access to medications in the home, so if we need to secure those then that's what we need to do."
11798.0,Patient,So.
527.0,Provider,I can then add.
11798.0,Patient,Right now.
527.0,Provider,yeah That would be good.
11798.0,Patient,"That would be good, and you just stay on the line right now."
527.0,Provider,yeah i'm gonna yeah. yeah and then Vanessa are you okay with with mom taking you to the hospital right now.
11798.0,Patient,"Well, I don't have a choice."

527.0,Provider,know you can just go on in yep.
11798.0,Patient,"Okay, so so for your assessment she needs a behavior health."

527.0,Provider,um let's see the bright heart clinic me get that her.
11798.0,Patient,And she did she bring all of her meds trisha spring a list of what she's been taking.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, because typically if they're if they're admitted into the hospital I think they. Usually, they order the medications themselves, they they don't use the home meds. Alright, so let me get yeah."
11798.0,Patient,"Well, I can give them the list anyway yeah I mean honestly, a lot of it, too, I think I have said this and Dr she her neurologist and I have talked about it, but I believed that she's been overmedicated."
527.0,Provider,"And you know and, like the list is."
11798.0,Patient,"way too long, but like Dr she had said, possibly shatter was trying to keep her stabilized. Sure yeah um. You know, and I do think she needs to go in, if anything, to have that evaluate that she may only need a you know, three meds now one for thyroid the depression and the seizures you know. Sure she's off the alcohol and stuff you know."
527.0,Provider,yeah so the phone number for bright heart to the virtual clinic is one 800. uh huh eight nine to. uh huh 2695. Okay okay so Vanessa tell me tell me a little bit what you're hearing her tell me tell me what you understand what the next steps are going to be today.
11798.0,Patient,well. going to the hospital. To get. That. thing examined examiner whatever. Which just makes me nervous.
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, what makes you nervous, what can I help reassure you that it'll be okay."
11798.0,Patient,"Because I don't I just don't know what they're gonna be here, out of what i'm saying and what they're going to end up doing with me."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. I think I think all you can do Vanessa is just be honest with how you're feeling. And you've been able to do that with me and it's just going to be similar they're going to ask you a lot of questions because they want to know how they can help you and what what treatment is going to be most helpful for you. And so I want you to I just want you to be honest with with them because that's how that's how we're going to be able to help you. yeah Okay, because that's our goal here is we, we got to get some help and and it's beyond what mom can do too okay so moms moms you know just going to help you get to the next step here okay. And like I said I don't know what what they'll say at the end of the assessment what recommendations they'll make I can't I don't want us to jump to that."
11798.0,Patient,"That conclusion through the evaluation yeah. Somebody that knows another professional. yeah anything psychiatry is even look at what they've been putting her under you know, on medications and what she's going through, and you know, I think. If i've learned anything you know, through my daughter's issues being a health insurance broker, since the 70s, sometimes medications need to be adjusted. Yes, i'm definitely not the right medication for the person."
527.0,Provider,And that's yeah and that's what I.
11798.0,Patient,"yeah I had to get her back on track exactly I can't do it i'm not. You know you cannot do it. Right jackers not. minute not making a move, other than he said if she's not in the program he will no longer be her psychiatrists so that's when I got a little annoyed because personally that was just saying i'm going to make money off of the man's i'm prescribing to you. and the rest of it is up to you mom fix it, you know i'm out of here. And I can use other terms, of course, this is blah blah blah blah. And so I wasn't really happy with that approach, but there's nothing I can do about it and. You know my goal is, I want to see Vanessa back the way she used to be. mentally. You know, when she had Dr as an artist as an actress not having somebody all of a sudden take her down the rabbit hole and that's what I keep telling her you got these people that are not you think they're your friends and they're not you know."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I think at this point sheila that'll be something that she's going to have to figure out because you know us drilling it into her head and and trying to convince her otherwise. You know that's going to be something that that Vanessa can work on with her with her treatment team, you know in in therapy as well, so. yeah I think it's you know finding your worth again Vanessa that's what I that's what I want us to work towards is you feeling feeling good about yourself again okay."
11798.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So, so the So the first step, and the only step that we're taking at this point is we're going to the hospital for an assessment that's that's that's all that we need to focus on at this point, OK. OK OK."
11798.0,Patient,And i'll bring the list of all the meds that she's on.
527.0,Provider,"yeah because that'll be helpful for them to know what what she's on and yeah so that they can make. You know they literally I carry it in my purse yes, because it's you know, for me, as long."
11798.0,Patient,"Every time I hear ambulance i'm scared to death, you know it's been really tough and I keep the list with me that I printed out what she takes when she should take it yeah. Okay, you know it's It shows all bring that. All get her there I don't know if they'll let me stay because a coven Costa county but. we'll go from there."
527.0,Provider,Okay Vanessa is gonna.
11798.0,Patient,"Let me do this right you're not going to have me. force us to call the police. So how much time, so we're all in agreement here. She should show up, I mean, are you going to check to make sure i'm. can get her there, or what are we, you know, or is it all falling into me to."
