Jamie like. i've been open with same about everything and she's like you know you have a place to come back to if things don't work out like. she's been really, really cool about it, so I know it kind of hurt her too, because you know she was using me for emotional support which that's fine you know i'm still there for but i'm just not physically there now."
304.0,Provider,You and I were like.
3841.0,Patient,"yeah we had a couple of problems and stuff like that I. mean we figured everything out, but she she knew in her head that you know there wasn't going to stay like that forever, you know, like. At some point, I was going to move on and move forward in my life, so you know that was just I hate to say it like this, but it was a stepping stone, even though that's still my best friend. And i'll do anything for but. She knew that just as well as I did."
304.0,Provider,"I mean, as long as they think you were you were honest in a kind way. About sort of yeah just. It sounds like you both kind of. It benefited people at that time. And you were staying at jamie's a lot."

304.0,Provider,Temporary with the other.
3841.0,Patient,"yeah she I make. I guess well she knew from the start that it wasn't. going to be forever she knew that deep down in our heart, and you know I thought about getting a place with her stuff like that, but it was also one of those things it's. we're looking for two different things in life, like she's just trying to have fun and do you know meet new people you know what I mean casually. I know your little ones with you. So."
304.0,Provider,I gotcha.
3841.0,Patient,"So yeah so she's just trying to like have fun, I guess, would be the best way to put it. and not what i'm looking for in life, like. I already did all of that, I already you know I had my fun and just all the meaningless stuff and I want more than that, now, though."
304.0,Provider,"Right absolutely I mean so. sort of started to answer my question is. I mean obviously yeah you're not in the party. casual mode. Are you ready now for another relationship, are you kind of just seeing how things go."
3841.0,Patient,"um I do think I am ready for a relationship because it's a healthy relationship. it's family based you know, like with Beckett, he said, and so there's like responsibility and accountability and everything else, so I think it's something that's really going to benefit me yes."
304.0,Provider,yeah and and things have been like been good when with becca like you had met him obviously before.

3841.0,Patient,In a long time.
304.0,Provider,i'm really happy for you.
3841.0,Patient,"Thank you yeah I mean I worked my butt off to get here to reach this happiness, so I mean I should be able to enjoy it and I talked to my friend yesterday. And you know she was crying she's like I didn't want to lose you and i'm like you're not losing me like. I live 15 minutes down the road, I mean i'm not going to be there as much, but you know I told her like I still want you in my life, I still want you like coming to see me and i'll come see you like this isn't the end of the world."
304.0,Provider,"Right well, and this is just like hopefully you're seeing how different this relationship with Jamie is than it was with Tracy like Jamie should want you to have friends like it's okay to have a female friend. that's non romantic you know, like Tracy just was always so controlling and wouldn't even let you go to the gym and so. I think. You know that's. Like another marker of a healthy relationship and she should want you to have your own copy and have your own friends were like she's going hiking and you're not up for it and that's fine you know. Like that's healthy."
3841.0,Patient,"Exactly so she's gonna go do her thing, and I am going to do my um she's actually just getting home so, is it Okay, if I cut this a little short."
304.0,Provider,"yeah no worries Thank you yeah i'm sorry i'm kind of on the go today to and i'm sorry for not responding to your message sooner, I always have time for you so. Wonderful weekend. At the concert and save. On Tuesday."
3841.0,Patient,Alright sounds good i'll see Lisa.
304.0,Provider,"yeah okay yeah we'll touch base usually Thursday afternoon, so thanks for protecting me back, I appreciate it."
3841.0,Patient,No problem anytime i'll talk to.
304.0,Provider,"You later bye. That was john Ashley so i'm just going to finish up dictating this for him. Just one second. Okay, so john has gone through a lot of big changes in the past two months. So i'm going to just know tape for him that I think psycho socially that's The biggest challenge that john has had around his recovery, he has been in sustained remission for probably about six months now, six months now. But sometimes just the instability, like in his relationships, has been a contributing factor to his relapse in the past. And I noticing like a bit of a pattern, with him, where. Like previously, he was not working, so at least he has his income out but previously, he was always trying to apply for social security disability couldn't get approved and so essentially he had no income and was 100% relying on. his girlfriend his ex girlfriend now Tracy for financial support. did not have any of his own income it really was very much trapped in an abusive and manipulative relationship where he had nowhere to go and that. Was was a very unsafe situation for him, but thankfully, he was able to get out of that safely and he's working now, but he still does not have his own. Housing so now he's moved in with his new girlfriend Jane and her son and so sounds like he left things, though, on good terms with his friend his former roommate. But that is so my concern for him at least he has income now he has his be a goal but that's just my big concern for him that. You know, things with the relationship to go well, and essentially be homeless again into that might be. Just a goal for john I think for the future to maybe look at just finding. A roommate maybe a male roommate that does he could share expenses with but someone who's not in a relationship with its own apartment because the other roommate he was really staying with her and he did kind of key or anything like that so maybe just for john to find a roommate. We could share expenses with but really that his own. You know his own house. and his own place to stay long term. And so those will be some some updated treatment goals for john I will see him again in two weeks, probably Thursday afternoon and he's really good about reaching out and keeping those appointments and otherwise i'll see the group."
