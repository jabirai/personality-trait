Maybe some chicken and let us just purging three times a week that she'll survive on pedialyte popsicles greats. Only eating once a day. And that she had 13 suicide attempts was on life support from taking 400 pills, if you could note especially that she hasn't had a period since 2014 she has bone density issues malnutrition kidney every kidney problem. Her livers doesn't produce protein she can't have kids and she doesn't remember her ekg results, but she does have. tech Cardio I think what she said she you could note that she was in an Inpatient treatment Center because she was septic in the hospital due to her eating disorder, but it was not an eating disorder Inpatient treatment Center it was a. sounds like a mental health co occurring treatment Center. And if you could also know that she body checks for up to an hour at a time. she's. Let me see if there's anything else that seemed important. yeah no I think those are just the really important things to note. As well as everything else that she said, and if you could know that she did say she's not currently suicidal. Because medication is helping her that would be great to thank you."
