14204.0,Patient,Are you.
214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking so just want to follow up where we left off right, so I can figure out what we're going to do the work going forward Okay, so we we thought we wanted to get into the eating disorder and now now what's right that's all right."
14204.0,Patient,"yeah I think. I think my problem with eating is I stressing. So I think, maybe managing my stress."
214.0,Provider,"I just wanted to make sure that's all Okay, we definitely can work on that together. A couple of things going, how was your trip."
14204.0,Patient,It was good.
214.0,Provider,"Good good good. So you've done your survey, everything is good. what's your birth date again. Do you think the medications are working."
14204.0,Patient,"Well, the propranolol um I think it's helping with. Like the physical symptoms I love when I have anxiety because I feel like my heart's not eating out of my chest, I can catch my breath. And then the wellbutrin. I feel like it's hoping a little I don't think i've been on it very long so. Well i've only had one fill of the 300 milligram so that's 15 days I think so. Maybe. A month I."
214.0,Provider,mean we should we should see some effect either none or something that's improved so maybe maybe just it's just taking longer usually it's 14 to 21.
14204.0,Patient,"I mean I I think I can't. really know how to explain I guess. organize my thoughts, a little better. So actually I haven't started my. The pharmacy said that it was cancelled, and when I called because I have the it's walgreens I have the APP and it said cancelled, so I called them and they said Oh, we don't have anything on your profile for that. So I wasn't sure if she had canceled it or if it was a problem with the pharmacy."
214.0,Provider,it's a problem with the pharmacy because she put that in on September 20.
14204.0,Patient,They just keep saying they don't have anything.
214.0,Provider,Not so. Bad how is your sleeping.
14204.0,Patient,about the same.
214.0,Provider,Which is.
14204.0,Patient,"I fall asleep at about. 1130 or 12 and then I sleep really good for a couple of hours and then i'm awake for. A couple of hours and then. Just those off here and there, until."
214.0,Provider,"So we getting it less than five or like where we would like to continue asleep, and I was three."
14204.0,Patient,I would say two to three hours of straight sleep.
214.0,Provider,"and total sleep, maybe."
14204.0,Patient,four and a half. yeah pretty I feel very exhausted.
214.0,Provider,"I want to. hit shut up now because i'm not sure why this transit zone. We need to figure something out because that there's going to cause bigger problems okay. What. make anything a negative let's just talk about him hypotheticals what conference is it to be drawn to the food, if you have to. make it a sentence, make it label it what what is the comfort that it provides you."
14204.0,Patient,"Oh. I guess it takes my mind off, of whatever i'm. Thinking about. Well, I tend to worry about everything. But mostly what's on my mind is. I guess, a lot of. Like insecurities maybe."
214.0,Provider,"This trip, how did you do this trip that you went on. Dr fly."
14204.0,Patient,"um I flew and I was really nervous, but I actually took the propranolol before I got to the airport. So it kind of helped and. Once I landed I. I felt like I was. Fine, because I was back home. Just with family."
214.0,Provider,"So did you run that tape through what before I got on a plane, I feel nervous, while I was on a plane, I was nervous in the plane to golf I was knows. I landed, I was nervous, I saw my family I started to feel better I wasn't so nervous like so one of the things that will be helpful, is. it's okay to feel something, but then it's okay to say to that feeling, you know you keep doing this to me and every time you make me worry I tell myself, there was no need to worry when we have to you have to like figure out how to combat that bad. um. You know. Your worries, as if they're possible but he's worried he's really don't come true, and then you you've drawn a line to it and said, my insecure. So, when you say in security and security from one."
14204.0,Patient,"um. I think, having people. Like really pay attention to me or look at me. I just feel really uncomfortable."
214.0,Provider,thinking that they're thinking something. yeah yeah is there anything odd about you.
14204.0,Patient,i'm.
214.0,Provider,"i'm just doing the same thing I said before, we have this thing we have this feeling, and now we have the total feeling something here's the thought about this. Sometimes we believe what's going in on our inside our itself we actually believe people can see that if this person knows exactly what i'm gone through. But we know if we think about that that would be SLIM and none they wouldn't be able to see it, or we walk around. As if other people actually can see our insights whether we're in emotional distress maybe we're a little depressed because we have some daily will always worried that someone or figure us out. But could, that is, that really possible that someone I don't know in a coffee shop walking down the street, would be able to see, I know exactly what's wrong with Jillian."
14204.0,Patient,know. I feel like I hide it very well.
214.0,Provider,"No, I realized that cuz you're always smiling, the reason that point I don't see you smile, but I also think that's part of. your presentation. So if if you smile at least mark as far as the one last what's wrong, nobody will know, I will have to answer so we put up like a sort of a mask right. yeah that's hiring."
14204.0,Patient,"Yes. yeah because then I feel like when I do try to talk to someone they don't really take me seriously because I mean even right now. talking to you, I feel like. I just tough to smile and make it OK so."
214.0,Provider,"The person that knows everything about. I know who you are so I mean your smile, is something that you do as an automatic which brushing teeth it's just this is who i'm going to be this is how i'm going to represent. I think what you may want to think about, though, is now, when we see each other, can you at least let your guard down for those 1520 minutes. This week I think what will happen is you feel like someone's listening to like someone really cares about you versus if I keep having this friend has anybody going to figure out where i'm at or what's going on, I think you need to think about that a little bit."
14204.0,Patient,That makes sense.
214.0,Provider,"You know, it can be difficult um maybe maybe the way to start doing is to turn the video off. And you at least know that you're not always smile maybe it's hard at the beginning to show that to me, but at least let yourself saying, or what. For the moments that I see many i'm going to be mean i'm not going to be what I normally do throughout the day, which is put on a happy face, I want to figure out. How I can get my inside to be like my outside I want them both to match when I meet with him I don't want to have one but be presenting with another right those all those commercials up with happy faces, but my size not feeling so great. I think it could be helpful to you know, I think it could be helpful for you to just. feel you in a safe place know that you've been validated know that there's no bias, but maybe we can work through like. what's The worst thing that can happen if you look upset what are you afraid that people have an estate Julian what's going on and then you'd be like see this is what I don't want to happen is what's happening."
14204.0,Patient,I guess I don't want people to think that i'm a negative person.
214.0,Provider,"So, so are you the ball of the party all the time."
14204.0,Patient,Oh no.
214.0,Provider,Oh no.
14204.0,Patient,I know.
214.0,Provider,"that's all right so you're the wallflower but like is it is, it is it ever okay to be the one for the day that's just like I don't have the energy to do it, I don't advocate I don't have the bandwidth to help somebody today it's about me just having a blood day is there. Just thinking about is there anything wrong with just having a day like that, whether people know it or not."
14204.0,Patient,No there's nothing wrong with that.
214.0,Provider,"And you may find the return of, that is, people will be empathetic. So the thing is something's wrong somebody may say Julian I know exactly what you want to I had, I had a rough week last week, if you may find yourself. being looked at in a different manner versus what you think that outcome, maybe I don't know saying you need to be vulnerable solid front, but it's something to think about like if it's okay for people to civil you really are because I won't you get lost in who are eventually."
14204.0,Patient,yeah I feel like I guess that's what happened. I don't really know who I am and. If I just. keep this on then people won't ask and. they'll just accepting.
214.0,Provider,"And then we feel insecure. We start to realize how the wars got built in one hand we're trying to be transparent and be. As revealing as possible, then the other high and the other side when we don't don't want wondering like what's going on, so like right there's that push and pull event like if we continue to mask and not let people in. And people won't be able to get in so like How would that work."
14204.0,Patient,"I guess what it, I mean yeah."
214.0,Provider,"And it's tough it's tough to whatever's going on to express, but I don't think it's that tough to say to somebody just not having a good day man just just it's a real crapper today. I don't know what would that feel exhilarating would that feel like. independence and strength versus like hiding behind a mask."
14204.0,Patient,"yeah. I think I might have a hard time if someone. Actually. said, like oh what's Tom talk to me what's wrong or. Because, then I would I feel like I would just crumble like be very."
214.0,Provider,"Could you say something like this it's just a shitty day man now looking at the top about it, but thanks for asking is there a way. to shut anything down before and afters but for someone to say is yelling and i'm really sorry I hope it turns out better. Maybe you could shut them down, but at the same time, maybe you can get a vote of confidence or an affirmation. about how important you are to them because that's your missing piece you don't know how important you are to other people, because people can shoulder important because they think it's on the phone and. she's the one that's always fine she does not involve she says everything is great like and then at the end, would like to talk them nobody asked me how i'm doing this like oh that's right I don't want anybody asked me on them. So it's a little bit of a catch 23, but I think it may work in our next session seriously, just to be like. What what is, what do you really feel and, what is your devery like out there, and if it's good it's good it's bad it's bad to like see what that's like it. Is you really will not react to it it's going to be safe, like maybe if you felt the ability to like what I call farm it. up and be like hey this is pretty good, I think I want to do this more often and then you may pick certain individuals to deal with an MP very reserved other people that's how usually people start."
14204.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I was thinking. That oh now I need everyone to see that i'm upset if I am upset but."
214.0,Provider,Just just one person would be enough to say you know I love you I think you're great I still think is special whatever this person has the ability to save the conference you. Then you would realize your worth and then you wouldn't feel insecure but holding back doesn't let anyone in and we don't need the whole world to be anonymous all we need is someone who we believe we can confide in and who we actually are looking for positive response.
14204.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"In the past, have you thought you haven't gotten positive responses."
14204.0,Patient,"I think i've just always. felt like I had to be. Like. Okay i'm for my mom. I have three sisters and growing up to have them gave her a lot of problems, so I guess, I felt like oh if i'm like if nothing's ever wrong with me then everything will just make my mom happy and."
214.0,Provider,Actually. Hiding behind the mom.
14204.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Maybe mom is not the one to Sam have a crappy day. Now that you're an adult you're on your own. I think it's admirable what your. What your belief system is because it's true with this is what happened, but the reality is, how are you feeling sad. You feeling as as you're not sleeping you always worrying, how is that truly going away on your mother, one way or another, like is she going to internalize and say oh my God zillion This is all my fault I don't know how to react, but i'm just saying. You know what what's happening to isn't any one particular for and you holding it to yourself doesn't really help anybody because it's just as a role to to write that they're not still the little kids to pin we're a family dynamics have changed. So it's just something to think about it's a lot to think about, but I think I think you said something really, really great which was yeah I don't need to learn only to let everybody okay and kind of pick and choose. The individual someone will include and see how that feels I think I think it would be a breath of fresh air for you to be doing wrong and I realized that get that I don't want to use attention because seeking attention, I think they're seeking validation. So let's let's work on that and let's see how it goes so sometimes just told me she sent the transit zone and again. Okay, so I will call them now, and if it did not, you have my email, so he many they're saying that's not him because new sometime need to figure that out because I wanted to get some sleep okay So what does our next session look like for us."
14204.0,Patient,not sure.
214.0,Provider,"What is your schedule, what does it look like."
14204.0,Patient,um so my schedule is that I work Monday through Friday. Nine to five. I do get a half hour lunch and.
214.0,Provider,"we're not going to take your lunch, do you think that. Just. works. Do you think something like. 4pm on Sunday would work. So Halloween."
14204.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"um. So let's revisit lap exposure well there's a feel as we tried to, we now need will trade and I searched and let's see where we're moving on let's see how we feel about that and then we'll take it will take us law and we'll go from now, maybe we'll see. Maybe we'll see the similarities with the food come off as well okay so it's 4pm. seven. Questions for me, before we go."
14204.0,Patient,"about how long this session will be just I have a daughter, and two stepsons so."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe. I knew that I would never made it to that day. Is later better."
14204.0,Patient,throughout the week.
214.0,Provider,"Well, that last week is packed. packed I don't have any available, yes, my problem and I wanted you to be able to have you two in the month, you know i'm saying. Does it make sense to do it. On that Saturday, then at four o'clock on Sunday. So it's not on Halloween and you can do the trick or treating."
14204.0,Patient,I think I think I would work.
214.0,Provider,Is it Sunday.
14204.0,Patient,"Can I check, because I think they have soccer but I don't know what time the game."

14204.0,Patient,"Okay, very much."

14204.0,Patient,thing that's it.
214.0,Provider,"I very good, so I look forward to seeing you take care and be safe okay."
