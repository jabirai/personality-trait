12955.0,Patient,"i've been dealing with like this foot rash for like a really long time and just know I noticed like in the last week i've noticed that now, I have a weird like freckle or a mole on my foot so that's like I. said, I have to go in next week and get that looked at and i'm going on for a blood test later today to try to get to the root of why I have been tired uh huh."
706.0,Provider,Have you gotten your vaccine for coven.
12955.0,Patient,yeah totally okay.
706.0,Provider,"So I mean, even though you've gotten your vaccine, unfortunately, you could still have coven to so you might want to get tested for that."
12955.0,Patient,"Maybe I mean I they took my temperature, I have no other symptoms, aside from being sleepy like no weakness like one day, last week I went for a three and a half mile walk to try to wake myself up mm hmm okay um."
706.0,Provider,Have you feel your depression is i'm.
12955.0,Patient,"feeling pretty okay like. ups and downs, you know depends on the day. Pretty pretty good overall um. I got a request for a job interview, but she said she was going to call me on Sunday like try to call me and she hasn't contacted me and so i'm kind of like anxious about that, I think."
706.0,Provider,"That can think anybody would be anxious about that, but that's a good thing that's a positive thing."
12955.0,Patient,"yeah it's. For a preschool or daycare kind of thing and really, really nice part of Berkeley like a really hoity toity part of Berkeley. So that would be i've loved kids i've worked with kids before like. And if I could get that job that would be really swell."
706.0,Provider,"hmm definitely. So is there, something that you want to discuss today I know we talked about quite a few things last week we really kind of focused on your mom and that relationship and your family."
12955.0,Patient,yeah um I figured we could touch on my sister and like Maybe my ex little bit.
706.0,Provider,"All right, well, this is your time so take it away."
12955.0,Patient,"So i'm my sister's ra she's three and a half years younger than me. We kind of. don't really talk. In 2012 no okay right before I got sick i'd say we've gotten to a really big fight. Sorry, so this is back in um would have been 2010 or so. About that time yeah. We were close growing up like you know we fought, like all students did but. We like I thought we were pretty close you play barbies wrote fanfiction together, even though we got into like arguments over it, we really liked it and we really liked working on creative projects together and like me she's she was really creative. I was always the more social one, and it was like I was aware outgoing one, and it was easy for me to make friends and Ari was a little more awkward so she kind of focused on active. Academic success, and she skipped A grade, and she was the smart one she was valedictorian of her high school and all that jazz. She went I was still living in Hawaii and she came to the mainland for college she went to a kind of a. I don't want to say elitist but elitist all girls school and Berkeley like sue the most. I don't know if you've heard of mel's. it's an all girls school and like right on the cusp of Berkeley in oakland just very ultra ultra liberal school. And like i'm liberal, but this school is like kind of the put you in a pocket, so that when you experience the way the real the outside world is it's very upsetting based on just what you're used to. I feel like she got kind of stuck up after her first semester at that school. And she like. got a little nasty with me when she was back for winter break. And it would got to the point where it was just so much that I left and I went back to stay at the dorms because I didn't like the way how she was treating me it was being really nasty uh huh. And, like the day before she was set to go back to the mainland she called me and gave me a very half assed apology and I was just like okay like I didn't accept the apology, and that was basically kind of the end of our closeness."
706.0,Provider,Long is that man.
12955.0,Patient,That was back in 2010 i'd say.
706.0,Provider,Oh wow so it's been like 11 years.
12955.0,Patient,"yeah so um it was just like that was me like saying you don't get to like be so nasty to me and then give me a half assed apology, the day before you're supposed to leave. uh huh like just and during that visit, I discovered, like all kinds of things like she would always freak out if I borrowed her stuff I discovered she's been stealing stuff of mine like. She tried to make off with a pair of my shoes and that made me search through her things that I found out she'd stolen almost my entire CD collection."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
12955.0,Patient,"yeah basically everything she's like except for the one band that i'd have noticed their CDs were missing she took with her to California, so I took them all back and didn't say anything about it, but it was just a very. double standard for her she's screaming my face if I stole if I borrowed stuff from her and i'd always return the stuff I borrowed to her."
706.0,Provider,And you didn't take it to a different state.
12955.0,Patient,"yeah exactly so she got um. And then, like it felt like from then on, whenever she contacted me it would be just because she needed something like she hit me up maybe like a. year or so yeah like a year later, I mean like and she visited over the summer and we had a few nice moments, but a lot of it was her giving me attitude and acting holier than now, and just like pushing me away. He contacted me about like a year later, because it turned out, she know mills has this reputation for if you go there you'll become a lesbian because it's an all girls school and it's like this is not the thing they say like you'll become a million. And this is like I like it's on urban dictionary it's a very like big like a lot of people say it, this is like a thing. And Ari contacted me and basically i'm her girlfriend which I did not know she had was one of her close friends was threatening to break was basically saying I need a break up with you because you won't tell your dad about me. And I have no idea why IRA made such a big deal out of telling my parents about her relationship like it turned out, she told mom months ago. And mom never told me cuz mom kept it a secret, but like dead sisters a lesbian I don't know why are a you know almost feels like she wanted this like. Poor unexpected queer like. It just felt like."
706.0,Provider,That secret.
12955.0,Patient,"Or, just like to have this like I don't know if she liked the drama, or what but. I was kind of like sat with like talked to her on like video chat which we used to do quite a bit back when we're closer and we video chatted so much her first semester of college. And I said and I talked with her and she did tell dad that weekend and dad at already guessed it he's not stupid. uh huh but then she like never really talked to me after that, like every now and then she messaged me but i'd usually messaged her, and we were never really close. When I was visiting California, in 2007 when I was here up North for those three months trimming weed with when the friend that had the falling out with at one point I came down here. And our he did hit me up to hang out with her introduce her to now her boyfriend Liam transition from Liz to Liam. And we spent the day together and I thought we had a lovely time and I messaged her to say like how great it was hanging out with her and she gave me like a really like. Just like yeah it was fun like just like really like blahs answer and it kind of felt like the whole day had been performative for Liam."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so was this on the phone or with a via text."
12955.0,Patient,"This is in person Oh, the the communication was via text."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so just I want to stop you there for just a second so some accumulated yeah it was fun or somebody way yeah it was fun, but you don't know because it's via text."
12955.0,Patient,"I feel like sometimes with its family, you can tell."
706.0,Provider,"I don't think so because there's there's no inclination with text messages it's not like you put it in a certain color or something, and it means that you're happy you're that you're sad or you know what I mean like. So I just I don't i'm not saying you're wrong i'm just saying there's another side to it, where, if you would say to her well all you responded was yeah it was fun. And she's like well yeah it was fun, you know, like food because look see how much it changes that that sentence, if you just have the intonation that you don't get in a text message."
12955.0,Patient,"I guess but. um and she did a pick me up I had like a snafu with the bus and she picked me up in San Rafael, which was very nice of her and I like got them lunch and stuff to say thank you and she was being a little passive aggressive towards me. That was in December 2017 lights, say, maybe on the. 10th or 12th that Christmas, when she called home, and it was me and dad are back in Hawaii she calls home and she basically says. I pick up and she's like hey it's out there and i'm like Oh, he left for a minute he'll be back soon no tell him, I called and I was like hey wait a second Merry Christmas and she goes Okay, and she hung up on me."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
12955.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"So, have you talked to your sister."
12955.0,Patient,"i'm not. on the phone since then and that's because in 2018 something happened. So I graduated May. and My mom was coming, and I think I mentioned mom had been a real pill at ari's graduation uh huh and to the point where Ari refused to sear for the rest of bumps visit. w dad basically hit ra up and was like hey can you like send your sister like a card or something for graduation or color when it's your graduation, it means a lot to me. And I already got like was like I already sent a card it's on its way, a dad was like okay thanks because, like your mom's here and she's been a real pill, and I want like. Rachel to have like a nice graduation. and The following week rolls around and I told you what my mom did, and my graduation and just how like dad was really fuming. And he gets home and gets on the computer and sees ra being tagged and all of her friends graduation events, she has not contacted me at all I expected as much from her I didn't really care. So he called her any left her an angry voicemail. And immediately i'm like on Facebook, with my best friend at my house, I see all these little light go on, and I see your start typing and it basically she was trying to frame it that, like she was in the middle of writing me a message and then dad colder. And let the horrible like dude like the worst thing anyone ever said to me like. Just really tried to like. So, and it was obviously a lie."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
12955.0,Patient,"and her and dad got into it over that weekend dad was upset with her for it turned out, she lied she basically said I just put the card in the mail that was like wait, you said you mailed it last week."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,So she had basically been caught in a lie.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,"And she started trying to like make it about this so many different things like well I don't like the way you talk about mom to dad which that doesn't like. Should top mom sometimes he rolls rise, or when she's being a real deck he's like. A deck. But and then like or and saying well you like Rachel better than me just like all these like just. They get into it dad gets upset with her, and that was last time I talked to my dad."
706.0,Provider,that's last time she talked to your dad.
12955.0,Patient,"was in a while I guess she did send them an email at the beginning of right when his accident happened because I had to reach out to her and tell her that that was in the accident and what was going on. And, of course, she pride and called mom. it's just like. it's just really obnoxious to me that, like it's like she's such a martyr."
706.0,Provider,So.
12955.0,Patient,"I have not spoken to her in like over i've not heard her voice myself like talking to me, since 2017. And we live very close together she didn't contact me when I moved to California and I didn't really bother contacting her because, like I know she doesn't want to see me uh huh he's made that perfectly clear. After in. mom had an APP or 20 yeah 2019 mom they found her on the floor, I told you, they found her landlord founder on the floor. And it feels like every now and then, are you gets shook when she realizes and you know, like, I told you when they thought I had a brain tumor she rushed out and bought me all these things. She flew to Wisconsin and help take care of mom and mom thinks it's because already felt guilty for not really talking to mom very much."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
12955.0,Patient,"So. After that already started contacting me every now and then like she text me or like Facebook messenger me. uh huh and i'd like massive chair like because I know we both she likes houseplants too and i'm a real house plant freak so like let her know if there's a cool plant like a certain department store or something. mm hmm Center tech talks, but like maybe once every few months or so I don't keep in. A couple months ago she asked me to pets it for her which was like oh wow like the first time you contact me and like. want to see me it's so I can do something for you. huh no she didn't invite me over to visit her I don't want to like at her house, I do not want to see her on her like turf because she'll be in control of the space. So I have invited her to like third party spaces, like a park or a restaurant like not not a space she controls, I don't want that to be but. Basically, she sent out an email after his accident, saying that she was basically there for them, if you needed to talk and he sent her like a couple of emails and she never responded and I told you, I had like there's a moment. When I was finally moving out of my apartment where me and dad had a fight and weren't talking but I was still really worried about him, so I said hey. to shoot email a dad if you can, and she basically full on admitted to me, but she doesn't want a relationship with that or to give them false hope that. She will have a relationship with him. So yeah that's a."
706.0,Provider,"that's a lot of information, I mean you, I mean you really were very descriptive and and when it happened. How do you feel about all of that, how do you feel about that lack of relationship with your sister."
12955.0,Patient,um I feel kind of the shoes i'm not a very genuine a nice person.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, but how do you feel I mean do you do you do you miss having that relationship with your sister, are you relieved that you no longer have to deal with that relationship with your sister, how do you feel."
12955.0,Patient,I mean I liked her when we were close but she's that was back when she was in high school. she's an adult now she's like a completely different person. Okay.
706.0,Provider,I feel like you guys grew apart.
12955.0,Patient,"hmm I mean I feel like I don't know who she is and what I see feels very like she has a book blog online and it's all very performative. Okay um when she graduated from mills she was the head of the newspaper and basically wrote an article about how she felt like she never had a family, which was not true her and she mom and her were close she was the faith like mom definitely liked her more than me. And dad was always there for her like what she got jaw surgery dad was the one who nursed her back to health."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,"And it just dad was, like all right, what is this and she's like well you weren't supposed to read that. Just kind of feels like she wants to be like perceived as this misunderstood LGBT person who built her own way and has no real family."
706.0,Provider,"So why do you think that. You are able to kind of stand up for yourself when it comes to your sister and your mom like you're you're able to kind of vent to them how you feel or be angry with them, or those kinds of things. And do it, and then advocating way like you're advocating for yourself but in your other relationships like friendships relationships. That you just let it continue and continue and continue."
12955.0,Patient,I don't know I mean I let ra be nasty to me for quite a bit like when she was she would be like say some really nasty things to me in high school. uh huh and my mom has to. Maybe it's like. It takes me a while to put my foot down with people.
706.0,Provider,"can be could be it just I guess i'm. Was enlightening to see that with family, you seem to cut it off. Like I mean obviously you've done with your family longer so I mean obviously it's going to take you longer to make a change or to advocate for yourself for those things. Whereas what like friendships maybe they're just a couple of years, and so, but after a couple of years you haven't you've had enough, and you kind of like okay i'm done. But with family it's different because it's spread out over a longer period of time um that could be possibly but it's just interesting how you had the same pattern in all your relationships, but."
12955.0,Patient,"you're not all of them, I do have some friends that are very nice."
706.0,Provider,But all the relationships that we've talked about.
12955.0,Patient,I shouldn't say.
706.0,Provider,"You kind of have that same pattern, but when it comes to like the family, it seems like. You had less patience for them kind of like once you would had enough you had had enough, and with the other ones, when we kind of talked about it, it just seemed like. They just kept going and going and going, but like I said it could be just a simple fact that with your family it had been over an extended period of time, so you just you know kind of hit that that implode I guess point at a certain time and then you were done. mm hmm you know but it's interesting to just kind of examine the difference of the two relationships and then also the similarities."
12955.0,Patient,I mean with Ari it was her decision to end that relationship like I tried to she got off the phone with me really quick after she tried to give me that half assed apology.
706.0,Provider,And I.
12955.0,Patient,called back and i'm like hey and I tried wanted to explain and she just cried and yelled at me and hung back up.
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you did try to mend that relationship."
12955.0,Patient,"And I have many times over the years and, like, I thought we were close again after that. You know day, but then like I said I kept trying to reach out and she would always kind of like. back me back up or like not really respond, and it was very clear, I mean if anything is calling on Christmas wanting to talk to your other family member and then going OK, and then hanging up. and Like she rarely ever con like she didn't contact me on my birthdays and stuff like it was very obvious she did not want a relationship with me. And my mom had been abusive as a kid. And she was you know. I, the only reason I moved back in with her was because I was chronically ill and I didn't have a choice and I, you know the other relationships like when. I knew going over many years and I don't know at that point, I felt like one felt like family, I think, maybe like when you don't have a really nice family you kind of cling to found family super hard."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,I think that might be.
706.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, that makes sense, so. Why do you think. So, like your mom and you have some issues and your sister, and you have some issues and you've had some friendships that have had."
12955.0,Patient,"my sister, and I have a non existent relationship really okay."
706.0,Provider,"So a non existent relationship with some other friends, you have a good friendship other friends who had kind of attacks like. What do you think is the common denominator, with the relationships are unstable. For the non existent ones."
12955.0,Patient,I don't really know they all kind of feels like. They all kind of feel a little different like.
706.0,Provider,"So you as a person, how are you in each of those relationships."
12955.0,Patient,i'd say really giving and probably really. didn't set up boundaries enough.
706.0,Provider,"Okay that's good insight. um. Do you feel passively and i'm and I think you this is how you feel but potentially could you have felt due to that generosity and that kindness and, that being very open and giving when it wasn't reciprocated that you harbored some resentment."
12955.0,Patient,I don't think so because things ended with gwen because she. was like nasty to me and would say horrible things to me and things like ended because we got into a physical altercation because she made me cry.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,"With my mom things ended because she wasn't being an eye like she I had an interview, and she didn't show up to it."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,"With clown things ended because she kept like constantly I don't think I feel it feels like not reciprocal is one thing, because I have relationships that like you know I feels like i'm a little more present towards but I forgive because those people are like cup very demanding careers. I feel like expecting the bare minimum of like you know not leaving like. Things ended with Leona because she left me waiting for over an hour and then change your plans to once she should have known like. I had a little nervous dog that needed to sit on my lap and she thought it would be like. cool the change those plans without contacting i'm like sitting there dressed and I all these presence for her and stuff and she couldn't I had to contact her to find out that they were change. I don't feel like that's like it's not even like be reciprocal at that point that's just like have a little common courtesy for me."
706.0,Provider,"OK OK, so the last time we talked about your mom we talked about what that non negotiable is where to remember that. um and then we also talked about you, creating kind of a letter to her telling her like what you need to decide, did you work on any of that."
12955.0,Patient,"I didn't work on a letter to her, it was really upsetting to think about that and it had been like over 10 days since she emailed me and I just. I guess I kind of woke up today thinking about like maybe saying. My boundaries it's just really painful right now."
706.0,Provider,yeah no absolutely absolutely and it's going to be painful um.
12955.0,Patient,"But no each all of these relationships that and I guess, and when I finally I mean they all end in like very different ways, but. It may be ends, when I put my put my foot down and say you can't treat me this way anymore."
706.0,Provider,"So do you feel like you were. kind of an easy target for everybody, because you didn't put up those boundaries and they felt like they could kind of do whatever to you, and they didn't have to worry about it, you were like. kind of that unconditional person, so you know how they kids especially they'll pick one person that even if, like. They love more than life itself like they just love this person to death, but they know that that one person isn't going anywhere, no matter what, so all of like the access outside anger and frustration goes to them um I kids especially do."
12955.0,Patient,The steak oh yeah. You know what I mean like mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"Because they know well, I can treat this person, however, they, however, and they're not going anywhere they're always going to be there for me."
12955.0,Patient,"With gwen definitely and her husband was also that person for her uh huh. um I think when did really value me as a friend, but I think her like. She would get really like frustrated at me, and again I have ADHD and like she didn't believe in ADHD at all. And so, she would like anytime I made a mistake or messed up she would like get really pissed off or just be really nasty and say mean things to me, and she would not speak that way to other friends of hers."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,"And I observed that and i'm like it's because she knows i'm always going to stick around uh huh and that was definitely gwen's mo mo absolutely. I think my sister maybe thought that too, when that relationship did come to an end, I think, maybe, she was so nasty to me was because she like thought i'd always come around and maybe. Cutting that off like when I put up boundaries was like her way of protecting herself I don't know, are you displays a lot of narcissistic tendencies herself."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So is it possible that she had some so maybe she had some I mean, because obviously being somebody, that is, you know lesbian or bisexual or things like that. is challenging for some to come to that realization of hey this is this is how I am. You know, is it possible that, because she was kind of coming into that she seemed like she was kind of frightened to say something to your dad what you thought was weird. But she had told your mom but she hadn't told you um you know and your mom didn't tell you do you think that potentially some of her feelings of that snappiness and then. kind of verbal aggression wasn't necessarily meant for you, but just came out on you."
12955.0,Patient,"um I don't know about that, because when she had that snappiness towards me she wasn't yet and her relationship with Liam. dad. thinks our is jealous of me. And this is like stuff he's like slowly embedded over the course of like the last 10 years but. You thanks I mean, as I said, I was the more outgoing person and our he was kind of a little socially awkward he thinks are he was jealous of that. I don't know and again now, are we were both creative people are is a librarian and I, you know don't really have a big career path, but I am working on making a name for myself as a writer. That thing sorry might be a little. jealous of that. ra had a kind of really bad overbite that was corrected with surgery so. A lot of like I think a lot of people might have said, I was the prettier sister growing up. Okay, which is something I definitely didn't feel because she was thinner than me and I was so fixated on weight as a kid. uh huh so that wasn't something that like cross, like every now and then like people would say you're the prettier sister to me and i'd be like really shocked because i'm like but she's the skinnier one."
706.0,Provider,Because you associate being pretty with being skinny.
12955.0,Patient,"I back then, I did. yeah. i've become a lot more accepting of you know."
706.0,Provider,Good.
12955.0,Patient,"I mean, I still want to be thinner than I am currently but."
706.0,Provider,"And you can make that change, you know."
12955.0,Patient,"Oh hey I already, am I, my most I told you, I lost 80 pounds gained about but i'm working on losing it again. yeah I didn't get it all back against like 30 bucks but anyway."
706.0,Provider,yeah exactly so you can make that change.
12955.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. That thanks, a lot of it comes from jealousy on her part. could be which would make I guess makes sense um I don't know. What clown i'm saying, like, I mean clan of burns all of her relationships like i'd see her dating and we were only friends for like a year mm hmm before like I actually like got mad at her and like really put my foot down."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12955.0,Patient,"And she immediately like I I feel like I provided like I one of the telltale signs that says, you were correct here was anytime she felt she was in the right she wanted to argue it out with them. And the one time, like she and she had told me like. Oh, I feel like I don't even know you when, after the last time I saw you was when I helped you move into your House and then I meant and see you again after that and i'm like that's not true Leona the day after you help me move. I helped you garden all day don't you remember that uh huh and then like i'm and i'm like you've been busy you've been doing this, and this, and all this and i'm like and I tried to take you out for lunch remember. And then immediately text back and she's like I don't want to argue. And i'm like you usually always want to argue. mm hmm. So, and I just didn't text her back after that, and I feel like she didn't seek me out because she can admit she's wrong."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm cuz she only is going to argue If she thinks that she's right and if she's wrong then she's going to avoid. yeah okay.
12955.0,Patient,"And there were like I did so much like and I feel like it's in my nature, and this is something my ex pointed out was like anytime someone did something just a little bit nice to me, I would be like. And I always would give so much to other people. And it's like where why don't I even expect, like any of that back."
706.0,Provider,So. Tell me about your relationship with the ex boyfriend.
12955.0,Patient,Oh you're gonna make me cry.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we don't have to do that. This week, maybe."
12955.0,Patient,"Next week, so I can I can talk about it."
706.0,Provider,Because we only have about 15 minutes left.
12955.0,Patient,there's not that much just say um. We meant no i'm still little.
706.0,Provider,it's okay to cry crying.
12955.0,Patient,"And we met in October, through like online dating and he worked in the medical field, so we couldn't meet in person right away, but he asked me on an online date right away, so we would have these little like zoom dates. and We finally met like immediately like we scheduled like three days back to back because we just didn't want to be apart. and Like at one point I had been helping like we had this really silly conversation, where he was telling the story. About Anthony bourdain getting his girlfriend flowers and it was like in a really extravagant way and I made a comment like oh my God it's so hard for guys to like. To get a guy to give you flowers, would you want followers and like like flowers and then like. very recent like soon after that I just been helping clean oh with too much stuff and it was so stressed, it at my wit's end and I ended up sitting for her kids when I shouldn't have agreed to when she like went out of State on a whim, and I had a break down. It was just too much for me like to just be it was just too much. And i'm. Like I Devon came to stay like visit me while I was sitting the kids and clear and I had said it would be fine and sort of the kids dad so Devon came to like hang out with me and he brought me this huge okay. And he made it really clear you wanted to keep seeing me. and He. realized he either to break up with me or just wanted to I don't know. When I was moving out of my made a comment about like it if he thought it would be okay, if I visited him at his house and that made him realize that it was this is like the almost the six month mark. Including the online catering, it would have been made him realize it wouldn't be time to introduce the newest grandparents because he lives with his grandparents and that made them realize it was time to decide if this was a relationship that was like long term. And I guess he didn't really. Think about. He had kind of just realized he didn't want kids. And he knew we wanted to live somewhere rural and that I kind of wanted to stay in the east bay. It kind of came out of total nowhere for me. i'm. Like. I thought we were really. Like he had helped me move out no drove the truck and he had been so supportive. Like it really came out of left field for me."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh. Do you look back on that day, when he ended things with you and wish you would have done."
12955.0,Patient,"things differently, I do, I feel like it wasn't a very nice thing like. He was younger than he's younger than me he was he's like he was only 24 is very mature for his age, though, like. And i'm kind of. mature from age so. um I feel like it wasn't like. Nice to just sit someone down and say there's no easy way to say this, but I met think this relationship and I cried and he started crying too, and he said it was heartbreaking it, it was like he's like I mean for me my heart is breaking us what he said I just. It was really hard um. I would say, get Fred jeans. The their friends, who I realized were very nice like that was what I so they were away on vacation of it, the next day, I went out did an interview about some groceries and that evening when I came home I checked in with gene. i'd run into someone who I really didn't want to run into what grocery shopping just someone else that I knew from Leona. And so I was a little rattled but I was fine I talked to gene for a bit and then. She had been wanting you to do that online fair, the bank, the reason why I, like the therapy thing because she always wanted me to do this meditation thing with her and she hadn't set it up so i'm like we can do it tomorrow. In the morning I was I you know when you wake when, after you first go through a breakup, I guess, this was my first boyfriend and my first breakup. and The morning I was texting him because we were going to talk via Skype on earth, on Friday, and like maybe like he said i'm like we talked about like why you want to break up and stuff and. I was crying and text human asking if we could answer my question sooner, because I was like eating me alive and gene comes downstairs and basically gets super upset with me and yells at me that she's sick and my crying and wants me out by the end of the month. So I immediately like I called liotta and told her that gene said that gene called clear to to try to defuse that. At the same time I grabbed my phone my stuff like my computer my laptop I got dressed and I leave the House immediately and I basically text Devon and tell them that, like. So I ended up meeting up with devin in person, because of that and we talked it out and I actually like. felt, really, really positively after that talk. I also feel like I kind of had to feel positively about it, you know just so I could survive staying at g. uh huh."
706.0,Provider,So is that when he told you about not wanting to have kids and.
12955.0,Patient,"That is yeah we drove somewhere, we could sit and talk we even had a last kiss. And it was just. It was a really nice guy and just I don't think it was a nice way to like in retro and I told it might like in retrospect, if you had sat me down and say look I don't want to have kids that would have made it so much less horrible you know just be like look, this is something that."
706.0,Provider,"Well, is that something that you could have gotten past."
12955.0,Patient,i'm pretty positive I want kids.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so that's not that's that's kind of like that non negotiable and so. That would have that would have eventually pulled your relationship apart because, if he would have had them for you, he might have been resemble a resentful and, if you would have not had any case."
12955.0,Patient,"and totally yeah. But i'm a die understand that completely i'm just saying, if you had said that wake."
706.0,Provider,yeah that might have been it easier for you in the beginning.
12955.0,Patient,"Or, just like. um. But yeah we we had a really nice long talk. positively i'm."
706.0,Provider,Going contacting them.
12955.0,Patient,"At the time, it made me feel a lot better to like think about steak friends and he said we could stay friends, but um we're very different people he has kind of i've been extreme extrovert I think that's pretty obvious he was an extreme introvert."
706.0,Provider,What does he do in the medical field.
12955.0,Patient,"So he works in a nursing home and he's also in film school and he was kind of juggling this of. Trying to decide where you wanted to go if you wanted to be a filmmaker go on to some professional like us thinking nurse practitioner or something like that, because his parents are both you know, in the medical field. He actually had gotten a grant to travel the world and visit different nursing homes and make films about it. uh huh so it was like this, he was juggling this do I want to make money or do I want to be an artist kind of perspective. He did not really have any friends like he had friendships but he didn't really talk to anybody like on a daily basis. He had to like really know close friends in the area like he has friends that he goes and sees a visits, but he's like was perfectly content about to have like any. Real like you know friends around, so I texted him to let him know that I found a place to live and he was very excited but he didn't really contact me again after that and. I mean. kind of made me realize like yeah this I don't know if this would have been the one."
706.0,Provider,"I guess the other thing to think about too is when you're friends with somebody after a breakup. Eventually you're going to see that person that you broke up with with another person, and can you handle that you can't be friends with somebody if you can't see them move on with their life."
12955.0,Patient,yeah we're still like friends on Facebook and stuff but he never updates us Facebook so.
706.0,Provider,"But I think I feel like it would be pretty devastating to you to see him with another woman. And so that's the thing when you become friends with somebody when you try and be friends with somebody and you see them with other people and it's heart wrenching to you, and you, you can't get past that then you're not ready to be friends yet."
12955.0,Patient,I know. I kind of feel like the ship but late. I don't oh.
706.0,Provider,"No it's hard it's hard and but they'll come a time when you'll say. i'm glad is happy like you know, like he's with somebody and they're perfect together and you'll be able to be like. Oh, my gosh like I cared about him so much i'm just i'm happy he's happy and then he would be able to do the same for you, but the wound is too new and so, if you saw him happy with somebody else it would just twist the knife in your heart. And so it might be better to just give some distance for now."
12955.0,Patient,I know this was back in the mid may uh huh.
706.0,Provider,"You know and who knows you know things you know, everybody comes into your life for a reason they either help you or hurt you."
12955.0,Patient,"I mean, he was really it was really like he was there for me when I was like searching for house and helped me move that."
706.0,Provider,"helps you grow as a person. Definitely so help you some people come into your life to hurt you which will either help you in the end, or teach you a lesson, some people are come into your life. To simply teach you a lesson positive or negative, but everybody you come across in your life, I honestly believe there is a reason there is a reason everything happens for a reason and everything that you've been through makes you who you are. So maybe you know, in the future, when you get into the next relationship, you know after you get to know the person, a little bit like you will have those serious conversations of you know. You know, like these are the things I wanted my life and if these aren't the things that you want, in your life. Then I don't I don't foresee this going any further, and you taking that initiative and doing that and that way you're not so blindsided it down, you know down the road. When they decided to do that, because you taking initiative for your own life it's a lot easier than having you know kind of get like blindsided out of the clear blue or you think everything's Okay, and then Bam."
12955.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, and so maybe this was a learning lesson for you, you know just to be able to navigate relationships, a little bit clear and then grow as a person, because it sounds like he really helped you to kind of get back on your feet and and get out into the world again."
12955.0,Patient,"I mean it's probably terrible but, like in the moment when he broke up with me like the first thing I thought was like relief because, like you said that like. This is like oh good no I don't have to break up with you, if something were to go wrong just that oh good you did it first kind of idea."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and it's funny that it happened at six months, rather than six years when you're ready to have kids and he's like I haven't changed my mind I don't want to have kids and then you have to decide between. Having a child or having him, you know or living someplace where you're not happy or him living someplace he's not a happy or whatever else you guys couldn't you know. come to an agreement on you know, like I said everything happens for a reason and all that means there's somebody else out there, that is going to check those boxes."
12955.0,Patient,"yeah it's just a really big like a fear of commitment for a while, so I kind of just dated guys that I knew weren't going to be around like people who were visiting. Or, I was visiting uh huh."
706.0,Provider,So you didn't have to make that commitment.
12955.0,Patient,uh huh.
706.0,Provider,"Probably has a lot to do with your. attachments your your ability to attach and detach from people because people that you wanted to attach yourself to let you down, so why attach because there's going to lay it down so, then you actually just basically get from them what you need at the moment, and then you detach."
12955.0,Patient,whoa that makes a lot of sense.
706.0,Provider,So we are out of time for today. mm hmm So do you have another appointment set up next week.
12955.0,Patient,"They don't um. And my next week, let me busy."
706.0,Provider,that's fine I would i'd like to see us do is get to like every other week.
12955.0,Patient,I was actually thinking that might be a good idea.
706.0,Provider,"yeah um so that you can kind of figure out something, because you want to go back to work, and it also be time to process in between sessions."
12955.0,Patient,Sorry i'm just trying to sign into October my.
706.0,Provider,What you can do is look at your schedule figure out kind of what its gonna look like and just get a hold of the virtual clinic.
12955.0,Patient,"And you can set up special I know your guys's appointments fill up fast, so I kind of wanted to make a while I have you on the phone."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I can take a look and see what we have I don't think October is too bad yet. Okay, so that would take us into the first week in October. What they are you thinking."
12955.0,Patient,"um maybe a Tuesday. Okay, the first."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so Tuesday the fifth as of right now the only time I wouldn't be available would be okay, so are you Pacific time zone. Okay, is from nine to 10 Pacific time. that's the only time that is not available on Tuesday the fifth other way, as on Tuesday the fifth I have anything else available."
12955.0,Patient,um what's the latest time available.
706.0,Provider,will be. So be. One o'clock. Your time.
12955.0,Patient,"Okay let's put me down for one o'clock and, if I have to change that I will, I just want to make sure I want to keep myself accountable and make appointments. Just so I know that they're made it helps me ease my mind okay. And doesn't keep me from like postponing making them, but if I end up having to go in for a job interview and get the job that way I can call you guys and let you know as soon as I know that I need that change."
706.0,Provider,Okay yeah that's fine so i'll put you down for three o'clock on Tuesday the fifth so we'll have from three to 345. The sound good.
12955.0,Patient,sounds great.
706.0,Provider,"Alright, so i'll get that in the calendar and then like I said, we can try every other week and see how you do I think that I think you know we saw we did like the last like three four weeks, you know weekly, and I think that was. Great because I think you had a lot to get out, but I think now, I think."
12955.0,Patient,You know that's why those first few weeks to yeah. OK cool and again i'll let you know if I need to change that based on. The stuff.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds great."
