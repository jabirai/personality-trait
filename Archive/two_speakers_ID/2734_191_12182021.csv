191.0,Provider,Let me ask you this because we have a lot of things we need to dress. From what I can tell you're getting 20 milligrams a day is that what you're getting consistently.

191.0,Provider,"Okay, can get missed a day all right, then so get your mass today because a lot of times. The fact of being on 16 or 20 milligrams doesn't always impact, when you can get it, as long as you're following the prescription, so if it says two and a half a day. Then, and if so, you get eight days of madison's so if as prescribe it a let's say, if you take your last dose of medicine, on Sunday. Then you do to pick it up on Monday, some places don't let you pick it up on Sunday, so if you pick up your script and you start it Monday and it's eight days and Madison is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday Sunday. Monday okay so, then you do to pick up on Tuesday Okay, so you have to come with a lot of places you complete the script before you get your next script okay."
2734.0,Patient,yeah that's what they're doing but.
191.0,Provider,that's what a lot of places to it.
2734.0,Patient,"Yet one thing we're five days I had gotten five days ahead because they haven't they usually do a two day lead way. The script and they said I got five days ahead, so now it that that's that's where it's constantly creating conflict, I need to what it's not really conflict but I need to do is. stretch it again, I need to take an hour to get it back on because I will be able to pick them up, you know they wrote them because would be one week and then, when you go to my to go pick them up."
191.0,Provider,"So. We may be able to do seven days see if it'll work doing seven days. But don't stretch them take them as prescribed if that's the dose that's adequately covers you take it as prescribe try not to pick it up early now if you still have problems, let us know okay. Okay okay so let's let's try that so we've got the the dose now are you still seeing your therapist cassie. Yes, yeah okay let's see when the last time you saw are you seeing her twice I haven't."
