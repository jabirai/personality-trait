510.0,Provider,"This is Tara lot therapist i'm an individual therapy session with patient ilana day Laura she has checked in so we're just waiting for her to join. hello, how are you oh you look super dark is there no light. You The background is so dark I can't even."
11127.0,Patient,yeah there's little dirt today's a little cloudy and so there's no.
510.0,Provider,kidding oh wow I. can barely see you yeah.
11127.0,Patient,It looks good I think it's just the camera looks a lot later.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yep just having a hard time seeing you. So um how have you been doing and in the last time we met you had to end the session short and we were digging into the sleep hygiene, so I definitely want to go back to that just to make sure i'm assuming you got the PDF that. I sent. And I don't know if you reviewed it if you had questions just wanted to revisit that since we had to and a little shorter and then I certainly want to get an update to see how you've been and what's been going on."
11127.0,Patient,"So, with the sleep hygiene I. i've been trying to follow like showing a schedule and stuff like that it's just. it's I am able to get. My eight hours it's just at weird times. So instead of like 11pm to 7am it's more just like. 7am to 3pm."
510.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11127.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,And that's a tough one that is really tough because you're basically you're now daytime sleeping the bulk of your your time.
11127.0,Patient,"And I try to wake up earlier and earlier, but sometimes it. I end up. um. Sometimes I end up just like taking a nap. Like really late and it's like. And it throws me off so that's I think the one thing that i'm struggling a lot with this just. Trying to resist taking up because sometimes I just get really tired. And then i'll set a timer. For like 30 minutes and i'll sleep, through it, I won't hear it."
510.0,Provider,"You said yeah. yeah so i'm going to give you a little bit more. technical information about what's going on in your brain and maybe this will be enough for you, when you think about all I want to take a nap this might help I don't know but. Sometimes it's just it gets so technical that I tend not to share it but you've really been struggling with asleep, so there is actually i'm going to get the the actual i'm gonna put it. In the chat I want you to, and you can look this up. and Oh wait, oh no wait hold on. Okay yeah I haven't I haven't right, and there is. there's going to be a website, I give you around sleep, because I, as you know, this is our final session and I just want to give you all the resources, I can so just make a mental note or obviously. If you want. To look it up, but, basically, I want you to know that this is a, this is a neuro chemical, this is in your brain and. it's so when you go to sleep. This chemical basically reduces it metabolizes in your body, you know your brain when you sleep it starts to metabolize and it decreases and it's a cycle. So when we wake up. This actually is, at the lowest point in your brain, but then, as the day goes on, it increases it's also part of your sleep wake cycle, so what happens is. As it builds the part of what's happening is you do get sleepy because it's it's gaining and numbers, but when you take a nap. It starts to metabolize in your body, and then it reduces again, and this is what disrupts the sleep wake cycle, and this is often why, when people take a nap especially late in the day. What happens when the regular 1011 o'clock bedtime comes around i'm not tired, this is a big factor, and it seems to be playing a big factor for you. Right and I know it's really hard, and this is why I tell you, and I think it's even on that PDF is really try to avoid ness because, from a chemical perspective that's what's happening. That chemical is metabolized and then, when you wake up you're like whoa okay i'm ready to go and when your regular sleep time comes around you your your struggle i'm going to give you an article I can put it just in the chat and you can take a. You can open it later and just put it as a bookmark or snapshot or whatever you want to do. And it gives you a little bit more info on that and sleep so um I don't know if that might help you, you know from a from a more technical standpoint, because that's what's happening. that's right I most people I know if I take a nap later I am done because I there's no way i'm going to be able to go back to bed, and some people are just more sensitive. than others, but I think that's what's happening is you are building it up and then you're just so sleepy and but then it's metabolized in the numbers drop and then, when you really do need to go to bed it's it's you're off and running you're like i'm not sleepy i'm not tired. So, and this takes time we talked about it, like really slowly, you know, trying to make those changes and getting up. And when you change your sleep patterns you gonna you're going to be uncomfortable there's going to be times that you're just really, really tired and you. You have to kind of you know kind of move through that in order to kind of get back on a regular pattern, because if you're sleeping during the day, and I know you take later classes, but is that. Is that what you're wanting, are you trying to get back to going to bed like at 10 or 11 and getting up more in the morning, like what is your goal as far as your pattern."
11127.0,Patient,i'm Dr blake. For shit normal times.
510.0,Provider,You would okay.
11127.0,Patient,Usually getting up late trying to like say I need to run errands. Like by the time i'm about wi fi stores are already probably closed. yeah yeah.
510.0,Provider,"yeah so you're saying, some of the natural consequence and there are people who who work nights and they have to deal with this and not everything's accessible and they have to kind of get up and do stuff during the day because that's when things are open. But it sounds like you're wanting to get back to a better schedule and I hear you because. Honestly, our circadian rhythm we're really not meant to work nights and be sleeping during the day and that's not really how it works. Our brains and bodies actually respond we're up during the day, and when it gets dark we tend to want to sleep, that is our natural circadian rhythm you don't have to be like you're not doing shift work. Some people have to because that's their job and that's a different story, but that's not the story so."
11127.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"you're wanting to it is going to be a matter of really slowly trying to set those alarms getting up even when you're really tired and then trying to make it through the day. And and just slow Lee going to bed at a better time because it's it's really off, I mean this is this is really tough. Now, besides trying to keep a schedule what other pieces, did you take away from that list that maybe you could improve upon I think we got through maybe half of it. Obviously the NAPs we just talked about, and what actually is happening, but anything else that you, you were able to take away that you could adjust and change or try to."
11127.0,Patient,"Well, I. Have like a set morning routine and a set night routine. And I also. I don't touch my bed at all until I actually have to go to bed."
510.0,Provider,Oh good okay that's. that's a bit of a shift really trying to use it just for sleep or sex okay good good good good.
11127.0,Patient,And I think regarding everything else I don't do drugs or caffeine so.
510.0,Provider,"Okay yeah Okay, do you do anything as far as your sleep hygiene before you try to get to bed, so another aspect from a physiological standpoint. Hot showers a hot bath that actually brings your blood to the the skin and part of the mechanism of what helps us go to sleep, besides that chemical in our brain. And does our circadian rhythm and melatonin it's also temperature is your room a good temperature taking a hot bath or shower for a lot of people helps prompt that drop in temperature, which helps them to fall asleep, do you do anything like that, before bed."
11127.0,Patient,"um I usually take morning showers to help me wake up. But for. Like the. Because my little closet office space. Is hot already I just keep I just turned on the fan, and my actual room So when I actually leave my entire room is cold."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like the temperature is pretty good. Because a lot of times, people are just hot and but part of that getting your body temperature to drop is sometimes people take a hot bath or shower before bed. Some people use, you know oils in different like lavender is a biggie that helps promote sleep, some people do cam a meal tea, I mean these these are other parts that you could add to your sleep hygiene, you know so you're not taking like a prescription right. A lot of people weren't avoid that but utilizing camera meal passion flower lavender these are well known valerian root. Obviously i'm big on sleep hygiene and also herbs to help people sleep So those are the. biggies those are the ones that are well researched and documented that really help, but I know not everybody likes to use those things, but that could be part of additional sleep hygiene that you could try to do before you go to bed. Right yeah okay Okay, well, it sounds like you know you have some ideas and i'm really trying to shift that schedule, because that is a rough one you're getting eight hours but it's like daytime."
11127.0,Patient,"yeah I think just my biggest struggle is trying to make it throughout the day because, like I don't drink caffeine, and sometimes i'm just so tired that I just end up falling asleep."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I know so it's a matter of trying to slowly bring back that the time you go to bed. I know and waking up even though you're really tired and trying to go to bed, you know slowly going to bed like like what would be your ideal bedtime like."
11127.0,Patient,"10 1110 or 11 year I. Am wants to start waking up utley. Just I used to I remember, I used to actually wake up when the sun would rise. So i'm trying to do. i'm trying to do I."
510.0,Provider,mean that's going to be a challenge because you're really in the throes of. The schedule.
11127.0,Patient,That might be.
510.0,Provider,more of a challenge.
11127.0,Patient,"yeah I because I remember. I used to like. I wouldn't even set an alarm, I would just wake up, naturally, is you know it's like my room we get lighter. trying to get."
510.0,Provider,"To that yeah that would be ideal that is literally our natural circadian rhythm, most people once their light enters the room, they tend to. be able to wake up on their own, as some people does not matter you know, and they need alarms and and that's okay there's no that's not a bad thing. But that is our natural circadian rhythm and when the sun goes down. We tend to be more more tired right our body is like oh okay soon i'm going to be getting ready for bed here, but also the chemical in your brain that adenosine. that's that's a factor in this it helps promote the sleepiness But some people need support right, and so they do herbs they do T they take the hot bath the brain their blood to their skin. So when they get in bed, you know the temperature of their body starts to drop, which is a known mechanism that you need to kind of have that temperature drop in order to fall asleep so so some additional things to think about maybe read about, but I, I hope that that helps. I know that sounds like it's still an issue okay. Well, what else is going on for you. Overall, like Oh, I meant to sorry I did another session right before and I wanted to look at your depression, anxiety I knew the last time I looked at it, it was. The lowest i've ever seen it. and pull it up here. It remains really low Oh, a lot of this is fantastic, this is the best since you started in April talk to me about it, what are your reflections and insights. To see."
11127.0,Patient,"So I ended up dropping the fifth class, because I, with my four classes, I was already swanned. Right, I was able to catch up with everything so right now i'm at like a good pace i'm kind of just like. I did yesterday did everything I needed to do today have like a set schedule of what I like to do us of what I need to do and I tend to just spend an hour on each assignment, so I have like one or two assignments for Class so I just spend maybe. Maybe five to six hours some times on just doing homework but I often I often take breaks I I have i've already i've experimented a lot with like, how long I can stay focused and I averaged like an hour, so I take a 10 minute breaks in between. But the fact that I can just spend at least a little bit of time, each day on projects it helps me a lot, I often find that i'm already finished with the project before it's due by just doing that."
510.0,Provider,"Perfect your lighting, the time and it sounds like you're even you're getting some time back oh good you've really found a rhythm and there's definitely motivation and that so. What do you mean the difference has been. i'm glad to hear, and I think that you shared that that you're probably going to drop that class, so you still have a pretty full load but talk to me about why you think you've been able to kind of maintain the rhythm I love it and the motivation is certainly there."
11127.0,Patient,"And so, last week I kind of for the last couple days of last week, actually just. Put in a little extra time just to catch up."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11127.0,Patient,"And this week. it's like Oh, because i'm all caught up now, I can just relax a little bit more, because I can now i'm not spending. as much time as I was last week or before. And then. ya know so that's basically it I would spend a certain amount of time we'll just doing work for classes and then I find at the end of the day, I have like some extra time just to do stuff for myself perfect."
510.0,Provider,"Perfect oh i'm really glad glad to hear it sounds like you definitely have found a really good rhythm, are you um are you recognizing that are you like giving yourself a pat on the back, I hope, you're giving yourself some good support and talking to yourself with with kind words and. yeah."
11127.0,Patient,"yeah but also often times like I this happened a couple days ago I finished everything I needed to do for that day, but I still felt like I don't know I got. I felt I still felt a little anxious like oh I should do some more work I should do tomorrow is. worth the work. So I could have more time to rest, but then I have time arrest, then, so I kind of just like didn't know what to do."
510.0,Provider,"yeah there's that should that's your cue right I should be doing something, the reality is you did your tasks, you did what you needed to for that day now if you wanted and you felt super motivated. You can do it, but when you start to have that that tape in your head go, you should be doing something like somehow there's a shit in there that's your cue right. So, and that often prompts that anxiety like I should be doing something like somehow I should be no you actually did all that you needed to. What would be great is if, then you would have that awareness like hey I did all my tasks what other things, could I do to just. Around self care and just tend to myself and something I enjoy and have you been able to do self care are you engaging in activities that are nourishing and enjoyable and are you. I don't know if you were in that group, where I did the eight dimensions of self care, but have you been able to do those sorts of things that would be a perfect opportunity."
11127.0,Patient,And I ended up just playing video games and doing like I took up sewing as a hobby so I just did that and.
510.0,Provider,"Oh that's self care. yeah yeah I love it you took up selling I love. All right, yeah so you were doing other activities that I think you find enjoyable. hmm perfect yeah I love it that's the balance right, because if we just do all the tasks that we. i'm not saying school is depleting for you, but I think on some level it's like I you want to be doing it, but I don't know if it's super nourishing for you. The reality is you've got to have a balance right you've got to be able to have that balance, because what happens is then. You start to go through the exhaustion funnel like if we're only doing things that we have to do. And not doing things that are nourishing there's going to be an imbalance and that's also wearing it and depression really start to worsen. Because we just start to we go in this funnel down the tubes right So hopefully the sewing and the video games, so they sort of boost and give you a little bit of a boost, something to you enjoy a."
11127.0,Patient,"lot of the times when I play video games with other people so and it kind of works, because sometime like most of my friends, I played video games with their away for university right now so."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11127.0,Patient,"Like one way, I could talk to them and then. i'm. oftentimes sewing or like cuz sometimes some of the projects that I do like i'll work on those and it tends to be pretty relaxing like one of them is is painting so. I leave like the more enjoyable ones, towards the end."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, you are artists through and through and that is for. Sure, you really are. That is awesome. I was sorry I know you weren't. Due to be in group, but we had some new group members and we did show and tell. And we had some artists like showcase and I was like Oh, I wish a lot of us here and again i'm so sorry about what have I have no idea I thought I admitted you and and then I saw you disappear so last week got messy but."
11127.0,Patient,it's all right.
510.0,Provider,"Make sure you attend the 1pm I think there's there's other artists in there, I think you're really gonna find more of a connection in that group so. um yeah I thought of you immediately like Oh, I wish a lot of us here to kind of see and maybe they'll do it again, it was really actually super fun to kind of hear some of the passions and I could easily seen you showcase some sort of your. You know your art. Anyone so all right i'm thinking of some before I forget, I want to, I have a name, because you weren't in group you weren't able to meet her you'll meet her next week, but. Your new therapist is the same person who's going to take over the 1pm group so you'll see her just like you would see me for individual in for group her name is Karen Karen Clark. And she lives in California I got to meet her for the first time, and she has a dog she lives in the Bay area. So I think you will be in good hands she'll be you'll see her bi weekly for your groups, but then you'll get on the rotation. All the cases will be transferred probably Saturday, the second only because my last official day as 10 one and they won't be doing the major transition over until my last day but. If, for whatever reason you don't get an outreach or a prompt text your email to come to the virtual clinic to set up appointments. outreach the virtual clinic and just say hey I haven't heard, I need to get on Karen clark's schedule, but they're pretty good i've seen it when other people have transition and. They have a list and the team starts outraging but yeah so her name is Karen so that I think you'll be in good good shape now shauntel will still be your prescriber and the group time 1pm it'll just be Karen and chantel instead of me and so until."
11127.0,Patient,sounds good.
510.0,Provider,"yeah I think you're and you're honestly I mean I couldn't ask for a better situation and which your symptoms are the lowest they've ever been, since you started. And I guess that would be I guess one reflects oh I just lost her, oh no. i'm going to pause recording ilana de la I got disconnected. i'll wait for her to return. I lost yeah."
11127.0,Patient,"yeah sorry that's Okay, did you hit a button by accident. Spam phone call in. But took me off the zoom."
510.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes it kicks people off I don't know how that works, but i'm glad you were able to rejoin so quickly. um I don't think you heard the question that prompted. Because obviously you're doing, really, really well I think you'll be in good hands. Moving forward. But I guess, I was just sort of curious from our five months working together, has there been something that's been most helpful or least helpful, I just wanted to give you the space to kind of, say, and talk through what you have found helpful or not helpful in our process together."
11127.0,Patient,"I think the thing that I, like most is that I just have someone to talk to that I can rely on to. help me work through some things because I mean I obviously have friends, who I could talk to you, but I mean they can only listen to so much and give advice as much as they can. But oftentimes. is usually more helpful to have someone who's like who's actually like. No, no, like a friend isn't a therapist."
510.0,Provider,"Here yeah you I mean you've been working i'm a trained professional clinical counselor right like. Absolutely, and there is a difference because I often will hear people well I can just talk to my friend, like, I can my therapist like you know, a therapist is ideally outside your system right we're not ready. and your family system or not in your family systems, we can kind of take that broader helicopter view but also we're trained to there's actual things we can. help you talk through it process but yeah i'm glad you see, there is a difference and your friends are good, I mean i'm not saying that's part of your support system, you want to lean on them, especially in tough times. to know that you're not alone, but there is a difference there's a formality of working. In psychotherapy and you've been really consistent as well, and I am really I want to say out loud i'm appreciative of that you utilize sessions. You come to session when things to talk about I don't think you've ever missed. A session like you've never know showed me, I think you had to cancel one which Hello life, of course, I had to cancel for the first time I don't think did you miss a session with me, there was a week, I was off for a family. Emergency earlier this month we know life happens, but for the most part, you have been very consistent in your your engagement which has been great. i'm really appreciative that from from a therapist point of view it's like you come ready to work, not everybody does."
11127.0,Patient,"yeah it's just like. it's really. helpful to just know like. This is, this is the one day like work on myself, because I remember before I went into like long term therapy, I was, I was having like short term sessions at at like my school surface. And they gave me advice on how to always have something to talk about each session and it's like I usually I have like a little. In I have I keep a schedule, which is also a kind of a journal I keep notes on like how I felt that day, and if I would want to bring that up and stuff like that. So oftentimes like say I would be in a conversation with like a friend or my boyfriend and I would off late sometimes i'll stop midway between myself on bring this up the. term later."
510.0,Provider,"Good yeah you always would come prepared, I mean I i've always been impressed with that and that's really that says a lot about you, but it also allows me to know that you are thinking and reflecting on Okay, actually, I want to kind of talk through this or I want to bring this to therapy. That is great, not everybody does that and sometimes it's a learning process, you know as Eric I help prompt people of how to do that, but yeah you've always come ready to go with things. And I just think about well one you were my very first bright heart, I know i've only been here a short time, but I. knew, you will always be my first reinhart client that I had on zoom which I think I messed up. And then I finally got on but um you had just gotten out of the hospital, I think, a few weeks prior. And the depression, anxiety. Like I said I it's like night and day there's been such a one at when you think back to like March, April of this past year to now Sep tember almost October. What are your reflections, I mean you've done some really significant work, but what, what can you say about the difference of where you're at compared to when you came in."
11127.0,Patient,"and I think, comparing from when I came in I done a lot but oftentimes I would so think I haven't done enough. I think, but to. Like pre pandemic, but I feel like that's kind of not fair to me. Because I used to actually just wake up seven at 7am and I would have to it's a 30 minute drive from my house to school, so I would actually be forced to wake up that early to get everything done for going to school. And I did have a set schedule, I make sure I had everything done because I was at school because school was far away, I spend my time they're doing homework before I got home So when I got home moves like my place to relax. So. oftentimes i'll look back for that and compare myself to now, and I think i'm like I still need other still work to be them and I still need to do more and stuff like but."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean I, I hope, though, that you're also able to see that you've really done some good work to address your mental health, are you giving yourself kind of those you know that that recognition and acknowledgement."
11127.0,Patient,"I do sometimes I do things like. You know, back then, I still had problems regarding mental health, so the fact that. i'm actually. proceeding to get the help that you need in doing stuff like this it's it's like. And it's one step forward for me."
510.0,Provider,Oh for sure I just I really want to make sure you're acknowledging all that you're doing to address your mental health and it's working.
11127.0,Patient,Like what you're doing is.
510.0,Provider,"Working because I don't think it's a fluke and the last couple surveys you've completed, which really covers the month of Sep tember. That your depression, anxiety are really well managed, are there still symptoms there, yes or there's still things that you want to work on yes. But what is important, I think, on a therapy process is that we don't lose sight of the work that we have done so often. Not so often, but I will have clients like William still get bothered by this or I still have this to work on. we're human there's always things that we can work on, we are not perfect beings nobody gets a free pass when it comes to suffering and the stakes, and things we have to adjust and amend greater right. it's a matter of how we respond to that and healthy ways, and I think you are really learning ways to respond and manage and but, of course, you still have things that you want to work on, but I just I want to make sure that you're giving yourself some. Credit where credit is due, and not and not lose that aspect well, of course, you know a lot of people are like oh yeah yeah yeah i've done some work, no, I really want to acknowledge that so anyway it's the feedback, I wanted to give you."
11127.0,Patient,"Okay yeah i'm late, I often just don't I don't compare myself to when I first started, so I think that's what as issues."
510.0,Provider,"mm hmm. mm hmm. yeah well I just since we are, this is our last session, I just wanted to give you that opportunity to do a little bit at the comparison, because I want to acknowledge. You know the work that you've done up until this point and then you're going to continue to work on, and I am curious not that you might not have an answer, but I am curious are there, what would you say, are the things you want to continue to talk through. Hopefully. You will, with Karen, what do you, what do you think that will look like for yourself ilana."
11127.0,Patient,"um I think one of the things is I do want to work a little bit more on the relationship with my family. i'm starting to like not bring dinner back into my room and I would I would eat at the dining table, but like I will necessarily talk to anyone. downstairs. So I want to continue working on like what's The next step from that and stuff like that, and then I still have an issue with just with my boyfriend and his whole family situation like not that anything has happened."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11127.0,Patient,it's just I can start to see how it's beginning to affect them. But it's not it's not in significant ways that it's it's lowering the quality of his life at home it's more just like. I see it as something that's inevitable and will eventually he'll eventually have to face.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11127.0,Patient,"And I can't help myself, but like it's not my problem to deal with and it's not my it's not my place to get involved so i'm kind of just. I would think about it and oftentimes I would take a step back and I would say to myself, like. I shouldn't these aren't my problems I can't be I can't feel this for him."
510.0,Provider,"mm hmm. it's good and I started the boundary which I, like the language you can still be support and like hey if you want to talk through stuff but. yeah you're not there to fix it that's for sure."
11127.0,Patient,"yeah well oftentimes it's like he last time we did talk about it, he did say how it's more of the fact that he doesn't know why he doesn't think about it, but I told him eventually he'll have to think about it more. And it's more just like I just get worked up about it sometimes when I shouldn't and I don't have to and oftentimes it's like it's not even something like it comes up recently it's more like shower thoughts."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11127.0,Patient,"And I would, I would just say, like, I would say to myself it's just. I can't be angry for him, I can't feel these things for him and. I it's like not in my place to bring it up so much that it feels like i'd be pushing him to do something."
510.0,Provider,Right right it's different if he brought it up.
11127.0,Patient,And you can.
510.0,Provider,"You know, make space for them, but it's. right there to prompt and. We got to figure this out for you exactly that's recognizing the boundary. But I like the fact that you're you're having that awareness alanna and that so much of life is learning to have the awareness and just because we have a thought doesn't mean it's true doesn't mean we have to. act on it we're having the thought you know and what do I want to do with that whether it's the thought of feeling, etc, and I think you're starting. To gain a little bit more awareness and I tell ya easier said than done, this is a big part of what we talked to people about in therapy is. Having that awareness and not feeling like you have to go 100 miles an hour and just because you have these thoughts. doesn't mean they're all true it's sorting through it and having awareness of how you want to respond so to me that also speaks volumes to your level. of work that you've done I don't know if you would have had that level of insight back in April I just I wasn't hearing it then but i'm hearing it now. Right yeah so that's good that's good yeah I mean relationships there's always things to process through so it sounds like you'll definitely have more things to talk about and I love the fact that you are. Out of your room or that was definitely a goal that we really try to help you get out of your room or not isolate as much I think it's helping with the sleep hygiene, not using your bed not hanging out on your bed too. But it's hopefully now prompting maybe for some interaction with families, they think there's a want there you can't control if they're going to sit with you are engaged, but certainly you physically putting yourself, there is a good start, I think it's a great start. Right yeah."
11127.0,Patient,"I just I know cuz normally we don't eat together do anything, the other one is just in their own little space um. And I. I don't know personally just. talking to them in general for me seems like a really big step, so I don't really know what. how to get there, how to get from just going outside my room to like actually saying something to them oftentimes I only asked, like the only times I would talk to them as it is, if i'm asking or something is or where someone put something and i'm like."
510.0,Provider,What would you like to ask them like so let's just it's just you and I talking they're not here they can't hear our conversation but. If you're if you imagine yourself sitting at the table you just sat down what What would you like to ask your mom or dad.
11127.0,Patient,I was curious about. I don't know. that's that's like sometimes I think it's just so far out but. When it gets to the point I don't really I don't even know what to talk to them about like or or. Maybe would want and stuff like that.
510.0,Provider,"And you curious about anything you could start small right just asking about preferences likes music food. Animals places they visited that maybe you know about or places they want to visit like are you are you curious about anything like that might be a. More non threatening right versus diving into major communication and feelings, maybe it's just sort of almost getting to know them, do you know those things about them their preferences."
11127.0,Patient,"i'm not from them like my dad has six siblings. and His youngest on his youngest brother my uncle is like in his mid 30s and I he. lives in Poland, and he invited me to his day as like. He teaches English to this family and they were basically my host family. Every since we just spent a month there with them. So I did get to know like him that's our family mostly just from being around my uncle and he's. Like i'm i'm a gen Z and he's a millennial so we could kind of get along. And some. So oftentimes I mostly just get to know my parents through other family members, like with on my mom's side there is my cousin they basically treat my cousin like. The ideal version of me they like talk to my cousin a lot when I go out to see her because she she's only two years younger than me so. When I have the time we do like get together and stuff like that, and when I knew my mom always slips me $100 bill and she's always like you will see your cousin i'm like what about me and she's like you have a job. And um well I don't I don't see that as like. I I don't I don't see that as any there's nothing wrong with that in my opinion. it's just whenever my I would talk to my cousin about my parents, you would always tell me these things that they've never told me i'm like they just told you that and they're like yeah. Oh okay."
510.0,Provider,"yeah it seems like there's some secrets, but the method of communication seems very indirect."
11127.0,Patient,"it's not it's not it's more like it's not like secrets it's just like my mom would tell childhood stories and stuff like stuff about like our family that I just. didn't know about that I thought were. it's not like drama and stuff it's it's more like oh this happen, this is like the story that my grandparents so like my great grandparents told my mom when she was younger. And that you would tell those stories so like. My cousin and stuff like that my mom has like."
510.0,Provider,"You know. And they've never been shared with you directly, but other family members. yeah I say okay. And that can be where you start like hey I want to hear the story about. such and such in that way you know. You can hear directly from mom do you think she would share that with you."
11127.0,Patient,"She would oftentimes it's they don't talk to me, mostly because. I feel like they're also timid, to the sense like they don't. they're also they they don't know how to converse. it's not that they're scared to talk to me it's more like they feel like they're bothering me and which. I can kind of get is also my fault, because i'm very closed off whenever they do talk to me about something."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11127.0,Patient,"um. And I wish I could change that about myself, because a lot of the times I do notice how, when they would try to talk to me, I would give these one word. responses with a very like cold tone."
510.0,Provider,and say okay.
11127.0,Patient,"So, like Sometimes I feel like if I just if I change that it's a little too. Like I don't know how to I don't know It just seems like a really far off step, I do want to get there, which is, to me, I feel like a lot of times to people on the outside they're like you can't just talk to your parents, I know."
510.0,Provider,"And I think you putting yourself physically in the room, as a start, and then I think ilana, especially if you feel like you've sort of kind of. created this dynamic where you've been a little more closed off and again no judgment it's like okay it's happened we can't change it, but. The beautiful part of this present moment is you can always shift it, you can always do something different, you can always prompt for a new. behavior change right, so you can you can ask some questions you can show more curiosity with your parents that in itself is going to show them that you, you have a curiosity and interest and hopefully that will start the ball rolling, and being able to open the dialogue. I think you it sounds like you have a little bit of this preconceived notion of like it can't be done, but the beautiful part is. You could do it today there's there's no timeline it's it's you get to decide. And to try to forge that relationship, if you feel like it's it's been really hindered which it sounds like it has but that's the beautiful part you have. This moment and any moment, you want to select to go ahead and start, you know that that conversation we physically now have you in the room, which before you weren't right, you were in your room completely isolated. So I think the next step is now that you're there asking just some real open and them, you know how is your day or. If you want to dive a little deeper tell me the story about grandma like whatever you know and reference, something that you know about that you want to hear about. showing the interest by asking the questions you might be surprised, with the response and what you get but you you, you can do that anytime you could do it today, if you wanted."
11127.0,Patient,And it's just something that's really like haven't I haven't done in just. My last higher whatever it is actually having a conversation with any of them so. yeah I don't know.
510.0,Provider,"Maybe you could do something even very paradoxical This might be a little too scary but you could even say. You know I know we haven't really had big conversations lately, but I, I really i'm i'm interested in and talking, today, like you can almost just say. say what you're nervous about right you kind of name the we call it kind of name the elephant in the room, you know, nobody wants to talk about the elephant the room, but once you just say hey does everybody see the elephant in the room kind of metaphorically. That might in itself break. The tension, for you or the anxiety of it is true, anxiety, you can just say like you know I know we haven't really had a lot of conversations, but. Just, I just wanted to kind of check in how is your day going today, you know I don't know if that would be too much for you, I don't have that feel comfortable, but maybe just saying what you're you're nervous about. Right."
11127.0,Patient,"Like they're they're waiting for that. yeah like I can, I can tell that they're just they don't want to. push me that's why they're holding back. Sure um. So a lot of the times, I often think like it's it's me, I have to do it and that's life but. And that's what I get like I don't know why but. it's just like. I want to do it, but I also don't want to do it and I don't know why I don't want to do it there's. Nothing that would. stop me, I guess, like the others. I know that they won't. like this is like something like that is something that they really want like they're waiting for that. So it's like I don't get why I get so. anxious about it, or why I sometimes feel like I don't want to do it."
510.0,Provider,"yeah I know and there's there's no real we don't we might not ever know the true answers, and I only really you can answer it, but I think. I think, letting go of the judgment and trying to figure out maybe the reason why we could we could come up with reasons which we've talked about some of the reasons why right. I think it's more of. When you're ready to take that step if you're really wanting to. then go for it and see if this is something you know you, you want to continue to forge. it's there's no right or wrong, but I think you've talked about this, since our first intake is wanting more of a relationship, now we don't know exactly what that might look like, but I think at least having more of that communication think you're wanting is. Not about it now, but it is going to be taking maybe some uncomfortable steps and some awkward silences or awkward moments. I think you'd love your family I think they love you there's there's been some tough times I and like I said, we can come up with reasons, what kind of could be delaying it could be that might not be. But in this moment I guess you have your primed and ready, if you want to try to shift that relationship and open the door."
11127.0,Patient,to break. I just yeah.
510.0,Provider,"it's okay it's all in due time, I think, talking through it and then, just like we did with the getting you out of your room like we had to talk through it a little bit, and then you. You started doing what I call not well in therapy we call it like small exposure right and you were starting to do it a little bit each each day each week right and it started to get a little easier yeah."
11127.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"yeah so it's it's those small steps. yeah yeah, I think, maybe it sounds like maybe talking through it a little bit more, and then maybe trying to set a goal around okay i'm going to try to do this at the table or asked them about this that might be the next step that you and Karen can start start working on. yeah I think you'll do it because there's been I think the yearning I think you're wanting to establish more of a relationship with them."
11127.0,Patient,"yeah I just I know it's like now i'm out of my room, I think, just like sitting from sitting at the dining table to actually having conversations with them is just. a really big step."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, it might take some time you might just be at the dining room table for a bit, and then the next step. More the conversations will begin yeah."
11127.0,Patient,Right.
510.0,Provider,"I think it will happen, the thing. Is no quick fixes right we know it it's a process and kind of getting you comfortable and so it might you might just be sitting there for a little bit until you're ready to to maybe broach some questions I think you'll do it, though, I do have confidence that you're moving in that direction. yeah yeah you are, you are for sure. Excellent before I forget I did want to check in about meds and I guess safety, I mean your your symptoms look really good but I, I wanted to check in about the meds because I know you know some tell does manage the one but are you still taking them in your lexapro."
11127.0,Patient,"um I asked her for you. get off of it, and she said she put me back on fives for. Okay, I have like one week left to go and then i'm completely off."
510.0,Provider,"Obviously you'll be you are currently ty trading off Okay, and the good thing is the symptoms are the lowest i've ever seen so hopefully that is sustained and that looks good Okay, have you had any safety like in the last couple weeks. I know a lot, and he didn't know suicidal that's awesome."
11127.0,Patient,yeah no no really.
510.0,Provider,"That is wonderful all right yeah you did talk about wanting to tie trade i'm glad it sounds like you chatted with her and there's a plan okay. And the good thing is, if you need to reconsider and go back it's super easy to schedule an appointment and you can talk to her about symptoms. But you and Karen can start to track and that's the beautiful part of those surveys, which you've done a really good job of staying on top of those because that gives us a snapshot. We know that day could have been great it could have been not so great, and we know it's not perfect, but that's why you do it over time to get a sense. Good all right well That to me is another positive sign if you're wanting to tie trade and see how you do great good good good. i'm going to miss chatting with you, but I, I honestly wish you the best I know you'll be in good hands, though."
11127.0,Patient,yeah i'm sure miss cherry with you too.
510.0,Provider,"All right, anything else i'm really glad we got to talk a little bit more about the family and the communication, I think. I think that's going to be probably your next step with with Karen hopefully like I know you'll have to sort of build rapport but sounds like it's definitely probably your next goal of what you want to be working on, besides the sleep hygiene, of course, so. Great yeah."
11127.0,Patient,"and I think that's about it, I also just want to be able to know better ways to cope with the whole boyfriend situation because sometimes it gets. Like I would actually just feel angry for like an hour for no reason, because I just think about his situation and. I don't like doing that I don't like because a lot of times it's it's more just like I would think of these situations and it's all in my head and it's like I would take a step back, but even then I would still just feel upset over nothing."
510.0,Provider,"But it's okay to feel it right so. you're allowed year allowing and accepting the feeling you can't change the fact that's how you feel right, so we try to resist the feeling like I don't want to feel this way I don't want to feel this way it actually intensifies it and makes it worse, it magnifies it. Allowing and accepting the emotion it's there you accept it, and then you ask yourself how can I attend to this, what can I do about this. And then you you allow the emotion, you say with it and usually it will then shift and you started describe that like you know within an hour sometimes it's shorter but trying to resist having a feeling. it's futile like people do it try it all the time, like I don't want to feel anxious well guess what you're feeling anxious so. Allowing and accepting it in that moment, and then you can do a self care or specific strategy or mindfulness meditation and then you can be more responsive and how you. You know, acknowledge the feeling, but trying to like not feel. It doesn't work."
11127.0,Patient,You have a.
510.0,Provider,"Allow the feeling, and then it usually passes through you a lot quicker it's already there. Does that makes sense."
11127.0,Patient,yeah yeah I think I think the whole sitting with it is like one of the harder parts for me.
510.0,Provider,"it's for most people ilana and that's one of the most common things that comes up in therapy, the first thing that often people I don't want to be feeling depressed well. you're feeling depressed let's talk about what you can do you allow the feeling, but then there are other strategies, you can be responsive to it right doesn't mean you have to be a complete passive, but when it comes to emotion resisting it it's not going to work. You have to feel it and accept that it's there and then it will pass through. So. All right, well my pleasure so glad we have a final session, I wish you the absolute best you'd be well you'd be safe, you take care of yourself okay."
11127.0,Patient,You too.
510.0,Provider,Thank you ilana bye for. session with a lot of day laura's over she has to be listed as a low suicide risk did a suicide assessment she denies any current suicidal or homicidal self interest thoughts behaviors. And zoom room is closed.
