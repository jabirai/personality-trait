Okay, and so a lot of change and a lot of activity accident that you probably know. You buy, what do similar changes. With changing the whole structure of how we operate. More with Colbert and. Just managing a team a lot to do that and then with this disability i'm on oxygen 24 seven so. wow it's managing that. In working and living alone and isolated and it just got. It God to me I didn't realize how far down I have wit but. I just felt like I couldn't do it anymore I didn't want to do it anymore."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14035.0,Patient,"And that's kind of a first for me, other than years ago when I was using drugs but. i've been clean for 40 something years and. Often, to do that. I was really on a downward slide and I still am and that's I don't feel like I want to hurt myself today. i'm in a better space than that was by weeks ago six weeks ago, what weeks ago. eight weeks, whatever was but. I still am in a place of Depression and anxiety and I really, really want to come out of it. And I really want to work. Hopefully, through you, and through the through CPS to get this. under control. No. No okay absolutely."
740.0,Provider,"that's perfect um so the other stresses that I see here is his family, I thought work, family and hill but you talk about work, you spoke about health, so what how. How is your family a stressor."
14035.0,Patient,"Oh, right now, because of the shape, I was in when I was little I have two sons monster police officer and the other one is homeless and living in a car and sells a anyway, the one who's working is married as two children. One seven and one is 70. The 17 year olds is about the doctor. says wives wife's child anyway, their family of four and he felt like he couldn't take care of me, based on my condition, when I got hospital, so he decided well. My friend friends and him decided in his wife, that I should come in there, because he lives in San Pablo. Which is. I don't know if you know the bay area, do you."
740.0,Provider,I live in the great State of Texas.
14035.0,Patient,"Okay, so it's about. We count we don't count miles, we got count minutes cuz cuz we're so spread out, you might be able to relate to that. About if it's not a lot of traffic. it's about a 45 minute drive. From where I live, and he also works in San Francisco, which is another 45 minutes yeah so it was a lot for him to try to come check on me daily and maintain his family and he works, the graveyard shift so just too much so. I don't want to, but I felt like, for the first time in my life, I really need it somehow. yeah physically not just mentally but physically as well, and so I went so here I am i'm in stay with them for almost two months now. Okay, and what happened, his wife has cancer. Stage four cancer. And she's 36 it's kind of devastating but she's fighting it. But she's not feeling well because she's doing chemo radiology you know, makes me sick. and trying to spend time with her children as much time as possible and him trying to take care in me in the kids they they're doing homeschooling with the youngest so they can smell more time with mom and dad and. Your work in graveyards and then trying to come on and make sure I got breakfast and you know just all of that. All of a sudden, last week we wait before last, you went to work and osi was urban urban urban a couple of days, and he went into the emergency room and that capital or three days, he had. blood clots. What dad attached to his kidney. One side to an artery so it was really day I still am figured out what caused that they're gone, but there's scar tissue there, you can see where they were so anyway that long story story. he's not able to take care of me they're barely able to take care of each other, so I need to go back on. If I had a choice to go home, right now, all things equal I will go, because I feel more comfortable and. They also have a dog and a cat in just now I just noticed oxygen wasn't coming through the cat thanks my these cords are toy. So when he sees them drag in. he's a baby he's six months. When he sees them bullen. he likes to jump on now well you know they have cloth and he cut it to the line and I had to get my son to help me change life so it's just a lot of stressors here, then I wouldn't have him on. The downside downside to being home some there alone."
740.0,Provider,Why.
14035.0,Patient,"And they have to be careful. We ordered a bit and have a live in the condos three bedrooms but downstairs bedroom is empty. upstairs this where you know my little office and bedroom master bath is. downstairs i'm order to bed or downstairs or days that I just can't climb up there don't want to climb up the stairs. that's coming the frame to be put together by next week in the next week, the bad thing about downstairs and everything I do is upstairs other than eat the kitchen downstairs, of course, but my bedroom. it's like. that's my home home base so, then the good thing about their upstairs it's a walk into our. And I have to climb over to get in. The habit seed and afraid I can just walk in to the shower upstairs so there's some ads some pluses and minuses In both cases, but long story short, another anxiety building is moving back home. This Saturday."

14035.0,Patient,"yeah well here's the thing. If i'm recuperating I really should be able to go up those stairs I won't be able to go fast or carry a lot of stuff. But I should be able to walk up the stairs as good at a pace, where I can go to the first landing stop breath catch my breath then finish going up. In my problem. yeah."
740.0,Provider,Oh no. Oh no.
14035.0,Patient,"You. know, everybody else I think so."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, thank."
14035.0,Patient,Goodness there is a rail rail I could go on.

Oh no. yeah i've been doing i've done i've been on it's not new, for me, i've been on it long time now, my lungs aren't getting any better, but i'm learning how to live web learning how to live with it, and you know to be able to function."

In the batteries not charge and my son was gonna get it fixed for me and he's like you know mom. I can't think of anywhere, you need to be drive into right now. And I was like what.

740.0,Provider,"He gave me he gave me a good enough base. So let's kind of dig a little deeper a little bit so growing up what was your What was your family life, like."
14035.0,Patient,"It was. good and bad. Good the good things were. When my father wasn't drunk. With the things I remember, is going to San Francisco to the beach and going on long drives to like. bakersfield pick walnuts, and you know it's going off family drives and doing things together, my father was an alcoholic mother didn't drink or smoke or anything. And he was just the exact opposite and when he was drunk it was a mean drunk he was in a happy drunk he would you know take whatever abuse, he got at work, it was a construction worker and he would bring it all home and abused my mom. In us the kids do we were in the way. The other thing was. And this is difficult, telling you but i'm going to. Open our. yeah I was molested by my POPs at a young age. And in fact he took my virginity. It went alone, two hours. So that started me in a bad space already about sex man and. in life. You will always tell me stuff like if you go sleep with a man, you make them pay if you're like a new make a baby get some for it, so I had that kind of. mentality him I have why the left on. And I like to say my mom didn't know, deep down inside I think he did one time I mentioned it to her and she slapped me to one accepted to say I with my making that up and it wasn't true. yeah my trying to get down get down the coal. blah blah blah scared anyway, I wonder. You know kind of read what's in their head, but that that's part of what happened to me as the town and let. The let the line the damage there. yeah then soon as I left home I got in drove I met some guy and I got it and."
740.0,Provider,"While. I appreciate you so much for sharing that with me, I know that wasn't easy at all. But I thank you for no no don't like to talk about it."

They lead to the happy birthday, but other than that he's very. giveaway argumentative type person I don't have a lot of talents that he always wants to talk about what our parents left us and we should add the House that we should add this that not only want to talk about that. Is that's not what's that and then. I managed to be okay, so no go down that road."
740.0,Provider,"And anyone ever struggle with like any mental health or substance abuse. or food issues in your family, I know you did after you left home but, like in the home, was there any kind of mental healthy and outside, well, I know dad was an alcoholic but was there any mental health involved between mom and dad."

740.0,Provider,"So um regarding your anxiety and depression and then you said you want to work on those pain, so what is something that you in regards regarding your anxiety and depression, I what are some pain point like what are some things you, you want to work on exactly we're gonna get."
14035.0,Patient,"Well, I want to do is look at stop focusing on the negatives, and try to focus on positive things and to stop the conversation in my head that everything is. not going to work out, but that it will one day at a time that it will work out work itself out i'm a worrier and I worry about. Next week, and the week after and six months from now, and you know really some time I get myself I call it on the ledge about stuff that is not really necessary, but I get worked up about it. For example, yesterday was the first day that I was supposed to go. To a new hairstylist and i've been going to somebody for four years that retired that I really, really like so we might disability and going to a new new shop and going with an uber not having one of my friends take me, it was very stressed. For a minute I could really get stuck but. It will end up turning out okay. I tried to make it look like an adventure because I hadn't been out of the House, and do it three days, so I said oh i'm going on an adventure today. Yes, I tried to. Create that and I told my uber driver and she was she was really good too. So worked out, but just trying to find when I work up wake up in the morning that's almost in a panic mode and I don't know if it's. The medication, but. I don't know, maybe it's just the situation that i'm in. Oh no but I wake up eight inches. about the day. and not one to start the day."
740.0,Provider,"So, when you say that you worry what are, what do you worry about."
14035.0,Patient,"What am I good, what do I need to get done today what time does it have to be as I have to do my breathing treatments, it takes an hour to do that. And then also got it he takes me about an hour to do that because I have to eat really slow i'm just worried about, and you know the all these doctor appointment is that the your dare be the weekly therapy and I had all my health nurse coming, and then I have the. The home health nurse, who have ma who else new shower. In physical therapy SAB and I have my primary care. guys. yeah i'm busy."
740.0,Provider,"So i'm therapy won't be every week, unless you want to be every week every every other week."
14035.0,Patient,Right is it gonna be on Thursday every other week.
740.0,Provider,Do you want us to be on Thursday for the week.

14035.0,Patient,"That, though, was three o'clock."
740.0,Provider,Three o'clock. Oh yeah three o'clock five. My man.
14035.0,Patient,yeah on California time. Bad is what is five o'clock there right.
740.0,Provider,"You series. So the 30th so that's the that's the Thursday after so the 30th at. What, let me, let me, let me go ahead and make a note now because of wind down remember."
14035.0,Patient,me to.
740.0,Provider,kegel. 38 please. Okay. All right. thing your reminder.
14035.0,Patient,yeah and then get one this time.
740.0,Provider,I think they I think they will I don't know cuz somebody one of my patients that they they they sent via email.
14035.0,Patient,And i've been checking my email I didn't get it.
740.0,Provider,"i'm not even though. No, no."
14035.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"Oh. Do you have enough strength, you can save it, or do we need to enter."
14035.0,Patient,i'm good.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
14035.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"alright. So. I want to deal with the worry. I know that that if I if we can. We can deal with the worry, it will make your life live anxious."
14035.0,Patient,Yes.
740.0,Provider,"Because badly and worry, they could. So. um. This activity is called what could happen versus what will happen. worried derives from what could happen. The elimination of where it derives from will actually happen."
14035.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"It just like when you say i'm gonna get my hair done today. i'm going to go out automated uber try this new sounds like they say Uma you could think the worst i'm again allow the other person might be a psycho I mean what have you and do my hair good you know, and all that kind of stuff. When, in reality, you didn't do last overdrive was great and your hair looks wonderful."
14035.0,Patient,yeah but that's after the fact.
740.0,Provider,"Exactly, so what i'm saying is is that, instead of worrying about something because, basically, what happens when you were you make a speculation, we mentioned you assume. Yes, and so, when you offend."
14035.0,Patient,You a song for the worse.
740.0,Provider,"Right and that's and see that's the problem, and the reason why you assume for the words is because a lot of times we basically characterizing based on what we've experienced in the past, so if we have more negative than positive in the past and then maybe we'll bring that over. And it will continue it will continue to a transfer over each and every day."
14035.0,Patient,"yeah I think what adds an additional layer for me is because of my disability. Right I don't talk I don't Am I well. and doing I do see myself as a disabled person i'll talk about myself that way but. Having this oxygen adds another old layer of complexity, for example, I called the lady to remind her, I was coming to my appointment and I asked her if she had a restaurant in the shop. Because my previous. Yes, Dallas you had to go down the hallway and it was a common bathroom. And she seemed like what she said to me, was Yes, this is a salon, of course, we have a bathroom in the shop. But to me and my is sound like Oh, she thinks i'm talking down to her because she's in the shopping mall you know, trying to put a shot down by asking that question. But when I talked to her later and told her how I was feeling she said no, I knew that your previous stylus her salon the bathroom what's down the hall. And that's why I said to you know our bathroom is in slot because, for me, I have to strategically think about if I have to go to the bathroom and sometimes I gotta go quick that's a whole nother day mom experiences is. incontinent sometimes I gotta go quick I need to know how far I have to walk to get to a bathroom strategically or is, can I find myself where i'll be gone only so long, I won't even have to use the restroom. I took you down long story, but that's."
740.0,Provider,Definitely very you are more than me okay.
14035.0,Patient,"Anyway, that's that's it just adds that that disability adds another layer of complexity of fear for me."
740.0,Provider,"it's understandable, I have, I have a. dad who's disabled. And so he's he's permanently disabled. So. I can definitely understand he needs to walk he can't even walk without a Walker or became like he can even you became he has to have a Walker."
14035.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So I definitely understand and the hardships that it can be and that's the reason why I in regards to how much healthy receive because you have to be able to. maneuver through life. feel and you can't do it alone so that's why I was asking okay well how much have the, you have the support that you have the home health nursing, even with food delivery, I know, with some program they do have programs where they actually deliver food daily. To where you can get daily meal."
14035.0,Patient,"Unfortunately i'm on my income level doesn't, allow me to have state funded programs like that."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, you."
14035.0,Patient,"know. I was making me I make pretty good money when i'm working. I work for the county. And the same detail. don't know if you know about. semi tail in California, but it's one of the it's one of the highest paid counties in in California bear so I never not I tech area. of California San Francisco Bay area."
740.0,Provider,But.
14035.0,Patient,But but here's the big but to that the cost of living is off the chain.
740.0,Provider,I can't.
14035.0,Patient,"You know, everybody here almost everybody has a roommate if you have a roommate you better be humping. know my I have two jobs. But yeah i'm blessed i've been blessed with reasonable income, but you know i'm thinking. that's another fear, what if I have to retire and i'm really seriously thinking about it because i'm 69."
740.0,Provider,You think. You were eligible to retire four years ago.
14035.0,Patient,I know. it's not that i'm not eligible i'm thinking about the insurance.
740.0,Provider,yeah well everybody Chinese different but they don't they don't take care of you for the rest of your life with the insurance.
14035.0,Patient,"No. way ours go. I ever much sickly you have many hours sick leave, you have you get. They take. Eight hours every eight hours you get a month's worth the insurance paid for."
740.0,Provider,So what about medicaid and aarp yeah I have it up there.
14035.0,Patient,"Yes, but you gotta be at a lower level and."
740.0,Provider,When you retire.
14035.0,Patient,"yeah and I have medicaid medicaid hospitalization. I don't have the other. Yet, because i'm still working, but I wouldn't be eligible to get it."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so no may cover that basically takes the place of your insurance."
14035.0,Patient,Right I don't know if you still could get it is you and I are income level I guess you can I.
740.0,Provider,I don't I don't think I don't think it's the basic way in Texas is not I don't know how did California.
14035.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So, but you never know unless you unless you research and figure it out, because."
14035.0,Patient,"I gotta do and that's one of my fears i've been. lagging on we'll talk about that another time but. yeah that's a big one, and I need to make a decision, probably by November cuz i'm on medical leave until November and if i'm going to retire, they say the month to retire in our county is in April, because you get an extra to set something I don't know. But I gotta do some research."
740.0,Provider,Because. You want to know what all your options are in regards to how you will be taken care of. physically. You have Gray hair. and your medical.
14035.0,Patient,"Yes, you are."
740.0,Provider,"So um yeah this is, I mean you can just do research or maybe that's something that we can do together doing one patient. and be."
14035.0,Patient,"listeners, we can work out a plan."
740.0,Provider,yeah mason that's.
14035.0,Patient,"The other piece to that that's a little. Complicated its own some property out of state. Okay that's not paid off. So do I sell it now or do do, what do I do."
740.0,Provider,"Easy I mean if you got family and because the thing about it is if you're not if you're going to sell it, are you gonna or you want to pass the balance of one of your phone."

14035.0,Patient,"yeah you know it's a little less than what it's a little bit of a loss, a couple hundred dollars, but I didn't mind that because I was getting a tax write off."

In reality, these words may never come true what happened, have you ever thought about their lives when you were worried about something or worried about what could happen and and what happens is what you worried about never comes true. Does it make you feel."
14035.0,Patient,I feel good that it didn't come true.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Does he."
14035.0,Patient,feel feel kind of Stupid worried about it.
740.0,Provider,"Well, you know that's. So do you know that worrying can actually. affect your health."
14035.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely. I can tell, because. When I start worrying too much I can feel it in my body, I have to go to the bathroom my stomach gets nervous. I might get a little headache."
740.0,Provider,So. A regard I think the thing that I heard the most have to worry about is making sure that you get everything done that needs to be done within a day.
14035.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Do you have a planner.
14035.0,Patient,know.
740.0,Provider,How do you keep up with your appointment.
14035.0,Patient,i've been putting them in my. living room in my phone. Okay manually. yeah.
740.0,Provider,Do you say reminders in your phone.
14035.0,Patient,30 minutes before the meeting.
740.0,Provider,"So do you put every appointment, that you have to do that day your phone."
14035.0,Patient,I tried to.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, how far in advance, do you put your appointment on your phone."
14035.0,Patient,Two weeks.
740.0,Provider,Oh that's good.
14035.0,Patient,"As they come up like you I just added you. Your every other week so you're alone. difficult to talents challenging to schedule. Like my hair, I went yesterday. And i'm going in two weeks again. Okay, so i've made that appointment. Now I know that I add the women's group. Every Tuesday. Okay, so I put that one is repeat. so few. For a few months."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, it looks like you do good with scheduling."
14035.0,Patient,well. kinda.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so where's the whole."
14035.0,Patient,I think I do need a physical cuz i'm old school. I really do need a notebook. write this stuff down.
740.0,Provider,"and listen live I got me a little freedom, one is breathing. I got. Another thing, and I think about it with me electronically, if we are good, but I was like I need to write this down. yeah right there and the thing about it is because when you write you use both sides of your brain."
14035.0,Patient,hmm.
740.0,Provider,"And so, basically your your brain is able to capture. i'm in in two different ways, because not only not only do you write it down, but you also have to read it."
14035.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"So that means you hear you hear yourself, but then you also get the weather, you also are reading what's going on, so it actually I will say this, they say, I remember, I read some kind of statistic one time, they said, if you write out your schedule. With the plan of has to achieve it, then you're not I mean, with the goal of how you're going to know what the plan of how you're going to achieve their goal you're 93% more likely to achieve it, when you write it down. Maybe an old maybe a little planet don't I mean maybe it'd be more efficient. Maybe we can try it out. We have a can alleviate some of the worry. When you when you wake up every morning are you guys doing as a planner Okay, if I got this done today. yeah this to do today. And so I mean just keep next to you. You know you have you're in a good space because you're all medical leave so. it's not you're not obligated to get up and go to work. No, basically, is one of those is more so, opening up the planner being able to see what you have to do today, and then they see. And then check it off, as you go along. It will alleviate the stress of trying to figure out oh my gosh what do I have new today, did I write it down that I put it in my phone is an iPhone I don't overdo my phone, let me go look I don't see Okay, well, I see this point with I missing I guess too much that's a lot. that's a lot. So I like the fact that you write down your appointments as they come. How I mean that you put them on your phone as they come up, but maybe we can get a planner."
14035.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,And so.
14035.0,Patient,"One virtually when I have the gone live, and we will have to go ahead and store."
740.0,Provider,So. yeah yeah. And you get you a nice preaching one Sunday. Like. You just some nice to you know something that something that draws you to want to make sure that you write to your planner. consistently.
14035.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"bye that's why I got like a little floor type plan and because I was, I was rereading it he got locked out of necessity, so I know i'm gonna use it, because it's real freedom to gossipy. But if it is playing and ugly I don't think i'm gonna use it, because there's nothing different tracks this pulling me to use this because it's blank."
14035.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"Does that make sense. yeah So if you like, colors you know call is always captivate the APP. So, to get something colorful or to get something that you like you know it will basically kind of motivates you to continue to utilize a planner. So can we start there. Okay okay so by the 30 if you will have a planner and for me."
14035.0,Patient,yeah what.
740.0,Provider,"I say, by the 30 if you don't have some planner if something."
14035.0,Patient,Is some fans.
740.0,Provider,P and P and.
14035.0,Patient,"dance oh Okay, yes."
740.0,Provider,"So we can try bit and being so once your plan arrived when Amazon, you can do like overnight, or you have Amazon prime become very soon, and so, but once your planner arrives, everything is in your phone put it in your planner."
14035.0,Patient,"Okay, OK."
740.0,Provider,"OK, and then every day. Every day. I want you to write a your plan or your daily routine. that's from the time you wake up because it's time you take your medicine to your our breathing treatment so you're out to eat. When you when your doctor's appointment. A. Rehabilitation whatever you have that day your daily routine write it down from time you wake up to when you want to go to be. So wait and see until you're going to find a time you wake up down to when you're going to go to sleep."
14035.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and the reason, and I would just do this because sometimes sometimes our days can be repetitive. Like I know if I wake up. I know what my day is going to consist of when I wake up every now and then I may and and you always leave room was looking you always excuse me, you leave room for incidentals. yeah, just in case something happens there wasn't plenty."
14035.0,Patient,"that's always, the one thing with these. nurses it they. They can schedule those only the day before. And sometimes they don't. schedule them for the week out. still have to leave room."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, so just leave room, you know and just go okay well the nurse she may come around this time so imma leave this gap, just in case the nurse comes. yeah and so being organized. can help alleviate some of the worry."
14035.0,Patient,So that way you don't follow the. Word organized.
740.0,Provider,"So that way I know right so that way you don't feel like they were you don't feel like you're missing something, because when you feel like you're missing something, then that's when you start to worry what am I missing. yeah right so we're going to continue to work on that, but we want to take it, piece by piece i'm not gonna throw it all on year one. we're going to start off with the schedule, everyone thought I was a planner and writing our daily routine down and making sure we stick with their daily routine and leaving room for incidental. Okay. and What is all of the planet movies all over the planet is all of. It so everything that everything that you everything you have to do it will be in a book, so you won't have to go outside of the book. Everything will be in the book. So we're just thought there like you said I you you you believe that the that the actual paper will be better than the phone so let's just start with it."
14035.0,Patient,"Okay, as."
740.0,Provider,Always I appreciate you so much for showing up. This has definitely been a delight is a pleasure meeting you I look forward to working with you again and i'll see you on the 30th.
14035.0,Patient,"Okay. All right, well, you haven't read weekend okay. Okay, you too."
