A detox. Well, if you go to a hospital and you let them know give them all our information that you're rolling and I because I did the intake they're. Just show them all this paperwork that you've enrolled and they'll give you this suboxone there and then after that you could come into treatment and then so when I called and I ended up meeting a social worker there, and she told me about this place."

No enjoyment, I mean i've learned over the time that i've been achieved in that they talk about you know when you mess with all your. That brain functioning and how it just affects it so bad, where you're you know it takes some time, the pause I want to say it was or."

298.0,Provider,it's just knowing.
14822.0,Patient,"Anything and my girlfriend has been so good, to me, these few times and I just feel upset with myself it's like even with her it's hard to try and find enjoyment and. yeah like do go places do things and it's just kind of like it's not there, we go to places, but when we do place you go to places I go where we went to Monterey Bay aquarium and it was just it was nothing I didn't feel anything. and irritating. The super packed but. and I mean, I like videos up and from what i've heard in the rehab they just. You know. Over the years and years I just never did anything about it or try to change my patterns and build new habits."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14822.0,Patient,"And there's been periods of time, where I tried in like introduce a new thing to myself and try to keep up with it, and then it just falls off and then."
298.0,Provider,Tell me about your anxiety.
14822.0,Patient,"Actually, my nails a lot as a kid as a little kid i've always true to my nails. I really future trip. i've never had an anxiety attack I don't know what that feels like from what i've heard people explain I don't know how that feels but I mean it's just basically my mind's just wandering in wondering I. i've been taking melatonin for a long time so sometimes if I don't take it, I fall asleep really late."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14822.0,Patient,"So I kind of got you, but before that. I never really had a hard time sleeping. I was always able to have good sleep. But I mean I just like I future trip I think about this, I think about things that haven't even happening or sometimes the worst case scenario I guess it wouldn't be considered major and you know where it's. You lose control your breathing and stuff like that, but. yeah that's kind of the gist of it just overthinking my brains constantly that's why I like staying really busy and working hand like, but I know. i'm not really learning the deep down issue what's going on with me i'm just covering it up with something else, so I don't. Bring occupy."
298.0,Provider,How would you explain your moods.
14822.0,Patient,"um. Can I. I guess insecurities like job wise and stuff I will be working in all especially my last position, I feel like I mean since I wasn't doing any type meeting or any type of. Gathering social gatherings with other like sober people friends meeting new friends, I was just expressed on my work and thinking to myself, all these people don't like me, even though they've told me different. Like that i'm doing a good job, but I didn't feel like I didn't feel like I was doing do that. It was a mechanic type job and honestly that's not my in my area. Okay, it was basic just oil changing so I was like man these guys don't think I don't know what i'm doing I think i'm stupid and. I was basically just oil changes I know how to do that and change filters and things simple their stuff but. I was just over here thinking i'm not good enough here this it's like you know i'm better off on the other side, which is basically it's more Labor is but it's just bear separating things that don't belong in it's a transfer Center like a dump. And I feel a lot better there, so I feel like this position, you know it's better for me because I mean I it's really good benefits, you know they have all retirement stuff and."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14822.0,Patient,"But it's like where i'm at there. I feel like I fit in more with those other people and. But I see like I was futures, I was thinking about what they're thinking like ball wonder what they're thinking and then have stresses me out and then I get upset with myself because i'm telling myself they don't like me or. So it's like worried about other people was thinking would look like or. Just bringing my staff, my moods and the. it's hard, now that I have to think about it it's hard to try and take point. that's why, when I do start to notice that i'm getting like that I try to really find things to do at work, so I could just block my mind out of stuff and really stay busy on what i'm doing in the moment. and I mean I don't know if I can answer your question or."
298.0,Provider,Do you have panic attacks.
14822.0,Patient,"No, I never yeah i've never experienced anything like that."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you excessively worried."
14822.0,Patient,"And then there's times that there's other times it's more than others what I what I knew know that i'm worried about right now is like like how I miss that meeting because usually on these meetings i'm early hour. Early and I don't know what that meeting, and just like completely slipped my mind and then i'm like man i'm not going to get myself I missed it and now i'm going to be sick i'm going to."
298.0,Provider,not feel.
14822.0,Patient,"Good I was like in shrimping so hard on that in like and then I call now lately i've been climbing like twice during a week or sometimes three times, just to double check of making sure I have my appointments down when he did do him."
298.0,Provider,"good for you, it does get easier, what is your height and weight."
14822.0,Patient,i'm 62 and I weighed like around between 185 and 190.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Can I repeat back to you what I think i've heard you say. Yes, Okay, so you struggle with sleep because you're overthinking and you have feelings of blah where you're just not happiness, you know it's just not a joy inside you. And it could be pause because you learned about that from wherever rehab you were in, but it also could be lack of sleep and you."
14822.0,Patient,"know the sleep part I do get sleep like I said i've always said really good, but I was saying that I I take melatonin a lot, so I noticed when I don't take it off policy later, but even before like because i've been in a treatment Center since like 2014 but i've started using. Since like I got at TC 2009 but, even when those periods of times when I got clean, I was always I had good sleep, I was always able to sleep, but then not too long ago a boxing so I could fall asleep prettier. And wake up really early job the shift, but then I started taking it for a while it's been like almost a year, and so I noticed when I don't take that then i'll fall asleep late."
298.0,Provider,But i've never done.
14822.0,Patient,"anything except now, I think, maybe i'm used to the melatonin or maybe my brain just got used to that melatonin. Because I used to stress, even in during the times, I was clean. In my sleep."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14822.0,Patient,"One that's one thing I know that's me stressing us they never affected my state. Because I was always will I was, I, like my sleep that's why I guess i'm a downer type of guy."
298.0,Provider,Okay. So if I had a magic pill What would it do for you.
14822.0,Patient,"The cravings. yeah you know I just not crave and then. Just be able to not worry. about what people think and, to an extent because I mean you know not to where it's overwhelming, and all this like really irrational stuff. But, just like. i'm just where it really eats at me and then just where I feel more confident myself and. Because overtimes i've i've had very plenty of jobs and i'm always had heard good of me, and it wasn't ever hard for me to find a job, so I see things that i've done that I know i've got capable of doing, but then, at the same time, so just not to. downplay myself or feel like you know i'm i'm really hard on myself so some to not be so hard on myself."
298.0,Provider,"So what i'm hearing is some depression going on. Would you like to do a little bit of research on what I recommend and then you could let me know via email if you'd like to try it. Okay, I think you might do well on. lexapro for depression it doesn't really. it's not a big gun it doesn't have a lot of side effects it on it, like some of the other men's."
14822.0,Patient,lexapro.
298.0,Provider,lexapro. Lol attack. yeah.
14822.0,Patient,"All right, i'll check it out."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14822.0,Patient,So you were saying that's not like a very heavy hitter type of thing you're.
298.0,Provider,"yeah it's not it wouldn't have a lot of side effects. And so that's why i'm thinking. Unfortunately, these meditate medications take like four weeks to even notice that they're working but and then, when they start working you think well I don't need medication. And so there's this vicious cycle."
14822.0,Patient,Right i've heard of that yeah.
298.0,Provider,"All right, um. Okay, and let me give you my email T."
