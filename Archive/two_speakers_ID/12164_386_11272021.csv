12164.0,Patient,"really, really, really sick, I mean real sick and i'm almost pointing using."

386.0,Provider,"And I have walgreens drugstore located at 1000 park avenue West in mansfield. Yes, okay. Is that a day, where our walgreens."
12164.0,Patient,know they close it ah OK. And the view for morphine that subjects right.
386.0,Provider,"it's w tax. Okay yep I have model therapy here and then. I currently have you enrolled in our program for opioid use disorder and your current care intensity is that you're supposed to be seeing once weekly for your group therapy. And then twice a month for individual therapy I currently have you mark down on Wednesdays with Dr cell and john reinhart. Yes, look here so right now the prescription recommendation reads that it's a two day supply, with no additional refills and that's due to multiple. Miss appointments but. It says yes significantly pass to do you have a urine drug screen Cup."
12164.0,Patient,I have the cup but I don't have the baggage amen.
386.0,Provider,Okay.
12164.0,Patient,"The Cup is there, I just don't have the bag that it came in."
386.0,Provider,"yeah so you actually have to have like it has to be like completely like not taken out or anything like that, so what I would recommend is once we're done here logging into the cure navigation vc or compliance vc and. Requesting for a new year and Cup to be sent out to you and then see if they can send a lab order to like. lab near you. To just get it done at a lab that way that way once it's done it's done."
12164.0,Patient,And if I can get if I can get that paper you know something saying that then. That that's a lot easier than going to the hospital and Sagan i've been asked to do a drug screen and they look at you like you're an idiot.
386.0,Provider,"yeah they might be able to send you a copy of it but that's something that I don't do that's something that the compliance vc does. um Let me take a look here so last appointment, I had scheduled for you that you checked into was on 1110 so it coming up here it's going to be 30 days i'm in like a next couple of weeks sorry my cats move and behind me. But. I have 10 um. she's hiding she's. um. But I have i'm like the crazy cat lady of the neighborhood. But so once we get up to that 30 day marker that means I can't bridge any longer, so you definitely need them to just make sure you go to your next appointment, I have you scheduled on 12 one for group so. Next Wednesday Okay, so what i'm going to be able to do for you, it doesn't look like individual therapy has been met, have our, would you be available to. Come to one of our care groups on Monday. And then I can Bridget for like the four days for Friday Saturday Sunday Monday and then on Monday, if you go to care group and just let the let me see who it is on Monday, if it's. I think it's going to be. You can let Andrea know because it's on Monday so it's similar to like a peer support almost but it's not. With the provider, and I can give you the meeting ID number. But what they're requesting right now is that you'd be seeing three times a week because of all the missed appointments um you obviously have a lot going on right now I would prefer you to just talk to Dr cell about it. But in the meantime to get you bridged, to be able to extend out the prescription from a two day to afford a I would need for you to agree to go to that Monday appointment. So I have Monday, and it is at 1234 o'clock four o'clock Eastern standard time would that work for you."
12164.0,Patient,"Okay, four o'clock my time is what you're saying. yep yep."
