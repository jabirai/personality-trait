191.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
2847.0,Patient,And it just keeps getting worse and worse and.
191.0,Provider,worse.
2847.0,Patient,Like through the years it's like I didn't use the limp and now I can't really walk.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah you do Nice. yeah because that may give us definitely some idea if you've got bone on bone grinding. If our you know gives you ideas about alignment and things like that Okay, so they will start with some X rays you definitely need an orthopedic referral Now let me ask you this, any medication allergies, can you take like ibuprofen."
2847.0,Patient,yeah but that doesn't work because i've had I got some of those from. Last Dr kind of just gave me I rip open.
191.0,Provider,And it did give him they gave you regular ibuprofen.
2847.0,Patient,"They gave me 600 milligrams I used to be on I used to be on eight but that doesn't that's why I don't know what else I mean, so it helps. birds and when i'm sleeping in my legs go to totally non I can't even yeah."
191.0,Provider,"So i'd be. Go ahead and look at have you been The other thing you need to do is call the price method if you're able to do it OK. So for prevent the pain. Price okay so you're going to have to get off that. Can you want to you want to risk the leg as often as you can okay. The sea is, if you can compress it. Like I have to have people do ice bandages so with many of my patients i'm able to get like a. So almost like a splint or soda like a splint tight where we used to order the one with the ice packs on each side and that's where your primary. Care doctors gonna come inside what you have the jail ice packs where you can wrap it around your knee. and correct Plaza and I want you to elevate it. So I sit. I sit. elevated Keep it up, you may want to wrap it with a Spanish not too tight, but to kind of help it out elevated up. And while you're not using it, I want you to try to risk that leg okay. It sounds like you may have something going on with your meniscus sounds like some arthritis i'm concerned about other ligaments and things in a joint. as to why you're not stable and sometimes bracing can help with the stability and maybe offloaded little bit that's, the main thing for you to do when are you going to see your primary care doctor."
2847.0,Patient,"I guess, for the first time this past month, I see her on the 28th."
191.0,Provider,So you saw her last month.
2847.0,Patient,yeah That was my first visit yeah.
191.0,Provider,man on the 28th.
2847.0,Patient,yeah she did she was worried about giving me other referrals like for gastro and liver and.
191.0,Provider,"you'll see her on the 28th of this month, so that's great. So the 28th of October The other thing I do which or buprenorphine a lock some, and this will help you, with your pain, you are what's the dose of buprenorphine you're on."
2847.0,Patient,To a day I mean i've been on for like 1011 years.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so what you can do you can take. Every four to six hours, so if you split the dose that helps with paying better."
2847.0,Patient,That which some. Somebody else told me that you know what i've been doing.
191.0,Provider,"ibuprofen. Do it like that, for your pain, so that I helped and the other thing too is I can send in yeah so yeah she's already sent an ibuprofen 600. Hours yeah yeah take ibuprofen. i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get started any type of control substance."
2847.0,Patient,"Oh no I don't like that I was thinking, if you had anything that wasn't controlled I would have thought I was wondering."
191.0,Provider,"six hours The other thing i've had people. Do i've had some people. You may want to try like have you tried any of those creams, that you can rub on your knees, that all."
2847.0,Patient,Yours them all.
191.0,Provider,"yeah the old account of creams. yeah okay. So, usually once we do that for wild and everything then your primary care works it up. And then they may have to try to get you a stronger dose I see the 600 milligrams every. six hours and that's still an active prescription, so we have that. yeah that's, the main thing I don't necessarily mix ibuprofen and tylenol together, I would do the just go ahead and do the price method what we talked about and. And splitting your dose of be on. You know I don't I don't have anything else that I would add, I don't know if. icy hot to help you or not."
2847.0,Patient,"i've even tried, I even got my friend gave me those prescription numbing patches. And then I. A good night time and nine times when i'm laying down it's really bad."
191.0,Provider,yeah that's it have you been ice in it and elevated and wrapping it. But I spend it.
2847.0,Patient,Really that might.
191.0,Provider,"have time but yeah i've i've had some knee pain and i'll tell you, and I do this, what my family members. You try to get that inflammation down and try to when you come home you got to get that pillow under that knee and wrap it and you know how you can go to walmart and get those I do that for my family. I wrap that around that knee elevated take that ibuprofen. Sit them down say this is your moment to relax because if you're like most providers like if your mom or grandma you go go go go to give me a chance to heal at night."
2847.0,Patient,Right my nine year old grandma getting around better than me.
191.0,Provider,Where you. You looks like you have some good genes in your family okay.
2847.0,Patient,"Oh man, she is yeah."
191.0,Provider,"So what you want to try that miss luck it Okay, if I be profaned doesn't work, then we may want to try something like a mole vic that's a different type of anti inflammatory but you don't want to mix it with ibuprofen and they. For you know."
2847.0,Patient,"I was on something a while back I don't know what it was. I was on a different thing something, this is something it was a little."
191.0,Provider,Close lynette.
2847.0,Patient,I don't know something it was it was joint pain basically.
191.0,Provider,"yeah and that's closer neck is off to us now, the thing about it it's much harder on the stomach okay. You know so often what I share with patients if we get a stronger medicine, you may potentially have a stronger side effect, so we have to be really careful."
2847.0,Patient,effects.
191.0,Provider,"Right, I would like to see you try to do the arm I don't think you've tried, the price method like rest in that knee elevating it wrapping it with the ice bandage. Putting the ice on top of it and sitting there, do you ibuprofen okay what we're trying to do is beat down that inflammation okay definitely and physical therapy X rays, and then also. Be helps to depending on the type of the pain, it very much can help. To see."
2847.0,Patient,"What my problem is it goes, all the way up my leg my back of my leg that's why I can't pinpoint the exact."
191.0,Provider,"Right exactly. yeah and i'm wondering do else going on, do you have lower back."
2847.0,Patient,"that's what my grandma said she said it could be from your back, not that I know of, I mean when I lay down at night, I can like you know certain way I can't like that messes me up but."
191.0,Provider,I really need a whole body physical exam. If the pain running down the back of your neck leg to you need.
2847.0,Patient,"any type of side well my neck I did have bad when I was in that wreck I had. whiplash required, I was in a brace for a minute."
191.0,Provider,"Right, I think you really need to get that checked out miss Janet. And and and definitely. Okay. Okay, with you're in it after you meet with your primary care provider if they are working, you up and doing X rays, and if they're concerned about trying something a little stronger I am perfectly fine if you speak with Isaiah to continue with him or if you need to see me for pain management. But I do to."
2847.0,Patient,narcotics or no.
191.0,Provider,"No, I understand, but I do. work we do work with patients that have chronic pain, but we need you to be worked up to we don't want to be worked up and detail, because what I found is that if we give Madison to cover the pain in the source of the pain is not a dress you actually get worse in the long run okay. So yep so remember i'm Dr sale, so, if anything, comes up you get your ex your primary care they recommend like a gabapentin or lyrica anything like that, and if they're like well I don't know. Because you're a human or fail. If they say but you're all people normally we don't want to do that don't Let that be a reason that you don't contact Isaiah or me to work with your pain Okay, and just let him know you met with me okay."
2847.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"I appreciate, you have to have you. worked up to first do no harm, because that might be something nerve pain going on, based on what you're saying okay. Please, please keep me posted okay."
