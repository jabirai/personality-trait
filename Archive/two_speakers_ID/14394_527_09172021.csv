14394.0,Patient,hear me okay.
527.0,Provider,"yep I can, can you hear me okay. yeah good all right well how's things going this week."
14394.0,Patient,"I, I have to say, probably better than um the previous week, maybe like 1% better because. I am. Just more aware of kind of what's going on. And i'm because I am I feel like i'm trying and putting effort into it. Okay, like okay i'm. trying harder than I did last week. Okay yeah. um so I mean that's I guess better than I feel like i'm maybe 1% better is that right."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14394.0,Patient,"Good yes, I was really good up until. i'm. Wrong Okay, so the weekend was bad because I was like hey. i'm i'm going to go to the weight loss clinic and get vitamin D shot and then they give me these little pills, the vitamin D pills, or whatever feel like i'm like I talk way too fast i'm like everywhere, when I pills. I, like my husband calls him the crack fails because i'm. Not like cleaning up factors and I go to the neighbors my clean out their gutters you know. I I said to on the weekend Okay, so this is like my one last final and I, and when I wrote, I wrote it down because I wanted to just kind of start journaling. And I read, I wrote down like what am I, like this crazy crack addict where I know i'm going to go get this this shot and this this, these are correct pills basically that are going to help me so this last weekend i'm going to get that one last hit basically i'm going to be."
527.0,Provider,binged yes one last hoo hoo rah.
14394.0,Patient,"Right all right go in and like commit myself to know you're on track like let's do this. The weekend was like what downhill. Monday I drove over to the clinic and they were closed, so I was like Oh, I guess that's just like I get one more day so."
527.0,Provider,One day.
14394.0,Patient,"And then the morning I went over there and got my shot and then. Tuesday was good Wednesday was good yesterday was good um. Except for dinner so dinner. I justified to where like I made a thin crust pizza homemade for the kids. And then I got a calling us for me. Okay, I justified that by oh it's a cauliflower crust so I can eat the whole pizza so like. Before, and you know, like there's nothing left and on the plate so. Then I was like oh I shouldn't have done that it was I know that was bad I know to do just too small pieces. Why did I did a whole pizza oh cuz it's cauliflower crass but then I was like. Well, there was a lot of cheese on that pizza so it's like a lot of calories so i'm probably like already. You know, had slipped that first off the way again. As well just have some that ice cream in the freezer, and so I like a big bowl of ice cream. And, but then that was it I didn't eat anymore and usually I would go back and eat whatever you know and but I haven't. On the days of Tuesday, Wednesday I didn't eat anything before I went to bed, and then Thursday I just had this boy ice cream then that's it so. After I got done eating a bowl of ice cream, I was like man i'm gonna have to tell her what I did."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so what's what's it been like hearing for you. You know, having this accountability and really looking at the behaviors what's it been like for you."
14394.0,Patient,"it's hard, because I get so angry with myself and so fashion discussed it like in every single one of the little things that I wrote um I. I wrote like how bad I feel about myself, because I let myself get to this point where i'm just so disgusted like I just I can't even wear any clothes that fit me anymore they're all too tight and I just I don't feel good about myself. it's frustrating for me to just like justify and I get so angry with myself because it's like. You can't. buy that you can eat a whole pizza just because it's a cauliflower Christ like and then I get really upset with myself like. It goes to Britt do you think you can be very overwhelmed So what are you going to do i'm just I already feel bad about myself so i'm asked to just you know enjoy that ice cream, but I don't enjoy the ice cream. Okay, I just eat it yeah. So. I know. it's hard."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so let's think about here, because. Just because I like that you are able to recognize the justification. But let's look at how how the eating disorder thoughts are so irrational for you like you know, like just because it's a cauliflower crust doesn't mean that it's permission to eat the whole thing but, but it also just shows how intense your eating disorder thoughts are. And how. That twist to go no it's Okay, you can do this. yeah when and so you're trying to battle your own thoughts with irrational behaviors and irrational thoughts, because they don't make sense. Right yeah. So one of the things I want to kind of challenge you on to is thinking about. Like. Being able to recognize recognize those irrational thoughts, but also trying to stop that cycle of beating yourself up like. Again, that all or well I blew it so let's just go just let's just go down the rabbit hole and just really just validate, then the negative of myself versus you know, being able to look at okay what was going on that. That was leading me to that behavior you know what you know what was I feeling before I sat down to eat dinner."
14394.0,Patient,um.
527.0,Provider,And are you enjoying anything that you eat Karen.
14394.0,Patient,"No, not really. Okay, now I don't think I do. Okay yeah and you know, like. The dinner that we went to the other night that I had to go out and buy a dress because I can fit into my my dress um. You know, it was wine and roses, which is like executive chefs back there, and you the best of the best. And the food, you know it's gourmet food kind of thing and everyone. Should this is so good, and I was just like. Just food like you know the desert is so good, you know, like I I don't know like what am I missing I guess yeah I just died I don't enjoy I for maybe I mean I don't get. The to enjoy the the savoring tastes the. You know odd taste the pine nuts in that pesto, now I hope it's. Okay, maybe I don't think about it, and I just eat and just eat and don't think about what i'm eating and the tastes that are in it so. yeah but. yeah okay."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and how much, are you feeling like you're even present for food or meals."
14394.0,Patient,"um it depends so i'm. When i'm aware and I have the mindset of okay stay focused and. Then I can eat just a little, so I had to go to a work event where they had like a Barbecue events and. It out a taco truck it was like a Barbecue truck so you go up and then they had this whole. chalkboard like a menu, and I was like oh i'll just take one of the little salads. and Oh no, no, no, this event is catered and we give you everything on that menu. Wait and it was just overflowing."
527.0,Provider,Sure okay.
14394.0,Patient,"let's went sat back down and I showed up late, hoping that the food would be done packing up whatever, but it was, and then I literally. Put the food down in front of me and because. i've had had the mindset of like I actually have the mindset of like i'm not gonna eat until like three o'clock and not eat, but like just one or two strawberries or a bite of those something small and then sit down and have my one big meal of the day, with the family, like. Three four o'clock, but this was so everyone's eating and I just ate a little bit of that either salad I mean it was just a little portion of the salad maybe like a. quarter of a cup of fat and but whatever dressing it had on there and it had pumpkin seeds in there and some sort of. Probably ease whatever I mean probably load, it was calories and. um I took one or two bites of the meat and then I pushed it away as i'm sorry I got a diner dash you're going to go left early. I was fully aware of the food in front of me I didn't want that whole plate. I asked. Like but in the end it was put in front of me and I had the willpower to be like no I don't want that. But I have. People that I knew, you know I didn't want my eating disorder to express myself at that time, maybe like I I kind of kept that hidden like I can. I can control it, I eat see I can do this, even though, like they don't know that i'm battling with this, but in my mind, I was like prove to yourself that you can do this in front of your colleagues. And, but I was able to do it when I sit down with the family, though, and it's like i'm with comfortable people I I can. i'm aware, but I can just eat anything."
527.0,Provider,In are you even connected with the family during mealtime.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah so we do that that's one of our things that I insist on is going to sit down and we're going to eat together and how was your day what was the best thing of your day what was the worst. Okay, and in what are you grateful for, so we we go through all that with everybody i'm. haven't done it for a while, but I started it up again and we would just sit down and eat we didn't ask how your day was but. i'm starting that. My family is really trying to help me the best they can, but I don't think they understand. How to help me, maybe so. My little one just heat course he six me love sugar, so my instigator teenage girl will okay little brother get in the car i'll take you to go get ice cream and they came back with like two big things of ice cream and my daughter. He I can't see that you have to move it move it out to your hide it in the freezer so I don't see it. put it in the freezer in the garage out of sight out of mind, like, I cannot see that ice cream, otherwise I will want it she's like okay mom you know kind of like blew me off typical stuff right so like no i'm like telling you like, please. She didn't do it, and not because she was like i'm not going to do that she just probably just forgot right because it's not something I asked her to do all the time. She can. Look at the freezer there's ice cream and it's just staring at me and i'm like well there it is so like i've been and then I say asked my husband like it's really important to me that, like we sit down and eat together so like you only meal, we found his his dinner but yesterday. I instead of just. Freezing I made a salad and. I dish it out and said let's eat lunch will okay so him and I sat down at the table and. I didn't want to start eating until he was ready, we got up to go do something and I was just sitting there. Okay, like. Here I am at this table all by myself with this food in front of me."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Be here like I have nobody here to. help me hold myself accountable. Okay, and not that you'd be. You know, like watching everything i'm doing, but it makes me aware like Okay, I need somebody to sit here with me and talk to me why eat so i'm not like. Just eating eating eating."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah."
14394.0,Patient,"i'm just sitting there and it felt like five minutes is probably only like a minute, but i'm like oh my God I gotta. Okay, like salad in the in the refrigerator. And I thought i'm just going to wait for him i'm just going to go back to my work and wait for him and then couple minutes later he's like what happened, I thought we were going to lunch together, I go I can't sit at the table for myself with food isn't. Okay, I was like I just can't do that and he's like. Oh. yeah totally understanding my husband more than probably cuz i'm when I came back home from the clinic when I didn't step on the scale at all so super super scared. I was just going to close my eyes that's usually what I do like don't tell me just going to close my eyes just write it down I don't want to know."
527.0,Provider,yeah okay.
14394.0,Patient,"I looked and it was 142 and I I kept it together and I kept my emotions in check and I got through that and I got home and my husband said how was and I just broke down and just cried and. So mad at myself, because I let myself get that disgusting at 142 and so he he just helped me, and I think he's any of how difficult it is for me. So okay um he's a recovering alcoholic. Okay he's gone through this so he knows like cuz I do kind of look at it, as like. An addiction shouldn't be categorized, it is an addiction. Whether it's. Alcohol or food or whatever people are addicted to exercising. Yes, so to me it's just a straight up addiction and then you have your under underneath it so like I feel like I still have to go through the steps that like he did when he was you know going to a and so. Okay, but I don't want to bring up that was him like I understand I know you understand, because you went through with your alcoholism, but I do kind of feel like I want to somehow St like I don't keep alcohol in the House if I do it's in the garage in the. In the in the refrigerator in their garage like you know, whatever people come over and want to be here you go it's probably six months old but it's. You know, still here and I don't hardly ever drink so. Maybe a glass of wine or something if we got to dinner and but. I keep that visually away from him so he's not tempted and. How do I say. We can't have food in the House."
527.0,Provider,"Because yeah yeah and exactly I mean that. That is a very good example of you know the difference in those addictions Karen you know you can live without alcohol, you know you but you can't live without food. Right, you know, and so that that is the hard part I think there's probably some areas that he can probably relate to and empathize with. But yeah it's it's yeah it's it's different though yeah with with eating disorders yeah how long now were you guys together kieran when he was drinking and in. got sober."
14394.0,Patient,"The first like maybe three months, and then I basically was like. Either the alcohol goes or I go. Okay, he went to a and. And he hasn't drink at since then. One was accidental he didn't know he was drinking an alcoholic beer thought it was non alcoholic can eat. Okay, and he's like oh she's so good, the best non alcoholic beer i've had and then he looked in it was. So many he could put it away so um, but that was like an accident but i'm hasn't had anything since he's he's gone through the Program."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah and how, so how long's that been now that he's been sober."
14394.0,Patient,Like seven years. Okay ish something like that.
527.0,Provider,yeah okay okay yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Because, and I. Maybe eight years, something like that."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay. yeah So what are you what are you think would be most helpful for him to understand at this point.
14394.0,Patient,"i'm of that I can't have the food around I can't see you eat it I can't smell it I can't see it I can't know you're eating it. When I was doing the Bikini competition, I was just like so strict and focused and i'm only eating this amount of food at this time I mean i'd set my alarm, so I knew to eat um. And I would say you guys could be like Oh, we just want pizza okay um i'm not going to be home until this time. If you guys are going to get a pizza I don't want it, I don't want to see the empty box of you. That you even had pizza and that's kind of where i'm at right now, like I can't deprive them of these luxuries of these foods in why um, but I just feel like if I see like I saw cookie rappers in the. garbage and I was like oh yeah we have cookies or man they know i'm struggling like superstar lineup with all this and they're eating cookies like. Maybe, be a part of it with me and if you can't which I did um do it when i'm not around your head of the evidence. Okay leftover pizza in the refrigerator throw it away rapid in foil and hide it I don't want to see it I don't want to know it's there. But I. I don't I don't know I know that I know my husband would would probably try my daughter doesn't get it so but she'll she will like when she sees. You know if I just get on her about it, like. hide all that from me. So, but knowing sometimes that they're eating, it is also like. really would like to have some of that no."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's going to be something definitely important to work with key lean on because what i'm hearing is your good foods bad foods. and your food rules and restrictions. yeah. And what kind of messages is that. saying to your family."
14394.0,Patient,That I cannot control myself that. I don't have the willpower I am not strong enough to say no. That i'm weak that i'm just can't give into like all of the bad stuffs okay.
527.0,Provider,"So I want us to kind of watch the language with your family. Because my concern to is. How they're viewing you and then how that impacts, how they feel about themselves like if mom doesn't like herself, then. Maybe i'm not supposed to like myself, because i'm eating these things that mom says are bad."
14394.0,Patient,yeah i'm always telling them it's so bad you're eating that you're eating they're ready for you to bed oh my gosh I mean i'm always on them about it.
527.0,Provider,Okay okay what's that like to know the messages that you're sending.
14394.0,Patient,"So. Before when I was like doing herbalife and that's what I did all the time to my clients like I you know, take a picture what you're eating and send it to me oh gosh there's a. White potato on your plate, it should be sweet potato or you know you got white rice on there should be brown rice and that's a lot of. A lot of sugar, so I was like doing that, with. My and. That doesn't stop i'm calling me, you know, like my daughter heights her candy. because she when she knows that if I find it i'm either going to eat it or two of you know, oh my gosh you just ate all that sugar. Okay, you haven't even gotten out of bed today, and you haven't showered in two days, three I don't even know you know and. She gets out of bed to eat and then goes back to bed and watches TV so she's not like working and i'm telling her like you don't do any kind of exercising at all and you're eating all this terrible stuff, and this is me talking to her. she's depressed she's she's. I mean. be like I feel like my actions and my words have pushed her down that road."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah this definitely is impacted you know when you think about eating disorders, they definitely impact the whole family whether. You know you're consciously aware of it, but you know just the messages the APP you know the behaviors the actions i'm not blaming you at all care and. it's certainly something that you've been struggling with for a while and and just looking at the. You know the work that you were in for so long, just how that approach was and how much that even played into how you feel about yourself to I mean what was it like for you to hear those messages constantly and be saying those things like."
14394.0,Patient,"Oh. first thought i'm helping you i'm making you aware. calories how to count calories i'm making you aware of how to look at the nutrition guide on the food i'm making you aware of the difference of. Good sugars and bad sugars, like, I felt like I was helping and that was when I was you know thought I was healthy um and trying to stay on that route, but now I when I do it. I just feel like a hypocrite basically i'm telling her not to eat, sugar and I go and. drive to the store for a box and milk duds and haven't eaten before I get home right you just."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. What, what do you want to do in regards to addressing things with the family, I mean, obviously. You know it's complicated. In so how much you share with with the kids versus you know just working on yourself and. Internally, working and and and with your husband. Because I think it is you know how do we shift the family dynamics here when somebody's struggling with an eating disorder and body image and the messages that have you know kind of been laid out like what do you think a good kind of fresh approach. Without sharing a lot of details of how you're struggling like how, what do you think you would want to share with the with the family to. me."
14394.0,Patient,"And my daughter's 17 so. i'm not and we have a very close relationship, I mean we talk about everything and anything and so i'm not uncomfortable sitting down with her and saying and I have said to her like. Look at what eating bad has done to me like look at how what's like use me as a learning experience and don't do what I am doing and. You know I have sat down and talked to her about it, but as for like. them I think what I have to do is not. say the words of. hey I have this eating disorder helped me, I have to show them. In actions. how serious it is and it's like they've seen me all eat like they know I can eat so and that's that's not the kind of action and I need to show I I think I just have to show them like. That I can push the food away that I, you know need to focus more on what i'm eating I did ask my husband yesterday. or day before, whatever it was I remember um. I it would help me if we played it the food and put it in front of me. And not. The big bowl with the serving."
527.0,Provider,Like the family style.
14394.0,Patient,"Right yeah because. You played it yourself like I can make this, we had a tortellini the other night and scope and another scoop and another scoop and it was just there, so I said I can't have food. In front of me I need it played it and then even when you're done cooking. That food has to be put away and like covered and put in refrigerator if there's leftovers, and even like when I cook I I even do the dishes to where the only dishes you have or just the dishes that you're eating with. And so the kitchen is clean i'm not going back into the kitchen for another half hour 45 minutes and eating the leftovers, so I. Make it I think it's really going to help me if we could plate, the food and then you know someone tried to portion it small but I mean that's all we sat down yesterday and the big thing crust pizza and my cauliflower pizza sitting on the table. Okay, where, if I just had two pieces in front of me I probably would you say those two pieces, and I mean I don't know, maybe, maybe I would have maybe I wouldn't I don't."
527.0,Provider,"Know sure you, but I."
14394.0,Patient,"kind of felt like when we sat down and I saw the pizza there as like. Okay. Okay, but I didn't want to say anything because. I don't know I mean I don't know why I didn't say anything, maybe Maybe it was just like Oh, this is how you eat pizza you put it on the table, like this yeah I don't know yeah yeah."
527.0,Provider,what's your what's your feelings with food right now.
14394.0,Patient,"it's a love hate relationship. I love food, but I hate what it does, to me, and how it makes me feel into joy, the way I eat food I don't. It to me it's just. Like I used to feel like it's just food like you live. You eat not to live like you have whatever that saying is. Like I don't want to live and have my whole life surround it and what's what's for breakfast where we're going for dinner what's like always dude I just want to oh it's just food. No biggie."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
14394.0,Patient,And now I feel like its food like bring it all on us.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, how much time of the day, how much time throughout the day Karen do you think about food."
14394.0,Patient,all the time.
527.0,Provider,Okay 100% of the time okay.
14394.0,Patient,"Right, well, I wonder what i'm going to eat like right now and not that it's like always on my mind, but it's there. Oh i'm driving home, I wonder what i'm going to eat when I get home soon as I get in the door, I got home i'm going to just see what sarah's to eat. and always always there okay. Then the next me fighting with my thoughts about it, like stop thinking about it. stop thinking about food just forget about it, keep busy busy keep busy, and I think that's why the little crack pill that they gave me a because, unlike zooming around everywhere, I stay busy. And if I stay busy, then I don't eat, but then, when I get fun of whatever i'm doing I go back in the House and go right to the fridge I went up to Fred. I just got done cleaning out the gutters or whatever, and I deserved like this food i'm okay cuz I worked, you know burn some calories so I buy it that way."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14394.0,Patient,So.
527.0,Provider,"yeah, what do you so if you're not thinking about food, what do you feel most of the day. What kind of feelings, do you have most of the day."
14394.0,Patient,"It depends what's going on. I got stuff going on at work and it's stressful and then like now, I have one piece of document that I need to get over the title company in order for this home to fund so we everybody gets paid. And, and having some huge issues with this one document and. I went to bed stressed about it, I woke up stressed about it, I until it's done i'm going to focus on that or it might be like. Things that are coming up like this weekend. We don't have anything going on but. We just scheduled a little camping trip for the end of September, so you know oh yeah it'd be fun to do that, or you know kind of excited. going there or my birthday is coming up. Oh, you know, do something fun for my birthday um so like that just random thoughts of what's kind of going on in that particular time of the day, or of whatever's going on in my life at that time."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah any feelings of like loneliness.
14394.0,Patient,um. I don't know because I think i'm okay with loneliness like i'm a kb my myself. i'm okay having that time to myself um. I don't know I don't know I even understand what loneliness is.
527.0,Provider,Any sadness.
14394.0,Patient,I don't think so I don't know I don't think so.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, and you mentioned anger, so do you feel anger often."
14394.0,Patient,"With myself okay. We gotta get mad at myself like, why did you eat that whole bowl of ice cream. That kind of. Okay, all the all the time. Okay, and then, because I know i've. been healthy or not healthy but. I know how to do it and I just don't so i'm not totally disappoint myself every day."
527.0,Provider,what's what's your husband's views on food and body image and. Things like that.
14394.0,Patient,"The same Okay, is to 66 one to 60 and um he's always saying like. You can use my tell me as a pillow and not be a good Santa and you know I kind of makes crack some jokes about."
527.0,Provider,It okay.
14394.0,Patient,"But he's not happy with with the way he is either because he's always you know I gotta put on my fat shirt again, you know, like almost identical to me. He has like I would kind of like talking to him to about like I now understand, like my brain has been from what i'm getting out of whatever i'm from you talking to you guys. yeah DARD my brain and he did the same thing, because he did the I did the Bikini competition and he did the men's whatever they do yeah. He the same thing happened to him right afterwards, he he can't turn it off and I so i've been talking to him about it, like we have starved our brains, so we kind of made it to a point where like. When we do they do yesterday it was about three hours and I hadn't eaten anything and i'm like to eat something i'm like I don't want to start my brain I eat couple of days or something. No star brain, you know and Michael. will remind each other so she's going through exactly what i'm going through. Okay um I don't think it's affecting him as much because he does at least play if he doesn't he plays it off like pretty good but he's okay he's not 100% Okay, but he's. More okay than I am about it Okay, and on his side he's more worried about he's got it that heart about liver. Okay, yes, health issues and that's more of his concern of like he's afraid he's gonna just one day just not wake up because of this, whatever else issues he has so. Okay we're on is concerned, but I know that he struggles just I do."
527.0,Provider,Okay. Because i'm wondering if just. Trying to eliminate the negative self talk. Because how much does. That impact you when he's making comments about himself. yeah it was sense.
14394.0,Patient,"you'll more comfortable that Okay, he loves me even at 142 he met me at 124 now and just deflect it switched to do um so it makes me feel like. he's okay with it and and he is he's gonna he's like I don't care if you're 200 pounds i'm going to love you and and i'm like that's really sweet they you say that, but you just gave me permission to get to let myself get up to 200 pounds. Oh, can I. But I don't want him to say you're fat you're ugly either so. yeah he does, and by just sometimes he just holds me."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Oh, I need when he knows it so."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah it's definitely. going to take some some time to change all of this, too, and be patient with it. You know I I think if we can start with just eliminating a lot of that negative self talk and just. You know redirecting that for you, you know, for both of you. And, and I think just helping the kids to also not hear that as well. And I know that you share, you know you're close with your daughter, and you share a lot of things, but there may be some areas that we need to just set some better boundaries to. You know that she. You know that she knows you're working on things but doesn't necessarily need to know all the ins and outs of it either. And and helping them, you know and i'm wondering just kind of going back to you know, maybe what the family needs is maybe maybe just saying you know we're going to be making some some changes within the family. That. That i'm getting some help on, and so you know meals may look a little different snacks may look a little different. But but i'm working on some things that are going to be helpful for us as a family and maybe just leaving it as kind of general and vague like that, because. Again it's not like we're going to be healthy, you know it's or have good foods and bad food, you know we're trying to get away from that as far as just kind of normalizing eating habits. Because they've been so disordered for so long and so getting those back more normalized for you guys as a family. yeah."
14394.0,Patient,yeah to start.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i'm wondering to like what it would be like, if you wrote a letter to your eating disorder. What would you say to your eating disorder."
14394.0,Patient,Probably some pretty hateful things. Okay okay. It has ruined me it's ruined my life. Okay um it's changed me um. yeah it'd be pretty mad.
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah yeah. yeah and that's normal place to be Karen so i'm glad to hear you say that because that is you know it is looking at how much is my eating disorder taken from me. You know what areas has it all impacted that I, maybe didn't even realize, you know and and and or you know how has it impacted my children, you know they're hiding food or sneaking food now and so. Look at how the eating disorder, you know, has challenged their own thoughts and beliefs about food too yeah."
14394.0,Patient,I don't know in. I. It probably be pretty hard for me to write the letter.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14394.0,Patient,don't know. Because I don't feel like. it's fair. Like.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14394.0,Patient,"I believe, like I believe in Karma good things happen to good people. Right to be like I tried to do good all the time. Because like eventually Carmel find me into by being like why me why Why did I do what why Why is this happening to me. Sure, oh. I don't know. I just sometimes just get really upset with myself about it, and sometimes don't want to deal with it and I just. Like like if we talked about it, or something later or whatever, whatever issue comes up. Is what. What are we going to do, like where do you want to look patio furniture, do you want back and. have our styles are so different he's still living in the 90s, and I want trendy I want. You know um he likes to browns I like the grades so like we're completely opposite on that, but I literally will just agree with. Whatever you want because case like this whole experience that has happened to me affects even my everyday decisions like it's not going to matter what I say. i'm not going to tell you really how I feel because I just Oh well, who cares who cares like it's not going to matter what I say, or how I feel or what I what kind of furniture I want in the backyard because. Ultimately. it's going to come down to. you're going to make that decision, whatever you want like. So I have. Just taught myself or tell myself. Let him do what he wants and deal with that later and you're being a good person by doing that. Okay, so because you're saying do whatever you want, even though i'm i'm unhappy. Then there's brown furniture out in the backyard, but he's happy so because that's me being a good person because he's happy. That Karma will find me and do something kind something kind will happen to me and then. I go back to. Oh there's. ice cream in the fridge there it is there's my good kindness thing that I get."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14394.0,Patient,"So I. Look, for these things that. Do something good for you somebody award myself. Because this. What is in front of me and it's supposed to be here this is supposed to happen to me i'm supposed to be standing here at this moment, looking at this ice cream I 100% believe in that. That. Things are happening all the time for reasons. And we don't know the reason, sometimes, but you know reason, so I do try to figure out a way and how to Okay, even though i'm like completely mad about this mad at myself for getting this way. discussed it at this whole situation i'm angry i'm you know everything that just I shouldn't be and get angry at. The. The just the disorder the binge eating the whole that I let myself get to that so. I just get. Mad at the. The whole umbrella of it. yeah so like when I had a friend, she. miscarried like nine times. Okay, and. watching her go through all I was like oh my. God, just when my dad died emetic God, I was mad at God for. forever I don't even know. Sure, why would God like this happen Why am I. supposed to have this eating disorder. Why is God in this happens to me i'm a good person. You know. yeah so I just feel like. I just get Why would Why is this happening to me. Why did I get chosen for this and. Then eventually down the road, I can say this is why, maybe, maybe not but. I don't feel that i'm it's fair."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"So then, sometimes I feel like i'm not going to be good. i'm going to say no, I don't want to do that and then i'm like that for like a day or two right. Okay, we don't want that. No i'm it's like we had the House painted a couple maybe a year or two ago and it's not it's not my house it's his house it's in his name, he paid for it. I came. After the fact that, when he bought the House so okay I didn't even have a say, of what kind of house this I walked in, and this is your House. And so I. got like when it came down to the color of the House guide it doesn't matter because it's not my house. So he's like no I want you to pick a color and I was like whatever is pick whatever colors and I don't every time I try not to say look at these. colors and I don't like the color of it, and then, finally, like couple months ago I was like. I my bucket had overflow just. i'm just gonna start telling people how I feel about things and i'm like I don't like the color of the House I hated every time I look at it, I eat it it's like oh it's so ugly but. Getting pull your car in the garage garage door to get in the House, you don't see outside you to see the inside i'm telling you know do get my moments, where I do say like. I don't like this, but the majority of the time I just stay quiet and I just it is and it's supposed to be that way because there's reasons for everything."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay. Well i'm definitely going to push you to find your voice Karen because. It is important.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah I know it is, and then I you know, will be able to. show my daughter, also because she she keeps it all in she she finds ways and how not to cause issues. And I know that i'm teaching for that. I mean i'm even an instigator when it comes to that like she didn't want to go see bad he's in Wisconsin and she goes and sees them for four weeks out of every year for weeks that's it. And I I don't tell her oh I don't tell her yes, I say whatever you want to do well this last summer, she didn't want to go. Tell him, you don't want to go I can't I can't tell him I don't want to go. Okay well let's figure out a way and we like came up with this scheme, the two of us have Tom you got a job do this do that and make sure you loop, so we our stories are straight, you know because I, even though I say you know just tell him no it's you know you just keep that. feeling of okay did it and um you know she can't she won't say no to him, but she can easily break up with her boyfriend. Like no big deal she can do that, and then, but on the other hand, like, I can help her do that to like just take some notes or do this, but when it comes to like her dad or so, but she doesn't stand up for herself and neither do I. find ways on how not to do it. Okay, but I know you're right, I do I need to express sell floor and not let people walk all over me. Okay, I just want I want people to like me. And i'm. not going to if I say nope that's. For this is how I like it so."
527.0,Provider,yeah how are you feeling today because I just want to check in before we wrap up today.
14394.0,Patient,"i'm day it's a new day. And I will continue to try to not eat and to stay positive. And I have it in my mind that I need to try to incorporate some exercising. Anything just like walk around the block after dinner or something so it's on my mind, which is one step closer to where it was. Okay last week okay."
527.0,Provider,Did you get some direction from killeen as far as meals and snacks.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah she did she gave me. Okay, she wants me to eat three food groups, every time I eat. it's and I was overindulging like I was trying to eat three food groups i'm going to eat this. This. sandwich and this big this big thing of yogurt and and I was overdoing it so, then I told her that i'm trying to eat. Three food groups every three hours so like at eight i'll have a half a peach and then three hours later that's my fruit group and then three hours later, I might to like couple bites of like a bagel or something that's migraines. Then I might have like a half of potato or something there's me my carb and then my protein a little couple little cashews or something there's my protein, so I eat the food groups I just don't do three at a time, I do do. So i'm trying to do that."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14394.0,Patient,"Be to do sit down and eat a breakfast and sit down and eat lunch and like I i'm trying, but I I can't."

527.0,Provider,"Okay that's okay that's okay we're we'll get there. yeah there was just going to it's going to it's a big adjustment it's a big shift and change to what you've been doing and we're really challenging. The thought processes and feel you know, bringing a lot of feelings, to the surface, too, so. Definitely being kind to yourself, I want you to really try to try to counter some of those negative thoughts with being kind to yourself that it's not an all or nothing it's if I messed up it doesn't screw the whole day up it's okay what's my next right step to take for myself. And I can restart at any point during the day."
14394.0,Patient,yeah that's what I need to figure out how to do.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. And maybe it's maybe it's putting some sticky notes over you know, on refrigerator in the bathroom just as gentle reminders of you know, food is fuel for my body or you know be kind to yourself, or you know, whatever you feel like might be some good affirmations to remind yourself."
