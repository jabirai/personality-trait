416.0,Provider,Much got going on.
14138.0,Patient,I got work all week until Sunday.
416.0,Provider,Oh wow. yeah. Do you. work long hours.
14138.0,Patient,And about four and a half hours a night it's for a. Local baseball team here.
416.0,Provider,Oh that's right yeah I remember you're the concessions is that.
14138.0,Patient,"Right yeah everything sessions, I worked yesterday at their arena, the Convention Center we have here for a they call it Stockton con it's like comic con or whatever. I was supposed to be there Saturday, but I woke up Saturday, and I just couldn't get myself motivated go to work because I knew there's gonna be a lot of people there and the anxiety kicked in."
416.0,Provider,So you just kind of froze huh.
14138.0,Patient,"I froze and I called my boss, and I said i'm not going to make it today, they were understandable about it but. And then I I went to work yesterday, and I was you know it wasn't many people there yesterday they had 4000 on Saturday, and they had about maybe 2000 or less yesterday."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay. So, how did you manage yesterday."
14138.0,Patient,"I did, I think I did pretty well. I you know I kept myself busy where I wasn't because I worked a cash register to always helping the customers. Instead of just like. Just helping like moving around the healthy and seeing everybody."
416.0,Provider,If I just like.
14138.0,Patient,I feel like I focus on one thing. Well i'm there i'm okay.
416.0,Provider,i'm good okay so it's about. it's that sounds like that's for your way of like keeping your brain from spinning out a little bit right. Okay. Can you remind me did he ever talk to you about attending groups.
14138.0,Patient,"I have yeah I have it, this Wednesday at two o'clock."
416.0,Provider,Okay you're going to attend groups okay good.
14138.0,Patient,"yeah cuz, then I got to talk to him again because. he's got a refill my pills because i'm down to my last five."
416.0,Provider,Okay okay good all right yeah he should be able to take care of any refills in the group usually that's how it works.
14138.0,Patient,yeah cuz I talked last week.
416.0,Provider,I think was last week.
14138.0,Patient,"After group just this week, he said we'll get your pills started He also mentioned something about a new pill to take, and I thought he was going to. put it in for Terry put it into."
416.0,Provider,That was weird. i'm having like pop ups on my screen all of a sudden.
14138.0,Patient,home system.
416.0,Provider,That okay sorry go ahead.
14138.0,Patient,He said something about a new prescription and I thought he was going to send it over to CBS but they don't have anything yet.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, well, he should be able to answer all that for you, on Wednesday."
14138.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"So last time we talked we talked about you, keeping track your thoughts doing like a journal were you able to do that."
14138.0,Patient,"A little bit and. The days that. A day I forced myself to go to work. I was like okay i'm just gonna hurry up and get there. and it's just the thought of I don't I don't know what crowd to expect. If there's gonna be like a lot of people like on Saturday morning when I got it I knew there was gonna be a lot of people, because I know I know these events are huge. And I think that's what kicked in my anxiety really bad on Saturday. But. slowly. slowly starting to get back to normal."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So it sounds like there's some thoughts going on around. Is the crowd going to be too big, is it going to feel overwhelming how's it going to look, am I going to be okay what other thoughts go through your head in those situations."
14138.0,Patient,"that's basically it or you know if. Am I going to eat something or you know cuz I have a badge to see if I eat something wrong. It makes it doesn't grant my stomach sometimes. So I kind of eat something light before you have to go to work, I try not to eat at work."
416.0,Provider,So what's the fear around that.
14138.0,Patient,Just knowing that. I have a bathroom close by.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so worrying like what if I can't get to the bathroom on time."
14138.0,Patient,"yeah like when i'm in the car trying to go to work and I have you know. If I have to go where you know, is there a place where I can stop or am I going to get there in time before I you know, I have to go. And it's in it goes all back in my is it."
416.0,Provider,Mr yeah well it actually your thoughts are causing your anxiety.
14138.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"That sounds crazy but it's true. it's not that caused the exact right. Yes, so um. I am going to have a you do a little bit of a thought record, let me kick my dog out of the room hold on one second. hey actually go. into that. A little girls. Okay, so I am gonna have you do a thought record this week. Okay, and i'll walk you through it before we stop it and how familiar, are you with cognitive behavioral therapy and like kind of the cycle that we go through."
14138.0,Patient,And this is all new to me.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, then let me, let me show ya. Okay hold on one second i'm going to show you the. and Here we go think of it pretty simply. A triangle. or a circle either way. Let me just get this image up and i'm going to share my screen with you really quick. Okay. So here we go. share my screen. Okay, can you see this okay."
14138.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,"Alright, so this is why i'm having you do the thought internal because our thoughts are what create our feelings and lot of times we're not even aware of our thoughts. So the usually there's something that happens we're going along in life, and something happens like this something might be, I have to take a drive and go to work."
14138.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"And there's an event coming up that's going to happen there so, then you have the thoughts. The thoughts are what create the feelings, the emotions come up right. Feelings then create the behavior. And then the behavior sort of reinforces that thought. which then creates more thoughts right, and then you that's when you mean battle that so the thoughts and these thoughts over here can be. Often, and when we have a lot of anxiety or depression and we are what we call cognitive distortions somebody else called in one of my other patients that called them brain weasels which is like my favorite thing. that's exactly what they are right, so we get these brain weasels these weird twisted thoughts that come into our head. That that are probably not all that logical, but our brain really believes them. they're important to our brain right. When that thought those thoughts those twisted thoughts, then create the emotions that then determine our behavior so for you like what you're describing you have these thoughts like today's going to be a big event. it's going to be there's gonna be too many people there i'm going to be anxious all day it sounds totally miserable I can't face that what if I can't get to a bathroom my stomach's going to be upset. The feelings are worry anxiety, what else."
14138.0,Patient,i'm. Just story that's the worries the.
416.0,Provider,Two right here you're in there anymore.
14138.0,Patient,hey.
416.0,Provider,Do I hear fear in there anywhere.
14138.0,Patient,A little bit.
416.0,Provider,"Right, so those thoughts create those feelings. which then causes you to be like. My brain is done too much i'm staying in bed i'm calling in sick. Yes, right. And there's physical symptoms that go along with all of this, too. Right, so your physical symptoms will get worse, with all of this, too. Right mm hmm Okay, this is where cognitive behavioral therapy comes in, because we like to take opportunities to challenge, some of those thoughts. Right. Okay, changing the way we think about these things can actually interrupt this cycle so first let's start by i'm going to stop sharing for a second we're going to start by identifying. Those thoughts right, this is where the thought journal comes in, so i'll have you do that i'm going to share. A list of cognitive distortions with you on second. here's some common ones, let me find them. Oh yeah, this is a good. Alright i'm going to share my screen with you again. Here we go. Okay. So cognitive distortions are irrational thoughts. Brain weasels. They came from our emotions right. Everyone has these to some degree, but when they happen all the time, or when they happen persistently they can be really harmful so let's run through some of these and see if you can connect see if any of these are true for you. So the first one is magnification or minimization which is just like exaggerating or minimizing the importance of some event and. So either like your achievements are totally unimportant like oh i'm just nothing, no matter what I achieve i'm always going to be nothing or that your mistakes like are the worst things in the whole entire world."
14138.0,Patient,not really.
416.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I haven't seen that new yet yet either catastrophizing is seeing only the worst possible outcomes of any situation so that's like. If I drive to work for sure i'm going to need to use the bathroom there's not going to be any, and this is all the horrible things that are going to happen after that."
14138.0,Patient,That. Probably goes along with like if we. When we leave out to go to Reno sometimes that's what happens.
416.0,Provider,"yep. overgeneralization is another common one, making broad interpretations from a single event and. So, like you, you had an awkward conversation with someone, and so it means you're always just so super socially awkward right it's not just like oh that was just one awkward conversation that was weird it's i'm so awkward i'm always so awkward Why am I so awkward right."
14138.0,Patient,I don't think that's me.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good magical thinking. And the belief that actual influence and related situations and so like i'm a good person so bad things should never happen to me."
14138.0,Patient,"I tell myself that I, you know i've done this before I can do this, so this shouldn't you know. It shouldn't happen."
416.0,Provider,"I don't hear that as magical thinking that's that's a like a belief in yourself that you can get better that's a little different. What you're describing this healthier. So personalization the belief that. Any one of us is responsible for, is it for events that are like outside of our control so like my mom is always so upset she'd be fine if only I helped her more. About jumping to conclusions interpreting the meaning of a situation with little or no evidence. So there's mind reading like interpreting some beliefs of others without adequate evidence and. This is a good example of this one is like you're walking by a stranger and the stranger has like a nasty look on their face and you think that look on their face must be about you Oh, they must hate me. Like they don't even know you and they're probably just weird fortune telling is the expectation that a situation will turn out badly without any evidence of that. So it's like assuming that things are always going to go wrong."
14138.0,Patient,"Well, think so."
416.0,Provider,"Okay emotional reason reasoning is the assumption that emotions reflect to the way things really are so if you feel like a bad friend, you must be a bad friend or. If you feel in that moment, because feelings change all the time right, and so, if you feel in that moment, like you're always going to have anxiety. That you must just be an anxious person and there's no way out of that."
14138.0,Patient,Just. it's. I was never been really this bad.
416.0,Provider,"Good okay. So disqualifying the positive, which is recognizing only the negative aspects of the situation, while ignoring all the positive stuff."
14138.0,Patient,"Maybe, yes, maybe, no."
416.0,Provider,A little bit of that how about some should statements. I should always be friendly I should have been better at this I shouldn't be sick I shouldn't have these struggles.
14138.0,Patient,"Yes, sometimes."
416.0,Provider,"For the all or nothing thinking thinking, an absolute such as always never i'm never good enough i'm always like this."
14138.0,Patient,She goes.
416.0,Provider,"No okay. Okay, good so you have some of these, but not a terribly huge overwhelming amount so that's good. um. So I think we'll start with a thought journal because that'll help us understand more of what is triggering and the intense anxiety Spikes you get. around you know. Driving and getting out in the world, I think you're aware of some of your thoughts, but my guess is that there's going to be some in there, but you're not aware of. Okay yeah. Sound okay. i'll share with you in a little bit. and I was going to share with you have resources it's actually a video that I have on. anxiety in the brain. But it's up to you, if you want. If you want to see it it's about Do you know what neuro plasticity is."
14138.0,Patient,Real.
416.0,Provider,"And neuro plasticity is the so our brains operate like like wires right so there's billions of little. We call them synapses in our brain right so like these chemical signatures over here in these chemicals over here they sort of wire together. And that helps us that's what creates our thoughts and our behaviors and our emotions and stuff so when our chemistry is really off that's why we put people on medication right to kind of fix those synapses. Right and the way they fire and but the other thing that does that is behaviors so when we have a behavior for a really long time, and when we have a certain response to something that. happens for a really long time or even a short amount of time, but. long enough for our brain to get used to it, we sort of developed these connections in our brain these synapses and I always think of them as like rats on a road like an old dirt road. And the you know, the more you drive over it, meaning the more you have a certain behavior certain thought or a certain feeling and the deeper those rats get on the road. Right it gets harder and harder to get out of them, so you have this very strong connections in your brain so neuro plasticity is about taking a different paths. And it's really hard to get out of those ruts right because I want to go there, but once you get out of them, then it's a rough road, the first few times, but the more you drive in that same healthier path the smoother that road gets in the easier it is to travel, so it makes sense. Yes, sort of how our brains work in terms of neuro plasticity. So I can share that video with you as well. If you think it's time to watch it."
14138.0,Patient,"and jam, is it I don't know, is there a link that you can send me that I can watch it. At a later date yeah that's pretty mean i'll i'll email it yeah."
416.0,Provider,"i'll email that in the worksheet to you, so you can watch it on your own time that'll be your homework. So um how are you feeling about works tonight."
14138.0,Patient,"Well, I don't work tonight. Definitely tonight is actually my first night and my Bowling league after this my first night back after Kobe."
416.0,Provider,hi i'm feeling.
14138.0,Patient,"That i'm. i'm excited but I know i'm going to probably be sore. Because I haven't thrown a ball, since a year and a half. I mean I. Might Kate what I did call in sick on Saturday I didn't get up and go watch my daughter bowl. and Normally I would have. Normally I couldn't do it, but I wasn't able to go to work, but I was able to get up to go to the Bowling alley to watch your bowl I think it was more excitement because I get to see my friends and stuff that I haven't seen. Any year and a half. So."
416.0,Provider,How long were you Bowling before covered head was this like a long time thing that you do.
14138.0,Patient,And I sort of bullying. When I got married i've been married for. gosh almost 18 years.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14138.0,Patient,I say. I forgot.
416.0,Provider,I think you said 15 months time but.
14138.0,Patient,Maybe I got no I was i've been on xanax for 15.
416.0,Provider,Oh.
14138.0,Patient,that'd be 18 years in October next month. wow and i've been with i've been with my husband for 19.
416.0,Provider,Because they're coming up on a big anniversary here and your do.
14138.0,Patient,um.
416.0,Provider,So is that how you started bawling was with him.
14138.0,Patient,"yeah so see usable he's been bullied since he's been a little kid. And then we got my daughter into doing it, and she she loves it."
416.0,Provider,wow that's so cool.
14138.0,Patient,I think it's just getting you know cuz. My girlfriend that when they you know we used to bowl together she used to call me the social butterfly. Because I was never at my lanes to as my turn to bowl because I was always down talking to somebody.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14138.0,Patient,"And, and when coven hit I think that's when it all went downhill. But that's slowly everything's getting back to normal. let's hope it stays normal. Because they're talking about there's I guess there's under strain coming around to. The virus. But. You know what i'm not letting the virus control me. i've got my backs i've got my shots. and"
416.0,Provider,Get out and do it. yeah.
14138.0,Patient,"But I do. When. When they first started like people's first start going out. I know, as I remember this, because I was in target. And i'm like looking around, and I see all these people were in the masks and stuff you know. This is back before they even mandated the mass thing and. I was like the thoughts in my head was like terrifying because. You know you think of the mask and you think of robberies. So that was."
416.0,Provider,New to the mass comm.
14138.0,Patient,"that's what when I first started doing it when they first start wearing them. I was in target and I had to get out of there because. I was thinking okay there's gonna be a bank robbery. or my big robbery, but you know these guys, they could use, you know, because you don't see their face. But. A couple weeks ago we was in costco. And i've seen a lot of people have asked on. But I put mine on, and I was fine."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
14138.0,Patient,I think you know that I think the master you're gonna be here to stay.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14138.0,Patient,I don't think they're going away anytime soon.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm. And you were were you having trouble before with your mask was it like creating a. Panic issue for you. yeah okay so. I mean that that's even better right you're vaccinated and you're wearing a mask. that's. Good protection.
14138.0,Patient,yeah because all.
416.0,Provider,It.
14138.0,Patient,"was all like i've got friends that refused to get their vaccinate get the vaccine, but you know i'm not gonna hold it against them, everyone has the right to either get it or not. But i'm protecting myself and my family."
416.0,Provider,Tackling. and
14138.0,Patient,"Ever since day one, you know people's all I got people saying you don't want to do that, you don't do that and i'm like well i'm not gonna let this virus control me. i'm gonna be told the virus."
416.0,Provider,"It says a lot about how adaptable you've become that you're able to find right you're you're not being naive about the virus, you know it's serious. And he and you're still finding ways. Especially now that things are opening up a little more you're finding ways to still get what you need right like. How life see your friends do activities you enjoy and to to adapt in ways to do that safely or as safely as possible."
14138.0,Patient,All right.
416.0,Provider,"Now the really healthy adaptation. Especially for someone who struggles with anxiety so much like a lot of people can adopt in that way, so that's that's really great."
14138.0,Patient,yeah. i'm getting there.
416.0,Provider,"what's your favorite part about the Bowling and the like, is there a particular person you're excited to see or just the whole scene."
14138.0,Patient,"it's basically this one exercise it will get besides we're walking all the time at work. But. I just I like this, for I just. Go and have fun and. My bowl of my boyfriend's and. stuff like that so."

416.0,Provider,"Nice savings, or do you have like a crew of people that you play with."
14138.0,Patient,"No, I just go at the fairgrounds. it's. Just I became friends with one of the girls in there. But she goes this. She was five days a week. This they call her the doorbell lady because it's in two separate rooms. And she says next number when. it's when they win and then she rings, the doorbell for them."

Okay i'm gonna. i'm actually going to send you this article that I want you to read, but here we go. share my screen. Can you see that okay it's a little blurry yeah your mom okay so you'll just throughout the week write. Down the situation doesn't have to be like a huge perfect explanation, just like a couple quick notes, so that we can look back on it, you can remember enough for you to remember what it was right. And then names many emotions that come up as possible. And then these sort of any negative or automatic thought that you have. And, and I don't you don't have to do the rest will do the rest together. But just face first three columns if I said, the situation, the emotion and the negative automatic thought that you have.
