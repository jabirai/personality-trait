Like i'm not hearing voices it's just my own. it's my own thought process, just like going crazy and you know, like running at 100 miles per hour all the time."
740.0,Provider,Right yeah that doesn't sound like schizophrenia. I think the assessment was generalized anxiety.
17552.0,Patient,"Okay. have a lot of social anxiety, so that makes sense, like. In front of people or. stuff like that."

740.0,Provider,"Okay okay and that's fine any other addictive type behaviors in the home, like gambling pornography working a lot things like."
17552.0,Patient,"i'm I might I don't know I might be a sex addict i've watched like read about that, like, I definitely I mean I don't know i'm just a guy you know. I like I like."
740.0,Provider,"i'm just you know not your you are a key. Just in your home period I did you see that amongst your mom. Oh, I like OK. OK OK. and growing up deal and how was school for you what was school like."
17552.0,Patient,"It was good. huh think I mean school is the school part was always super hard i'm like looking around like. Like how you know it's like harder for me if it just felt harder for me, you know than other than other people, I had to I have to try a lot harder to focus in on stuff or like I hate writing essays. writing. This you know being out on the playground, and that was the easy part you know. The inside the classroom I just have no interest in when I have no interest in something it's it's just so hard to do that thing. well. But if it's something I really want or like or i'm interested in then it's the easiest thing in the world."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I agree with you i'm the same way honestly nala. yeah um and I think that's just a how. Because domains are released. Different feel good hormones are released when you are doing things that you like. versus it makes it more difficult to do things that you did, basically, you can stay. yeah you don't stick with a lot of it, which is why people can stay on diets too long."
17552.0,Patient,yeah I.
740.0,Provider,"mean honest. When you when you when you feel like you're restricted for something that you like, then it doesn't last long. yeah yeah i'm saying, and so I completely get that did you how far did you complete your education."
17552.0,Patient,"I after high school, I went through like a semester at sea at the Community college by me and I was just like know as a young good it's not for me and then I went to a trade school and I got all my certificates for powerline mechanics. So I was climbing like those telephone Poles all day. And then that that's it so but that's all I need i'm about to go i'm trying to go back to tracking school. But I just don't I don't want to be like you know testing out different medications and stuff while i'm while i'm like driving a big truck so i'm just kind of waiting until I can do that."
740.0,Provider,"So you need. This one I saw that you need your car, you need your life you're a license you're a licensed okay. Okay. Okay that's not bad."
17552.0,Patient,"I have a lot of anxiety about about going because, like and then like I just see stuff on the news where 26 year old male was just sentenced to life in prison for something that wasn't his fault at all, like the brakes failed. On the truck. And four people were killed and I just see that and i'm just like whoa I can't I can't go get this to from feeling. This way. And yeah."
740.0,Provider,"yeah I completely understand, especially with your your social anxiety is going to be kind of difficult to travel. to drive when you have we're anxious like that, because I mean God forbid, you don't want the situation to happen to you to where you're driving a truck you have a panic attack and I was saying, you lose control over. You i'm saying yeah so I respect the fact that you are willing or that you have kind of hot it's not it's not it just kind of postpone does not stopped. That you've postponed that desire, so that you can get the help that you need, I think that's very admirable of you some people will try to do it and then fail and then come get the hill. And you know I think that's really, really good so that's fine we'll work on it you're not the only patient that I have one of the reasons why a patient, you know if I only client that I have i'm that has social anxiety right. yeah but this one i'm gonna say did. You you're not gonna put in the work we just gonna be sitting here, looking at each other."
17552.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Does that make sense, because I can only give you. What I can give you, but I can't do it for you, you get i'm saying. yeah and a lot of times we have a lot of time with social anxiety is the same thing that I tell some of my clients who experienced social anxiety is there now, mind you, I would never take you too far too fast. Right it's always little by little until you can hit. In time okay so that's just me right that's just how I do it because the thing about it is, how are you going to grow out of something if you're not exposed to it. Does that make sense. yeah now if at any point you don't agree it's Okay, I completely understand like I say if any point it feels like it's too much of what i'm asked you, is too much, and all that kind of stuff. And just let me know it's a nice i'm not ready and that's fine I don't push you."
17552.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,Until I have to push. let's keep going so I have you did you ever serve in our military.
17552.0,Patient,"No, I did not."
740.0,Provider,Do you have any financial or any legal. Any legal issues you're currently concerned about.
17552.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so. I mean, like my. Like like crazy thoughts, like the stuff that isn't real. Things that they're there could be but but I don't. yeah I don't think so."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and we're. And we'll deal without we would deal with all of those things right, we definitely do that um are you currently in a relationship. Yes, Okay, do you have any children."
17552.0,Patient,I do not.
740.0,Provider,Okay How long have you been in a relationship for.
17552.0,Patient,"Like. I don't know, three years. We don't have like an actual date. That yes."
740.0,Provider,"It does average for you it's. funny yeah. I mean that's fine I don't remember that I don't remember the date they may my thoughts talking before we got married. I did not been on for a long time that's all I know. So Okay, and you say right now, you still live with mom. So lily so you tell me what are some things you want to work on, while you're hearing treatment, let me pull up my little list I like to write it down because I don't want to forget."
17552.0,Patient,um what do I want to work on.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17552.0,Patient,"Like. I want to not not have these thoughts like that you know all my best friends and everybody like. Just thinks i'm like just a horrible person they've been like plotting against me to like kill me, and all this stuff."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so you so basically you're having thoughts of. You basically have a target. The guys out the queue you."
17552.0,Patient,"yeah like i'm i'm with my work like. i'm catering like movie sets or commercials TV shows and stuff and like at some point, sometimes I can't stop like. Thinking like that, like you know i'm the show, and like all these people are like like secretly like you know, like filming me and they're just like making fun of me, and like doing these things like it's so crazy but it's so real. it's just that's why I think the schizophrenia makes sense."
740.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah now that you say that absolutely.
17552.0,Patient,But I don't. see things or hallucinate I don't know.
740.0,Provider,"I mean definitely. Best not always gets a friend, he is. It you don't have to see things or. You don't have to see things for it's a fit, but the fact that you have."
17552.0,Patient,"And I was a la county lifeguard for seven eight years and I started not being able to like go into work, because I thought people think i'm like a pedophile or something like that. When i'm giving kids like swimming lessons and like I don't want any like i'm disgusted by that you know, like but it's just like me thinking other people. think that because of what you have to do bathroom checks and stuff like that you have to walk into the bathroom and as i'm walking in the bathroom like are these people thinking i'm. You know what like that i'm trying to look at them there's this one time, where one of my coworkers he has two younger brothers and one of them is named dylan and then he was changing and though the one that's a little older than him. was just like dylan dylan you know and i'm like look I had to like turn and his younger brother was changing and it's. so short that like if i'm looking at him i'm looking at his whole body I can't just like look keep my eyes, like I like a level, you know or something so. Then it's so, then I had like dreams, or something and shit about like. About. Like that that everybody at work and everybody around me thinks i'm a pedophile and it was affecting my relationship with my niece and nephews and like being able to go take care of them and stuff. and it's it's really hard."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
17552.0,Patient,"cuz I know I know who I am and I know. That I don't like those things are want those things. But I can still live a pretty normal life at the same time, like I don't know I just have to like shut it off every time that like like my brain trying to think about it."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm So do you know how to shut it off or.
17552.0,Patient,"It just seems like. I just like look around like you know presently and like then go like do something else you know, or like. um yeah I wouldn't be able to like keep a job, like not be in jail, right now, or like not be like crazy homeless drug addict if I wasn't able to like if I didn't know how to like conquering or like you know be stronger than than these other like mentally stronger than these things."
740.0,Provider,But you're still struggling with you.
17552.0,Patient,"yeah but it's just getting to a point where, where I do need some help with it. And you know my sister was just telling me that, like from like 18 to 26 is when schizophrenia really starts to show and i'm 26 now. So. yeah when I was just reading on. doing a lot of reading, you know I know it's not good for a patient to do reading on it, and you know self diagnose and all that kind of stuff but um it it kind of makes sense, everything that. Everything that I was reading. You know I know symptoms of things overlap, but. yeah. I I hate being labeled as something you know. labeled as funny or labeled as this or that but. I just yeah I know i'm not seeing things. When I was like. yeah I don't know. i'll let you go no, I know I have anxiety, though, when I know I have like I think a little bit of a dd or ADHD. But I was smoked weed for so long that i'm just like inside like ADHD is on the inside and in you know, instead of out. That makes sense I don't know if you've ever smoked weed."
740.0,Provider,"No, I haven't."
17552.0,Patient,So you know it makes you go in and sit out.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17552.0,Patient,That makes sense.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so nicely more so internal. Then external type things. Okay. Okay. So I know that your provider is chantel."
17552.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"And so i'm speaking with her now just to. Get her thoughts, she said that. You should make another appointment with her this week, if the next dose of does that pricks it doesn't help."
17552.0,Patient,"yeah so like it helps like right after I take it, and then it's quickly. Being like nullified by I think the vapor that i'm smoking, so we just I wanted to ask her if I can take it multiple times a day to to fight that and she said it's fine, so I last night at seven o'clock I took a half a pill. This morning. At like six o'clock I took half a pill, and it makes it a little better. But the main reason I feel like i'm like she was trying to make olanzapine work, because it seems like it's the medication with the less. symptoms are like bless. negative effects. You know, I was reading up about upon all of the schizophrenia medications and it seems like it, they just get worse from. From there, but maybe it's just just me so i'm trying to i'm trying to let you professionals, through your job, and not you know take what my reading on the Internet. You know."
740.0,Provider,Not so so are you still taking the zyprexa you just taking the olanzapine. santana the santana you taking the olanzapine.
17552.0,Patient,"That they're the same thing, I believe."
740.0,Provider,All cow cow is just a generic.
17552.0,Patient,Nine yeah yeah. Okay yeah she knows that i'm been taking it. yeah zyprexa. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and so, is it working or."
17552.0,Patient,"It does work but i'm still i'm still addicted to nicotine or my V. that's The one thing I haven't I haven't kicked kicked off. So I think like when i'm smoking it it's making the medication not last as long. I know shauntel is super super busy, so I can't like go in depth about all this stuff and it takes it takes a little bit to get all of this, this out, so I think. The issue is was."
740.0,Provider,"But she wants you to make an appointment with her this week. Okay, so when you get out of here just go back to the vc and tell them that shanty I want you to make an appointment. To see her this week so they're gonna squeeze you in somewhere. yeah okay. Okay, so ass out of their thoughts anything else you want to work on why you hate me."
17552.0,Patient,I don't I don't know um.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's, the main thing right now okay."
17552.0,Patient,"yeah that's, the main thing right now is getting now getting a medication that works, I was on the call doll. And that one I have to take like co Jensen, with as well and it just made me want to like like just like shake at all times, you know, like it's just me me like so irritable and like I couldn't sit in my computer chair for more than like two minutes at a time. Before I had to like get up and walk around. The olanzapine I don't have negative side effects, besides being a little sleepy and other than wanting to eat all day. And I am trying to go to the gym and like get my ABS back and stuff like that so that's making me sad but overeating is isn't the worst. it's not the worst thing in the world, so. I was just reading some of the like other. Negative symptoms, you can get some. Green bad battery do this this diary know rena nails."
740.0,Provider,"Now now don't Google nails don't read them nails if you want something to read and action to to provide you with some reading material. This accurate for so you can get the knowledge that you need, but other than that. yeah do not take it upon yourself to read the nails. Okay Okay, because the more you read the more you get these delusions and then you start thinking stuff that I don't worry nothing else. Please just don't if you have any questions, make the appointment with Shannon to write your questions down on a sheet of paper right all the questions you have down on a sheet of paper, so that way when you meet with her you won't miss anything does that make sense. yeah Okay, so do me do that, I want you to do that. i'm going to try to i'm going to create your treatment plan for you um accurate diagnosis, we just got to play it out and see what happens. yeah i'm trying. i'm so we'll keep she's gonna monitor monitor and then we'll just see what happens Okay, but don't forget to go back to the vc to make the appointment with her let them know that she that she said.

Any other questions any concerns or anything like that. No Okay, let me tell you something i'm gonna tell you this before we get off this line. Right. You have something that other people don't have. And you know that is the ability to shut it off. So the fact that you have a minute, it shows that you have it shows you have great strength mentally so. yeah so. don't listen to people say. You know i'm saying and stop readings. Already sorry man down below not playing only method else if you need something to read that you asked us to send you stuff three but don't Google none else. Literally it would drive unit."
17552.0,Patient,yeah. Just one page says something you go to the next page say something completely different.
740.0,Provider,"There i'll say don't just just just just keep complying with the program you know i'm going to do my best. i'm gonna give you my best.
