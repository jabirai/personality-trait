11083.0,Patient,there's no better.
214.0,Provider,It is so much better not 100% but at least I can hear you.
11083.0,Patient,"Okay, so we've a video offer."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I think it's the bandwidth i'm fine, but for the purposes of the recording can you provide me your full name and date of birth."
11083.0,Patient,hey Sue still a cruise of 1691.
214.0,Provider,"Thank you so much, so he's just what's going on, well, no."
11083.0,Patient,"Not much really just been working. My daughter's finally had my daughter's birthday Party last night. after birth. Is her birthday was at the end of last month, but her godfather had been working and been out of town recently for like the past month, and he finally got a few days off anyway, and she definitely wanted him to be there."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and and. Whether we're people drinking at that birthday party."
11083.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, it was at my house and. Everybody."
214.0,Provider,i'm just trying to see how. You you you. You know you work with the flow so that's good to know so how's your sobriety been.
11083.0,Patient,"it's been really good honestly it's. i've been. Pretty just. It hasn't been what it used to be at all, it really hasn't. I stay busy when I get home I relax I play with the kids for a little while and it's it's just been it's been. I don't know how to say, I want to say it's been easy, but it's been given easier."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, this is good to hear, and when you say it's getting easier like what are you really defining what are you talking about."
11083.0,Patient,"Like as far as when I used to just sit there and. That would be that would occupy my time because I would think in I would pretty much struggle with myself and have to. Like think of things to do to pretty much distract myself now I could literally sit there and relax or more, and just watch TV and it's not constantly on my head."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so so so you're becoming. more aware of yourself and actually you're not becoming as an fi of anxiety driven."
11083.0,Patient,that's all.
214.0,Provider,"I know that that is so fantastic to hear, so I see you did your October surveys, let me just check something here doesn't look like the October drug screen isn't on."
11083.0,Patient,October is that this month. I haven't received both for this one.
214.0,Provider,"I try. we'll just keep on top of it, I want to be able to. Go we go. So let me just look at something. So um how's it because last time we spoke, you had with your old boss or your own company and you kind of went back to Bush you used to work with has not going."
11083.0,Patient,"That it's gotten a lot better and I have more time in the evenings and he's a lot less willing or a lot more lenient i'm sorry and i'm. He he lets me do my appointments and everything but he's old and he forgets in at the same time, like he'll have me doing this and that and i'm myself why i'm really not good with scheduling appointments my wife he's weekend was that."
214.0,Provider,"I get it, I get it, I respected okay."
11083.0,Patient,"And yeah just. If i'm at work like i'm the type of person when i'm at work normally I won't even look at my phone if somebody takes into I get a break, and I just sometimes like that that morning or that day that I had my less was supposed to have my last hole with you. yep I had every intention. You know, being here and then like that I, my alarm goes off I have half hour and i'm thinking okay 10 minutes I got to check in. And I just got carried away and totally totally missed the next thing, though, I look at my clock and it's time for me to be with you and I still hadn't checked in."
214.0,Provider,"I got I listen these things happen, but you know what's the good part about it. Is that we still can get another session in October and complete the two for the month we can't do anything about some time but we definitely can do something about toba. But I think the idea here, too, is really Where are you at in that recovery, what are the interventions you're putting in place to stop pause and think look at positive results, it sounds like you're you know. changing employment was a good thing."
11083.0,Patient,yeah that's a little as well. Even though he's more of a. i'll say about who.
214.0,Provider,"I get it, I get what you're saying."
11083.0,Patient,But he's he's lot more winging things he. He doesn't. doesn't care if if I have an appointment in you know he knows that I have things I need to take care of in my boss like he was not understanding of any of it at all I.
214.0,Provider,"will listen, the idea is to find the balance and I think you know i've been working with you for a little bit, not a long time. But the whole idea is you understand, like you're trying to be committed to family you're trying to have wellness within yourself and sometimes you know. it's really the employment it's really the job if we can make those adjustments, we should so i'm really, really glad that you want about that the right way, so i'm looking in survey. That you submitted and the surveys, the pH Q nine right and that one's for depression and your score comes up to zero, do you think that's a good reflection of where you are today."
11083.0,Patient,"yeah I really do i'm. Like there's things that. Like i've felt excited about things like I was so excited about my daughter's birthday like honestly I feel bad as a dad the last year I don't think I did. The year before that I don't think I did. Honestly, it almost makes. You know I mean I feel bad because of it."
214.0,Provider,But I know but.
11083.0,Patient,Because of it.
214.0,Provider,"Right Well, this is what i'm saying to you so like you know I don't want you to feel bad I want you to be aware that. You know, there was a period, maybe you were absent, you are absent as a father it's not what you wanted to do, but it was. But this this weekend or yesterday was about you, being in participating his daughter's birthday, so the person that you're dwelling back on it's not the his use of today right if. It is. Exactly so when you're looking at feeling bad it's more like you need to remember this is what i'm not going to do to my daughter, this is not what i'm going to do to my family. Are you digging the past, to give you the energy for the future, I don't want you to guilt and shame yourself but it's okay to have a little. You know, every once in a while somebody nudging on your shoulder and say don't forget man you're doing great but let's not go back and it's a good way of remembering. But don't feel bad because if we get into the guilt and shame we we couldn't run into some dilemmas and I don't want you to run into any dilemmas I think you've been doing a fantastic job. Alright, so when I look at your pH Q, not the gad seven for anxiety, it says zero good reflection."
11083.0,Patient,"whoo yeah yeah I mean there, there are times I get anxious and nervous just about certain things but. it's just. I mean these certain things are things that I was kind of like anxious about even as a child right going into large crowds and things like that."
214.0,Provider,But have you acclimated someone to launch crown.
11083.0,Patient,"um. yeah I mean i'll do it it's normally just initially going in. I don't know what it is, I always get like a feeling in my stomach like something is going to happen."
214.0,Provider,"Right right. I definitely get that but, but I think the idea here is the way i'm going to describe it to you is you know first time someone children. Go go see water let's just use a pool they're like wow that looks very dangerous and we just tell them go up to your ankles and even in their ankles. They feel like something's going to happen, but the reality is we know in the water and ankles for an adult anyway, no child. it's not going to be harmful so when you're feeling that you really have to save yourself Okay, I know i'm feeling that i'm going through it, but I am safe like you have to challenge the way you think so the thinking doesn't become prevalent and stay on track."
11083.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,You know so it's just a little bit of modifying the way you think. So have some medication working out for you.
11083.0,Patient,"it's been it's been working real good honestly oh like At times I forget that I take it, like not forget but At first it was like. You know, I have to have this otherwise. Who knows what I might do you know when I take it. Like it is kinda kind of like I don't know whether it's me. That. Is kind of. Balancing or if it's the medication that's keeping me like you know what I mean like I wonder."
214.0,Provider,"Well, I mean it is helping you stay sober it is helping you be a better. father, husband worker, so I mean it is benefiting but on the other side don't forget about all the work that you do to benefit and be better yourself. So the two components together is just a good mix and you have to give yourself credit for the things that you're doing I think that's important yeah you know so that's good all right, so let me look at what we're looking at here, so how is a Thursday October 28 at the same time."
11083.0,Patient,yeah that word.
214.0,Provider,"Is. Alright cool so again just listen. Use the past as what you don't want to be, but don't dwell on it, because it happened, you just can't change it, the other one is. Take a little more time to realize that you're doing great work you're really doing a lot of work to help yourself saying sobriety. So I want you to be reflective of all the hard work you're putting into it, too, yes, the medications working, but you to a making a commitment so it's really great to see you do that, you know. yeah awesome so any questions, for me, before we leave."
11083.0,Patient,um. I. mean.
214.0,Provider,"All right, good enough, well done i'll see you own group on Monday. And just keep up the great work."
11083.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
214.0,Provider,hey take care bye.
