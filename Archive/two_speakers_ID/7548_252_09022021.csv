252.0,Provider,How are ya.
7548.0,Patient,Good we only have 30 minutes today.
252.0,Provider,I know I noticed that I didn't even know that they put you on my schedule until I saw you checked it i'm like what in the hell.
7548.0,Patient,"yeah see the problem is is I went to check in yesterday, and they were like oh you don't have a meeting with Rebecca and I was like. Why."
252.0,Provider,They never even said anything to me because you know what. I was sitting here waiting for you to check in.
7548.0,Patient,They knew.
252.0,Provider,We have a five o'clock Wednesday standing. it's.
7548.0,Patient,No longer five o'clock it's going to be Thursdays at eight in the morning for the next month.
252.0,Provider,Why.
7548.0,Patient,Because they couldn't put me in on Wednesdays. Like how stupid is that.
252.0,Provider,I don't know what's going on.
7548.0,Patient,"I don't know either, but it's now Thursdays at eight except for today, which is 11. So i'll have to be up at seven to check in."
252.0,Provider,They could have put you in on Monday.
7548.0,Patient,I don't know I really don't know. But i'm frustrated with them right now.
252.0,Provider,i'm frustrated right now with them to. I am.
7548.0,Patient,They are anyways so I. I checked yesterday and I got denied for disability. which I was expecting.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7548.0,Patient,I wasn't expecting to be denied until I saw some money. But I didn't get to see anybody nobody saw me or anything so I have the paperwork filled out. For an appeal good and you remember that letter of diagnoses that I got from bright heart. yeah i'm going to send that in with them with the paperwork. For the appeal.
252.0,Provider,yeah I think everybody gets denied the first time around.
7548.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,doesn't make sense.
7548.0,Patient,"I don't know either, but I know we got denied So my first round about is officially over Thank God."
252.0,Provider,That was fast actually.
7548.0,Patient,"That was fast. Well, in comparison to what it could be could be a lot longer i'm hoping it doesn't take years. To get there because i'm thinking, maybe I should just since I got denied go get a job. try again before I try. For disability again. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,I think I would submit it first. And the appeal.
7548.0,Patient,"yeah. If I submit it for the appeal, then I can't go get a job. Because then i'm appealing to be on disability, whereas if I don't submit the appeal, then I can just go get a job. Does that make sense."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7548.0,Patient,"So i'm deciding trying to decide what I want to do with that because. I am thinking, if I get a job, my mom and I move out. But then i'm thinking to is how long is disability going to take his disability going to take another you know, four months to. deny me."
252.0,Provider,Present yeah.
7548.0,Patient,"So I don't know and my uncle told me yesterday Oh, it could take years and i'm like are you kidding me. there's one long going no it won't take years. yeah. So my uncle did say that yesterday, so."
252.0,Provider,"So security benefits, I do know can take years. Right."
7548.0,Patient,"I mean again 30 benefits that's exactly what it is, it is social security disability insurance s s."
252.0,Provider,di di okay.
7548.0,Patient,That is what it is the term it's it's not ssd anymore it's ssd Ai which is weird.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7548.0,Patient,"Social security disability insurance. So I don't know. yeah I got denied I got the paperwork filled out for the appeal. The only thing I need is white out I need some white out. Because I made a couple mistakes. But otherwise i'm Okay, and I think it should be okay to send it in so. i'll just send it back to me. So."
252.0,Provider,You can't copy another one.
7548.0,Patient,"No, I can but i'm like afraid that i'm going to end up using all of antennas paper."
252.0,Provider,Oh okay.
7548.0,Patient,So. I don't want to. copy too much.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7548.0,Patient,"I know I got a lot of paper back 30 years I have a lot of paper I forgot about the paper, I went out to write it and plot this big stack of paper. A ream of paper okay."
252.0,Provider,mom. I love it.
7548.0,Patient,In the back. So I don't know.
252.0,Provider,yeah you could print it again print that one page maybe again that you can't.
7548.0,Patient,"I can't print one page, I have to print all four pages. Okay, because it's a four page thing. But I mean I could print it again and just refill it out."
252.0,Provider,So correct the mistakes.
7548.0,Patient,Mistakes you have white out. mom has I know we have white out for where is it in the. Car pull been out again to me yesterday. again.
252.0,Provider,What is.
7548.0,Patient,"We have to pull the stupid bins out again. The bins underneath our bed it's hard to pull them in and out to get underneath there. So it kind of sucks that we can't. We. Sorry, we could get to them. But it's just annoying. To get underneath the bed so. The mom said she pulled out for me so."
252.0,Provider,"haha there how's everything else, been going."
7548.0,Patient,"everything's been going okay and Tina has been. Excuse my language, but she's been really bitchy lately. She literally yelled at me and told me to shut up in the kitchen, the other day because remember how I had. On Tuesday I had group therapy. So I ate my food as fast as I could and ran into the room and got in to group therapy and I did group therapy. And Tina is trying was trying to say that I took the pillar, you know, like the pillars that she used appeal cucumbers and stuff yeah she said that she that I asked her if I could put it in the dishwasher. which I couldn't because they were all cleaning up while I was in counseling so there's no way that I could have asked. If I could put the peeler in the dishwasher because I wasn't even out there. Right, I was therapy. And so she's like she's like no you did you asked me, and I said note the I was in group therapy and she goes shana and i'm like are you kidding me. And of course I just did because there's no point there's no point in even. arguing about it at that point she's just not going to admit that she's wrong."
252.0,Provider,wow.
7548.0,Patient,She yelled shut up to me that sucked.
252.0,Provider,yeah I bet you it did.
7548.0,Patient,"So that was stupid, but. And the only reason shield shut up at me is because she didn't want to admit that she was wrong."
252.0,Provider,If she loses her memory.
7548.0,Patient,"At all yeah yeah I think so she forgets whole conversations or makes up conversations in her head. Like she'll be thinking she's going to tell me something and then just somehow makes herself believe that she didn't tell me, and she didn't. I think she's got the early stages of dementia."
252.0,Provider,yeah that's what I was going to ask.
7548.0,Patient,"that's what I think, but of course i'm not a doctor and I can't diagnose or with it."
252.0,Provider,"me either, but. You know, definitely it's a concern you know."
7548.0,Patient,"yeah but The thing is, is she won't go get checked for it because she thinks she's normal. Well, but everyone in the House knows that she's got problems everyone. So."
252.0,Provider,"So, are you able just to chalk it up to that."
7548.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,Just not like personal.
7548.0,Patient,"Oh, I take everything personally, but I just just. I leave it alone, and then I wait until I have somebody to talk to, and I tell them and then i'm done with it. So can I keep it in the back of my head. to remember. So that when I moved I don't forget, none of this stuff yeah. yeah I mean yeah."
252.0,Provider,Very much so. Anything fun this past week.
