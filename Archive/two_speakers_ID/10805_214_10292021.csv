214.0,Provider,"Oh, because doing."
10805.0,Patient,"Good and my youngest one she's doing good at school and stuff like that, but I think when I talked to you last time that she had like eloped ran off campus and stuff. Well, now they're trying to kick her out of the district and put her back to the county program and i'm trying to fight it because I don't think it warrants it, I mean it's happened twice in since they started her behavioral plan and that's you know."
214.0,Provider,"So it's a little interesting right, so we have someone. With a fracture we presumed that schools would be responsible for children, and here we go blaming the child. And i'm just kind of like looking at it. From a different. But. If if we can help change the behavior. And what we say, is, we should put them someone else with somewhere else, what do we think we're telling this person that that type of because it's not constructive right."
10805.0,Patient,"they're giving up on my kid. Like they just want to get rid of her that's how it feels like that they don't care enough to try harder. And I get it because I work with those kids like. We, we had a child that eloped."
214.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"to the point, we had a clicker you know with a lot counters of how many times a day he would do it, and if he was upwards of 20 times a day, and he was a preschooler. elope and he never left camp Well he did he left it into the parking lot which technically is leaving campus and we kept them in our Program. All the way until he was when I started in the program he was like three and a half we kept them in there till he aged out to go to kindergarten so would have been two years. We didn't send them anywhere else we kept him with us. You know and that's why I look at it and so like we have. They have a. If he scheduled next week. i've got like a great i've got really great resources so i'm not really worried about it i'm going to fight it. And if they don't listen um I have no problem, you know getting a hold of whoever I need to get Ahold of to help me."
214.0,Provider,"You know. Listen, you have to advocate when when."
10805.0,Patient,"When I don't think it hurt them kicking around is warranted, yes, she escaped one time, but it was a day that she like saw violent she's never seen there were so many circles, like so many somebody wheel spinning, at the same time that built up to it, it wasn't. Like I think I told her like she looked at her teacher and she said, I need a hug because she had just had a panic attack and she's new to panic attacks, so they really scare her, she asked her teacher, can I hug please because it's all in for her. And he looked at her, and he said i'm busy right now."
214.0,Provider,hmm.
10805.0,Patient,"And I was like Okay, I was like but does he realized that knowing my child that hurt that can DS like that hug could have completely."
214.0,Provider,De escalate in these conversations.
10805.0,Patient,"Right right so i'm like, and so I want to say that, and she apparently left campus and made it half mile down the road before the assistant principal was able to get her but i've never gone incident report. My child left campus I never got infinite report, I never have gotten one accident report, but they want to kick her out yeah try try again."
214.0,Provider,"yeah no I get I guess oh listen, these are these are things that we do and it's a good thing that you're, you have the capacity to understand."
10805.0,Patient,"That they don't have to make like I don't have to let them, believe me, like they're building."
214.0,Provider,This point. like this will happen is someone will feel as if all they get through is pushed around pushed around moved around and that causes create a home at the end of the day we say they were.
10805.0,Patient,"Like they don't know who they're fighting with. This This is like a little hiccup for me because i've. You know i've been through way worse than last 10 years I mean I my baby that baby I fought for, because she's had brain surgeries she's got two different brain surgeries I spent months in the hospital with her, you know, like. Oh you're not going to just tell me that she. That you're just going to give up on her because we don't give up on her she's a mate like. she's amazing like when my daughter my older daughter told her agenda so she's still not having any behaviors in her general education classes, she just having behaviors in her special education classes imagine that. Her jenna teacher rally told my oldest daughter told him today they're like oh they're trying to get alyssa kicked out of out of school and Center county and he said oh hell no so he's like well he's like, and of course they scheduled it up when he can't be there. Like all the people so i'm rescheduling it till he can be there."

Just kind of miserable there too, so i've like toyed with do I just made my girls now and not wait till June, but then I don't that's like giving up."
214.0,Provider,"can't let the battle know about that just. Just think about that for a minute is is getting them tough skin. Will. Fire you at the end, or will it make things worse at a new beginning."
10805.0,Patient,"Well, I just my worry with my older alyssa like, if I have to homes like have my dad has to homeschool for the rest of the year he's willing to do that, like that's what we have to do. But but i'm just i'm there's a thing called a stay put order I guess that you can put in there and they can't they can't make her move. But we'll see if that happens, but like I don't know if we'll get to that point we'll see what happens i'm going to fight like heck and her IP but for Riley she's wearing what almost November she's a senior. I would have I wouldn't be able to move her till January so she's going to be graduating with know when she knows like it's going to be I think it's it's going to be different, but it's going to be a whole nother maybe potential for another problems, you know I mean."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but is it possible that. Because this is traumatic right, this will be period ptsd if it if it has a negative impact."
10805.0,Patient,Of ptsd issues on. lexapro.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so. you're right so. it's actually which one is the best of the two evils. So I would describe and I don't know enough, but I would you say. You know what."
10805.0,Patient,i've listened to her yeah.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I wasn't feeling more bullying and more bullying, you know. It could turn into a crisis and. She feel abandoned and lonely like I don't know which one is well yeah which one is our so we're her and I had a big talk about it, and I said don't think about those two girls that are."
10805.0,Patient,"messing with you, I sent out a few moved. In the amount of people that have been for been there for for the last 10 years those friends that may not have been as strong as this friendship, the fell apart and they're not being mean to you, I said those friends. Like imagine trying to graduate without them like imagine that what your last memories you like you left, and you know it's."
214.0,Provider,A good conversation.
10805.0,Patient,"So she looked at me just now, before I got on here because I asked her and are cooking dinner my parents came over for dinner, it was like I have an appointment, so I didn't eat yet, but i'm. Her my parents are downstairs and talking about it, and she goes you don't mom i'll stay I said okay so. i'm going to talk to, it is still may change if stuff goes wrong with her sister, I still may let them change, you know. If it doesn't if just kind of depending on the next couple weeks like we'll talk about it again i've already been in contact with the new district so i'm not terribly worried, they have great programs up there. and positive news we found out, we got well, I think I told you, we are movable or moving but."
214.0,Provider,I know.
10805.0,Patient,"Get the keys on the 19th. wow so we just saw today, so if he's almighty we if she's not to that's huge, so I think for her to. US her like I think a lot of her having a hard time with the girls they mean doors they're telling her all the time we're doing this, this weekend we're doing that this weekend. And normally she would have been with them that's just not friends with them anymore. And I was like you know it, but every weekend we're going to be up the new place like you just start making new friendships like breaks work on like thanksgiving break or thanksgiving break starts that day that we get the keys. So we can spend that whole week up there, getting the new houses worked on like it'll keep her mind off of it that we."
214.0,Provider,I told her I see my right it's new.
10805.0,Patient,"Right, and so you can get your bearings and you can understand it, and you can start looking for jobs that when June comes around I said, you know I said I know it sounds like it's a lot right now I was like but. Thanks give me a break, then you have like two and a half weeks and then you'll her 18th birthday is on the 19th of December so. Like she said, do you have your birthday and will be up there again we'll spend all Christmas break up there. Then we come back in January and then she does um livestock judging she's an ffa future farmers of America, she has livestock turning things so she goes every single Saturday two. Different competitions and she competes as a team with other kids and they evaluate livestock like they have to pick the three like three."
214.0,Provider,Reality is this is. A minimum amount of time and a negative environment because.
10805.0,Patient,"i'm switching process. And switching costs that she has with them because she's struggling in math because it was like a breakup and it was just a lot of stuff at maths hard for her, she was dating a boy, he was. super smart and so he was helping her and then, when they broke up you saw her Greg like she just got and it's a it's chicken algebra two so it's not a required class. So i'm going to talk to her counselor get her out of that class put her in like another like a fun elective so her senior year doesn't seem so stressful she's. she's in a class with those girls i'm going to have them switch it so she's in that same class, but it was like a different period. Just like flip flop her it's our fourth and fifth that flip flop on so she's not with those girls that limits the amount of time just to spend with them."
214.0,Provider,that's what i'm saying so that that's the total benefit right.
10805.0,Patient,"So so i'm hoping that that work between the two girls i'm just going to have a big fight the school is next couple weeks, but it, you know. it's for the best of my girls and if it if it doesn't work and it doesn't fit right, then, then I let them go up there, which breaks my like my mama heart, because I have to stay because I have to, I have to finish my contract with work, you know, like."
214.0,Provider,"But here's the thing think about it, think about all these great up these options, you have versus no option. or one option, like you, you have a plethora of these. If this doesn't work, we can do this, and if that doesn't go in and then it should be a little bit of a peace of mind it's disruptive chosen."
10805.0,Patient,"Britain normally have. In the last will say two or three weeks, not even I don't know even sent you and I talked to last couple weeks I have like really just tried to. Not freak out I got really upset yesterday when I got that because I don't like a meltdown yesterday morning because the day before on my birthday was Tuesday my birthday was today. I found out that Riley was failing a class my oldest and her friends were like smoking faith in her name got brought up like there were still a bunch of crap that happened with her. And then she told me she I want to go school there anymore, and then alyssa looks at me yesterday morning it was like I don't want to go to school, and I just. fell apart, but I got it out, I tried it out and I freaked out for a few minutes, and then I did my mom thing and I figured it like I just got like I I put normally I would like stress and stress and stress and i've kind of learned to. Like. Look at it like you said, give look at what I have had me look what the choices are look what I can fix what's beyond like. Am I letting people you know i'm kind of letting those people at her school like alyssa teachers. Bullying me like her riley's being bullied and I have to show her that you don't just give up you fight for it, and so what i'm trying to show her so that's why i'm like no I fight for it and i've you know i've got connections and. They are not going to win. And if they think they can win then i'll just move on, because the district we're going to is amazing."
214.0,Provider,"But here's the real treasure to this. Having the ability to fight and they'll not winning still allows you to have another option. is not like, if you don't win. All right. There is no, this is all good gravy stuff cotton candy and stuff. And yeah there's a moving and shifting, but I would say to you, like when when i'm just visualizing myself if I had no other options, I couldn't get away on weekends I couldn't get away on school break side. I wasn't gonna change the environment. yeah that would make me a little depressed about I can't provide for my children but. you've had something come your way that you flourished opportunity, so if you have to seal them, you can."
10805.0,Patient,"I can, I can absolutely do it, I like I don't want her and I made I made her understand I made her my dad said he's like you're you're you're speaking on emotion right now and that's why she wanted to leave she was just done with it. And i'm like the thing which are leaving you're leaving this this and this. For like you're letting them and they're like I said they're they're going to be there they're like this at 17 I said Riley they're going to be like this at 30. I know those kind of girls are the same girls that I had in my high school that were the same way and they're miserable now they may be fun and me, and right now but mean girls it catches up with you and you end up very alone. And I like I just heard, like i'm there and i've been through a lot and so she sees that and so we've had we've had huge talks, and I feel better about it and, like my anxiety my side has been really bad, though. Today, it was like I woke up this morning and I was so sick to my stomach because I didn't want to. Talk to her teacher alyssa teacher didn't want to talk to him because I want to just tell him all. But I know that's not helping anything and they'd be like you saw her, let me cry to you yesterday and told me that I was doing great job and that you had my back and then you three hours later, sent me an IP thing trying to pick the kid out of your school. i'm good dude like I don't do fake."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I get it, I get it."
10805.0,Patient,"I was like. So I had like this morning I didn't want to deal with it, and whatever the higher powers or whatever happened a different the other teacher that I really like. grabbed her like I was walking in the park next to each other when I got all the trap my truck and she took alyssa and she walked a listen class and while we're walking we were talking. And she was telling me, you know I keep just talking to relax she's like she's normal and I was like well why didn't you talk to her like that, before she was supposed to really seems to work and i'm like yeah cuz she isn't she is. And she goes both days, because she was lissa we had a great talk didn't we endless feels like it, and so today, she was a did it again just just perfect."
214.0,Provider,"It really to two seconds of attention and kenton empathy can provide someone so much stability, I."
10805.0,Patient,"So, like, I can so she was like right with her and she's like you know we're going to keep doing that every day and so she brought her out today and she's like she had an amazing day and he's like see what happens when you're nice to my kid like. I should be a jerk but if you're not a direct to her she's usually not one she still is, I mean I accidentally forgot to give her her she's on. she's on a lot of medication she is on like 15 medications because she's she's epileptic. She has. A cold when it's terrific PC PC dh 19. it's a rare form of epilepsy. Okay, only and females. very similar to drum bass and drum and men Okay, but. It is the only seizure disorder that gets better as they get older. The reason you don't hear about it a lot in men is because it's usually fail because it's on your it's on one of the X chromosomes and you guys only have one. You know."
214.0,Provider,So it.
10805.0,Patient,"So it's a it's a protein, it has to like a protein that's a malformation on. One of the X chromosomes and it causes seizures disorders, but it causes behaviors it causes a bunch of stuff so she's. All like for anti seizure medications then she's on her spirit own new decks the. one. Next. To be six because she takes care for her seizures which the side effect is kept for rage, which is like Road rage. Right and and then she just started. antidepressants and it's an old school anti depressant. rallies on lexapro i've shared the good the other one. Because they always tell me the generic it starts with an F flow."
214.0,Provider,Now for you can be philosophy.
10805.0,Patient,philosophy something yeah.
214.0,Provider,I know that one.
10805.0,Patient,"But it's. it's on there, so what is it's like the generic for a minute i've been to feel stupid because it's like one of the big antidepressants and she's on a lot. um. she's only been on that so i'm going to tell you the name of it because that's going to drive me crazy now. It always gets on like the five. Prozac. she's on Prozac to put like two capsules of process, as I knew it was like one of the big ones and that's what it is so she's on Prozac and my other daughters on lexapro i'm like. Okay it's. been moans on an expert on an invaluable."
214.0,Provider,"lesson that medic medication has a purpose and. I never diminish the tool, the tool provides stability conference and there's a lot of things, I can say about it, so you know I looked at it from a very different vantage."
10805.0,Patient,"yeah riley's on lexapro and she has she stopped panic attacks, not so much anymore, because of my marriage, she was old enough she remembers it and. So anytime like a male figure yells that are like an authority figures not like me, but not not like my dad my dad her grandpa deals that are. it's not a big deal, or if I get letters normal um you know, like she didn't look at that, but if it's like a teacher or someone who like it's like an authority figure yells at her full blown panic attacks she used her when she was younger because of my ex husband. condition it, she was very. lucky she used to what came next and that's what and so she was. shouting lot better her and her dad have a relationship now whatever I don't trust it but don't trust him, but just because he's flaky but. They have a relationship she's on medication she's seen countless she's seeing a therapist once a month, which I don't think it's enough they're seeing a psychiatrist it's really hard for adolescents to get into therapy right now. super hard like super hard like she's on to waited six months to get into a psychiatrist and she was borderline suicidal. wow like when I when I called her doctor she looked at her doctor she goes I don't know what's wrong, but I just don't feel like this anymore."
214.0,Provider,Sure sure.
10805.0,Patient,"In her. In her ex boyfriend to suicide like year and a half ago, and so like I got scared and she's like no mom I don't want to I don't want to hurt myself, she was like I just don't want to hurt anymore. Because I know like she was I don't want to be upset she's like I don't want to be when they put her on she's on zoloft before, and she said she goes mom I don't like taking it Mr why because it just didn't make me feel. She was like I couldn't feel sad but I wasn't happy either just kind and I. Will often sleep, I took it makes me sleep, no, no, why it's put me to sleep did shontelle ever say anything about because you were talking to me about medication, but she never said anything to me when I talk to her. you're talking about medicine."

After talking to one friend, I was like Okay, we can't do this or you know, like there was just it was easy and I felt like I had to get. A kind of freak out sometimes but it takes me five minutes to get right back to where I need to be like I like initially like kind of lose my stuff and then i'm right back to normal.
