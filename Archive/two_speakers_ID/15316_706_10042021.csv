15316.0,Patient,"uh huh we are, we were staying with. A friend of ours, and he decided to have us addicted he was keeping our mail and didn't tell us, so we didn't know until they look came to set us out, and as soon as we walked out the door he kept all their stuff in my."
706.0,Provider,gosh that's horrible.
15316.0,Patient,I need I need to hold on face I need to call my phone and i'm on the phone my therapist I need it. yeah so. yeah.
706.0,Provider,wow.
15316.0,Patient,So i'm sorry my fiance was just leaving who i'm about fed up with I just my days get really bad.
706.0,Provider,Okay. So let's start what brings you to break.
15316.0,Patient,um. My addictions.
706.0,Provider,um tell me about that tell me when they started how old were you when you first started using.
15316.0,Patient,"um I mean with everything, and I was probably about 12."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and what were you using at time."
15316.0,Patient,I mean I started with pot. Then acid and. Ecstasy cocaine. The heroin didn't start until more recently last like four or five years.
706.0,Provider,Okay. So. When you were younger and you were using was that consistent use it was that.
15316.0,Patient,"yeah i've died in some way, shape or form, I have always I mean. Up until the heroin i've always got high, just like you never because I had to because when I was married here via previously there was a 10 year gap where I stopped everything."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so you did have a time of sobriety."
15316.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's, not because I wanted to because I had to. I had. I just got married and my ex wife had a one year old who's now my son. And I just. It was time to grow up, so I stopped being on well I shouldn't say that i've smoked pot consistently the entire time but. Everything else there was that good 10 year period was where I was married West maybe once on new year's we would do a couple lines of code. If we're out but I mean it wasn't anything like that."
706.0,Provider,um so Have you had any treatment before now.
15316.0,Patient,"There was a there was a period where I had gotten in trouble is juvenile and I had a court mandated quest. Drug test once a week, but I never even saw I mean I didn't stop being either either I just found a way around it."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, but no actually creating programming."
15316.0,Patient,"No, no."
706.0,Provider,um. Have you ever been through like a detox.
15316.0,Patient,"No, no, because I mean I was doing. When I got married I was doing two or three balls contain a day, every day for two three years and I stopped cold Turkey I don't. I don't really have. I guess an addictive personality, when it comes to drugs i've never had a problem stopping them. This has been the only thing where i've had an issue."
706.0,Provider,And that's because of that physical withdrawal symptoms.
15316.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no I mean I know cocaine is not an addict physically addictive drug. You know, and I did a lot acid next to see but never because I had to I didn't I didn't do it because I craved it I would do it on the weekends or. No just do it. This has been the only thing, where it was there was actual physical symptoms okay."
706.0,Provider,"So with cocaine. There is some physical withdrawal symptoms, I mean if you if you do a lot of it for a long period of time. A lot of people do experience like stomach cramping things like that kind of it's the same things that you would experience from other stimulants like with amphetamines. yeah so I mean you do have some of that, but with the opioids you're absolutely right, like the withdrawal symptoms are far worse, you have not only stomach cramping the nausea the restlessness the one into proud of your skin the moodiness I mean you name it, you know what. The body is um so yeah so I mean that definitely it definitely has a stronger physical withdrawal definitely um did you ever try anything like a or na meetings."
15316.0,Patient,"I went to one, a meeting once. Okay, and I thought I didn't like it, I just. I was with a girl, and it was actually her ex or her kids father, like my whole life and he was a big drug addict he had gotten sober he was all about church and he knew that that she was just bad news, and he didn't really want his kids their kids around her. And he talked me into going I did it was a good experience and my my cousin was a massive crystal meth and cocaine user and he went through, for I mean he lost everything lost a half million dollar your job. He was all over the newspapers and things that happen when we live. He went through rehab and now he he worked his way back from delivering pizzas to he's got a half hour job in Tennessee city planner okay."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean definitely that happens, just because somebody falls into active addiction doesn't mean they can't pull themselves out and live a very productive meaningful."
15316.0,Patient,"Life, you know."
706.0,Provider,"it's just it just has to do with the choices. That you make, and you know how hard, do you want to work at it, because it's not easy. it's not easy if it was easy everybody would do it, it takes a minute, you have to take it takes time well, sometimes it takes medication medication assisted treatment. It takes dealing with all the demons that you've been hiding, because those demons are the things that usually drive you to use whatever it is that you're using um you know it just it just depends on the person that that's I mean that's a good example of a success story."
15316.0,Patient,"I mean honestly. My my bigger issue I don't I don't really need drugs I don't care about. I have money my bigger reason for coming here was more about. therapy, sir."
706.0,Provider,"Okay you're in the right place on um so you know we kind of talked a little bit about your your addiction, do you have any mental health diagnosis."
15316.0,Patient,know what i'm sure i'm probably bipolar.
706.0,Provider,Okay okay so that's definitely something to take a look at I mean that's definitely something that when you meet with them medical doctor you'll want to talk to them about.
15316.0,Patient,And I talked to Dr Shell about that.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds awesome."
15316.0,Patient,yeah I like her she's really nice lady.
706.0,Provider,"yep yep she's great and she's really great with the mental health stuff too, so you know just being really open and honest with her about you know any kind of symptoms that you're having she you know she will she will work with you. We want you to be. Have the best quality of life, as you can, and that includes your physical health your mental health, you know your spiritual health everything it just it's all in one you know. You, you are not an addict you are a person that has a substance use disorder. You know, and so there's a big difference there now when people say oh you're an addict, and that makes you be like Oh well, that's all you are now. you're a person with a substance use disorder, just like you could be a person with diabetes it's the same thing. It changes the chemistry and the pathways of your brain, so that when you first start yeah it's a choice, but when you have to continue to do it, because otherwise you get sick it's no longer a choice it's because your body dictates that now, because it changed the chemistry of your brain. So i'm. really important things to remember. So you think that you are bipolar but you haven't been formally diagnosed and you haven't gone through any kind of treatment."
15316.0,Patient,"No, no, and actually Stacey i'm going to pull my screen down my fiance just left with my mom's car to pick her up. From the hospital she works of mercy. I just want to text my mom and tell her that you know be looking forward, because she has no phone."
706.0,Provider,I think that's fine.
15316.0,Patient,"So i'm just going to flip the screen i'm not going to where I can hear you, but I. want to be rude and just do that and I didn't want to cut you off. But I don't know."
706.0,Provider,I appreciate that Thank you. So i'm within like all of the years that you've been using and kind of the mood swings because you're saying you might be you think you might be bipolar have. suicidal ideations.
15316.0,Patient,No. I don't. I have said it numerous times. I have never I have never tried to physically do it okay.
706.0,Provider,"So, are you saying it because that's what you want to do, or because you're looking to get a reaction out of somebody manipulate a situation What was your purpose for it."
15316.0,Patient,"Sometimes it's it most of the time, it is to get a reaction. Okay um I mean honestly, it really is most the time it is to get a reaction. um. There have been times, where. I mean my you know my cousin blew the back of his head out."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh i'm so."
15316.0,Patient,"There have definitely been times, where I I had thought. i'm sorry. I don't think that I would. even know how to say it."
706.0,Provider,"So let's look at it, do you ever wish that you would not wake up in the morning."
15316.0,Patient,"I mean there's definitely been times, where I. I just don't care if I get out of bed."
706.0,Provider,But is it that you don't care if you get a better that you did you what you wish you just didn't wake up at all.
15316.0,Patient,That I didn't wake up.
706.0,Provider,Okay um has that happened in the last three months.
15316.0,Patient,"No, I mean. Even as upset as I am right now. I still want that I just. I am. Very codependent."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, how dependent on like relationships. Women yeah we're okay."
15316.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. i've been separated from my ex wife for for almost five years. i'm still legally married to her. um I still care about her. um i'm with my fiance of why I love, more than anything. um well we're gonna have a kid."
706.0,Provider,Congratulations.
15316.0,Patient,I. big part of me tells me that. we're not good together. But I don't want to be without.
706.0,Provider,"out. So yeah those are definitely things so when you talk about. therapy, those are definitely things to explore, because you know you have to you have to ask yourself those questions assess the situation and look at things and say okay well if I know this isn't good for me, why do I stop it. Because that's the question that needs to be answered, and not just with her, but look at you know all of the other things that you've done all the different substances you've done. you've known they haven't been good for you and they haven't had a positive effect on your life, but you still want to do them. Up until heroin now you."
15316.0,Patient,Go none of none of none of the drugs i've done throughout my life have ever affected me from pulling down job.
706.0,Provider,making good money.
15316.0,Patient,i'm enjoying life i've never.
706.0,Provider,i've never you're very functional.
15316.0,Patient,"yeah I am i'm a very functional functional addict. I know I always say it like I do drugs, because I want to, not because I have to, and that really is the truth, for the most part."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah. Then question is, what do you want. If you have, if you have that quality of life, you know that you want, then why do you feel like you need those those drugs to enhance it."
15316.0,Patient,"I mean honestly. Because I like to get on I like that's that's my you know if i've been at work all day or you know i've sold cars for 20 years so cocaine, has always been a big thing in the car business I worked at 19 hours a day, you know i'd always have cocaine and my desk I you know. I never wanted to do Crystal and then you know after my ex wife left. I was. In a place where I was like you know what I was, I was having a horrible day and I said I want to try it. And I ended up doing. like an ounce and a half over 17 days and then sleep. and I still don't I mean I. Very rarely do I use crystal. And at this point, it became more of a extra. Then you know. um. But I even during that point, I never. I shouldn't say I never. fell, but I was always able to get back to where I need to be. So. it's just I love my fiance more than anything, she is very bipolar she can relate to where she was beat really bad for eight years. And she is extremely verbally abusive. um. You know she is physically abusive but. You know it's just. it's who she is and she was she was brought up as a biker. You know i'm the first one, she done with it wasn't a biker she said she didn't want that life anymore. I mean, she tried she she slid a risk a year and a half, two years ago right."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's very traumatic."
15316.0,Patient,"And you know she said, and I believe she said i've never i've never cared that much about anybody, I was with my son's Father for eight years, he beat me every day I ended up almost dying four times. And I never thought about slit my wrists and she said I didn't want to leave you, but I didn't want to be with you at that point. Either it was either she saw me with what she said he was he was either. You or me and I didn't want to hurt you."
706.0,Provider,"wow so. So and we'll get into more of this in therapy, this is just kind of to get some background on you, but it sounds like she definitely needs some therapy as well, and some."
15316.0,Patient,She doesn't believe that.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so the one thing that I that I will. That, I will try and give you a little insight on before we move on to the next round of questions as. If you work on yourself, and you, because obviously you're you know, in the medication assisted treatment, you know program so that's going to help with the heroin, but if you work on yourself through therapy and you grow as a person, and you figure out all of the things that make you tech."
15316.0,Patient,And do that does it.
706.0,Provider,"Do and why, and she doesn't do the same, you two will grow apart because one person can't work on themselves in a relationship, and then the other night because it just."
15316.0,Patient,That terrifies me more than anything. Because I know that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah and you love her so you want it to work and it might be just having that. very honest conversation and during one of our therapy sessions, you are more than welcome to bring her with you, you are allowed to have whomever you want, in your therapy session, if it is going to help you to achieve your goals."
15316.0,Patient,"I would love to because I can't have a rational conversation with her. For for anything. Okay, so then. I have not done my job. As man to take care of her the way I should have but i've also not. I have not, you know she says, I haven't done anything in three years and it's not true, I haven't done with it, but I should have I haven't done what you know I did for my family before what I should be doing for her. But it's."
706.0,Provider,"So, and those are all things to explore, you know, during therapy and like I said, you know you're welcome to bring into therapy whomever it you think needs to be there in order for you to. move forward and achieve your goals and, basically, what I do in those situations is I just facilitate that conversation, because sometimes those conversations are very."
15316.0,Patient,"yeah because in three years I haven't been able to have. an actual rational conversation with her, because the minute I want to say anything it's you know no you're a piece of shit you're you know this is your fault. And a lot of it is but it's no."
706.0,Provider,"yeah but then there's also a piece of guilt and shame, so you have some guilt and shame for the things that you've done i'm sure that she probably has some guilt and shame. She has a lot of trauma that she hasn't dealt with from her previous relationship that she could be projecting on to you there's a there's a lot of dynamics here. That you know I probably affecting the situation with you, too, and you really want to get this figured out before that new baby hits here."
15316.0,Patient,"And I do and. My son is my son is 16 but he was a year old when I met my ex wife so he's not biologically mine and my ex wife. yeah he's my son. And my ex wife wanted to have a kid and we were young and I couldn't I really couldn't afford to take care of another child, I think it was fair but they told her you know we either have a child now or you're not going to and 24 she had a hysterectomy. So you know she resented me for a long time, because I didn't have a kid with her, and you know she just found out that we're having a baby, so it makes it worse. And I you know I have wanted a child my own. Since I met my wife I just didn't want it, I didn't think. First of all, I didn't think I wasn't ever gonna be with her, so I said. kristen's my son I don't need a piece of paper, I need some. healing my son and that's all I care about and I actually never legally adopted him which I hate now because now she holds my head and I don't get to see him, like, I want to."
706.0,Provider,yeah his there's no legally binding.
15316.0,Patient,"piece, and I never thought I was going to be without her so I always said I don't need a piece of paper for him to be my son. So i'm not worried and we couldn't afford it time so I was like i'm out, you know that's not a concern of mine, because i'm not going to be without you know i'm not going to be not so it didn't matter and. 10 years later. she walked out with 150 grand out of her checking account didn't tell me when she got her gifts on Christmas morning and left."
706.0,Provider,wow. Another.
15316.0,Patient,My mom back i'm listening to you.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and another traumatic thing that has affected you so all of these all of these things make you who you are today and the is they all are all the reasons that you act and react to situations, the way that you do."
15316.0,Patient,"This. And, and I i'm not trying to cut you off, I think the biggest thing is, I told my mom when I was 13 and my dad was having an affair, and he left and. You know I don't. I don't have I don't. I love my father's my father, but i'll have a lot of respect for him, I don't really care for him. um you know and that's always been. Something else well."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
15316.0,Patient,"And that no actually very, very married my parents every married after I did so they're back together but. I think that's where actually a lot of it stems from."
706.0,Provider,"yeah it definitely came, I mean you don't know. it's hard for you to have a healthy relationship that's not a codependent or a toxic relationship, when you didn't see a real healthy relationship growing up."
15316.0,Patient,"it's not. challenging and not that I believe me, I don't want to make it sound like I had about like. You know my mom. My mom did whatever she could for me and."
706.0,Provider,And it's. A bad childhood. Certain. pieces and. feel is that you.
15316.0,Patient,Were checking out your stuff together.
706.0,Provider,"You know that you absorb and so, and as a child. teenager when you absorb those things you take them with you, and then you have to look at when you become an adult and you're trying to have relationships, you know what's normal what's not because you didn't have a great example of what looks healthy."
15316.0,Patient,"And you know the sad thing is i've done the same venue my son when she left he stayed with me for a couple years and then. He didn't like he doesn't like a fiance and I let. I let that dictate. My relationship with my son, because she doesn't like my ex wife so she doesn't want to talk about my experience, so I don't."
706.0,Provider,So that's another that's another dynamic of this story so when you are.
15316.0,Patient,like a hot mess.
706.0,Provider,"And no you're not you're not a hot mess everything just intertwines. Because of the codependence obviously you don't want to upset your current band say so you're doing what you can to make her happy, which is to not talk with your. son's mom which causes more issues, because then you have lack of communication as Co parents, which. Definitely limits the amount of time you get to spend with your son, so all of these things are are very fixable but it's just a matter of. who's willing to bend a little bit because you can't have she can't be with you and have this new baby and not know that you had a life before that that that's going to be a part of it. And, in some ways you're all family, you know and and it sounds really weird but it isn't the best situation for everybody involved is simply to have that coexistence that's peaceful."
15316.0,Patient,"And, and I see no reason I honestly don't why I can't why I should hate my ex wife, even though we're not together and I don't like what she did to me. You know I. I always loved her because she gave me some that I couldn't have."
706.0,Provider,yeah and you don't have to hate her and nobody can you hear her and I there's probably some insecurity and some jealousy.
15316.0,Patient,"There is there is there is and part of that I guess is my fault, because she. I never got rid of pictures well that I should know once I started. But you know you to shut up. My dog barking sorry. It went from you know, having what i've seen pictures of my actions on my phone to she throughout every picture i've had over to high school any picture of a female that I was standing with she burned, I mean even as back as far as I was. If you don't stop them on the phone."
706.0,Provider,"yeah and those are all those are her issues, not your issues, I mean you need to ask yourself why you hold on to everything you held on to for so long, but."
15316.0,Patient,I like to have memories of things even even before her and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
706.0,Provider,"No. No there's not as long as long as you're doing it for for the right reasons, and I think that that's simply communication and if the communication isn't there in a relationship and the trust isn't there and a relationship it's really hard to make that relationships successful. really hard and I just would like to see both. years before that even comes, because then the dynamic is going to change so dramatically that it's going to just throw a whole nother layer on to all the complication."
15316.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So um What about you were talking about your family a little bit, is there any mental health diagnosis within your family."
15316.0,Patient,"No, I mean. i'm know i'm my dad was my dad left when I was 13, which is about the time his father died, he was a different person after in my mom says it to this day, he was a different person after his dad died. mean my dad's always been quick to fly off the handle and never, never laid a hand on I never got I never got beat as a child. i'm so sorry Casey can you hold on this is my mom."
706.0,Provider,"Yes, that's fine."
15316.0,Patient,Okay hold on one second. hold on my sound went away. Can you yeah I hear you.
706.0,Provider,um. let's see you were saying that your dad was never abusive or anything but he kind of had a very trigger.
15316.0,Patient,"I knew that I didn't want to piss them off I you know my mom my mom have always been my mom is one of my friends, so we talk very fast so each other, never, never with anything really behind it was just you know we're very foul mouth to each other that's just who we are. But you know, so I. I got always got over my mind, I was never worried about you know if I pissed off I got smacked in the mouth they never bothered me. I wasn't scared of my mom my dad would. You know, he all he had to do was grabbed me by the collar and I was you know I remember when I started out when I was like 14. In the middle of the night and I came home and the lights were on in the kitchen and my mom was like your dad's gonna be here in two hours, and I mean I remember hiding under my bed, because I was terrified of him coming home. And like I said we never touched me uh huh. um. And in a lot of ways I am I had been like that I have raised. Four boys and. You know, after my ex wife, like the friend of ours new, then I took care of her three kids I almost adopt this role and son. i've always been able to take care of kids and nobody's ever said I get anything wrong. Brittany doesn't like the way I talked to her son, who is a very. Very. disrespectful kid I don't I don't like hearing her tell him more than once, to do something so again i've never laid a hand on him, but I also don't. You know. You have her rest of the 10 years old, he called the COPs on me saying I beat him which I didn't and she end up getting arrested over. So I mean there's it listen there is so much."
706.0,Provider,"There is there's a lot here, but the fact that you're talking about it right there, I mean that's like the biggest step is just saying. Oh, my gosh there's so much stuff in my head and I have to get it out when you said to me i'm here more for therapy than I am for the substance use. yeah that's huge because most people want to come in get their suboxone take their pills not use heroin and they only come to group and therapy, because I have to."
15316.0,Patient,you're telling me I. Honestly don't like group I really don't. I don't I don't get anything out of it.
706.0,Provider,"and which group, are you attending."
15316.0,Patient,The doctor cells Tuesday group.
706.0,Provider,What time.
15316.0,Patient,One o'clock.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and your Eastern time. yeah OK so maybe it's maybe it's the group, maybe you."
15316.0,Patient,know I just. I like the one on one.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
15316.0,Patient,And that's fine I don't really care to sit and this probably sounds mean but I don't care to sit and listen to a bunch of people talk about shit that I know they don't care about that they are all there for one reason.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I think that that's definitely an assumption of opinion, but."
15316.0,Patient,"I know it is and i'm sure that that doesn't hold true for everybody, but when you listen to eight people give the same answer and they all say the same sense and nobody really wants to talk."
706.0,Provider,I think that sometimes has to do with the group you're into. So.
15316.0,Patient,And then you might be I don't think i've ever done that in group settings.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm just saying um you know, I have a group with Dr style, my group is um let's see what so be here at the what what what time is your group."
15316.0,Patient,One o'clock on Tuesday.
706.0,Provider,"Nine o'clock so I believe so i'm the 12 o'clock group because i'm in iowa so it's an hour before so that's why I have to sit and think like time wise so. me the group is that 11 but for her beach ball and I have a Tuesday group with her and I disagree with you. Just because I guess the groups that I facilitate are much different I don't know I mean I don't mean we definitely definitely talk about things, but it's never the same, and I do more and group, then you know rehash the past because rehashing the past over and over and over. isn't really. For anybody, you know it's more about you know what things are we going to do in the future, what things are going on now that are positive, what things are you struggling with how can we support you those kinds of things. um I don't know like I said i'm not saying it's the group, but maybe it maybe."
15316.0,Patient,"It might be, if my group was really it was more of a time issue, because when I work."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
15316.0,Patient,So.
