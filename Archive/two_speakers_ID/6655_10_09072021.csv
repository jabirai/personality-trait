6655.0,Patient,"Oh. Nothing I can think of, I mean. I use a lot of the tools, I. I get from that I was able to finally download that book that we use and group. So i've been reading through that too and that's helped with my anxiety. Okay fantastic, so I mean just come in a group and taking meds what I do. Do you want to make."
10.0,Provider,Maybe like a small.
6655.0,Patient,Commitment around anything. particular with regard to your. Anything really.
10.0,Provider,something to do with. Your exercise or your stress.
6655.0,Patient,"He diet is kind of hit miss to. friends, but i'm.

During her surprise, a luau retirement birthday her birthdays actually on Saturday to a now 11 so."
10.0,Provider,That sounds that sounds lovely.
6655.0,Patient,it's keeping me busy.
10.0,Provider,"Alright, so focused on that, right now, it sounds like maybe we can check back about a goal in the future, and you could just sit with it and see if there's something that coming up, because you know I think you said that you were just go ahead you're gonna say something."
6655.0,Patient,"Oh, I was gonna say probably something to focus like more to get my attention to stay on one thing, because I am so scattered brain that I would like to be able to like focus on one thing, but. With the add I know it's really hard to do that yeah so I don't know, maybe something around that keeping focus."
10.0,Provider,Would you like a suggestion or.
6655.0,Patient,"Yes, I will take any suggestions."
10.0,Provider,"All right, the key is consistency with the meditation So if you. are able to find a time like first thing when you wake up or right before you go to bed before bed sometimes harder, because you might be. A little tired or whatever, but and just sitting quietly for five minutes. or even three and just keep that pattern going. and commit to it that could make a big difference in your in your attention focus. Okay, so."
6655.0,Patient,"I usually do my meditation usually like I do do it before bed there's a certain when I watch on YouTube. it's like a little five minute meditation thing it's like a it's a breathing one so. I usually watch that before I go to bed so. Like everything. Not every night but most I would say most nights. Okay, so I usually watch or listen to music when I sleep. So I do that, like right before and and i'll switch it over to my music station."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will kind of do it more on daily, though. Yes, and try to. Maybe adopting a small city. In the morning as well. That really move that move the needle along as far as your. ability to focus and. Which cannabis, are you using right now."
6655.0,Patient,"i'm not that much actually. Maybe I usually do i'd smoke a little bit before bed. um let me write this down before I do forget. To focus. And usually we're like right when I wake up, maybe a couple times during the day."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so so about maybe three four times a day."
6655.0,Patient,Maybe if that. And that helps with the anxiety and sleep usually too.
10.0,Provider,"yeah so and that the thing is that it's going to be helpful, but it also can mess with your attention. So. it's kind of you're gonna have to weigh the risk benefit of that that medicine. yeah but at least bringing in the meditation could be helpful aspect and then maybe consider pushing the cannabis use to later in the day. see if you can get by in the morning with something else to keep you going and then just something to experiment with that could be helpful for the for the focus and the attention."
6655.0,Patient,I say if you're going to take away my coffee i'm sorry I quit. I will be evil.
10.0,Provider,Our plan is to continue all that you're doing with the exercise. physicals.
