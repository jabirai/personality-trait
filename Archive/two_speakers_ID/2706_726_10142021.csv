726.0,Provider,Okay.
2706.0,Patient,"yeah I was just I was doing it locally and children, there are three and two, so the local program I had to like go in once a week, and it was just a lot with two babies and their 10 months of core. yeah it was a lot."
726.0,Provider,"A lot, especially with the three in the two year old that's. A little."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah they're the same age for like two months from July to September they're both the same age, so it was just a lot, and they were little, and you know it was when coven just hit, and I was like packing them. In, for you know it was just. A long, I decided to go this route."
726.0,Provider,"yeah no I could I definitely this is much better than going every week to the same place, with little kids it's hard with little kids. Were you on like us suboxone or ma te Program."
2706.0,Patient,yeah I really well.
726.0,Provider,or methadone or.
2706.0,Patient,"suboxone was on subjects, because I was pregnant and then. I had my first baby and then I went to sub you tax or suboxone sorry, and then I got pregnant again like four weeks later, so I went back on the suboxone and then they turn on the shot called sub okay."
726.0,Provider,And okay.
2706.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't like it at all like I stopped I don't know if it was like I just got used to like taking the medicine, maybe it was a mind thing."
726.0,Provider,You know I don't have math.
2706.0,Patient,Let me get all so I had to like wait a month before I could you know start taking. yeah.
726.0,Provider,I feel like we have a group. together.
2706.0,Patient,What is it.
726.0,Provider,i'm that I feel like you were in. That that I have instance I think it's my. yeah.
2706.0,Patient,Every other every other Tuesday I do.
726.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. I was like. It looks familiar and then, when I saw you my case when I was like oh I don't have to do, like the intake thing it's just like an individual songs my gosh she's been here. Well i'm cassie. Tell me. How you're feeling so far on medication and if I feel feeling Okay, where you're at now."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah um I take what i'm on 24 milligrams a day um but sometimes like there's days when I don't need you know all of it, the way I do it is, I take a half, like, I think, have said it and i'm not a whole one. So some days I don't need like i'll have like a half leftover or whatever, but um where we live, I have to drive like an hour to get to a pharmacy. So that's good to have it like on days I have group."
726.0,Provider,Playing and I.
2706.0,Patient,"get my medicine that day like if I don't want to drive an hour to the pharmacy that day I can wait, you know, to the following day, so it kind of works. out but i've been on that dose. For like three and a half years so."
726.0,Provider,They took delivery I know some faces will deliver medication. On the drive.
2706.0,Patient,"They do deliver within like the city limits and I don't think they deliver like controlled substances, I mean they might but. it's in a whole different rounds in a different county."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2706.0,Patient,"All kinds of pharmacy like and it's so crazy because I actually have a pharmacy it's like right across the street from my house. But when I joined bright heart, they said they didn't feel comfortable doing telemedicine, for a doctor that was out of Florida, because it was Dr jamison at the time. But then my brother joined the program and he got his medicine there, so it was kind of like."
726.0,Provider,that's all Could you ask the doctor and see if it's possible now because it's changed.
2706.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I could That would be a lot easier for me like I can literally walk to my medicine, especially know the watchers the roads are getting bad and i'm already like a frantic driver anyway, like I go 15 miles with speed limit like i'm scared. But um yeah it would be easier, but then i'm afraid like if they don't do it, and then like I won't be able to get my medicine back at the pharmacy. That you know, I was because I was like grandfathered in like they're not accepting new suboxone patient for the pharmacy that I do good you know. So I was grandfathered in because i've been there, so long. So maybe I can just like not say nothing to my current pharmacy. And just try to have my prescription Code into the one by my house that way they wouldn't even you know."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I would see because, like if the doctor can talk to them, just because you have like little kids and then having to drive a full hour just to get medication that's a two hour tread. isn't like I mean. yeah I mean worst case scenario is they say to you, you know week I can't send it to that pharmacy but um you know I knew I could ask them because. I think pharmacies, is it the same pharmacy just a different town."
2706.0,Patient,"No it's a different form, you see."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, because I think sometimes some pharmacies will be in network so there's like were like medications and stuff like that, but it's worth asking and, like the worst thing I see is no, but I think. Just because you have a three year old if you have a place for across the street basically. You know what's the harm in asking."
2706.0,Patient,"And like I get all my other medications they're like my you know blood pressure, medicine and you know it's not like, I just want to get my controlled substance there you know."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2706.0,Patient,I guess it is worth a shot.
726.0,Provider,Like that's my show me like the roads are getting that.
2706.0,Patient,"The roads are going to start getting back because he drives semi and he's gone like four or five weeks at a time. You know, so when it gets nervous when I have to drive that far, I mean I know the roads aren't bad now but yeah like a whole day you know I gotta get him dressed get them ready package to get them. Will pack them drinks like it's just. and make it happen."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I gotta die all day. Long girl, if you could get it. close to your House like."
2706.0,Patient,"know. I know I don't have the physician joy, but that's who my brother hands. or had again."
726.0,Provider,"Programming or whatever doctor so. she's really she's really she's really good it's not possible to do it, I know that she'd say. Something I don't think she would ever be steer you in the wrong direction at all, so you could ask her and just see what she says about it, but I think it's worth a try because. yeah if you have a little babies i'd be like Oh, my goodness."
2706.0,Patient,they're boys and they're ornery oh my gosh they're so on.
726.0,Provider,They don't.
2706.0,Patient,They don't go to daycare anything yet so i'm like you know just a lot like i'm even going to the grocery store.
726.0,Provider,"Oh gosh. Do they do delivery service for that I know like. In where I live, where I live in cool been hit it was like I could order. Like let's say a shopping list because walmart was just like cheaper to get certain things I would or something and have the drive and pick up where they just put it in your. surroundings yeah I mean it's worth it, because I have a little kids too so it's just a lot easier to do it that way."
2706.0,Patient,yeah i'm here there's not even like i'm a grub hub or there's no type of like. Delivery there's nothing we have a kroger and it's like the smallest program and the entire world like if you Google it. Like yeah there's like four aisles yeah it's an opponent yeah it's crazy. And there's like one restaurant it's McDonalds it like there's no options we get McDonalds are.
726.0,Provider,You born and raised. Here you.
2706.0,Patient,"know, I was born and raised in Columbus which is like you know, a big city so yeah moving down here, it was like oh my gosh was different definitely a change."
726.0,Provider,i'm sure if you used to sit every time you have access to pretty much anything you might need. yeah.
2706.0,Patient,"Like after when we do go, you know to zanesville which is like an hour when. We like buy everything involved, like the pull ups, we buy in bulk. Even down here but it's like $11. For a pack of like wanting to pull up you know it's just. yeah you know they're taking advantage of the situation."
726.0,Provider,"I. thought they are I bet. Well, please talk to on your next minute, let me check right now with your next appointment and his."
2706.0,Patient,"doctor, so I believe it's on the 28th."
726.0,Provider,"The night, the group is on the 19th and the bed is on the 28th."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm all have group see the way it is is like every other group, because I get a whole month script. So, like a glitch a group on this weekend didn't need medicine, so in two weeks, when I have group again my medicines do so I don't know, maybe I can send her a personal message like."
726.0,Provider,"Probably some term message, or something just to let her know."
2706.0,Patient,"Like me, because every. pharmacy because I don't want it to be a thing, where like i'm trying to the pharmacy here and they're like no and then I can't get Ahold of nobody to send it back to my you know regular pharmacy because I can transfer your."
726.0,Provider,prescriptions like that.
2706.0,Patient,"Well, I just want to make sure I can get Ahold of somebody. yeah."
726.0,Provider,Do you like your brother has he ever had an issue that his medication.
2706.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh. No he met with Julie. And she was like well hold on like she put him on hold and she called drivers and was like."
726.0,Provider,You know.
2706.0,Patient,"For us well it's prescription for him, and they were like yeah and they gave him his suboxone and I think he got some sort of like benzo."
726.0,Provider,So he got like.
2706.0,Patient,"New controlled substances there so. They did it for him. And he's no longer like with the program so maybe that's a spot that opened up, because I know that pharmacies can only have so many suboxone patients and just."
726.0,Provider,"What I could do cassie and I can send Dr cell message I can't guarantee that she'll get back to it right away because she's been a lot of groups for for one or the other prescribers so. I know that she's busy like she always has. like an appointment, so, if I can send her a message just let her know that I touch base with you, and that we talked about possibly two possibilities possibility to. get your medications at a different pharmacy and so, for her to just commit like touch base with you, I know you have an appointment that's when the aid but. It might be possible that you could get it sooner than that, I would even call virtual and see if you can see her a little bit if there's any openings at all before that date."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah and even if I have to switch like to the strips like I can it doesn't matter to me, really, you know. If it's a strips it doesn't."
726.0,Provider,"it's better that we do it. Like now it's October, but we I, preferably for this change to happen, I wouldn't think that it should happen before Christmas time it's going to because that's when it starts getting a lot colder. And then the CES so. i'll um i'll make a note to. send her a message Okay, and I will let her know that you're interested in changing your pharmacy which pharmacy is it that is your House."
2706.0,Patient,it's shriver's it's us HR I ve R s.
726.0,Provider,And is it i'm okay and what's the city and. The urine.
2706.0,Patient,"But connersville mcc do n N, ie ll s VI ll E it's so long for such a small town."
726.0,Provider,Ohio right. yeah okay.
2706.0,Patient,i'll have a phone number. If you have the phone number I know it by heart.
726.0,Provider,Already down what's the phone number. 740962 yeah 255240962255.
2706.0,Patient,"yeah and like I said, like i'm already a patient there you know, so I don't. know why problem Viagra. my brother my brother was on the video with Julie and then as soon as he hung up he walked right down there and God as medicine went on, you know about his day and he's not getting there and more because he decided to go to detox and he didn't want to be on stubs and whatever."
726.0,Provider,bad experience at the pharmacy at all what they saw communication.
2706.0,Patient,"But she had called but see I think Julie, is a prescriber out of Ohio right."
726.0,Provider,"Now I just met Julie, yes, like, for the first time, yesterday, because I, my groups I work with other doctors and she was from yet so I don't i'm not sure."
2706.0,Patient,"Because I know the issue with Dr jamison was she was a prescriber out of Florida, so they were you know it's just that skeptical and whatever, but now I. I don't. Maybe since covert hit and a lot of things are telemedicine now because it's just it's a little family own pharmacy like there's. Two there's one here and then there's one now so in there really small."
726.0,Provider,"Well awesome also turn email and i'll send her my sense. I don't know how quickly should she can get back to you, but at least you just know that I will be something credits information that you gave me."
2706.0,Patient,"So it has a possibility yeah cuz I mean I don't think it'll be in the show, with just the case. yeah if she calls and just said she's from bright heart because no matter what the prescriber is i'm sure it also has great heart right."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah. yeah I mean so it's like.
2706.0,Patient,Returning yeah so I don't know what. i'd be a lot easier for me a lot easier.
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well listen, you have three V to bb so. yeah anything an hour drive Oh, my goodness i've and then they get stir crazy in the car. And they want to get out of their car seats at."
2706.0,Patient,The age where they can like push the button like they're pushing your buttons yeah so it's a it's a freaking mess it's a mess in my car. And I funny oh my God they fight. I should have had twins like it would have been easier if I did it because I was pregnant for like. 40 months or wait 18 months straight.
726.0,Provider,"I was the button, the recovery, the body recovery."
2706.0,Patient,"I have something called a by corneal uterus I guess like where I basically have like two years so. i'd have. First C section, it was good, the second C section it wasn't my normal doctor that didn't. So they got me like up and down. So. A big cross on my stomach it's like one goes this way one goes this way and that way was healed yet so they put like this tubing it was like a white cane, and the second one I didn't really. recover for like I needed a pain meds and all that from the second one, but my first like a breeze I was up the next day walking. We were also in the hospital long time because my son, you know he had withdrawals pretty pretty bad, but my second son we didn't have any rituals at all, and I was on the same to. la and that's crazy. Like I didn't do you know I didn't do anything different. I mean I. know I should know, but I smoke cigarettes, when I was pregnant I drink coffee caffeine, I mean there was nothing I did different with either."
726.0,Provider,"yeah wow. So, but like developmentally are they pretty similar the kids now."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah i'm actually my younger my younger son the didn't have any withdrawals he's like really smart like when it comes to like toys and putting things together. But my older son he's more like physically active smart like he can jump over things easier like they're both really smart. But in different areas like my anger, he can talk better than my older son."
726.0,Provider,Oh.
2706.0,Patient,Okay yeah like those different things yeah.
726.0,Provider,"It might be too I don't know like you know how like the first kid it's like it's just them an. Adult and sometimes the second baby it's like Oh, I have another kid to play with so they catch on quicker I. found that the second kid catches on quicker than the first one, because the first one is like okay that and then there with a bunch of adults so um, so I think it's kind of a benefit, like the second kid gets to see the other kids and we want to catch up to them yeah."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah like i'll give my older son something for breakfast and then i'll get my younger son same thing. And my older son will be like no yucky. And then it is something that my younger son eat and he'll just say no yucky. Because my older son said it, and he."
726.0,Provider,"Was yeah he was like. cassie it was awesome to talk to you. Today, and. i'll send a. message."
2706.0,Patient,You want to say hi say hi This is my older son.
726.0,Provider,He decided to front.
2706.0,Patient,"teeth removed, and this is my younger son."
726.0,Provider,wow it is so cute.
2706.0,Patient,"They look, just like don't say. My older son was on the bottle for a really long time and that's another thing like I don't. Know maybe he needs that because of the withdrawal, I mean I know he's not still going through it, but it was more like a comfort. Time. She sees."
726.0,Provider,"he's happy to. yeah we don't want to what you could do to answer like. He still on the bottle. or no. He all Okay, I would what I would do is I would. You know, have people take her off of medication. For him off of the bottle, so I would start with like like giving him a bottle in the morning and like and then maybe like have less of the bottle access and trying to give him the sippy cups because his front T you know it's not good for the T. Like for the development. Of the whatever I don't know."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah so even when the doctor. yeah like even when his adult teeth come in, if he keeps stuffing that bottle they're going to grow like upwards. And dumpling. that's what i'm trying to give them like sugar free stuff and the bottle or like. He wants milk at night time so i'm giving them like mostly water just enough. To color the water."
726.0,Provider,"So, leaving it, especially at night, if you give them milk, make sure you're brushing their teeth, because they can get those milk cavities but. But try to wean him off of the clock you don't have to go cold Turkey some kids are grateful, Turkey, you can just. Like remove it and make it invisible like it doesn't exist or even with a bakey I know I used to do this with my son I would give him the binky in the. Only for naptime only for sleep just select he could get off the habit of having it so just if you try to wean him off and my work and then you just find things to replace it with to like get him, you know. he's not thinking about it all the time."
2706.0,Patient,"Like during the day he doesn't get one it's like at night. He wants it to fall asleep, so what i've been doing, I put the juice in the sippy cup and I put water in the bottle so like if he wants the bottle he's going to drink water. You know yeah that's good that's good that's a nice one."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2706.0,Patient,And my younger son he doesn't care either way he never took a binky he doesn't care about a bottle. He wants a regular. He wants a regular big boy.
