741.0,Provider,Know sometimes.
9825.0,Patient,i'm really.
741.0,Provider,"Actually, sometimes it is the best. Because you don't put yourself in a position. To mess up."

741.0,Provider,Not having one.
9825.0,Patient,"I got fired because I got exposed to somebody who had coven so I had to quarantine and then like a month and a half later I got exposed to someone else. Again, and they just got tired of it and fired me. For missing any day."
741.0,Provider,Okay okay. that's kind of a rough spot because it's not something that you have a whole lot of power over is it.
9825.0,Patient,"No, I definitely didn't want stay at home."
741.0,Provider,"Right and. And we mean if you. are exposed to it because somebody else was exposed. it's not like you control that can. Control that other person yeah. i'm not, I think that you really have control over is your behavior and there's only so much isolation, you can do. So do a pretty good."
9825.0,Patient,amount i'm pretty good at that.
741.0,Provider,yeah yeah. Okay. So did you get tested.
9825.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And maybe you have it.
9825.0,Patient,"No. No Okay, I think i'm immune to it. Have you had the vaccine no that's it that's what the doctor doctor said they think I got a natural immunity."
741.0,Provider,Well that's good.
9825.0,Patient,"Like i've been around people who had it really, really bad and. And haven't got enough."
741.0,Provider,wow that is a blessing. That is a major blessing so i've had it twice.
9825.0,Patient,Have you.
741.0,Provider,"yeah it's rough. Finally, after the second one, I was like I went and got a vaccine. That was like no i'm not playing with this anymore."
9825.0,Patient,"sounds worried about the back thing you know, because you never know what. you hear all the time, you know they didn't find out. The effects of talcum powder, you know for 30 years."
741.0,Provider,"Right now, I cancer."
9825.0,Patient,"And you know what's gonna happen, you know there's gonna be some ill effects from it there's been some from everything."
741.0,Provider,"Oh yeah they're always it that you I mean. For the most part, if we can COP can create it. Then we have the potential to make a mistake. And yeah. The way I look at it is. There isn't anything in our atmosphere that doesn't cause cancer."
9825.0,Patient,very true.
741.0,Provider,"I mean, how many things. How many things in our atmosphere do not cause cancer. I think even our food. unfertilized and. protected by all the chemicals and stuff I think even that can mutate and create cancer and that."
9825.0,Patient,"If we're not careful, I think that cancer just ends up being a generalized term for something that the doctors. You know just explain it really."
741.0,Provider,right away there's that much stuff.
9825.0,Patient,That causes it.
741.0,Provider,i'm really wanting to mass who has cancer is a mutation of cells in the body that's all it is. yeah and.
9825.0,Patient,They don't know.
741.0,Provider,"I mean I ourselves me take naturally anyway. So. All right, well let's look at that lovely. um. worksheet that I sent you. i'm. relapses are. Usually the very end part the actual picking up of the drink or the drug or whatever addictive behavior it is that's the end of the relapse process. It starts out. In our head thinking about stuff. i'm. In waves it's probably not very healthy. So. Of the. Things that you tell yourself have you relapse previously."
9825.0,Patient,yeah. yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,What were some of the things that you thought about before he relapsed.
9825.0,Patient,I notice a negative in my thinking. Telling myself that things. That I normally wouldn't be okay with or okay.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
9825.0,Patient,hey even just generalized stuff you know. I noticed a down thinking.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
9825.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's down thinking, like my like my moral compass goes down a notch."
741.0,Provider,"So you lower your standards. yeah okay. um I noticed one of the things that that. for lack of a better term I got a Fuck it attitude. um. That it didn't matter anyway, that I would tell myself that it didn't matter anyhow. um. Another another one of those things. That I did was. told myself that nobody would know. And why I thought, nobody would know. is beyond me because everybody knew, when I was using because I don't have right."
9825.0,Patient,yeah i've never i've never had a as you. can see like I don't go around a lot of people so.
741.0,Provider,"Now, when I am when I start using I don't go around nobody."
9825.0,Patient,that's been given anyone generally.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so you."
9825.0,Patient,"know, no one would know."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
9825.0,Patient,But I do tell myself that i've earned it like it's somehow a reward for you know being good and. And thinking about it when you're clean it's just like it's what. I earned get myself back into some bullshit because I kept myself out of symbols that stupid.
741.0,Provider,"Right right exactly exactly. um The other thing that I usually tell myself is that one won't hurt and I don't know i've never done one of anything. I don't ever stop at one. um but you're right um the negativity the um the idea that it's somehow a reward for staying out of trouble or for worse for not creating more trouble for yourself. that's just insane. um. So that's good that you're really aware of that negative. And the negativity and that the lowering of standard. i'm there they're also emotions and attitudes that change like I said, you know I get that that effort attitude um. So it sounds like you kind of get that same attitude of i'm."
9825.0,Patient,normally have that.
741.0,Provider,normally do okay.
9825.0,Patient,"Yes, oh the care what people think too much, but then I do you know there's I guess there's a part of us that always does, but generally, I mean my life. well trained up flush it down the drain is mine."
741.0,Provider,"yeah, but there are probably a handful like maybe one or two, even as people that. You care about what they think."
9825.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And then I don't know about you, but it would bother me that that that one or two people. will be disappointed in me if I used again."
9825.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,there's always at least a connection to one or two people. um. So I do yeah the attitude the negative attitude and the on. The thought that somebody else important I mean i'm we're talking about somebody who is.
9825.0,Patient,"Important in my life, who I value their attitude and and and their ideas and."
741.0,Provider,"Their the way they see me. i'm i'm not talking about just anybody out there. And if that were to change that would really bother me and. And I think that if I use that there are. A couple of people that it would really bother me that would be very disappointed. The other I the other place is um. clear differences between actively addicted person's lifestyle and a recovering person's lifestyle. and You said that you self isolate all the time yeah. I don't I I do more now because of colby but um. I don't engage in manipulation and i'm i'm generally very honest if you find that i'm being dishonest then i'm headed down the road that. And secretiveness. People will start asking me questions and I get real secretive and defensive sums up. Something that. i'm. The one thing that I always notice that I have to look out for is being resentful I start getting resentful i'm sorry I mean just start looking around at my part. And i'm because resent resentment will lead me right back out there. I don't know about you, but if you get mad at people. and feel like they've done you wrong what's better excuse to go huge."
9825.0,Patient,I see naturally just assume they're going to do me wrong anyway. And more disappointed when they don't.
741.0,Provider,Okay that's that's reverse psychology there I guess. um. So what common behavior pattern. Do i'm. Using people practice. There are different. than people who are are not using.
9825.0,Patient,What do you mean what.
741.0,Provider,Well okay let's just put it this way okay if you're working for a living. You have a certain time that you go to bed and a certain time that you get so that you can go to your job right.
9825.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so people who are actively using. pretty much fly by the seat of their pants right they do what they want, when they want right."
9825.0,Patient,Most people yeah there's a certain there's a select few that just knowing about life and you would never even know they were using.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, what is that, as I know full blown addict."
9825.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah. Definitely there, but she goes to work every day, and you would never even know. wow if you."
741.0,Provider,Are people out there who will be. Who who can do that they're like functional addicts or functional out well. I was not one of those people so it's like really hard for me to.
9825.0,Patient,I am until it gets away for me. It usually takes a while to get away from me.
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9825.0,Patient,Usually goes on pretty pretty long for gets away.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, but the fact is that, eventually, it does."
9825.0,Patient,Oh yeah it gets in the way.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. So, as long as you're following some sort of schedule. you're eating regularly. you're taking care of your physical needs. Your emotional needs. Their chances are you're probably not using. Maybe. yeah. Some other common addictive patterns are irritability anxiety depression. Self pity. i'm in defiance. You experience any of those when you're using. or before you use."
9825.0,Patient,"Your credibility. yeah yeah. With that one a lot. Okay, when something doesn't go right."
741.0,Provider,yeah that's awesome Nick self centeredness kicks. yeah I guess. And if I don't get my way around but I saw a hissy fit.
9825.0,Patient,"it's insane. it's thinking about it, you know just thinking about."
741.0,Provider,la where does that come from.
9825.0,Patient,I don't know. it's got to be from the drugs it's got to be from that net craving they're need. overpowering everything else or nothing else man.
741.0,Provider,"The thing of it is, is that we experienced that even without using."
9825.0,Patient,yeah we think.
741.0,Provider,On a daily basis don't we.
9825.0,Patient,"Yes, how many."
741.0,Provider,How many times in a week do things not go your way and you get bent out of shape.
9825.0,Patient,"I think you just gotta clear you gotta clear it's like a scale Okay, and just waiting and waiting and waiting on and you got to find some way to clear the days. You know, craft it's been weighing on the scale. that's telling me go ahead and do it, why not do it."
741.0,Provider,"Right. Well, I I venture to say who says that we got to get our way."
9825.0,Patient,We were selfish people anyway.
741.0,Provider,"Right, but why not somebody else's way why why isn't somebody else's way better."
9825.0,Patient,"really comes down to it, when it comes down to that point is it someone else's way, or is it your way. it's still your way, whether you choose to go ahead and live this way or that way. Either way, is still your way, depending on what day it is. But."
741.0,Provider,"I mean, if I can live sober."
9825.0,Patient,Because it makes you know me happy or the people around me happy. I mean it's still.
741.0,Provider,it's still your choice. it's still you choosing the way that you want what's important basically what it amounts to. As you choose what's important to you.
9825.0,Patient,Sure we're something you could just erase it or. Make it so easy to get you hooked you know.
741.0,Provider,Right. But that's our society's remedy for everything.
9825.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I mean How else do we get addicted to drugs, there are some magic something that's going to make it all go away and make it better. But that's not how it works. We. have to change the way we think."
9825.0,Patient,"It is, I mean before someone told me that I, you know, was a drug addict or that I had guilt for all the things that I did. I didn't know I did so did I really have guilt. I mean."
741.0,Provider,"I don't know, did you."
9825.0,Patient,Did you feel okay about what was pointed out and connected the depth of what the. Feelings were didn't really exist when I was a good day.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, let me ask you this, are you comfortable in your own skin."
9825.0,Patient,i've never been comfortable in my own skin and i'll never be. Drug free or like. None of that change because i'm not using right now nothing's changed.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
9825.0,Patient,I actually I get some sleep and I actually eat a meal every now and then. But.
741.0,Provider,So that's different.
9825.0,Patient,yeah that's. really changed.
741.0,Provider,"So it is being in recovery, not better. not really."
9825.0,Patient,"I don't know if it's better or worse, it feels like nothing's changed."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
9825.0,Patient,"i'm living so what's the stable, I mean. we're."
741.0,Provider,"Far more stable. Okay, so is that better or not."
9825.0,Patient,well.
741.0,Provider,stability.
9825.0,Patient,"Well, I guess, I just don't know what I value, you know."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, maybe."
9825.0,Patient,"Is this I don't know I guess i've used for so long for so long, these things I don't think about you know I don't. know."
741.0,Provider,You are you move around on autopilot.
9825.0,Patient,yeah that's honestly what it feels like yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. What is a possibility, if we take you off autopilot. and think about the things that you value. And then start making a plan to go after those things that you value."
9825.0,Patient,Do you take me off autopilot.
741.0,Provider,well. that's gonna be having. your mind your body i'm your emotions. That means that you gotta you actually got to think about what you're doing before you do it. That even something you want to do.
9825.0,Patient,Not even sure if that's something I can do.
741.0,Provider,yeah you can. But you gotta want to. that's the difference. If you're okay on autopilot you're not going to follow.
9825.0,Patient,never knew there was anything different.
741.0,Provider,Well yeah you wanna you wanna. Live intensely or um. and have a passionate life or do you just want to walk around on our pilot. Where everything's pretty much the same.
9825.0,Patient,"don't think i've ever known in any other way, so."
741.0,Provider,"what's the possibility. What are the infinite possibilities out there, if you were to come off as I don't play it. Sunday."
9825.0,Patient,What are the infinite terrible things that could happen to. me.
741.0,Provider,there's positive as well.
9825.0,Patient,sent me to panic attack.
741.0,Provider,"No, no, no, no, no, but. There are. As many positives or negatives."
9825.0,Patient,I can't stay in order in pizza. Tina go off auto.
741.0,Provider,sila get your tail off of there. So yeah I mean just. I challenge you. To. Think about the things that you value in your life. And the things that you value that aren't in your life. make a list of them and then we can talk about our next time.
9825.0,Patient,that's weird.
741.0,Provider,i'm a very challenging I don't know.
9825.0,Patient,I just feel like this is always been the way it is and. I can't imagine any other way.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
9825.0,Patient,Wake up do what you gotta do weight go to sleep wake up this.
741.0,Provider,morning.
9825.0,Patient,"It is, but its life and its to live with it, you suck it up we're glad you got both your legs."
741.0,Provider,But why does there's a more passionate way to Liz.
9825.0,Patient,definitely something to think about. How are you can do that.
741.0,Provider,Right.
9825.0,Patient,Everyone.
741.0,Provider,Everybody doesn't live on autopilot.
9825.0,Patient,screwed me all the way up.
741.0,Provider,know. there's a whole range of other. lifestyles and. feeling and. yeah there's a wide range of stuff out there. And just imagine what you might accomplish not living on autopilot.
9825.0,Patient,I can do some pretty destructive stuff on autopilot so I could just imagine what I could do. Positive.
741.0,Provider,"Positive stuff not on autopilot. And what's the possibility that you might want to do more positive, not on auto pilot because you're not bored."
9825.0,Patient,let's feel like it can't.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's where we need to start unit delay your brain know and your body know that you can do positive thing. But because if you're capable of negative you're full of positive. there's two sides to every coin."
9825.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,So what kind of plans do you have for the next week or two. To. find a job.
9825.0,Patient,I got a bunch I got a bunch that i've got lined up.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
9825.0,Patient,"I got man i'm at a point where a file for the unemployment and it's coming in, but they put the past, you know, three weeks on hold because they need to verify my identity, yet again, for the third time. Of course, but like I need that money. Go to."
741.0,Provider,hmm.
9825.0,Patient,"So it's not like I can just jump into a job, right now, because then that would mess up everything that's coming in, and I would have to wait two weeks to get any money."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
9825.0,Patient,"So, like I don't want it to be that way, I want to go to work, I want to get the hell out of the House, but."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
9825.0,Patient,there's a lot of things that are positive about that there's i've got a lot of positive things in place.
741.0,Provider,Good good. Care to share some of them.
9825.0,Patient,"Care to share some listen. there's just a lot of factories around where I live, that you know are always hiring. Never. was never really too much in in doubt about getting a job."
741.0,Provider,"that's good, are you gotta do is you willing to wear."
9825.0,Patient,yeah that's never ever been an issue for me.
741.0,Provider,"away from what I can tell. there's a lot of dogs out there, because people don't want to work."
9825.0,Patient,yeah that's what they say.
741.0,Provider,wow why that blows me away.
9825.0,Patient,"I was on unemployment at the time when they shut every day like when it shut down I got on unemployment, so I was collecting the big paychecks and it makes sense, I mean it makes sense, I was bringing home $900 a week. wow doing nothing, so why, why would I go anywhere."
741.0,Provider,Right.
9825.0,Patient,Like that's a poor career move.
741.0,Provider,yeah.
9825.0,Patient,So I mean they really did.
741.0,Provider,"It makes me wonder. Why, we would help why we should help is that makes people not want to take care of themselves."
9825.0,Patient,"yeah, but they should they went too far, they should have gave people exactly what they were making it their job that's it. Exactly, nothing more, nothing less because if you're supporting yourself, then. you're going to continue to do that. I certainly did not need $900 a week."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
9825.0,Patient,"I mean their unemployment, so they know exactly what you're making because they do a percentage of it. Right so just in your system change it from 30% 60% whatever it is you do and just put it that 100% there you go goes through. They made it all complicated when it didn't need to be."
741.0,Provider,Well that's what government does isn't it. kind of. crap out of stuff.
9825.0,Patient,very true. Everybody that people would have.
741.0,Provider,I mean give everybody minimum wage.
9825.0,Patient,minimum wage job as well. But now it's great but. yeah you can't. play more than.
741.0,Provider,You give.
9825.0,Patient,"I went back to work, seven months before that money even ended. Just because I couldn't sit at home, so I like to think that a lot more people are like me then not you know. right because I just didn't want to sit at home anymore, I could have stayed home and collected projects i'd be doing great right now, if I had done that. right but it's just not who I am."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
9825.0,Patient,I don't want your free money because it comes at a cost.
741.0,Provider,It does come at a cost.
9825.0,Patient,and
741.0,Provider,yeah and cost my. Self worth.
9825.0,Patient,yeah but were you were. Here we got much that.
741.0,Provider,I knew. I mean for me to sit around and take money. for doing nothing when i'm fully well capable of working.
9825.0,Patient,yeah but it gives you time to work on yourself too.
741.0,Provider,yeah. I can work on myself and work at the. same time. cuz if I really want to work on me i'm gonna work on me whether i'm working or.
9825.0,Patient,"Not I think a lot of good stuff came from it, but. Because there's a lot of businesses that are doing things were different now they had to think out of the box and that's all."
741.0,Provider,yeah I agree. yeah I think a lot of people are thinking i'm trying to be innovative and do things different.
9825.0,Patient,"lot of people who started, you know at home businesses. mm hmm the side hustle is something now you know so. A lot of good came from it."
741.0,Provider,"Sorry, my cat is my."
