She would call me about every other weekend be like how you doing how's everything going. You know. she's like okay well have you called anyone like she'll call for me. yeah and be like, and so I had a referral from my doctor my my primary doctor. To see a gyn."

You just need to just give them a call and set your appointment she goes I can't do that I got everything cleared she goes I don't know who it was she goes all they had to do was just typing your number into the computer and it would show when insurance, you have."
724.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
5197.0,Patient,"So that's what she does so, like let's say I have issues she's the reason why i'm seeing you she's the reason why i'm with. bright heart health. yeah reason why. Because everywhere, I would go they were like Oh, we don't take your insurance or oh we're closed or office or all that. yeah finally she called me, you know what couple years ago and was like, would you be willing to do a virtual thing, and I was like yes, and she said okay I got somewhere that we can sign you up we I got I approved it. You know that, even though it's because it's out of state. I had to improve it, she was like I approved it for you don't worry about it."
724.0,Provider,that's an awesome doctor.
5197.0,Patient,"yeah well she's like. she's kind of like a care navigator. But her job is to work for the client so she her job. If you. Give us the information for that what we what what we're covered for so like let's say. i'm only going to the doctor, but my insurance will cover physical therapy her job is to notify me you realize that you qualify for physical therapy. Okay, and then i'd. be like oh I didn't know that."
724.0,Provider,that's awesome.
5197.0,Patient,"i'll send you the links this is how you sign up she's the reason why I signed up for the food program every week. she's also the reason why i'm finding out about like over the counter. Like tear. She was like that didn't mark that. box on your file, they just didn't market. Because. of my age i'm not on medic i'm not on Molina because i'm over 65. i'm on it, because i'm disabled. yeah so there's a different tier for people that are disabled. And that is what they had me on the 65 and over to you're not the one that's for the disabled people under 65 oh."
724.0,Provider,My God.
5197.0,Patient,"So she's like it's a matter of i'm checking this box and checking that box and now you qualify now I qualify for so much from my eyes transportation I get over the counter medicine, you know. yeah so i'm i'm. awesome i'm excited about that, but then of course the program changed again so. But yeah i'm i'm doing okay i'm just i'm in a lot of physical pain."
724.0,Provider,Okay.
5197.0,Patient,Like a lot of physical pain.
724.0,Provider,When it has it when did it start to feel more intense the pain.
5197.0,Patient,"That a week it's been happening all week i'm where i'm in bed crying you know cuz you know higher in bed, and you might turn and you toss a u turn or whatever. And i'll turn and all of a sudden my whole side, where my ribs are I feel like someone beat me up, I feel like i'm recuperating from broken ribs or bruised ribs, to the point when I wake up my whole chest is dry and i'm coughing. And yeah it's."
724.0,Provider,Yours do you think it was like. You think your emotions are showing up physically from our labs because last time we talked about that generational stuff and I wonder if you're releasing if your body's releasing a lot of it and that's an energetic standpoint. Right yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"On the energetic standpoint, I think that there's a lot coming out in my body. You know, understanding, like why I haven't been able to sleep. If that's energetically, you know. Because we're coming with another retrograde so it's like."
724.0,Provider,Oh that's right yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"So I understand the spiritual side of it um. But then. There are those things that are going on that i'm kind of like. Well, like Okay, and this is strange, but I did kind of want to ask you this. I know you're. Not a medical doctor um but. I do notice something okay. yeah that. The less sexual. endorphins i'll put it that way, the sexual endorphins The more I heard the more my body starts to it's almost like it starts to break down it's hard to explain but it's almost like i'm. Like I I rust. Like if you have a can you don't ride the bike or."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,don't drive the car. haha you know. Like more than turning it on and turning it off. yay so turning it on and turning it off would be like. masturbating. i'm sorry i'm. Getting too.
724.0,Provider,"Late, no, no. No, no, no."
5197.0,Patient,Like masturbating right. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But have you been doing less of those things. Oh, my God."
5197.0,Patient,"I have not had sex at all in four years so Okay, so my i'm trying to like i'm trying to do it in that kind of it's almost like Okay, so you know, like if you drive a car. Right yeah it keeps it oiled and the motor."
724.0,Provider,running.
5197.0,Patient,"But if you turn it on and turn it off. If you can still rush, you have. It on and drive it around the block and."
724.0,Provider,Again yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"Right it gets to a point where, when you need to drive it. It won't move. matches the gears are like the rusted and the tire Okay, so if you can. Think of it that way right. yeah okay so it's like i'm turning my car on. And i'm turning it off. I mandate. But yeah. yeah not driving me around the corner and perking me again yeah so."
724.0,Provider,"So my question would be, is it that I mean other than I know it has happened, but is it that you're. Not you don't want to have. No, I."
5197.0,Patient,"want to have sex. Okay, so is he."
724.0,Provider,So so.
5197.0,Patient,i'll put it.
724.0,Provider,That.
5197.0,Patient,"way i'm particular before in my past my addiction I didn't care if I never really got to this point where. Like my body is breaking down yeah. Yes, i've never went that long without having some physical interaction some. yeah some form. yeah so but I have. I have went bit of periods of time without having physical sex. yeah okay even being in a relationship and not having that physical whatever. yeah my body starts. To react this way. Oh, my body starts to cramp up it's kind of like how men always talk about blue balls well blue balls is an actual scientifically thing. Men. If they do not release they actually do their testicle swell up. to the point, they are not able to ejaculate, and that is where the blue balls isn't it hurts. yeah Okay, so it is a physical real thing guys always talk about blue balls and girls are like I you just want to have sex but it's actually men have to release."
724.0,Provider,Is that how you feel.
5197.0,Patient,That oh yeah that's exactly how.
724.0,Provider,I got.
5197.0,Patient,to the point where I start throwing up because the pain hurts so bad.
724.0,Provider,Oh.
5197.0,Patient,"Like I am swollen. Inside like i've had i've went to doctors, I had this one doctor she no longer is with me anymore, because she's kind of went to private practice she got married you know."
724.0,Provider,That yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"And what coven she decided to go back over to Nigeria with her husband. and help with a lot of. Families out there. yeah but she put me through all these different tests and she actually she actually told me, I have a form of blue balls that my nights swell up and they get so swollen that the glands or whatever."
724.0,Provider,yeah like.
5197.0,Patient,"she's like the only way we could release she was if we milked your glands and i'm like what is that. Like is not sound fun. yeah that's when she explained to me that, because of the swelling this but I don't have a uterus anymore, so that is why the pain is like so bad because there's nothing to pressure against it so like if your uterus and then you get swollen. and have your uterus to protect you kind of. yeah and then she explained that, as you masturbate with the uterus your body will naturally start to release through the masturbation. Okay Okay, but she said you don't have a uterus anymore so technically you're slowing with no muscle to release yourself. Right, so if you don't have that physical penetration."
724.0,Provider,I am telling me this and i'm like.
5197.0,Patient,"So you mean what i've been feeling and describing of what it feels like is actually true and she's like yes so she had put this wanting me to measure it and she was like Do you realize your body's doing key lords are not key lloyd's kick chemicals chemicals whatever those monster. drinks in your muscle yeah my body doesn't, naturally, but what happens is. i'm actually coming on myself like, but it will stop. Because uterus I have no uterus for it to. relax it."
724.0,Provider,yeah that.
5197.0,Patient,makes sense.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so so what. What do you want to do about that now I wanted you. I mean, is it the same thing, like if you have toys or something like. That i'm trying to think like so."
5197.0,Patient,I don't.
724.0,Provider,"That part is that's that's awful to feel like that, like over your body to feel like that constantly does, that was not feel good."
5197.0,Patient,"No, no that's why sometimes I just sit and cry. And it's not because. That it's not it's because i'm in so much pain, it just and then it oozes out of me, and I have to wear pads because. yeah imagine being on a menstrual with no blood and it just. Like you're peeing on yourself it's yeah. crazy, so the upswing about it is."
724.0,Provider,Is.
5197.0,Patient,i'm constantly smelling sweet because it's valuable justice right.
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,But the side effect of it is the pain and you get like a diaper rash kind of.
724.0,Provider,All yc yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"Because you're constantly moist. Now, and."
724.0,Provider,Oh wow.
5197.0,Patient,"So that's how I learned to this female doctor, to find out what can I do because it's also throwing my hormones off."
724.0,Provider,"Well, why don't you try one of your tried like vibrators and see if that works. or even even I mean I mean you're single I mean what if you found someone that was maybe just as a sexual partner if you don't want to relationship and just like have fun like maybe that your body needs to loose."
5197.0,Patient,"It does, it will send out that. that's the problem i'm having is big with the conflict okay. it's easy for me Okay, and this is where my fear i'm just going to be transparent."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,My fear is that i'm just going to go out back out there and just be reckless with sex. My physical body is. needing the fix.
724.0,Provider,hey you.
5197.0,Patient,Know kind of what i'm saying it's like.
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah well, I understand that my addiction is sex yeah. Okay yeah."
5197.0,Patient,So my fear is um because that's my diction i'm going to get a follow up i'm going to relapse.
724.0,Provider,I guess that I see. The word right well I would think about like so So this is the other part of it is like it's a biological need to release the energy right So if you if you were to think of it in what is the difference between lovely or can I see your real name. No you're fine a sandwich when you feel more comfortable it. Is it. more comfortable for lovely or Porsche what what what does healthy sex look like and what does relapse and look like right it looks totally different.
5197.0,Patient,yeah anything about it in terms of like.
724.0,Provider,"it's completely like your body needs it right and you're not gonna don't punish your body for wanting to have that experience there's nothing wrong with it. Like but but it's the awareness in even in addiction is the awareness so it's different because, with sex it's kind of like it is what it is it's like food can't just. have it."
5197.0,Patient,"And that's the whole thing like i'm tired all the time. My body hurts all the time, I have no energy. it's like. I need money."
724.0,Provider,"You need touch too. yeah also an important it actually releases like. I forget but touch releases that that relaxed happy feeling also So if you if you need that. it's do a game plan on it it's like how am I going to do this and it's going to be healthy, like if I would say if you're you want to enjoy. You want to enjoy having sex you wouldn't have fun with it, but if you're completely losing yourself to the point where it's just not even enjoyable it's just like a need like an impulse that's when I would think okay."
5197.0,Patient,"I see i'm afraid that i'm going to absorb because I believe in energy. i'm afraid that if I end up giving into it and having sex with someone I absorb their negative energy and now all this work i've done on my spiritual. journey and all of that. yeah i'm going backwards, because now i've absorb some energy that I really should have not absorbed."
724.0,Provider,Think of.
5197.0,Patient,Like I worry.
724.0,Provider,No it's okay it's okay.
5197.0,Patient,I mean the old me. wouldn't have cared the old me wouldn't have even I would have had 234 I would have had people waiting. yeah you know I.
724.0,Provider,"And I think honestly it's like. I get where you're coming from but also energetically energy is infinite So even if even if you absorbed energy, even if you do that, you can also before you even get into the act of it right. When you're in the flirtation you're flirting stages of getting there right. You could even set the intention that you're only gonna get what you physically need from that from that. From that time with that person, and you can just ask to cut the energy and the energetic cords attached to that person like you can say that and say angels God ancestors just cut any negative cords attached to this person any unhealthy cords knees just cut them out. right and just do something for yourself, where you feel safe enough to be able to go into those situations and have a game plan right. So, like if you're totally in the moment and you're going off the rails in what but be specific about what that looks like for you like, if you remember where you were at your worst, you know that when you get into. Some sort of physical relationship with someone you can figure out like Oh, I remember doing that, what are your red flags like what are your red flags for you, when you know you're going off on the other side of it."
5197.0,Patient,"wow i'm a few things I mean. I almost scared myself a few weeks ago, because I was thinking about going to a play party. Because there's no connections there I could just go there to get my fix. Okay, never have to come back again. You see what i'm saying like I could be a whole different, and I could just get my fix and leave. That is where I started getting fearful about absorbing the wrong type of energy. I do believe in suck a bus and sacrifice, I do believe in them. And I did I had a slick the bus in me um but only spiritual people understand that. anyone else they'd be like what are you. Talking about yeah meaning you. nevermind. um, it is a demon but it's a sexual demon. US feeds off a sexual energy. yeah so i'm like so that's what I was thinking because there's no connections there I could go, but then I got scared because I was like coven that's like. yeah. there's nothing so that's social so see part of where my big fear is. Is all of these. variants and all of these, even though i'm totally vaccinated."
724.0,Provider,"lovely let's let's let's talk this out, then write. It okay okay so like. I get."
5197.0,Patient,"My black book and say Okay, who had a big one. Like. me I could call them and say look I just need a one night stand. I could possibly do them but."
724.0,Provider,"let's talk it out, so the extreme. version of going for it would be the play party right."
5197.0,Patient,i'm laughing because I can actually talk to you about this and you know. This feels good I can talk to someone about this that doesn't think i'm just bonkers okay sorry.
724.0,Provider,"But I definitely don't think your markers and all it's like, how do we find that perfect the sweet spot for you it's been four years go into a play party might be over the edge in might be too, I think that might be too much from the beginning, I would. See like. If you if, like you said, if you have a black book of people that you know where you enjoy time with them you enjoyed it right. I mean, I know this sounds so stupid, but you can even say listen, do you want to have sex let's both get tested i'll show you my test you show me yours. Knowing that were both naked and let's let's go for it and it might be that that could be your way of going in and it's healthy and it's only with one person. it's harder to manage your energy if you've been if you've been home for as long as you have it's hard to manage your energy with a bunch of people, so it starts small."
5197.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,I would go to that.
5197.0,Patient,"And I would completely zoned out, I will let. me go back into my survival mode and I would completely be a different person, but then I come home and then I feel all this energy and I feel all and I might feel better, and I might be able to eat and sleep now and i'll be like i'll be back to myself, like, I took my vitamins kind of."
724.0,Provider,fall yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"um but then i'd have to sit and think about all Okay, who did I, who was I with, and you know if I go one time because i'm clearing my throat down panicking oh my God do I have things like I just I don't know. So yeah i've been kind of like today i've been this thinking i'm like Okay, because, like when my son calls me and he can tell i've been crying he's like what's wrong and i'm like i'm just in pain my ribs hurt you know he worries about me so much and I don't. want him worrying about me when there's no need. yeah it's just something I deal with it's not like you can give me anything and it feels better you can't. Somebody good, but you can't. yeah so I just today, I was thinking, I was like you know what I am in so much pain that I have not been able to eat. i've been throwing up all morning because my ribs hurt you know, and my pelvis has not stopped hurting. For about three years now, my pelvis constantly hurts so i'm like Okay, what can I do so that was my next thing I was like let me talk to her, let me see that she thinks this is a good thing for me to do like or does this sound like something that might be a little too dangerous."
724.0,Provider,"I mean I if you have. One it's like if your body is feeling in pain, because you haven't had. touch in a really long time I mean."
5197.0,Patient,"If you know doing. And i've tried everything, everything is that way okay yeah toys I. talk to people on the phone like I. Things to try to say okay. Can I change I get into a hot tub I. Have lacks I ever pro feel like I do all these things, and then I finally just was like I know what my problem is. My problem is, I have not been physically touched and four years. that's a long time actually. Three years I haven't physically been touched, but I haven't had sex in about four. yeah it's like for me i'm going. This is hard. I mean it's hard enough to not be touched or to have human connection. But it's extremely hard when my body is breaking down if i'm to a point where i'm throwing up. Because the pain hurts so bad. yeah yeah I definitely need to do something."
724.0,Provider,"That, and I also think it's part of the arm the generational thing that you're talking, you talked about last time I think they're connected to each other so even. Even though, like, I do think it's good for you like seriously find someone and be like let's get Colbert tested let's set up a day in time and let's let's do the thing and but it's also just like that generational that awareness of how we passed down genetically things over time. yeah it's it's also that part that's being like it's it's breaking something down that no longer serves you so at some point, stop something things never start off always as a bad thing. Things will start because. there's a need for it. And then you get into the next generation it's like. Oh, we don't need this anymore, and now this is actually not helpful, this is actually like not helping right I hope."
5197.0,Patient,i'm also wondering if it has anything to do with what today is.
724.0,Provider,Oh 111.
5197.0,Patient,Do you know what today is. National trafficking Awareness Day.
724.0,Provider,yeah I didn't even realize it until I woke up this morning.
5197.0,Patient,"i'm in pain right. turn on my TV and you know I watch the B and C black news channel because they talk about Hispanic at black and brown lives right. yeah they were talking about how a lot of people are having a hard time right now, because of today is national trafficking. Awareness Day and i'm just. Like whoa I wonder if my body kind of knew that without knowing that."
724.0,Provider,"Well, that energy is the collective energy of it is out there, so. yeah you had the experience i'm sure there was a connection with it yeah and I was trafficking that's the thing."
5197.0,Patient,"You know, trying to get that out of my body is like is hard, and that was part of the reason why I wanted to do the the letter, so I just caught me the letters."
724.0,Provider,that's fine yeah yeah because I know that.
5197.0,Patient,Your body remembers.
724.0,Provider,Oh okay.
5197.0,Patient,"So, because of that it's like yeah I got all these superficial stuff of like I want to know why I can't set boundaries and why i'm this and that and. All that. stuff. But yeah I really know that my body it's more than just my mom it's more than my children it's more than that my body has held on to that trauma. Do you know what i'm saying I mean i've been sexually abused. Since I was probably about six seven years old. yeah my body. holds holds on to that. and happy passed around. You know. My body that's why my physical body is reacting this way because i've been physically stimulated, since I was six. yeah i'm. Only nine years old next month that's a long time for your body, not knowing and that explains why my body reacts that way when I go too long without having that that sensation."
724.0,Provider,"So so lovely you know how i'm. Maybe two or three sessions ago your protectors came out so remember those parts that we talked about. is so kind so. it's Okay, there was a 1314 year old."
5197.0,Patient,There was this 1213 1212 1321. yeah i'm sorry 16 my fault my fault 16 I get my head got me you always forget about making.
724.0,Provider,"So, so what. did he do it's okay. Is we want them to be on board with us being able to process those memories and the only way we can do that is by working with them, so when you're thinking about like. The national trafficking day right it's like think about that agent I would kind of like journal, what are the major emotions that show up for you, when it comes to that specifically. Because because yeah so i'm going to just jump. In I will jot them down to with just for yourself it's like start journaling the emotions that are showing up and try to see if you can identify the age ranges of which parts are showing up. Because, then we can work with them, we can still do processing, it might it might be in little increments so we can start doing that. But, especially the body pain it's true your body does remember and it's in pain and because they're stuck energy energetic the meridians that everything is. Energy so."
5197.0,Patient,So just journal about my emotions around what today represents.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so I can jot them down if you want, but just um and you can be as raw as you want about them right, I do not censor yourself to worry about filtering your language I don't care about any of that is what are the emotions that show up for you, when we associate with that body pain."
5197.0,Patient,"I don't know necessarily associated with the body pain um this is going to sound really strange, but just the feeling of being wanted. Regardless if it's sexual or not. But just wanted um. yeah. and Is kind of like. Physical pain excites me but I don't know if it's because i'm that type of sexual pain, not the physical pain i'm going through."
724.0,Provider,yeah. He clarified.
5197.0,Patient,"yeah pain of the sexual things that were being done to me i'll put it that way, has developed into an arousal for me now to the point where i'm not able to get off unless I have some of that. Sexual pain, I guess, I could call it not physical, sexual pain. that's kind of got me warped little bit so it's one of those where it's a mixed feeling. um I don't I don't feel negative about it, which. My intellectual mind is saying that's odd. You know that you don't have fears it's not a bad thing it's not a bad feeling for you it's a good feeling for you, you know. So that's just kind of like where i'm going, why is it that you are so aroused about. being dominated being sexually dominated you know and having fear, why is it that you enjoy those things, but then I have to go back and go well, that was how they that's how my first sexual experiences were. Okay, so do you know kind of what i'm saying it's. Like everyone their first sexual experience usually is painful for women. Because they're hymens broken and all of that. um I was so young item I always I don't think I ever had a hymen. yeah, but of course I did. um so it's just interesting because it gets me to where. I I miss it. I miss having. That type of sexual experience, which makes my intellectual mind go what's wrong with me. what's wrong with me why do I miss that Why do I miss that type of attention, why do I miss."
724.0,Provider,"So. My question would be is why, why are you judging yourself for something that you enjoy and you're not harming somebody else."
5197.0,Patient,"Because i'm being harmed. You see what i'm saying. yeah kinda like. Pulling backwards if I looked at myself, I would be very concerned about me okay i'm concerned about this woman that enjoys being bit enjoys being choked enjoys being rough like she wants someone to."
724.0,Provider,move.
5197.0,Patient,"For her and you could die, this is how I would talk to her Do you realize, you could die. If somebody bit you and broke the skin all of the diseases that you could transmit how harmful that would be for your body. Do you know what i'm saying so it's like, but then I would have to go back and go, but I understand why that arouses you I understand why that is because your first sexual experiences. And a lot of your main sexual experiences have been physical like that you had no voice, you had no choice and they did, whatever they wanted to you. And so, your subconscious mind took that as pleasure and that's the reason why now, you can only get off when those things are being done to you. So it's I talked to myself a lot, so you know I try not to judge myself I try not to."
724.0,Provider,say enough.
5197.0,Patient,Things to myself.
724.0,Provider,"But that sounds like the adult mother and you protecting you, you know."
5197.0,Patient,Mother in me is like no we're not going out tonight cuz yeah you can get into trouble. yeah you know and.
724.0,Provider,"it's possible to do those things and. And just my questions cuz you've been in that world is. Is there, like a kind of verbal contract that you do with the other person where."
5197.0,Patient,"I always do contracts, I don't do a very big on contracts okay true lifestyle lawyers. Understand about contracts. And they they support contracts. it's a lot of the the what I call vanilla people wanting to get into the lifestyle. There are against contracts so like we're just going to have sex was it's not like i'm going to kill you it's not like i'm. they're not understanding there are steps to it, so there is a couple of places and that's why I was saying, play parties because they have what they call dungeons and they're just places for people that are in kink. That they can go to to do their kink stuff. yeah and it's safe and there's contracts and."
724.0,Provider,"they're good yeah the verbal contracts, because there's not always physical contracts and you do the verbal the first 10 minutes."
5197.0,Patient,"What are the do's and don'ts which you're safe word what's that it up. yeah and then you put all that out, so that each of you know, and then you have that kind of thing, and so I actually was kind of thinking about that the problem. Is in the queer community of kink. yeah there are individuals that are heavy into that queer keep people a colors kink that. are not safe for me i'll just put it that way they're not they're not emotionally or physically safe for me um. Because they're kink is manipulation there kink. Is lifting someone have to tear them down, that is what bear kink."
724.0,Provider,is okay.
5197.0,Patient,I can't yours.
724.0,Provider,And is yours purely physical and there's this more emotional kink. Does that make sense. yeah relation. Manipulation sounds more like in the emotional realm rather than the physical like if it's kick physical kink is different from.
5197.0,Patient,"way like you say right they get off with manipulation. So they will do whatever it takes it's mostly her, she enjoys watching her dominant that happens to be transgender but that's beside the point watching him dominate people. and manipulation and all this for her to be like I don't like you anymore, and now he treats you like shit that's their King Okay, he likes to he's a major status, so he likes to beat you to blood. He goes overboard. And she likes it. She likes the fact that she's in control of how much torture he does to someone. Like. Because my mind cannot when I get into a subspace and that's what we call it a subspace where i'm in this euphoria whatever. yeah world all my girlfriends are kicking in and i'm like feeling good and hi i'm hi. The fact that she likes to manipulate the fact that he likes to torture, I would not have I wouldn't be able to say no, because i'm in a euphoria i'm. and Vulnerable The next thing I know. he's not listening to safe words, in fact, it turns him on to cause you to have to say you're safe word. Okay there's a safe word for a reason. yeah what i'm sitting here going red is my safe word and every time I say read you're like Oh, and you do more. hey you're not you're not honoring my my safe word safe shut up for a reason. yeah and so they're big in that Community which upsets me because i'm like. y'all are dangerous. Your. bike I mean for real for real like I keep thinking you know people are like i'm R Kelly everybody's like you know screaming about our Kelly and i'm like what you guys don't understand is that all of that is manipulation. yeah it is your reason why those women don't want to leave. I was those women, I know exactly i've lived in our Kelly surrounding kaun pound. I know what that's about and it's very easy to get wrapped up in something like that. But anyway, I know I went off on a Brown, but so that is a part of the problem. If I go into the header key community. away people. That want to do this whole color you know."
724.0,Provider,Like. play I said a shot like. They vanish.
5197.0,Patient,"yeah women of color. yeah hey you know. You know, let me know beat me for all my slave owners that did this to you and call me and no good this is this matt. that's not good for anyone's mental either. Oh, trying to find my medium. would be finding lifestyle people that I know and ask them, are you having any parties are you having any gatherings ones that I know I could be safe, with i'll put it that way."
724.0,Provider,I forgot to assist you though. yeah cuz they're not going to judge you for what you like or don't like they're just gonna want to support the best. of you.
5197.0,Patient,"because they know that that's what's in me and that's what's so crazy because that's all I keep hearing you know, and I think it's them saying. You know it's okay your body, you know this."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"If you go with the with the man doesn't mean that you're heterosexual again, it means you needed something that only amanda give you."
724.0,Provider,i'm just me i'm being funny but it's like that's the things like here. You know yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"it's like it doesn't mean you're not gay doesn't mean you don't want to be with a woman, just because you needed that tool kind of thing."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,So I can find a woman that wants to do that.
724.0,Provider,And it's possible to find somebody that will be able to provide that it's just a matter of like. them meeting them and.
5197.0,Patient,Connecting without. Somebody hard with all of the you know there's probably someone out there for me that's in their house doing the same thing i'm doing. I need somebody I really want to be with someone but i'm too scared leave my house.
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah I am.
5197.0,Patient,"sure of it, and then the next thing we know we see each other and go where you've been for four years, where have you been for four years, yes I would look for you and you've been looking for me, and now we found each other at the grocery store. What did this happen, you know. yeah or a zoom meeting or something like that you know."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"I saw you on tick tock and it's the same thing i'm going through like. I know, someone out there is just in the. Time being it's like. that's The other thing I don't want to put myself out there, I don't want to find a man that can just satisfy that itch let's say. you're for me to find men it's not hard, I can. look out my door and I got about four. Oh yeah okay so but i'm, this is another thing part of me is I don't want to do something with the man and then make it look like well you're not really wanting to be with women because you went with a man. Did kind of know what i'm."
724.0,Provider,Is.
5197.0,Patient,"If a woman found out, I was still sleeping. With men, they would say oh you're bisexual but i'm not bisexual I don't want to be with a man i'm not attracted to men I just needed stick."
724.0,Provider,That say yeah. yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,Can I cut it off plaster it.
724.0,Provider,"well. I didn't love me the moment I use up caring about what other people think that's when you're going to find the best pleasure, because I think caring so much about. What someone else is going to say is just it limits your ability to just enjoy the process nobody's ever gotten it right nobody's ever gotten in perfect it's. it's what is what how are you going to live your your best life if you are worried about somebody else and just go back to you go back to you and. Ask here, so why do I care, why does this. Even matter they don't. want to find they don't. They don't want okay yeah."
5197.0,Patient,"I mean yeah, this is the problem I have is the fact you're right Okay, when I was only dealing with men I didn't care what anyone thought I didn't care like so on my whole so what big deal I didn't care as soon as I came out the closet. All of a sudden, I started caring I started I started caring about what women thought of me. yeah because I was getting such a backlash of gay women saying I don't want to be with a bisexual woman, I don't want to be with a woman, that is still sleeps with men."
724.0,Provider,Then they won't accept you as who you are. Right and if they don't.
5197.0,Patient,"But I don't want to be with a man i'm with a man only because I have to, and now that I don't have to I only do it because I need that physical. thing."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5197.0,Patient,"So yeah that kind of thing but yes, yes."
724.0,Provider,"I want you to take the next week yeah. it's just. journal journal, and I would even be like, if you were to pick the perfect partner person that you want, in your life in that in that way. write it down and be really specific about it get really clear about what it is that you desire and be unapologetic it's just for you, it doesn't matter, who see it's not for anybody it's just for you. away the things that you want get clear about what you really want because when you're fearing the outside world's perception that's when you're blocking the manifestation because you're not just letting you're not going with the. flow of it."
5197.0,Patient,makes sense.
724.0,Provider,"All right, and I think we have something next week. On yep. We have it on on Tuesday at one o'clock on at. Okay okay. yay be kind to yourself, your body wants it and needs it.
