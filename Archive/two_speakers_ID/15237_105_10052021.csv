15237.0,Patient,Okay.

105.0,Provider,"Okay you'll see it's going to suck a lot of juice out of it this video stuff. alright. So hang in there i'm opening up a note, right now, so i'll there'll be a little quiet it's it's a little weird because of telemedicine it's not like talking to a front end there's silence sometimes."
15237.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Alright, so we're going to i'm going to give a little heads up on things over the four years i've worked with bright heart that have made this assessment work really well and there's just a couple little tips that seemed to make all the difference. The focus is on getting the history, but not explaining why that history happened but it's a natural human instinct to want to explain Oh, because, but my boyfriend. We won't be doing that we won't do that part today I do want to know and it's actually very relevant but just for this it's going to be, how are you well how much did you do and for how long was the last us and did this happen or not versus explaining why but we'll get into that and. The other thing is that the other thing is that it's being transcribed so you're going to hear me talking to the transcriptionist at times you're going to hear phrases like please transcribe verbatim. or you're going to hear me say denies lifetime use, and that is not for you it's for the transcriptionist so that might sound like kind of weird. But that's what that is so we're going to dive right in first i'm going to be getting your history. of substance, use and we're going to start with short acting opiates so how old were you when you first experimented with short acting opiates and those are anything from fergus sets or roxy's fentanyl heroin, those are short acting the long acting is the buprenorphine."
15237.0,Patient,"Okay, so um, I think, mostly native opiates I didn't start until I was about like I think I experimented them with that 22 like 22."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, what were you taking at 22."
15237.0,Patient,I think I first tried like a percocet it's my first time I tried heroin um. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so percocet and add it's at the most, how many how many milligrams of practice sets for you taking."
15237.0,Patient,Just like maybe one or two five milligrams.
105.0,Provider,"And was there ever a time you did more than that, or that was at its most."
15237.0,Patient,i'm usually at its most yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and you tried heroin also around age 22 and its worst, how many milligrams were you doing."
15237.0,Patient,"I wasn't too familiar with the milligrams because I was just experimenting with it, I think, like, I would just I smoked it a couple times, so I really don't know as my month."
105.0,Provider,"Times okay so i've and you are 31 so i've got purpose sets and i've got smoked heroin a couple times so that's back 22 and you're 31, what do you think you've been doing in between."
15237.0,Patient,"as well that over the years, the that's when I first started the heroin progressed, but only like in the last like maybe like three or four years. um has did the heroin I become like prominent and other than that it was it was math math math is what I started using around 18 and i've been using sense."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm gonna put that down aged 18, but I want to be thorough and jump back up to opiates for a second So when I say at its worst, I mean in your life for. For sure it's okay for heroin have to do you know how much you were doing at the worst point."
15237.0,Patient,My worst will probably about a gram a day. Okay i'm a holiday and at that time I become I became like a IV users always.
105.0,Provider,"uh huh okay. All right, and. let's go back to the percocet again because that's a pretty low number typically what I have here anyway. So at its worse, we ever doing more than 10 milligrams a day."

And we'll be going to be looking at him every month we're going to put them in quotes. So it matters what you say, not what I want for you, but what you want, so be thinking of what you want to do more of what you want to do less of first start with substance use in your own words, you were to say I want the topic is substance meaning drugs I want what."
15237.0,Patient,"I. don't I don't want drugs, would you mean you want to."
105.0,Provider,"Try not. Okay, let me hold on, let me go with that. I want to not do what."

15237.0,Patient,um I want to do my program on suboxone and continue not using drugs.
105.0,Provider,"Okay we'll go with the math one. So let's shift now to. Other behaviors. Things you want to work on think of personal development, think of communication, think of the relationships with your people in your life, think of your mood your emotions. What do you want to work on."
15237.0,Patient,"um, I would like to work on. My like consistency with like my relatives like relationship wise i'm like a positive relationship and being consistent with them um I want to continue my education and go back to college."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, go fast coach let's circle back to consistent with relationships, but what I see with my eyes are here with my ears, that would be evidence that you were consistent, but what I see what I hear that you were being consistent."
15237.0,Patient,"Will would see. see that, like i'm making up an effort, like to be in my family's lives like calling or."
105.0,Provider,All the years.
15237.0,Patient,"In communication. Okay, consistent mission nation um."
105.0,Provider,"OK OK, we can work with that. And, and you want to go back to college yeah. So thinking actually will we're going to leave this just the way it is let's keep everything on air things like evidence would be calling says communication have that follow. The, as evidenced by part in the objective let's keep that statement there's because it makes tangible a better understanding of what she's describing as consistent with relationships, please transcribe so let's move to this question you have so here's the part. Normally it's a full, yes, the reason it used to be full yes, I used to write the letter. It was easy, I have a pre format I change your name like very little effort we do it together, I email it to you or if I haven't released I email it to your officer now I think you have to go to virtual clinic and tell them you want a letter. Okay. And that's brand new for me, so I don't have a lot of experience you're going to be teaching me what they say don't don't let yourself get frustrated okay. Just come back if they give you grief about it there's so many new people it's brand new for me to don't let yourself get upset. Just come back and say this is who. said what and I can find out, I can learn more maybe it'll be easy and they'll say Okay, and we have a release of information people send it might be just like that I hope it is. OK, but come back to me if it gets frustrating, and you, you have any kind of know and come to me okay. All right, the first part of treatment here, the first month is intensive, which means we're going to be meeting with you, every week. it'll change. or might not some people they meet with me twice a week it depends on what your symptom presentation is if it turns out, you need more care more support. It will meet more if it's less than will reduce it after a month okay."
15237.0,Patient,"Okay, OK."
105.0,Provider,"So the first one you'll go once a week to group and once a week to individual therapy, so you can be thinking that when you talk with your officer. I, for a month for 30 days it's going to be intense i'll be once a week group therapy say the word therapy, so they hear it group therapy and individual therapy. Okay, and i'm a licensed clinician so it's going to be approved okay so let's look at our schedule, you had trouble showing up to one of them. you'll have to figure out what what made that hard and you did you were able to grab the phone and jump on here with me, it does mean that i'm going to have you leave here and go into virtual clinic because you never got to check in I had to show up really fast. And if they're like oh I don't see you scheduled tell them to look if you're writing the word down look in slack SL a's okay hey my therapist said look in slack this was a last minute makeup appointment okay. And I will be doing my best to remember this conversation and send it as soon as we're stopping talking so we're going to schedule now and let's schedule an appointment for next week. This might be inconvenient, but these are the things that are open the timing will start to get easier, as more appointments, we can go two weeks ahead we'll get that book and it might be a time you like better. This one you might not be thrilled with, but I have either 7am on a Thursday or I have 8am on Friday so October 14 at 7am I still have open which day is your group."
