Your get your getting back to groups, you have an individual on the 17th at 10:30am. And then you mentioned in July and August, what happened was just that you didn't really understand the program and the appointments that you had to make it to."

12138.0,Patient,Definitely yeah I talked to my best friend and my boyfriend okay.

12138.0,Patient,yeah I like to like. bake or. Take long showers and just do like grooming things by myself.
462.0,Provider,"Okay that's good yeah that's really helpful, especially when under stress right like you're stabilizing from medication you're trying to stay for something. So it's really important to sneak that in a little bit of baking little bit of showering and kind of. That personal pair So what have you been working on with your therapist Valerie or what's some of your goals with her."
12138.0,Patient,i'm definitely to try to find ways to cope with my anxiety so i'm trying different things that she's she's brought up to me like some body stretches. We also talked about trying meditation. that's basically it.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so working on. kind of what we were just saying self care staying relaxed trying to keep your self regulated and that helps with focusing for studying you're able to be a little bit more productive and all of that. Okay, and what did you say you're studying for."
12138.0,Patient,"um, so I am studying to get license to work as a pharmacist."
462.0,Provider,Oh wow that's a really awesome goal.
12138.0,Patient,yeah it's tough.
462.0,Provider,yeah i'm sure how long of a process is that.
12138.0,Patient,"And usually people study for like two months, and then they take the exam."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've got. I think you mentioned that you're taking the exam and a couple months you've got a little bit of time."
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"In November and good so you don't have to try to pressure yourself or save anything for the last moment, do you feel like you're realistically moving along and the way that you need to be."
12138.0,Patient,"um I think I could do more like study more hours, but I feel like i'm not capable of doing that, right now, because of my anxiety and my own stabilization with my meds so i'm just trying to do like two three hours a day right now."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's a good start that's a good start and being realistic with what you're able to accomplish and get done day to day is better than shaming yourself right or having Guild or trying to push through and sitting there without really comprehending or. Study anything. Alright, and then have you been having any suicidal thoughts any suicidal ideation."
12138.0,Patient,"No, no, all right."
462.0,Provider,"All right, what do you think is just the number one thing you need to kind of focus on over the next week."
12138.0,Patient,just trying to stay on track and study at least two hours a day.
462.0,Provider,"Trying to stay on track study two hours a day. Okay, and then like I said it looks like you're getting back on track with the program since you re engaged you've been checking in for everything so. You should be. getting to the point of. Being in compliance, you know as you continue over time, I see that there's a couple of surveys that needs to be done, the band survey and the ear huge, do you know how to access those. OK so maybe if you could do those after we hang up and then that will help you get in compliance as well. All right, tiffany well once again there's no other group members today so and i'm not your individual therapist so I don't want to get too in depth, but is there anything else that I can support you with or that you have questions about today."
12138.0,Patient,No that's it Thank you.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, good then Keep up the good work of all that you're doing and I will maybe see you next week."
12138.0,Patient,"Okay, all."
462.0,Provider,"Right take care. Okay, can you please. Note that there were no other attendance for this group, and so we did a brief check in to understand what needs to be done to get into compliance checked in about what she's struggling with most right now what's helping her the most. yeah Thank you."
