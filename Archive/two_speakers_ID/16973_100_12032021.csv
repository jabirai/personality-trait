16973.0,Patient,"Yes, okay with you guys. I did with Pfizer a while ago."
100.0,Provider,Go for you.
16973.0,Patient,"Oh Okay, I guess, I mean you help some days some days were like that."
100.0,Provider,"just send a message and we'll go ahead and get started. Alright, so i'm. One of the clinical supervisors and i'm also. You see a special project managers just something else that I do. i've been with the company going on five years so. Some pretty familiar with what we do and why we do. And one of the things that I like to talk about today, as we get started um. is how we can possibly overcome like are stuck points I don't know if you've ever. been in this situation, where you just. Why bother. You just you know just want to just say screw it kind of thing. And you ever been in situations like that, yes, yeah. yeah also. Have any examples."
16973.0,Patient,No when it's just you know daily routine for me Sometimes I get really anxious sometimes.
100.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16973.0,Patient,I mean. Just you know when things don't go the way I want them or. I lose patience very easily with people.
100.0,Provider,and your experience with that has been what was the outcome when you get like that.
16973.0,Patient,"A lot of anxiety, a lot of stress."
100.0,Provider,Any impact on relationships.
16973.0,Patient,"Well yeah sort of it. just get you know frustrated with people when they don't do what they supposed to and. or they demand to imagine, even if you like, this morning I I told my daughter, yesterday you know I have this appointment at 11 you need to get up early, so I can drop you to work around, so I can get home. said i'm sitting on the car right now and a stranger will. soften the blow like oh i'm sorry this and the other is you know what you do before that. You knew since yesterday when I pick you up from work. And now you're putting me to stress just you know same thing with the with her daughter having to go to school in the morning, not getting up and getting her ready, but it's just a story of her life and she's one of my main right now."
100.0,Provider,"All right, so that can be pretty stressful and what other messages you get from that like when you ask them to do things and. It appears that they're not following through on this, what does that. say to you what kind of messages are you receiving by that behavior."
16973.0,Patient,"Well, I try to get. The thing that I need to be more patient speakers it's not. Under my control okay. Is this well I try to tell them, you know this and the other insane deal with my wife my other son says, like you know I tried to get him to do things my way and sometimes I need to understand that. it's not my way you know it has to be I had to been. Even if it's like making me late and damaging my my peace of mind."
100.0,Provider,"So when you were with Kaiser go ahead, go ahead i'm sorry."
16973.0,Patient,"it's really hard, because I mean i'm used to doing things one way in getting down. on time. Getting everything on the way, supposedly, not the way they want it no because they live on that part of conscience."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Listening to you i'm hearing. You working on trying to be a little more flexible with your expectations of them. Yes, yeah and so being rigid if if that's a good term. Would that be a good term for how you see things ought to be that this kind of rigid position or how would you describe it."
16973.0,Patient,I say is rigid they'll definitely.
100.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and so, with That being said, what. What have you learned if anything from Kaiser or over time on how to. relax some of that rigidity or release some of that expectation."
16973.0,Patient,"Well, try to keep myself busy doing something you know. Like I mean because sometimes telling them what to expect from them, it doesn't work I just went through the same situation of things, giving. Like I mean I started the excitement and the cooker the House I started doing something on this Tuesday and by Thursday I still was doing stuff so I spent like three days of. Fixing everything the end of the night, I had a good dinner ready and or serve and everything and then I end up cleaning, because nobody helped me clean figure, he was like tire or drunk. And I got really frustrated on the solution so i'm trying to think that I go over the limit when it comes to those things."
100.0,Provider,Over the limit as far as preparation for the meals are over the limit. has been.
16973.0,Patient,radios this vacations. I have are higher than where they have. And that really frustrates me a lot okay.
100.0,Provider,What do you think their contract.
16973.0,Patient,I don't know i've been like this for a long time. As I remember.
100.0,Provider,Okay.
16973.0,Patient,And I hear. You saying.
100.0,Provider,No go ahead.
16973.0,Patient,"I will say oh it's just you know the way I am the way i'm wired. and I guess nobody's gonna do things the way. I want, and done and sometimes that really irritates me a lot. And then boom."
100.0,Provider,"So it's not that they don't try. it's just that they don't get it, the way you would want it to be Is that correct."
16973.0,Patient,"I think they don't try as hard as they supposed to. Okay, they don't I mean there was like I say that wire a different way than I am. I get a lot of this a lot of this for my my mother, my father, because they were really on top of things and straight on to do whatever needs to be done on time. If it is a camping trip if it is you know shopping trip I don't know how can they go to the store and spend three four hours and they'll buy anything. Anything I mean they had made."
100.0,Provider,That one.
16973.0,Patient,"yeah it's very frustrating for me, and I mean I don't like crowds definitely I worked for I worked. customer service forever. So I don't have a lot of patience and he sent me my last job last 14 years of customer service at walmart and I got fed up with them and. That time was seeing my counselor at Kaiser and I just couldn't deal with them, it we got to the point that I was driving to work and instead of driving to work stuff at the liquor store and buy me a couple of years."
100.0,Provider,and
16973.0,Patient,"First, I got you know enjoy it and then went to work and then I left work and lay the land latest things that I had it was like I just parked in the parking lot and not going at all. From."
100.0,Provider,"The reason behind that I know you said that you got tired of it, but what was the it that you are tired of the."
16973.0,Patient,"End was of you know, the way walmart works."
100.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16973.0,Patient,"Okay, the way they do things they expect so much and it gives a little."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so like under appreciation."
16973.0,Patient,"Exactly Okay, and I mean I never got through them, you know it's like you know I do this, I do the other around here I run the other way, you know I know it's my responsibility to my job you guys need to get some help. Right and they know top of that, you get a route customers and. They got bunkers. Until one day, I decided, you know what i'm gonna let it ride waiting for the terminator employment come back my money that I had saved. And I can walk out of there not even looking back."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so you said that, during that time. You will, with Kaiser and you are on medications. Yes, Okay, and you also said that you just said Oh well, and you would go by the liquor store. yeah how good an idea was that."
16973.0,Patient,bad one.
100.0,Provider,Man why.
16973.0,Patient,If it fell numb what I was intoxicated.
100.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16973.0,Patient,But then it got worse afterwards. us more more than the sad part and more of anxiety more of the. feeling worthless. Right.
100.0,Provider,So the drinking just didn't help your mental state.
16973.0,Patient,"No, I didn't. Okay, instead of words Okay, how long has it been. it's been two years since I stopped working for them."
100.0,Provider,It was drinking.
16973.0,Patient,"Drinking this, and I mean I was drinking a lot. A lot is insane like having two 330 Jones or beers. losing a day. On a daily basis lately, for the last month has been like i've been cutting a lot with dissolving having. I don't get the urge anymore, I say used to. Use you know. Try to say you know what you know you're going to get sick of your drink, because it was the point I mean they start getting with the heartburn in the middle of the night, the night sleeping disorder they already have. To me is this is for the daily basis, I just can't seem to get to sleep. it's been so many nights up you know tossing and turning getting up right outside smoking a cigarette and bad you know. Right it's really sweet that is very stressful for me very."
100.0,Provider,"sounds like it. sounds like it was so. Okay, so let's go back to thanksgiving for a minute, because you were saying what was going on in the expectations and so, how did you get through thanksgiving."
16973.0,Patient,"I was very tired of the end. Actually morning I got up at seven in the morning and started making you know, Turkey ham eyes and stuff like God, by the end of the day, you know, making those herbs and the other stuff is like by the end of the night before the dinner started, I was very tired. Right so everybody stopped showing up and. I had to get everything ready and. it's just you know I know the hell out of me and I told them, you know in every year, I say the same thing, this is the last year that i'm cooking for you guys, because you guys are workplace you don't help. and"
100.0,Provider,You cook. yeah yeah.
16973.0,Patient,"But i've been doing this, since I was. single because I used to do the same thing for my for my my parents know except my mother used to tell me a lot I lost her two years ago, and that has to be nice."
100.0,Provider,yeah.
16973.0,Patient,"My dad I lost them like maybe 1415 years ago so lately, yes I have. I know they're they're okay. They tell me and your dad this, this is the other but I mean i've even end up doing things for myself. And that is really, really not the way supposed to work we supposed to work as a team. But they don't get it, and I think I hadn't realized they're they're gonna have. their own lives, you know because they do already have it online, but I mean sometimes it's really, really frustrating really."
100.0,Provider,So on thanksgiving when they weren't helping as you expected them to you didn't drink them right or did you.
16973.0,Patient,"I can't cope with that how did you cope with. A couple beers and. Maybe a couple shots. Dennis Dennis finished and then everybody was having you know, everybody looks like a Turkey stuff in the living room sitting down, but the household the mess. Right, the kitchen was a mess and one thing that I can send you some mass. So I got up and I start clean and effect getting frustrated, as I getting angry and everybody said, like when you submit. we're going to help you clean is like you know what let's get it done get it over and then tomorrow morning, I have to get up and see them as and see that's the problem that I have with my wife she's always lagging to do things like that. Even if she I mean she's not much of a helping the kitchen at all. she's not like that in God really irritating sitting down and i'm cleaning the kitchen nobody gets up and lift again, you know. Sometimes I see many going okay fine I like I don't like leaving a mess. I don't like leaving the kitchen or dirty place everywhere, all the different way pack everybody's feeling, you know. As I said, that's the way i'm wired. Okay there's things that I don't do nothing that I want to do nothing myself."
100.0,Provider,"No, no, what do you do."
16973.0,Patient,Watch TV be on the phone.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so you allow yourself to have days like that."
16973.0,Patient,"Yes, I do. Okay, maybe allow myself too much of that stuff."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so when you have expectations on family members, like, with your. situation now where you're in the parking lot because people were running late. What can you do to minimize or what have you learned to do to minimize feeling so frustrated or getting so angry."
16973.0,Patient,"I don't know exactly I don't know right now i'm really frustrating, you know I wanted to yell at her and tell her you know what you're making me be late. Because you can understand what I told you. And I want to yell out of my you know me very upset and angry, but I just keep it to myself okay I just."
100.0,Provider,blew me.
16973.0,Patient,"off, and that is that is not good at all because that's when I get more frustrating more deep breaths."
100.0,Provider,"Right so let's talk about that, so we have a stock point to start point is, you have expectations. And when they're not met, from what I understand you get pretty frustrated and angry."
16973.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
100.0,Provider,"and If it was up to you, you would just focus and yo let them all know exactly how you feel. Yes, okay."
16973.0,Patient,I have learned through the years. Nothing gave me nor.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's hold on to that point, because you learned over the years it doesn't get you anywhere. Is that good for you to know that."
16973.0,Patient,"way, yes, no."
100.0,Provider,Okay.
16973.0,Patient,ice stop. You from being more than it is.
100.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16973.0,Patient,"No, because I have to eat all my anger."
100.0,Provider,"Ah, you have to eat all your anger. So eating your anger means you don't find a voice to release it is that correct."
16973.0,Patient,"Exactly so. I don't like it when they come and ask me what's wrong with you what's wrong with you, you know what don't don't do that to me. Because I mean that makes me more."
100.0,Provider,"ups and makes you more angry. Okay, so why would they ask you what's wrong with you. Oh, what are your behaviors that they see that would cause them to come to you and say hey i'll go what's wrong with you."
16973.0,Patient,"I don't know that's their heads, you know but i'm pretty sure they they they always ask me like my friend came after the thanksgiving dinner, and he said. Yes, I. said, like well, I was angry because don't worry about it that's what I told them."
100.0,Provider,"I don't worry about it okay so. i'll just share something with me. i'm. For a very long time. People would think I was upset and I was actually in a really good mood and it's because I was raised, where it wasn't that important to smile smiling wasn't that big a deal. So I would always walk around with like one look and they would never know if i'm happy or sad and say was safe to say hey what's wrong with you, and I say nothing stop asking. But the reason they're asking me is, because how I was presenting myself my body language."
16973.0,Patient,yeah.
100.0,Provider,"And so, what do you think about that, what do you think your body language is saying or showing that would cause your son and others to come to you and say what's wrong with you."
16973.0,Patient,I.
100.0,Provider,think you did anything out.
16973.0,Patient,burger that look at my face.
100.0,Provider,it's not too happy look okay well. Like landmines stuff or. huffing and puffing any of those behaviors.
16973.0,Patient,"Sometimes they get a huffing and puffing but not all the time, like I say i've learned to just let it go. Like when they come in ask me. what's wrong with you you're angry. very angry don't talk to me."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you know i'm glad you're here and i'm glad that you know who can be a work with all these things with your counselor and everything, but just think about what you said. All I had worked on letting it go. But. Showing behaviors that say you really have to go is that right."
16973.0,Patient,that's right.
100.0,Provider,"So that's kind of a conflict, what do you think."
16973.0,Patient,I think it is.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
16973.0,Patient,You know.
100.0,Provider,"All right, so. And I can understand that. So that may be something to consider if we truly let go of something, then it wouldn't be no residual showing that we're still upset because if we're still showing that then maybe we really just didn't let it go."
16973.0,Patient,We think I think it's wrong.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so um How would we be able to truly let go of something. Is is is a difficult thing sometimes because our feelings get hurt right. yeah. So what can we do about this um."
16973.0,Patient,"I don't know. Okay, thanks so much guys."
100.0,Provider,"we're going to talk about it i'm. not sure if I can give you advice for that, and hopefully point you in a direction where you can incorporate some things. So let's do the facts let's take the scenario today why you're in the car, it was your daughter right. Yes, and she was late and you had already told her you had an appointment at 11. Yes, okay so that's the facts. Okay let's call that a."
16973.0,Patient,Okay that's.
100.0,Provider,A a the antecedent The thing that comes before behavior. The facts can't change that right. No okay. So with those facts being there. If. As a result of what she did you said you believed it wasn't important to her. She didn't even understand what was what did you believe about washing his late. or held you up.
16973.0,Patient,So Winston functions.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, what does that say to you about you and her will you thinking, what do you believe in about that could you tell them what was important to you right. yeah point 911. You said that she didn't. What."
16973.0,Patient,I guess even thought about me she thought her only like being selfish.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, she was being selfish and when and if you feel that that's how she's viewing you go doing this is because she's being selfish and didn't care about you well think about you. Would that be the reason why you got frustrated. and angry."
16973.0,Patient,yeah.
100.0,Provider,"OK, so the facts. To make you late. Or you are late as a result of her behaviors okay. You believe that what you need to do, probably wasn't as important, what is she wanted so she's being selfish. So therefore you get upset."
16973.0,Patient,Now.
100.0,Provider,"So let's do this again, but this time has changed the middle the facts of the same. Be resulted in feeling like you're going to be late because of her behaviors. What else could you believe, other than that she was just being selfish that would have changed the outcome, where you would have to get so frustrated what was going on in her life that you could have looked at. That Maybe she was powerless over."
16973.0,Patient,"I really don't know. She is all the time. We always on her case like get out of you know, she said grown up woman she lives with us. I mean, I take care of her her daughter I driver to work he's he's he hasn't been able to get a license on their own. If you bought a car and put it on my name, because she doesn't drive so it's like on the daily routine is. being laid me telling her you're going to be laying you're going to get covered word, you need to get out of the baby great for for preschool and she's always you know I think she she doesn't care much about what she's doing, I mean she said excellent work there. A good provider for her daughter good provided for me know that i'm not working. w no routine of hers that is annoying you know."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so hang on right there that's good to know very good, because what i'm almost sharing is that's how she is. And you already know that's how she is is that about right."
16973.0,Patient,"Yes, am I right."
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's stay there. So. What could you have done different if you know that her pattern is always running late. What can you have adjust what could you have adjusted different to avoid ending up late, since you know that's how she is."
16973.0,Patient,i'm not sure.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. um one of the things i've might want to consider for was me is starting even earlier."
16973.0,Patient,yeah.
100.0,Provider,"Because I already know that's how she is she's always running 10 minutes late so maybe I start 15 minutes earlier, so I can compensate right, what do you think about that."
16973.0,Patient,"I do, but I mean she. doesn't get it through her text call."
100.0,Provider,Oh OK.
16973.0,Patient,"For her that's her hair pattern all the time, and I know we got to be. on time, I cannot be rushing on the freeways, because you lead."
100.0,Provider,Right.
16973.0,Patient,"I cannot be you know postponing my appointments. Because you're late. So sometimes I think I should just you know, let it ride on herself. Like do whatever you want me oh. i'm sorry fine arrived fine whatever."
100.0,Provider,But what if you get that what would that. mean to you.
16973.0,Patient,That will mean to me that i'm going to be more worried because she's thinking in her software she's supposed to be or doing the things that she supposed to be doing.
100.0,Provider,"Okay, so on one hand, you have a person your daughter, who you know, is always running late. On the other side, you know you have options, based on what you just said that you can just let her find our own way. Right. yeah okay. I mean we have."
16973.0,Patient,"Several arguments, because she wants to."
100.0,Provider,Do their.
16973.0,Patient,"home, and I said no you're not driving a car, without a license. Okay, you want your car back you're going to prove to me you're going to go get your license you're going to go into your own insurance, because I don't want to make insurance, because I know how you behave. And she I think she's always saying oh yeah I will I will I will I this is to me how can I be always asking for right, you know I think that's your own personal problem than mine right, but you make in my problem."
100.0,Provider,No oh hold on right there because that's where I was headed does she make it your problem with did you choose it to be a problem.
16973.0,Patient,"She makes it my problem. And, and I do she's going to be involved in their problems he does, I don't have to be getting her up getting picking her up in the middle of the night she's partying. With she doesn't have a way to get home. we're just trying to somewhere. Right, so I can. I can't even count how many times I have to pick her up at 345 o'clock in the morning, all the way through Sunday the or or whatever, she is. Because she's reading. And I do it, you know, but a."
100.0,Provider,desktop hold on to that thought. That you do it. Because that's good all right.
16973.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
100.0,Provider,So why do you do it.
16973.0,Patient,i'm making my responsibility. To make sure she's safe home because of her daughter.
100.0,Provider,"So you want her safe. that's okay all right. So number I started this with what can we do to reduce the frustration, we feel as result of this. Do you think it's important that you cared enough to make sure she's safe."
16973.0,Patient,yeah.
100.0,Provider,that's what i'm hearing. These are you so good job for that.
16973.0,Patient,way what.
100.0,Provider,tell you stuff good job for that. You give yourself any credit. For caring enough that you would even be willing to like this meeting run a little late to make sure she said.
16973.0,Patient,Yes.
100.0,Provider,"Because, maybe, again, I told you, I can't give you these guys I can just give you some things to consider, maybe, considering the whys of what you do. may help offset some of the frustration you feel because what's more important. But that's something you to consider."
16973.0,Patient,"Okay, you know."
100.0,Provider,"I have a son and sometimes he unfit to be tagged with him, you know I mean he's young and he's he's a good boy, but sometimes. But I will choose those frustrations instead of not having it all. And so that's how I work to some of my stuff right with him I. Try to encourage him. I tried to set the example sounds like that's what you do. He let her know your expectations you role model that behavior but she doesn't fall in line you have two choices, you can be done with it like he said and leave it up to her. Or you can continue because you want to you know, do the things that dad's would do make sure that children are safe irregardless how old they are you know all those things. right but either one of those is our choice. and Either one of the outcomes. will be because we make choices, so therefore you know I know how like you said, I know how she is."
16973.0,Patient,hey.
100.0,Provider,"what's what's going on right now, what do you think. data."
16973.0,Patient,Is me.

No she keeps on falling in the same deal. and deal with my wife, you know. Just all. Oh it's just now frustrating for me it's been like that forever."
100.0,Provider,"Is frustration that word frustrating to you is that you're comfortable word, because if I was to ask you how does it feel and don't use the word frustrating what words, would you use."
16973.0,Patient,I don't know annoying.

100.0,Provider,"know you can just do the best you can with today right. You can do that, you can win today."
16973.0,Patient,Can everything.
100.0,Provider,Exactly and so and that's all any of us can do. And the scary part for me is that all the things I told my son because of my own experiences my dad had told me. But I didn't need.
16973.0,Patient,A little little Reno. maryville run around.
100.0,Provider,"Can you relate to that. Yes, Okay, and so, so there comes a point where we have to like they like my dad did with me sounds like your dad did with you, they have there comes a point where I just have to let you make your own choices. and be there when you fall to pick you up."
16973.0,Patient,Okay.
100.0,Provider,"All right, that's that's kind of. What i'm hearing is that you're doing all you can to prevent. things going bad or negative for her but. It also sounds like you really want to be there in case you fall."
16973.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
100.0,Provider,"I think good job. that's all any of us can do. And not only be there for when they fall, but the therefore one day have good you know they achieve and. Just be there, what do you think about that just just be there. So that's what I hope for you, I hope that when you see your daughter. You know celebrate that always well for whatever that is. continue to. To. encourage her to to be more responsible, maybe give her some reasons, like you have been. The frustration you feel. that's going to be on you as to whether or not you want that to continue um, you said you know how she is. So then those behaviors are not to be surprising right because you already know how she is. So now it's. A point of working with her to move past that to be more responsible towards your. expectations, if possible, or to accept her as she is. And then make choices."
16973.0,Patient,Okay.
100.0,Provider,"And if you choose to be there, that in itself is celebration. Because, you have the choice. You can make a different one. But that other one you said is not what you want to do. You don't want her. Not to be safe, you don't want her to be out there alone. I think that's really good choice. Even if it's frustrating. We think. Too much too little. What he said. Just. don't necessarily want to be right. What i'm hoping, is that you see benefit in embracing your situation and going through it. minimizing as much frustration as possible. And that has to do with how you see the situation you know what you believe about the situation. Alright, so my understanding is that. will be meeting every week until you see. Your prescriber. So same time next week we'll be hanging out okay. I have a couple of links here that I need to. provide you with the first one. Is. A survey okay. And so we'll take a few minutes for that. it's really. One question and, if you want to make a comment to add a comment is all it is. it's not very long. me see if I can get this to you. Did you see a pop up. In chat it might have to go to more."
