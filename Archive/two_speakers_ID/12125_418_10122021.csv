12125.0,Patient,"What was my my email said, my appointment, or that. at seven so I I took a screenshot showing that I was on here at 630. And then I don't know what happened."
418.0,Provider,"Well, you were on at 630 and then I came in at to start the session at seven. And when I came in at seven I saw you there, and there was no audio and it kept saying trying to connect to audio. And then eventually."
12125.0,Patient,I figured okay.
418.0,Provider,"And so, then eventually I just said okay he's apparently having some kind of technical difficulty and I put that and I, and I said that to the care navigators so that's what happened. Okay, so. When you check in at 630 it's okay. Unless I say okay i'll take him early i'm probably going to come in at your appointment time."

12125.0,Patient,"Everybody know friendly everybody so kind and Nice. And as i've been to a couple other places. And they were like. Nazis, they were like you know they treated you like like you were lower than they were because you had an issue you know I like that I have a degree in psychology for right State University, I have a bachelor's degree."
418.0,Provider,"Oh, that doesn't matter, even if you didn't have it, you still use I don't care if you didn't have anything you every person deserves the respect. Right and and courtesy because it's it's free."
12125.0,Patient,And you might as well give it away.
418.0,Provider,Because it's free. So you know.
12125.0,Patient,"psychology you know it's like I took all my electives I read probably 4550 books, I get a Barnes and Nobles and read different other books and psychology I was really into it, and then I got so deep into it was like. It changed my perspective of the world and people and it scared me, you know, like. yeah I mean like I was like. Right people weren't who they seem to be yeah."
418.0,Provider,Right right.
12125.0,Patient,and
418.0,Provider,The only thing I will ask is this if you ever have a group. don't do two things in one day like don't see the doctor and then see me don't do a group and then see the Doc you know I mean don't see you know just try and do one thing in a in a 24 hour period.
12125.0,Patient,Okay.
418.0,Provider,"um so that that's the only things. That I would, I would ask you know don't. Try to do two in one day. But um. But definitely if you need some kind of you know, if something comes up. Anything can be worked out if you just communicate see a lot of people just no call no show, but I appreciate that you, you hung in there you stuck with it. yeah having some Audio problems but it worked itself out and if ever, you get it by saying listen, I have this appointment with cheryl i'm not gonna make that appointment. um can you read this i'm sorry. No don't don't don't apologize you didn't do anything wrong tonight and just say, and just say you know if you could have her reach back out to me. I will get back in touch with you and we will reschedule okay."
12125.0,Patient,This way.
418.0,Provider,"This is our goal, so that you have no gaps in your treatment. there'll be no, no reason for you to ever not have your medicine or have to have a bridge script or you don't have to go through any of that if you just communicate and do as much as you, you know, do the right thing don't you have to do right."
12125.0,Patient,"Right right right. Now My other question was. I have, I talked to a psychiatrist one two months. And she and he writes me 90 calm and one milligram okay and here's how this works you're not gonna believe this. he's on the phone he calls me. And it's a 10 minute conversation, he says hey how you doing. i'm like well Doc I got this problem, he says we'll let me do this, let me write your script it'll be ready today and next time we'll schedule sit down, he says it every single time."
418.0,Provider,And Have you had that sit down yet.
12125.0,Patient,"And then, and then and then 10 minutes goes by me and he says alright so next time we'll do any and that's it and he likes $250 off my insurance. he's only he's a light he's a legal drug dealer."
418.0,Provider,So so so what you could do if you're not happy with your psychiatry's they're bright heart actually has our own psychologists and therapists so what you could do is you could potentially go through the care navigator who do you do group with Isaiah.
12125.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
418.0,Provider,You could speak to Isaiah let him know that you want is you want psychiatric along with this and have everything in the under the same umbrella if you'd like.
12125.0,Patient,"Okay, my problem my problem is I had my doctor before him. was writing me. xanax because I have panic attacks, I have anxiety attacks my anxiety runs like so high, it it's overwhelming, to the point where I can't think. And I can't focus on my job I can't."
418.0,Provider,"You know I still want to want to do yeah so what you want to do is really. talk to your psychiatrist your therapist you know, whichever one you choose, we have here someone to spend time with you kind of sort things out. Okay, for that kind of treatment. Or you you're going to have to you know settle down your your psychiatrists and let them know say hey. I really need to sit down and talk with someone If not you direct me to, who I can in your facility, because this needs to happen. So so yeah you have to be more you know pushy about your own treatment and I always. tell my. I go over this in my groups, all the time, you have to direct your treatment you're in charge of your treatment."
12125.0,Patient,"I know, and I, and I tried that i'm like for the last year, and he says okay well hey I gotta go I got another patient i'm like we're supposed to have an hour session. And it semin I and i'm pushing and pushing and pushing and he's like 98 nine years old, and he just doesn't get you know he just. He wants that money."
418.0,Provider,"So. So be now you you navigate your treatment, think about your choices and your options and. You know, talk to, I know i'll it'll be in my note definitely. That you are look seeking psychiatric assistance. And then follow it up with Isaiah who's the prescriber there so let's let's see how that works okay."
12125.0,Patient,Okay yeah cuz I I have. I have never like talk to like it's hard to find a good psychologist or psychiatrist it really is.
418.0,Provider,"I will say this to you, though, just just as a way of coping mechanism for the anxiety. Sometimes, and I get anxiety, but you have to remember also that your body's going through changes you're dealing with pain you've dealt with opioids you've dealt with, I don't know, have you done. No, but have you done any other drugs."
12125.0,Patient,Now ma'am.
418.0,Provider,"So, so what i'm saying is all of this is a transition and sometimes the highs and lows of opioids can cause a reaction of anxiety."
12125.0,Patient,"And i'm, no, no, no, but, but I was, I was born with."
418.0,Provider,"And, and this is i'm getting to that so so. You were born with it and you have dealt with it for years, I want you to really zone in on coping mechanisms for. anxiety, not only the medication therapies, there are there are breathing things you can do. There are things that you can do during the course of the day when you feel it coming on you can just say okay. You know I can deep breathe, or I can zone in on one thing, and just start thinking about you know the beach or the whatever it is that that's your place um. Sometimes meditation is good and what I mean by meditation I don't mean you have to go with Zen or anything you can just simply simply train yourself. To sister I am feeling so anxious right now, so you know what you do you sit get in a place and i'm going to sit with myself and i'm just going to make myself sick for two minutes, and let me tell you something a person that suffers from anxiety two minutes can mean a world."
12125.0,Patient,It can seem like an hour.
418.0,Provider,"So, so you take two minutes."
12125.0,Patient,It attack kids. you're you're you're helpless.
418.0,Provider,"And so, let me ask you this. And then I will. grow and then I would want to go over how are you eating, are you having caffeinated drinks are you smoking are you all of those things increase and intensify anxiety so. Once you go through all of that right, and then, then you can really see okay what am I what, what are the things that I can do. Without the medication therapies, what are the things that I can do on a day to day when i'm overwhelmed and then that that will help you, because then you know you don't feel so like helpless you don't feel like there's no hope you don't feel so overtaken by your mental health. If that makes sense. Okay, so those are some things that you we could try even in our one on one sessions. You know there's also music music therapy is wonderful, but here's the hit I don't want to go to music that you know my my jazz music that I like the words and. I don't want to go with you know what I mean what I want to do is, I want to find. A sound a soothing sound. yeah a lot of times a soothing sound is anything in the orchestra. And you want to find that and just play that for yourself. You can play it on during the day, while you're working just for about half an hour, you will be amazed at how it brings you down it helps you breathe, it keeps you grounded, there are different grounding techniques, you know. So those are things, those are options we can talk about along with. Your psychiatrists and the medication therapies."
12125.0,Patient,Okay.
418.0,Provider,Does that make sense.
12125.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am it does. And I appreciate that."
418.0,Provider,"No problem, it was really good to see you meet you and I look forward to working with you okay."
12125.0,Patient,I do too I.
418.0,Provider,"want to encourage you, though, somehow some way, if you if you can I know it's Tuesday already, but if you can try to make that group up. And if you can't just you know you'll jump back in there on Monday okay."
12125.0,Patient,Thank. You sure it was such a pleasure to meet you.
418.0,Provider,"Well, thank you, I appreciate."
12125.0,Patient,"You saying, I appreciate your advice and everything and just. Thank you so so very much."
418.0,Provider,"Okay that's my goal, I want you to be well okay. Okay, have a good night and a great week."
12125.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
418.0,Provider,No worries okay bye bye.
12125.0,Patient,"Alright, have a good night."
418.0,Provider,good night.
12125.0,Patient,"All right, lovely."
418.0,Provider,"That was zach and zachary and he's doing seems to be doing Okay, I really would like to see him get into some of the anxiety decreasing therapies, if I can say that if it's means anything."
