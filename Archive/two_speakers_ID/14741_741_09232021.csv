14741.0,Patient,"So, like. My dad was adopted and before I could ever know anything about his family, they know some stuff except the DNA test. He. When he was like he was adopted, out of oakland back in. i'm not even sure if his actual birthday was year was 57 since he was adopted. But. Soon after both of his parents were actually professors at Berkeley uc Berkeley at the time. For one his dad was a psychologist where it's really fucked up. As far as he explained to us later. And then his mom was a nutritionist for the. The CAFE or whatever they had at the time. But, so my dad when he was like. A year and a two year two and a half, three maybe maybe you're older they found out he's allergic to penicillin and he had to be in one of those oxygen tanks for like. He said, like a month, but I don't know. yeah oh so like since then he's instilled in me my whole life that like you know don't trust doctors don't you know if you eat healthy and do exercise and all that stuff. Other than genetic disposition, you will be healthy enough to not go see a doctor. Which is somewhat true. Other than the genetic disposition. So I haven't really but. I found out through 23 and me that my dad. Parents had 17 other siblings and they were from the ozarks."
741.0,Provider,wow.
14741.0,Patient,And so I actually have like. Over 1500 third and fourth cousins from all over the US and all over the world.

14741.0,Patient,"yeah I mean my dad had high blood pressure, but he also. You know, did cocaine for like 30 years. And drank every day for like until he died. And he was drinking like a fifth. One on one a day."
741.0,Provider,And then he was an alcoholic.
14741.0,Patient,Before he switched to Bourbon he was drinking like two half gallons of blue sky a day. Oh yeah full blown. up when I was in sixth grade I found what I know now like five ounces of curious cocaine i've ever seen in my wife's.

14741.0,Patient,"um my mom was a college student that met my dad after her. Baby my half brother as dad drowned in the local bay and humble. stuff like that was friends with him and then you know back in the. Mid 70s, it was normal for friends to take care of you know widowed loved one. dad I would say swooped in but that's not the right wording i'd like to use. So my mom you know, obviously smoke weed weed super normal to me there's nothing that you can say that's going to change my mind. it's like a part of my life. And then, a positive way there's no I mean. there's yes definitely like instances where I can connect the dots but it doesn't change anything. yeah my mom. recreationally smoke weed with my dad because he was a full blown commercial grower back in the early 70s. Okay, like 10,000 pounds a year like lots of. So she was like involved with that a little bit, which is ironic now because she's a probation officer for juveniles and has been for like 22 years. So. Okay yeah i'm when I get talking i'm like gosh, I guess, I can be pretty open. yeah. When it's not just like this is just who I am i'm honest."

14741.0,Patient,"it's always full time until I. mean. No, not injured. it's always full time until I get fed up or board and then I put in my two week notice and then i'm trying to do something else. there's no point in I mean if the pays are good there's no point in staying somewhere a while, so that you can find out that you are just wasting your time."
741.0,Provider,Right mm hmm.
14741.0,Patient,"I mean, I mean that's my. personal opinion I kind of learned that. Excuse me um I learned that from a chef that I worked with at a restaurant back in like What was it like 2005. I was like. Being quick catering position where I did like sandwiches Soups and salads and desserts and then like a Sunday brunch for country club, and you know at any given time we'd have like 50 to 250 guests, and this guy matt from. Was weird. sky map from. what's a weird state south of maine. Delaware I met this guy from Delaware and he was like dude I only work a job, six months, and then I quit or do something else. To gain experience and to try something and then ever since then i've been pretty much doing the same i'd rather not work during the winter, I rather recuperate get projects done. You know yeah I make less money than everybody else, but I i'm typically happy."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. So how many people depend on you financially for their food, clothing and shelter."
14741.0,Patient,"One person. Just two people but it's well actually you know what technically speaking, I guess, just myself I do pay 200 a month and child support them and i'm always willing to pay more, but she has a really good job my ex wife and her boyfriend. yeah they're not married her boyfriend. Families pretty well off. They. they're pretty well off. So actually just more recently. Like four or five months ago I know it's probably going to bite me in the ass but she told me that I don't have to worry about paying child support anymore. i'm. Just taking her word for it is gonna bite me in the ass somewhere down the line. 10 months and i'm like well I don't mind paying it now, but it's going to take me three months to come up with the money you know. Really needing to file for that I mentioned about. we're on the same page she just got a job working for legal cannabis companies, he makes like 60 grand a year and all she does is count pounds a week."
741.0,Provider,Okay that's.
14741.0,Patient,"that's bad back in my hometown so it's kind of. I moved out this way to be closer to Roy my eight year old. Even though I was still an hour from reading. But it was like the closest I was willing to move to reading because writing is literally like l. and Southern I made it work when Community our pick her up you know Howard back my house. And then they just decided to move back to humble, and I was like well I guess i'm not moving back to i'm also enjoy humble because it's not. very pleasant it's beautiful but it's not very pleasant."
741.0,Provider,"Right so you're divorced you've been married once. All right, and you have one child."

14741.0,Patient,"Do you take offense to anything that I said about that earlier. No okay. I, I had asked pretty specifically if it was possible to get somebody that didn't have a religion choice, but obviously doesn't play through."
741.0,Provider,"i'm not i'm. i'm not gonna ask you. to ease the way, I believe. Okay. i'm gonna put that off on you at all."
14741.0,Patient,"Okay, so thank you i'm not trying to be rude I just. I understand you know front."
741.0,Provider,"All right, so do you have any siblings."
14741.0,Patient,"yeah I technically have two older stepsisters. ones like enter early 50s the other ones that are late 40s. And then, I have two older brothers and the youngest. One is. So, ironically, one is five years older than me and then one is like two and a half, depending on the the year you know could be I don't know one and a half. And then, depending on the year it's I don't know how that works, I think it's one of the House he's. 37 is 30. yeah two years."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
14741.0,Patient,"and yeah with the reason I said ironically, is that um. My girlfriend's three kids three daughters are. and tango and 11 and a few days and then. 13 going on 14 and about a month and a house and then 16. So, like 552 and you know, one of the two and. So, like it's very similar to. How I grew up. And it doesn't i've already tried to explain to him, like i've been in this kind of situation, but with boys and like you can confide in me if you want to or. You can just listen to me that I kind of know what's going on here, you know as far as this specific situation and they're like you're not my dad's our costs so."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
14741.0,Patient,So.

741.0,Provider,and You live with your girlfriend and her.
14741.0,Patient,yep.
741.0,Provider,And are you satisfied living with. The children and her.
14741.0,Patient,"yeah. Totally my family they're good. Okay, but heads with. The youngest I but that's what the youngest every. Excuse me damn day. But I love her. butt heads with. The Middle daughter, and I love her too and actually just recently i've been going out of my way to make her like. super specific like 10 to her needs as far as eating goes and like she's been slowly but surely been you know, instead of saying yep I like the foods he's like yes, it was good. Which is baby steps when you're like I may try to talk, I was last night, and it was like perfectly on the edge of being not medium rare, I wish you all eat pink me which blows my mind. So it's on the edge of not being medium rare and I cut it up all small and you know. Try to make it as authentic street tacos as possible and she's you know half my skin so it's just preferring it to be. Good. And i'm always holding a lot of. drama, I guess, because you know being somebody that is giving it loves to cook for people when they just respond with like now's gross i'm like, if I can hate myself."
741.0,Provider,yeah no.
14741.0,Patient,"i'm going out on like you know, a not going bed early. i'm not even going to bed on time to get like a full seven hours of sleep or eight i'm going to bed late, so that I can cook you this bad ass meal and then all you guys have to say is is OK. But they know and it has expressed already that their mom can't coach they want me to accept. So, like they are they in ways have said you're good Cook, but without actually saying it."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. All right, so how many close friends, do you have."
14741.0,Patient,what's the definition of a close friend.
741.0,Provider,"Your definition. Somebody that you see regularly that you spend time with that you can find in. How similar interests. Okay, no."
14741.0,Patient,"No it's not, I know I just. You know, between coven and. People having lives like sometimes I don't see my friends. Are. close friends. Like once a week, if that maybe every two weeks."
741.0,Provider,"And that's acceptable, I mean you know. see them regularly."
14741.0,Patient,"So, like. So, like my definition of a close friend let's face in the last 10 minutes."
741.0,Provider,But hey.
14741.0,Patient,"My close friends would be like someone I hang out with almost 24 hours a day. You know we're like bros were like really close friends, we do everything together that used to be my close friend and I would have two or three maybe five I can think of five people that you stay on all the time."
741.0,Provider,"Now, and that's different."
14741.0,Patient,"it's impossible. Right and I still consider those people, my friends, except for the ones that have died. and But yeah it's like family comes first that's my sleep you used to come first family comes first. sleep second projects, I said prop family projects. Go. Family comes first that's all I got. I I play a weekly disc golf game with. These two guys that i've only known for a couple years now, but they're good friends and we talk openly and it's respectful and like, even if I have a difference of opinion there's no like animosity about me expressing myself. So. that's positive I haven't really acknowledge the fact that I consider them close friends. Because i'm so. I guess i'm hurt you know. Not from them, but from other."
741.0,Provider,yeah that's from other people. Other friendships right.
14741.0,Patient,failed friendship people i've known for like my entire life that are just worthless. never left their hometown. yeah.
741.0,Provider,"On a part that's all. Alright, so how many would you say that was three five."
14741.0,Patient,"um so now currently what was Sarah who's my homie we're tired we both like prospecting rock honey. You know outdoors activities hiking fishing. And then Kevin and Kai know we played this fall and we go to the desktop turn minutes together, so we see each other outside of where we live. So that's three. I still. make an effort to see this guy that i've known since 13. Sometimes we don't talk for three months, sometimes we're talking every day. he's kind of his ship. I don't know if you know if you saw I said I was spiritual but I was also forced upon. astrology growing up my dad was like hardcore astrology. So my friend is Gemini so he's all like every year he somehow finds a way to break up with his girlfriend. But also find that a girlfriend to go move in and live with and he's just a piece of shit I mean he moves his offer them and then he doesn't get a job he makes some work or they offered a work. And I don't know why he's still my friend, I mean it's just because we have such a history. yeah he's not he's not like a trigger history like I could go scam and i'd be fine not drinking enough smoking. But at the same time, my whole life that's all we have done together so like. he's not a traitor but. Highly possible that."
741.0,Provider,That is probably not a really good idea to hang out with them.
14741.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well see that's that I don't. i'm a firm, other than these damn cigarettes i'm a firm believer. That. And, most people might disagree with me but addiction is a choice, I mean I. You know I say that, knowing that i'm like soon as i'm done with this conversation i'm fine i'm smoking a camel on filter because that's what I smoke. and Like weed I don't have a problem with I mean we smoked and six months I did it because I wanted a better job. To not smoke. And a clear my head, you know. This. This time, stopping drinking. In the past i've just switched devices and we're just started smoking weed every day this this time I haven't you know, and I haven't. Yet I don't think i'm going to. The downside to not doing it it's been like an Anti depressants for me my whole life, so I every time I smoke. And it's not like I passed down a smoke like this much. At one time and that's it for the day like I don't i'm not sitting there like smoking a ball."
741.0,Provider,After ball. Right.
14741.0,Patient,yeah because it's not my ex wife's folks. it's somebody appalling.
741.0,Provider,So do you have a close personal relationship with your mom.
