324.0,Provider,How are you.
8150.0,Patient,"Good i'm doing all right. So. i'm happy about that. yeah. So I, it was very, very nerve. I was all nervous, but I ended up passing and 75 questions so. wow I was really out, I was like okay like I know this right like you're you're like you telling me like you know this, you know this was like on repeat. And, but and then, when it stopped I kind of was like my goodness, like. Either I did really good or I did really bad, so I was it was just."
324.0,Provider,"Unless we change, I think the middle and, at the time of 75 is still. The same Okay, let me chicken foot. Because that's exactly what either you did exceptionally well meaning, you have passed everything that you need to pass the walkie going. Or, I remember it will stop you look at 75 if you missed them all, yes, at this point, you have no chance of passing whatsoever so. Everybody is a scary, but that means you really quick book."
8150.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness i'm just. thankful to God, because I just I told you like I I I only studied like really, really studied for that I want to say, like. A week and a half to maybe but I had been studying supposedly like me because I had like a coach that was like. Supposedly her, she was provided by my school so um she she was, but she didn't really yes should she actually did kind of point me in the directions of what to study, but she didn't tell me like this is how you do it, you know so. The last two weeks, I really, really like just really, really tried to. to know like to test myself pretty much and and that really helped slow, how was just really happy afterwards, when you know I I found out that I passed so it was just. It you know, like that time wasn't worth it, and then just the teachers were not to that, I mean I just realized that teachers really over a hype. And clicks and they just make it like it just gets you so worried over I mean, I guess, they just want you to pass right, but like it was just not what they would tell us it was like it was just. they've been it seemed like it was so hard like you were not gonna do anything on there you only have one minute like I didn't even need the extra time. My guy was just like Why did I do Why did I just got through that all like all of that to get extra time if that test is five hours and I finished like in two and a half, so it was like and they gave me two days, so I they give me 10 hours, so I was like scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. So I was like I didn't need that but just, I guess, knowing that I have the time to. Go good for me so yeah i'm just after I had and I don't know if this happened to you, but like after when you take a test. And you're like so nervous and everything still tense and you just take your test and you just like relax and then like your whole body is just like like your body feels like sickness after like you feel like. Like I don't know I don't know if that's ever happened to you, but this happens to me after I take exams like i'm good i'm good until I take my exam then after i'll start to feel like sick and start to feeling, really, really like. Like i'll get diarrhea i'll get like I feel like I just want to sleep like it's just very."
324.0,Provider,"I see what you're feeling oh you're right before. I mean seriously. And then, after over. pick up is over, I have, I have a lot of worried what. yeah yeah yeah So yes, 75 oh man, I remember, I will always remember I stopped at one oh that's awesome like I hope that bit, but you know that wasn't good. For what does that mean."
8150.0,Patient,"yeah. So you. Because you're like Okay, but I passed that what if I didn't until you have to wait and then you do if you ever did the trick or there's like a trick that you can do to find out like if you pass like right away because usually you have to wait, you know the two days. or whatever days it is that they they tell you and there's a way to supposedly test it and you try to register and if it takes your payment, then that means that you failed. You guys like you're already in the system, so it won't let you reregister yeah. So I did that and I got like. The good the good pop up twice, I was like. Okay, maybe you know i'm good, I have to be, I have to believe in myself and. And yeah but I did i've been did feel like I understood, a lot of the questions there were some about like cancer treatments that I just didn't I was like we've never really like we. That very specific questions, and I just did my best guess i'd learned how to like eliminate the ones that we're just not it like you, they were not it, so I did that and I guess it was a good estimate to get so. yeah."
324.0,Provider,"Well, I."
8150.0,Patient,Think.
324.0,Provider,"The day will now tell me about the table. Good. Do the day before you take my advice, and will you feel."

8150.0,Patient,"So I started a hotel The night before, so I did it I did it well, I wanted to like my. My notes, I just have to like and I like no I I was like. No like I know when I know like I know this, I know what I know, and then I just like pulled out the notes and I just kind of like. You know, like I you know this like I wouldn't I went over this, and I just put it away because I was so stressed, like, I was telling you I was literally. I had like five nerve nervous breakdowns I just I couldn't do with my life, it was just so mad just overthinking and that then when. yeah, then the day that when we're at the hotel like my mom was just like let's you know let's go to school, we we went in the pool, which really how because I was meeting and just relaxing. And no I just I took your advice I didn't I didn't study and and a lot of people really don't study don't study, like, I guess, he knew they knew that I I you know I have that tendency you like studying right up to the test. And I didn't and I think that really helped because, if I would have studied, I would have been so like dead, I would have been so cool so tired so tired, because I didn't even sleep that night because I was just so nervous I slept like two hours. or so so yeah but yeah I did take your advice and it did help all of your tips and really, really did help, and I was remembering them when I was testing, I was like I know this, I can do this, it was a lot of self motivation, you know motivational. But yeah."
324.0,Provider,"Telling yourself over and over and over. I know what. This and i'm not and that's why I keep telling myself even further MP exam. I know this i'm not taking this again.

I can read you know I did, and now i'm just waiting for for i'm I hadn't showed up showed up on the on the dca.

But yeah i'm in regards to my medication I think my medication has been helping a lot, too, I have been more consistent with the. With the lexapro. And I have noticed a difference in my periods, like the my mood means i'm I didn't track it this like this, this month, because I was just so busy as you. can imagine. To not have any speak head space to think, but I did notice that it wasn't as bad like my even. yeah I didn't even notice it was coming I didn't even know it because I didn't have any. Like some like any like you know it seems. Like not and yeah it just was amazing I guess my mind was just so focused on something else about like it yeah I didn't even notice and then I noticed, like the day after my exam I got my period, and I was like oh I didn't even get any. mood swings I wasn't crying he wasn't tired. So. And then the the week of. Because usually I get them the week before and the week of. The week of I, it was a little bit, but not too much like it wasn't nothing compared to like.

Studying well not this like at the you know before the exam it was just so I just I would wake up a little bit later. And then, so I wouldn't get as tired or sleepy so, then that would you know that cycle of not having a good.

Like if I do take my medication i'll take it right in the morning and I won't take it like you know, like three or four because I feel like when I do that sometimes it does I don't know if it's just in my head, but I feel like I can like it's still my body and I don't like that. didn't get in the morning and that's how that's what I do to kind of help me to be."
