Of the plane. Okay, but I have driving privileges, I have an insurance company I have I just purchased tags for my car now, I have to get the back tire fixed and get the door fixed or whatever, which is going to close the lot, but at least it's still drivable and functional. it's always something bad every time something good has to happen, some data has to happen."
527.0,Provider,"wow it's been a while, since we talked. writings have been going on, so."
3645.0,Patient,"I mean well, maybe with like you're talking about like what the doctors here like with you guys, or what are you talking about with me. Are you as you, yes, yes, what i've heard is there's a lot of things that have been going on kaylee that we need to catch up on. i'm sorry but i'm not sure how we're who you would have heard that from."
527.0,Provider,Dr cell.
3645.0,Patient,"yeah she does it, I mean there's no way of knowing anything of what you're saying what's going on nothing's going on that's not anything that people don't do on a regular basis, like. I do regular shit and I piss clean and that's you know what should matter for the for the most part, but yeah I have i've had Internet issues obviously you knew about that back in October or i'm sorry September. That was also an issue intertwining with me getting to the appointments that I needed to attend to uh yeah I mean I fought my mom that's really the only bad thing that's happened to me."
527.0,Provider,yeah what. happened what happened with you and mom.
3645.0,Patient,"Well, I love my my kid's dad come here and stay we try to. Men things and raise the baby together so he's here, and she she just don't have really anywhere to go, and you know she thinks she's just going to run all over me and and since i've let him come back. i'm not let her state here, you know what I mean i'm not going to have her stay in here my house is too small already. here. With me my kids and my kids dad so yeah I just can't do it, so you know she she gets off the drugs and if she was clean, it would be a different story, but because she's not that's the number one reason why absolutely not she will not be in my house."
527.0,Provider,You know my relationship that i'm already trying to get mixed up.
3645.0,Patient,"Myself so so her and I got into it her and my boyfriend got into it. And just always been very. physically just physically what's the word i'm looking for like I don't know arouse she she she loves to fight and and i'll be the first mother effort she swings on but. I don't know why Dr cell would say that I actually kind of upsets me because, like I said there's nothing in my life that isn't happening that doesn't happen in everybody's life, but the the big main thing is that i'm clean. And I look clean and my house shows cleanliness and my spirit, hopefully, I got a vehicle there's a lot of great thing that's happened."
527.0,Provider,yeah no she was a bad thing yeah.
3645.0,Patient,"listing appointments i'm very aware, I i've always been compliant I hate not being compliant."
527.0,Provider,I know so.
3645.0,Patient,I was.
527.0,Provider,"kaylee kaylee take us pause for a second, let me explain. I have it so much. I know I know so take a pause and hear me out Dr. cell and I have talked. Because we were concerned with you missing all your appointments. yeah and then, when you did check in with her, she let me know that there's been a lot of things going on and so these were things that we needed to work on in your therapy sessions so that's what we were. that's what she was filling me in and that's why I was asking you know what happened here like. we've got we've got. A lot of things to catch up on. us your mom and your boyfriend and. First and foremost, our goal is that. You are taking care of yourself that's our number one priority at this point in we want to be able to know how to best support you and keep you on track So yes, so we're not out to get you kaylee where."
3645.0,Patient,I know how to. me because I mean you missed a couple of appointments she is assuming that there's been a lot going on. And I know we're no we're not assuming there's a lot going on.
527.0,Provider,"When you showed up again, you let you let her know that there was things going on that's we weren't assuming."
3645.0,Patient,"No, I went to jail and, obviously, out of black eyed, the only thing I told her about was my mother and that's because I had physical reasons of having to tell her."
527.0,Provider,"yeah the majority of the thing is, is it kind of just hurts my feelings because."
3645.0,Patient,"I have put a lot of work and i've been here for what well over two years now, and I. And I don't want her to think like. I don't know I just don't want her to think that i'm just you know falling off the face of the earth and going completely."
527.0,Provider,Down we don't we don't want you to fall off the face of the earth. that's why that's why we are that's why we didn't we didn't just discharge you from the program kaylee. We wanted to give an opportunity for you to get back on track and that we can. We could help you do that and stay on track with what you have all because you have done a ton of. Work and we don't want that we don't want that sabotage.
3645.0,Patient,"Right you're exactly right, yes, and I just I love Dr cell I love being here my gratitude is totally for bright heart health it's helped me so much on, I have a vehicle. I don't want to forget, where I came from I humble myself every day I used to walk every everywhere, I needed to ever go I was walking so, the fact is like sometimes people forget and. You know, they forget to remember to be humble and where they were just walking a couple weeks ago, you know what I mean and i'm the type of person that tries not. To allow that to happen and become complacent and things like that so really the only thing that happened was that my brand new car got hit and that my mother put her hands on me physically abused and then cause those goals to go to jail."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
3645.0,Patient,"So, now that she's just not going to be around me whatsoever, I really have no other downfalls besides, you know fixing the vehicle, which is going to cost a little bit of money, but you know things happen life happens calls me to remember hey be humble you slow."
527.0,Provider,"So So where are things that with you and mom. Because you, you said you both had to go to jail is there any like legal follow up or a quarter what were things standing at this point."
3645.0,Patient,"Domestic violence charges and I got obstruct or i'm sorry I got. What is that one disorderly conduct so i'm saying get to get out right away, I got a PR bond the next day, to get out i've never really been in trouble before obviously i'm going to fight it i'm going to get it dismissed off there, or at least drop from something. She you know I don't know I had a lot of physical marks, so the police, they hit her with a db and you know she could be sitting 30 days or more or less you bones out."
527.0,Provider,I don't see that happening she. She still in jail.
3645.0,Patient,"kayla she's still in jail what she is. um I don't know you know she's been living with my sister my sister she can't afford for her to be there, my sister is you know fighting a. battle with children services for her kid right now, and she just can't afford for my mom to either be stressed, and her out and doing drugs and stuff. So you know misty really doesn't have anywhere to go and she tries to put that on me like it's my problem or something and it's really truly not my problem. And you know she's mad that I let my kids dad come back in and live here with me. And she's not able to because you know she put me on my own home for seven months seven months I live with my grandma I packed my kids up. took them to my grandmother's and never came back to my own home just for this woman to get clean after coming out of prison in the voa and get our stuff together. You have somewhere to live. I went out of my own home, now that doesn't say who I am I don't know what what will you know."
527.0,Provider,"me So how are you going to stick with your boundaries with your mom kaylee that's what I want us to think about like how I know she's in jail, right now, but. I think you know, our priority here is how are you going to stick stick firm with your boundaries with mom and I know it's mom I know it's so it's family it's your mom but. It causes a lot of problems for you, and so we you know, we need to work through those feelings that you're carrying. You know those mixed feelings like I love my mom but at the same time, if she's not clean I can't I can't put my sobriety and my family at risk for that, and I know that's you know that's gonna be a hard boundary to set for you yeah."
3645.0,Patient,"I feel bad for my sister because my sister feels bad about my mom like I did after my mom put me and my kids out of my home and was you know in my house getting high. and bringing the bad energies that she brought behind all of her drug addict friends up in my house I lost, you know every bit of all that sense of care that I had prior to her getting out of the deal and coming here initially. The simple fact is that my boundaries with misty our firm and always have been firm she you know shows up hi wants to fight somebody wants to fight me she has underlying issues with me having my shit together. And she does not, and she just doesn't like that, and you know, and she knows that she can I have the heart of gold i'm the child of of all her children with a heart of gold, and she knows exactly where to kick me out."
527.0,Provider,And right exactly exactly.
3645.0,Patient,"i've never allowed misty you know around it she's just you know came around and hopefully she just doesn't get out of jail and come back around you know, we have no contact order, and so the cases over anyways. I just I feel sorry for my sister that you know she's got to be battling children services and crazy stuff and ongoing things from past Sharma with misty you know from misty and misty been living at her house and driving her absolutely insane. So, for her and. I just pray for her and I pray for my mom to I do, but you know I feel like she's just a lost cause at this point my grandma has always said that and I have always just frowned upon my grandmother, for you know, having no faith in my. mom, but I see why yeah I do."
527.0,Provider,"And, and for your sister kaylee that's I mean she's gonna have to figure out a way to set that boundary with with your mom as well, like she's gonna have to. decide when enough is enough and that's not anything I mean you can tell her and talk to her about it till you're blue in the flame blue in the face. As much as what she needs to do but she's the one I mean you can't do it for like you can't you can't do anybody else's recovery for them, you have to do your own recovery, and so you know."
3645.0,Patient,"My whole game she talks a real good game to my sister and stuff. My sister's never put in any work with my mother, though growing up nothing you know my sister put with her dad's mom dad so my sister was completely isolated to anything to do with drugs anything to do with misty. So my sister hasn't got to that line that has. You know that line that is showing her hey you don't cross the line with your mom. my sister has never put in any work with missy she's starting to realize now, though, what you know what it's like and how how horrible i've had it all my life dealing with misty having to be you know with the maternal grandparents of of our mother so. You know she'll figure out on our own she'll figure it out and she'll get there, just like I had to do as well you know she was asking me to please let her come back here, and I am not doing that they've lost their minds i'm absolutely not doing."
527.0,Provider,what's your grandma say about that kaylee.
3645.0,Patient,say about what exactly.
527.0,Provider,About misty coming back to your House.
3645.0,Patient,"And well my grandma she stays about 30 minutes away either way she could care less she just kind of thrown the talent amethi. Either way, she could care less what I let her come back or not, because my grandmother don't have to deal with it, and she won't so if your own mother, you know can be like that then your kids can be like that, so I know that we gotta love from you know arm's distance. I just you know I don't I don't want to be the type of person who holds bridges and has you know no contact physically with my mother. In any kind of good way before she passes, because I know she'll have a long time to live, you know I know she doesn't she found jobs for a long time, probably about 15 to 20 years, I think. And, and that starts to catch up to you and she's starting to be caught up to you know her body for take a toll on. So I just know it's not going to be a lot longer, and I would I don't want to sit after she's dead and be like wow I wish I would have let her come back you know I want to make sure, everything is not going to be regrettable later all the decisions I make going forward with missing."
527.0,Provider,"what's what are you struggling with the most because you know that, until she gets some help kaylee it's not it's not going to be any different if you let her back in. and"
3645.0,Patient,"she's got helped many, many, many times over the last 15 years Andrea she's she's been in and out of prison, for you know, a couple years on, on ends and you know gets clean and and as soon as soon as she gets out those doors. first thing she thinks about getting high those kind of people cannot live in a normal life, they just can't she can't there's nothing in the world that's going to be able to help misty no treatment Program. No way in patient nothing. there's just nothing."
527.0,Provider,Because she's not ready to surrender to her addiction and in worker recovery program for herself.
3645.0,Patient,"She will get high until the day she guys will endure and i've already accepted that and I keep trying to teach my little brother and sister and sisters, to accept that as well you know I don't want them to be all hurt and affected by our mother dying because. You guys are aware that she's a drug addict and has been for a very long time now, so be aware that once she passes away that you guys, have you know, hopefully said everything you needed to say. and have done everything you possibly can do for her so that way you have no regrets or gilts and anything to hold on to for when she does pass."
527.0,Provider,Very Where are you at with that for yourself kaylee.
3645.0,Patient,"Oh i'm mentally prepared financially, I am not prepared my grandmother is not prepared to very another one of her kids either my uncle was shot and killed by the police and. He was shot over 17 times three officers unloaded their clips onto my uncle. So my grandma was going through a hell of a time you know hell of a time she she got her one central going away at 15 years old and back in that day it was uncommon you know and people like my grandmother didn't have health and resources like they do nowadays. So her kids and her oldest son and then her baby son. He died in 2019 from the police my mother's a drug addict and my aunt Bobby she's a hypochondriac she's she's you know, trying to kill yourself over men she got mental issues so. I just feel sorry for my grandma because you know she's smoking cigarettes again, and she hasn't smoked in 20 years. And it breaks my heart so bad, with the."
527.0,Provider,"Cigarettes so so, can you use grandma as a as a support in in helping you to stand firm with your boundaries with your mom of not letting her live with you and. and putting your recovery in and family at risk."
3645.0,Patient,"Okay, what are you in here doing cheese um, I guess, if you want to use her as an example, I don't know about support really because. As my grandmother does not support me in any way, shape or form, you know she's maybe told me twice since i've lived on my own since 2018 yet no i'm sorry the beginning of 2019 since i've lived on my own. she's maybe been proud of me twice ever and I, you know get no money or anything at all, no resources come from my grandmother at all. So it's just kind of like I don't know she you know she feels like. about me how she feels about her kids for kids have ruined it for all of us grandkids and how she feels about them, she feels like you know she doesn't even want to get Harley close to us. she's at her old age, now, and she just feels like we're all a bunch of fucking drug addicts and so."
527.0,Provider,"How can you change that relationship with your grandma like how you know I think I think if you can show her. That you're standing firm with. With your mom and the boundaries that you need to protect yourself and your family, I think that would definitely show her that. That you're you know. you're you're serious about your recovery and your well being."
3645.0,Patient,"Well, she knows I am you know, Andrea that leaves their kids in their home to go stay with your grandmother that you know she should know when i'm very serious about my recovery."
527.0,Provider,I know.
3645.0,Patient,"it's just that my grandmother, you know, like I said has been ruined by her kids and absolutely has no faith whatsoever in any of her grandkids. She. she's really not a good support system to have. she's just not she frowns on me having you know these bills and taking these bills and being codependent on these bills she considers that to be no different than being a drug addict. just being a prescribed drug addict i'm a prescriptive drugs to her so that'll never change in her eyes i've already tried and I don't I don't really care to make it any different and I truly don't if she wants to look at me like that that's fine with me, you know but. Regardless she doesn't support me in any way not actually physically emotionally or financially so honestly I just love my Gramma and all I can do is tell her that I love her and hope. that she knows that I do truly love her so I don't really try to men that i'm honestly not really it's almost like I look at her kinda like my mom I mean I really talked to her, I don't ever see my grandmother she rarely you know tells me i'd much rather see you on. That have you here on the sets or heroin or something, because you know it could have been easily happen to you, knowing that you have the mother, that you have things like that that she could say. You know, but. So there's just there's nothing really to say or to save between my grandma."
527.0,Provider,"What do you feel like your mom needs to hear from you, but in you know to be able to you know set set those boundaries with her like are they do you feel like you've got things left unsaid with your mom."
3645.0,Patient,"Honestly, no, because when i'm brutally honest, which I usually am with everybody she takes it as a form of me talking shit about her. And I don't look at it like that i'm just you know being honest an angel and telling her you need to get into the doctors, you need to take care of your body, you know hear your body or. temple. or not, and she looks at that as me calling her drug addict and saying that she's still getting high and which she is but she's in complete denial and she literally wise to me like i'm a little kids Joe i'm like misty. I don't know why you do that stop lying to me and it's not going to get you anywhere, because you know she'll line. And she'll say something like foggy please give me a ride I gotta go here and grab a couple of dollars in cash for cigarettes and whole time you know she's in there, getting drugs already had money in cigarettes it's just stupid shit you know just. don't I can't stand that and if she kept it real about her stuff and. was like you know I am a drug addict and maybe one day i'll be willing to get the help I do need I would be more cool with her, but I can't be because she lives to herself and if she lives self July to nobody."
527.0,Provider,So what's gonna what's going to happen if she gets out and comes to your House.
3645.0,Patient,"Oh she's not there's no contract. And then 30 days i'm really curious about what she might be doing, which is out of 30 days from now, I feel like it's that she's got my sister. she's got my sister to go to, and you know ruin the rest of her little bit of normalcy that she's that i'm. Like I said I feel bad for but but yeah she's she's going there when she gets out she's not coming here she hasn't been here my sister has been allowing her to stay there at her house. My sister's fighting a case with her own head and you know needs her sanity to be able to get her kid back. And you know here's miss the homeless and on drugs and not appreciative of the fact she's living and has somewhere to go and tries to come back here to my house to put me. back out of my own shit and out of my misery, you know and because she's not satisfied with being with for anybody she knows brandi has shifted she cares about brandi having. lost her kid and having to fight against but she'll put me in my head and put me in my kids out of our own House like I said i've always. That way i'm trying to talk on the phone I hate when you do that with me, as always, just never gave a damn about me and she always use my kindness of my weakness and uses it against."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
3645.0,Patient,"Every everybody else, like my little sister Emma. You know she gives my mom rides and stuff. God forbid, if my little sister does anything wrong, God forbid, you know we all pay bills, we all take care of our business, but my little sister has it. Has horrible supposedly the missing. she's having said she's having said, you know, like really are you kidding me I did more for you than Emily Emily let her stay there for a week a week Andrea and then put my mother out but but misty will speak so hard. And we have Emily you know and it's just like mind blowing it's like you are so ass backwards any literally lie to yourself, like. you're crazy and if that's the case, please allow me to do it and stop you know coming around me and asking me to do ship, for you have Emily do it, you know, so I just. over it. i'm over misty and I i've set boundaries she's broken boundaries i've always been the one. hey guys my grandmother. never gave two shifts and I was too young to help my mom out. In the time that she really needed it the most in order to get to me, I was I wasn't able to I feel like in my DEMO would have been a good mom. My mom might not even be the way she year but it all started with my grandmother, and she was in denial about she doesn't want to look at the root of the problem, she wants to look at it like it's misty in me and that's the problem and that's it."
527.0,Provider,Look at this.
3645.0,Patient,"hold on. yeah so I just try to fix my own relationships that are worth fixing and maybe do actually have a little bit of. Time on the phone it just drives me crazy. Honestly, I feel like my grandmother um I feel like you know those are those people that don't do drugs but could be as bad if not worse than a drug addict. that's how that's how she is you know that's how she is a complete hypocrite um she doesn't like to look at the root she doesn't like the truth, you know. um yeah."
527.0,Provider,"She doesn't really I mean there's definitely definitely a lot of family dynamics here that are all, you know that are all. kind of all over the place, so it's. You know it's you being able to separate from that kaylee and figure out like what what's going to be most helpful for me and my family and my recovery."
3645.0,Patient,and
527.0,Provider,Who are the people that.
3645.0,Patient,are going to be worth having relationship.
527.0,Provider,"well. Yes, you need, you have to decide, you know who are my healthy people that I can have. Within my. Within my circle of trust and know that they're going to support and you know, be in a in a good place for me to."
3645.0,Patient,"yeah I had one person like that my best friend my best best friend she's she's 25 years old. You know, we literally lived together growing up, we was we was more than sisters than her and her own me and mine. she's the only one, whoever who never judged me who never really cared whether or not you know I did the drugs or did this did the treatment program was still my friend regardless. I never had to ever question her and I and that one person, you know we fell out, and I really don't have the support of me alone is enough for me. Honestly, you know people think you need a lot of support to help you you truly don't you truly truly don't you got to be completely aware, you have to be accepting of you know, the shit and you just you have to you know, do something about it so. That enough for me is enough support you know me on my own support I think of myself as like the realest person. out here, and in this little city that I live in, so I literally thought to myself, I mean I don't care call it crazy whatever but yeah I I talked to myself, because i'm going to tell myself what I need to hear and i'm going to know, be sure that it's completely blunt. not sure."
527.0,Provider,"So what's going on with the boyfriend kaylee fill me in because. All right, are you. Are you taking care of all that or and Ben."
3645.0,Patient,"Now that. I have metro so the houses is paid for. He got a job so he's been working he's been doing real well you know he's on probation so he's been paying on the ankle monitor thing he was in pain on court costs in fines he's been getting his checks taken for child support or whatever. it's just that we just you know scrounge up every little bit of change to get this car and it's always just something you know it's something always, though. I take him to work every day and that's really it he's gone all day from two o'clock to 10 o'clock at night and I tried to go see him on lunches and stuff which actually I need to probably get him in the car and stuff and ready to go because lunches at seven. So i'm probably gonna have to get stuff ready to go in for um but yeah I just take him to work and I seen one is lunches and and you know, by the time he's off at 10 o'clock i'm ready to lay down and we don't really have time to argue and fight or enough and. it's just beneficial for him and it's something that I want to do so therefore I do it because, if I didn't want to do it, I already told him you're asked to do, I didn't you know want."
527.0,Provider,"To do and what what kind of relationship, are you are you looking for with him kaylee."
3645.0,Patient,"well. I told him last night that he is not the person that I loved in and because you know he went to jail in 2019 we split he got a new girlfriend for that little time being. I haven't really got to you know see who the new him and then he went to jail for seven months, so I don't really know who this new him is but I shared no it's not the kind of love, I had for him in 2019. Pregnant so now that i'm taking care of his kid and raising his kid and stuff the only relationship that I really, really want is for him to physically help me. Because I have a baby dad who does the financial thing you know with my daughter and i'd much rather have the physical support than the financial support."
527.0,Provider,Physical support meaning he needs like.
3645.0,Patient,"Helping with groceries you know, taking the kids out to the car and buckland and things like that I live up a stairwell. You know I only got two hands and all the stuff I gotta carry in this kid up and down the stairs it just it's so tiring it takes a toll on me, it really does so. The physical support having him around is just he does the dishes you know from time he'll get the laundry separated and stuff that is what I care about now my daughter's death. anytime I asked her money he, like here go here go here go as long as y'all put me on child support here you go here. I don't give a damn about any of that money or you know child or any of that it's just I would much rather have somebody who doesn't give me $1 but you know gives me all the time, and my kid and is able to help physical."
527.0,Provider,yeah so does he understand that that's where you're at in regards to the relationship at this point that it's not any more than that.
3645.0,Patient,"Oh no, it is, it is, I do still love him it's definitely not like it was. Before I think I was crazily in love, but obviously I hadn't had a kid for nine years once I was pregnant, I feel like that whole pregnancy made me love him. More than I, maybe should have or more than I realized I didn't need to I don't know, but then he went to jail, we split he got into a new relationship, I was very postpartum depressed. I started drinking heavily before I got into your guys's Program. My son, I was very, very depressed and now that like we're together, I look back at all that depressed shit you know I went through. pregnant and then having my son by myself in the hospital during Calvin and it was like it was even worse all this like this is kind of actually really disappointing. Like I don't know he's not the same person at all. Okay he's working now, though, maybe it's it was I was attracted to the bad I don't know I don't know he's doing well, he is, and you know he helped and i'm very thankful, and I let him know i'm thankful for that. But that stuff I try my best to be nice, and so I just don't think I feel the same way as I used to."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, and I guess that's what. You know I want you to know that it's okay to you know end relationships, if you. need to I mean and set some limits on. You know how you want him involved in in his child's life to I mean he is the father, so I mean. That you have to take well. consideration, but you know, are you guys going to you know, can you guys be."
3645.0,Patient,Normal together right.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah and you know if. He wants to date somebody else, or you want to date somebody else like is that something that that is. Okay, with the two of you. and And would he can, would he. still be able to live there, you know that's kind of. What those are the boundaries and things like that that you have to, I think. Think about for yourself."
3645.0,Patient,"Yes, him having used my address for pls is a real tough thing on me, because I have to accept the fact that him and I. We need to not bring any buddy here in this home, but if we decide at some point we would rather see other people, we need to be with somebody who can you know financially support that relationship. Because you know, at some point you're gonna have to get out with that you know or or you know his boyfriend I I might. Talk to or whatever better have you know something, because he can't come here. So I think this needs to be just about him being cordial with me and co parenting with me and our home and i'll be bringing other people into this home, and if we decide, you know we're cool with. each other, seeing other people, we need to do it outside of the home, so that way it doesn't bring you know chaos into this home. And I just feel like i've already told them already i'm cool with you, if you want to you know see somebody. else just don't cheat on me in my home lab in my bed and act like you know you love. means that you're doing other stuff just please keep it honest because i'm always going to be honest with you and I do, and he knows that, and it makes it so hard on me to know like he cannot be. 100 about stupid little stuff so I chose down and talk to him about that exact thing because, obviously, as an order to go is Bo is here, if he decides he wants to move on, fine I will have to accept them before they like i've done before already. You know just don't disrespect me in my home in your son's home, you know."
527.0,Provider,"And again, you can open that heart to yours and just take care of people and put your your needs to the wayside kaylee so that's why."
3645.0,Patient,i'm that's why i'm that's why i'm here.
527.0,Provider,that's why i'm harping on you here is.

3645.0,Patient,Hello hold on sorry Scott.
527.0,Provider,"Oh, there you are yeah There you are, I lost you. So I was just giving you a hard time about open up your heart and letting people in not taking care of your needs."
3645.0,Patient,Hello.
527.0,Provider,"yep Oh, there you are."
3645.0,Patient,"hi okay so anyways this last time he was locked up OK, so the reason why he's on probation he went ahead and took the plea that they was offering him. Okay, so he told me because his grandmother was sick and in the hospital dying I guess of covert. say it was from covert, I guess, so he just simply to get out to see her well two days after he got out he didn't even get to schedule an appointment with the hospital to see her, she passes away okay so that's really rocking you know, like that's super super super hard on me. Not even. Considering him and how he feels that's that's sad, you know, on me because I love my mother I can't imagine what he feels because that was his that was his place to go for probation That was where he. Was. supposed to be living at so I felt really bad I did. Good after a while people start you know, taking a toll on you. and causing you not to feel so bad anymore about them."
527.0,Provider,"All right, Kelly, I know you're getting ready to leave and drive so we'll have."
3645.0,Patient,A few more minutes I. don't talk with a few more minutes so.
527.0,Provider,"You can't drive, though, can you just sit in. Your car."
3645.0,Patient,"So he takes the probation. Three years probation okay his grandma passes away, he has nowhere to go I allow him to stay here our initial plan was to not even try to date, again we wasn't gonna even try. But somehow or another, I guess, he must have fell in love with me and maybe got to see who I really am because in 2019 that's not who I really was and then last child together as well, so I feel like maybe he's the one more in love now. Maybe the tables are turning. You know now. So I don't know I just feel bad, but like I said, though people cause you not to really care anymore, I guess. I don't know about care if that's the right word it's just you know I start to get like I really wish he had somewhere else if I needed you to be able to leave what am I gonna do I kind of like overwhelming a little bit."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we will definitely have to pick up that conversation and talk more about that then kaylee so I because that's. You know I again my priority is this point. I have you scheduled again on the 21st at three o'clock. or six o'clock. Six o'clock Eastern time okay."
