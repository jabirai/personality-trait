148.0,Provider,"Okay well just yeah always know that you have that option when you are ready, and you know we can talk about it, if you'd like and just set up a plan on how to cope with that. But yeah when you're ready yeah let me know let your doctor know absolutely. how's everything else going, how is recovery."
13490.0,Patient,it's good it's good i'm hanging in there one day at a time. One moment at a time one step at a time. yeah. everything's pretty much good. Good.
148.0,Provider,glad to hear that. How is it going and treatment.
13490.0,Patient,"it's good it's good I don't have any complaints, for once, yeah."
148.0,Provider,Well what's been going on anything that you want to process with me anything that you're learning about that you want to talk about or explore more.
13490.0,Patient,"No, not at the moment I really haven't even talked about this time i'm yeah i'm just i'm glad everything's going good you know, I was kind of fearful for a little while just fun. You know the whole recovery thing and am I going to be successful when I leave here that's my biggest fear, but I know it's just one day at a time one moment at a time and it's really important to live in the moment. You know don't don't what they say don't be free to trippin you know I mean so i'm really working hard at trying to apply everything that i'm learning to my daily life, which is. A noble. really hard, but in one sense, easy to it's just it's. Things are as hard as you make them, you know, so if I make them, simple and I just slowly but generally apply them because we're I mean anybody can be in recovery, but to be. What is the word I say to be like daily in recovery job of recovery, a part of their life is a life change. Right yeah."
148.0,Provider,"there's a huge difference between. putting down and being in recovery right so there's a huge difference between just stopping your use of substances. versus being in recovery working a recovery program you know you're you're doing so much work there's a lot of work that's done in recovery right you're rebuilding you're learning a lot of tools right you're learning a lot of coping learning. How to engage in new and healthier behaviors in your life and making healthier lifestyle choices, sometimes what people will do. Will they'll stop using. But they'll still. be engaging in the same behaviors that they were in in their in their addiction right."
13490.0,Patient,And that's a new behaviors.
148.0,Provider,"yeah and that's a looks a lot different than when you're actually in recovery. yeah so I hear what you're saying and it's a lot of work, and it is important to take it one day at a time and, like you said stay in the present moment practicing that mindfulness mindfulness actually means paying attention in the present moment. You know. What are my thoughts, how was myself talk is it, am I constantly thinking negative, how can I reframe some of that into some more positive because it really makes a huge difference in how your day goes right. And all we really have is today, and the work that we do today, so it sounds like you're doing a lot of work, it sounds like you're learning a lot to. You know one thing they also said that you brought up you know don't future trip. um when you're living in the past you're living in depression nothing that you can change there right. If you're living in the future you're living in anxiety again something you don't have control over just you know thoughts racing thoughts of what could happen what could go wrong, am I going to be successful. But if we if you constantly are bringing your back yourself back to the present moment that is what you have control over so you can actually be at peace right because you have. um and that's important that's important work it's hard work, but it's so worth it in the end. Yes, yeah."
13490.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I did not sleep well last night so i'm like super sleepy. Plus today i'm on. leftovers and dishes so like set the table before each meals, I take it with you everything off the table after the meals wipe it down I watched all the issue all 15 girls now it's just a little overwhelming song. But we have enough time. To me, sorry. We have enough time between. three and four. minutes Okay, because because i'm dishes mines are four to five."
148.0,Provider,So perfect.
13490.0,Patient,we're done yeah i'm gonna go. i'm gonna go lay down for a minute.
148.0,Provider,"let's try and talk just a few more minutes, at least, so we can. give you full credit for an individual session today um. let's see it so nothing else coming to mind that you want to talk about."

148.0,Provider,Like a great me i'm.
13490.0,Patient,"i'm so sorry. I love that family that like head, like, I want to say, basically, I didn't know it, but I like cut me off. Because just my lifestyle and everything like that are like coming around they're giving me drop offs on Tuesdays. they're calling me here on the House when they're calling me on my cell phone you know they're like I just wanna hear your voice, I want to make sure you're still in recovery and. Everything has been if you need anything you know reach out like my slumber, was about to get cut off and i'm right now i'm not working. So I don't have an income, and you know things that I wouldn't normally probably asked my mom for. My aunt is like kind of taken that plays like she paid my phone bill and things like that, and so you know they're like as long as i'm doing the next right thing. Whether people see me or don't see me and I have that integrity about meet they're willing to help as much as they can help you know. She sent me some extra money, and I said that to make it, you know, so their families good somebody is good. I mean definitely good night I just I hope they know how much they mean to me, you know, and I am so grateful to have them, you know. As family and participating in my life and checking on me and me checking on them and I actually can you know call certain family members and not get the voicemail they actually pick up you know it feels good it really does it does."
148.0,Provider,yeah fear feeling really supported right now by them.
13490.0,Patient,"Oh sorry, yes, yes i'm feeling, really, really grateful for my family right now. support."
148.0,Provider,"Good i'm so glad to hear that yeah it's definitely. it's really amazing to see results when you're doing the right thing right like you said just keep doing the next right thing, just keep doing the next right thing, even when you're in stressful situations and you're not sure you know and you're feeling like. You know it's a really hard day and you're not sure how to get through it just do the next right thing, and I promise that things will always fall together. Yes, yeah. Because you are still good enough face some challenges here and there, like you face go on a couple of weeks ago right. And you get frustrated by that and I did hear a little. I don't know correct me if i'm wrong, but I did feel like you were feeling a little hopeless in that moment. Yes, yeah."
13490.0,Patient,"So a little bit. Not too much I knew something would give but at that moment in time, I was just like i'm nothing was giving. So I was like I felt like. And my thing was really I felt like my brother, should I support. should have supported me all I was acting for with cigarettes, but then I thought of it, like other my other counselor to to me like. You have to think of it like this, that you know they are taking care of my children they making sure they have hot water Clean Clothes. Food in their tummy a tutor they go on extra activities, the movie they do different things. And yes, I did send amount of money with my kids my kids are like almost priceless you know there there's no amount of money. That you could ever seen for children and they'd be enough, whether they're with someone 10 days or 20 days you know I mean so and I understand it now, but in the moment I was just like. very, very, very frustrated very hopeless, I felt alone, I felt abandoned, I felt a lot of things you know. When I was. yeah."
148.0,Provider,"And I it's Oh, I just want to remind you how Okay, it is to get to those points because you know we can't control our emotions, in a sense, where. I never want to feel pain, again, I never want to feel upset again, I never want to feel angry again the we're going to be challenged right by different things in life and. It is okay when you're feeling those things and it's important to just you know how can I get through the next 10 minutes. To the next 10 minutes after that and just keep pushing and also when you are having so many emotions coming up like that, like you were having that day. it's important to remind yourself that not only is it okay to feel what you're feeling, but have an outlet for that right do something that's healthy for yourself that can relieve it even just a little bit or just get it out of you for some healing purposes. yeah and you know, sometimes it's just about finding comfort in that discomfort right. Because it's not uncomfortable it's not always going to be how we want to feel exactly but. it's Okay, just like urges and cravings it'll pass right and we'll get. yeah I think you did a really good job that day getting through that."
13490.0,Patient,"I just that day. Like again I that day I was really hopeless like I just didn't know what was going to happen when it was going to happen, and even then after that day, I still had to hang on like I think it was. Two or three more days after that, because I think we met, then my dropbox want to that Tuesday. So I think. We met like on a Thursday or Friday, or something so i'm like the whole weekend Plus, you know that Monday and then I would get my drop off in the afternoon late afternoon because I think they dropped out troubles yeah for or evening for to you know 530 but eventually when it did come. In my cousin already told me I wasn't dropping off another cardinals cigarettes till next month, so he was like what i'm giving you. needs to last, you know basically till then and I still have like you know I don't have a lot left, but I do have four packs left since then, so I have smoked a lot, but I know now i'm starting to even like. Smoke even lesser you know, like like."
148.0,Provider,yeah that's great i'm glad to hear that um yeah and I think you know. it's about how you get through it and the fact that you did get through it and right you got through it sober and that's huge and not just reflects the work that you are doing. yeah. awesome proud of you.
