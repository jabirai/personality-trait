405.0,Provider,hi this is for an appointment with patient first name elsina lci na last name appears P ar D. date of birth is. May 5 1990. And the start time will be about 11am Pacific time.
11651.0,Patient,hi.
405.0,Provider,How are you doing.
11651.0,Patient,"i'm doing Okay, the last few days of just. I have a lot of school work and a lot of i'm just stressed, but like. Overall, like emotionally. Mostly good. I saw Andrea yesterday and. I saw Andrew yesterday, and I saw rhonda. On. Tuesday And I told her on about the calorie restriction. Without her asking me about it."
405.0,Provider,How did that go for you.
11651.0,Patient,"I did it. Dave I did it she didn't show me she didn't tell me like. I told her straight for that i've been mostly limiting myself around 1100 calories a day and tracking and if I get close to like I don't think I told you this, but like if I get close to like 1300, then I start kind of freaking out and. um but. So I had. I had a really big emotional. I mean, I was Okay, I was still like. I was fine but um. I had a big crime episode on Sunday. Because of. just some of the stuff that's coming up in therapy is just you know coming up to the surface and i'm not like. i'm not. i'm not completely numb in therapy, but i'm not feeling the full experience of my emotions, yet, because our process. I haven't processed both we've talked about completely. And after I talked to Andrew last. week on Thursday. I think I shared with you what we talked about, we talked about a lot of like. With my mom's use of drugs around me raising me and stuff like that and. A lot of what's been going on it's just like attachment issues with my mom and feeling abandoned but um so Sunday, I had this I was doing homework. was doing and. I haven't been able to identify any like immediate triggers I just think it's where i've where my state has been the last few days it's just I think it was just going to come up anyways at some point so i'm doing my homework and. It kind of hit me like a ton of bricks like why. Why still harm myself, who I do through like my eating disorder behavior and like why I struggled to. nurture the current relationships that I have and also look back, like on all any of like the romantic relationships i've had arrival like. falling apart well why my belief in why it's not like the real reason why but it's my belief and why and it's it's i've defined my self worth based on what I think my mom thinks of me, and since my mom doesn't. express any anything to me anymore I don't even know what's going on, like we didn't have a falling out or anything I don't know what happened, but like she is so completely different now, and she was raising me because she was so young, so I wrapped my identity and my unbelief like. you're not worthy of love, because even your own mother can love you so what makes you think anybody's gonna love you like the person that like gave birth to you, she can't even love you so no one's going to love you and and it just. A kidney. And then I realized like how that relates to my eating disorder. And I talked to Andrew about this yesterday, too, but like. So I like I know. So I don't think very highly of myself, I mean that's why i'm in therapy, so I don't think very highly of myself i've definitely improved a lot over the years, from where I was like maybe 1015 years ago when I was younger. But i'm still not where I would like to be and. So, so I, I know, like here in my mind that like. On an objective. Objectively, according to like many social standards in our culture, like i'm an attractive person because, like i've been able to like i've not been rejected, very much by people that i've i've approached and anybody that i've wanted to. Try relationship with i've been in a relationship with I haven't been I haven't been told, no a lot and. And when I was in my early 20s when I was like really heavy into like. You just like the party lifestyle and like I was really manipulative and stuff like that, just to get whatever I wanted for free and then I used. I use my parents like oh like you're this young attractive white girl in your early 20s so like you can just like charm people and get whatever you want, so I knew I could use that. To get whatever I wanted so like I knew that but I don't feel that way about myself and and i'm not saying like it's okay to like manipulate people to get we won't be some what they think of you, but like. But it's like I know how so how a lot of people outside of me will see me but I don't see myself as such, and so, how that relates to the eating disorder is. i'm going to do a disgusting thing to make myself look for i'm going to do repulsive things to make myself repulsive and my consequence will be I look repulsive. If that makes sense. And kind of like a self fulfilling prophecy kind of thing."
405.0,Provider,And so thank you for for sharing what you have been following that last aspect so to white and so you're going to make yourself a poster to white and.
11651.0,Patient,"I think, just to keep myself from. I think, to validate for myself. How I believe I see myself."
405.0,Provider,"And so, essentially, how you feel internally, you want to make sure is expressed externally."
11651.0,Patient,"I guess in a way, like. kind of in a way of like. Making my beliefs right. I don't know if i'm articulating it very well because I don't i'm not used to talking about this kind of stuff so."
405.0,Provider,"Right yeah you read his part, and so I can tell you then you've been introspective reflecting a lot more, and like you're saying you're trying to make sense of it and it's the worst do it to communicate it. To others and so so then so then so there's been a been a pattern for you within your life, where. your mother held in it, you had there's an image, you have of your mother holding an image of you and you've been striving for that you never been able to reach it, and like you said you don't even know how your mother views you. Nonetheless, you have an idea of how you imagine she she expects you to be and you can't you can't reach it, so you feel like you're never ending disappointment and not good enough when her painful emotions and at the same time. You can recognize it, although people interact with you in ways that don't align with how you see yourself. And then there that's that's quite a discrepancy and then there's. Then, then is there something about that discrepancy itself that is very unsettling, which is why there's that additional motivation to make yourself a pure repulsive so it does fit with how you feel inside."
11651.0,Patient,"And I don't know it's hard to answer i'm not really sure, and I, maybe it's probably because, like. summary, the neighbors chickens usually start freaking out exactly what this time every day. I think it has something to do is like one Okay, I think it has to do is like fear of success and fear of happiness, because I realized that about myself like. Maybe. Maybe like nine months before I went to rehab when I was like in my last relapse and I remember like sitting outside by myself and. I wasn't intoxicated but I was like. You know just miserable and suffering because the state of my life and my behaviors and my beliefs and. Whatever but. I was sitting outside myself on a on a curb and was just contemplating everything like. My many existential crises and realize like I self sabotage a lot because i'm terrified of being happy because I don't know what it's like to be happy and successful because it's so unfamiliar to me. And if I do it to attain happiness and success, I will love it so much, but i'll end up losing it and i'll suffer even more when I lose it, so I might as well, never try. And being that has a little bit to do with. The self abuse and making myself repulsive because my experience of bars and all of my relationships have just. disintegrated well, not all of them, but like the. Like significant other relationships and quite a handful friendships to and then with my mom."
405.0,Provider,"i'm. Sorry, how have those disintegrated what's the pattern that you've observed in yourself and your relationships."
11651.0,Patient,"And this is where, and this is where i'm like really like i'm realizing like okay now you are being a little bit absurd like where I was within myself in those relation in those relationships that i've had. Like i've grown a little bit. Between each one, so they haven't all been as like volatile and. Just so emotionally driven. But i've still not been a completely like internally healthy emotionally. Intelligent mature adult. And likewise with the partner to. But basically, like the first relationship was probably the worst relationship, and that was like. That was all through middle school in high school and into my. Basically, from like age 13 to 20 off and on and like that was very. That was very passion passion driven and it did get like violent physically. Emotionally. There was no sexual abuse in that relationship, but we also were using a lot of drugs together. And when that relationship ended, I met the next person, I was in a relationship with we also. I mean we met at a house party, when we were drunk that's how it started and that's kind of how it was and. And that was when my drinking was probably the most out of control. and That partner, so I was drinking like I was going on party and getting blackout and not coming home just all of that, and then he. I mean, he was also like in his late teens and early 20s so he wasn't like emotional mature either, and he. I don't know how real it is or not, but at that time he had shared with me that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and. He also had an eating disorder as well, but we didn't share the eating disorder I didn't know I had an eating disorder at that time. So I know like he had his own stuff that he hadn't fully like worked out or healed from and that ended when he found out that I had cheated on him with his best friend, when I was drunk and rightfully so and then. The relationship after that was. That was because I was. I was not emotionally capable to be single and process, what happened with the last relationship so I immediately met this other person. And like basically just moved in with him, like a daily like a day later and that lasted for like a year, and that was just kind of like escaping from myself and. not allowing myself to just like evaluate my life and where i've been irresponsible. And then that ended that ended because I moved, but it was get that relationship was getting pretty bad because that's when I my drinking was still really out of hand and. I started getting violent when I was in a blackout drunk and I was in I blacked out all the time and so he was basically a victim of like my drunken violence. And then I moved and then the last serious relationship, I was in that one. God that one was that one really mess with me. Because God amen um. I never like I had changed a lot, I had done a lot of work on myself. And I had tried like I had. been sober for a little bit, so I was like working on that I wasn't like fully like getting sustained like sustained sobriety but, like, I was working on it and trying. But I was like in the middle of like a closet relapse at that time and, like lying about it to everybody and. And he was like. The perfect perfect person, but he was a person that I was like I was serious like very serious about and we actually were. Talking about getting like establishing a life together and I never like I never believed in marriage and I didn't want to have kids but then I thought well with this person I would be I would be okay with doing that, with this person. Because I love this person and I, and I would just want to do life with this person, whatever that looks like and I, and I can be okay with like. If he wants to be married like if that's what he wants, I want to be with him so that i'm okay with that and so all this stuff changing me and. Then that relationship just fell apart, too, and my like my part was like I said I still hadn't fully worked on myself I didn't give myself time to just like not be distracted by things outside of me. And I and then in him, like. You know it's not the fault of anybody, but like I know it's him he. He was right, like he was raised, like in a. jehovah's witness household and so he didn't really share a lot of details with me but. I know a little bit about jehovah's witnesses and and so, and he didn't he lived with his parents until he was 30 so he had never really like gone out on his own and. So there were just some things with him like he just liked a lot of his own life experience. And there were some. He finally came clean T, but there was some deception like coming from him, but then I saw why deserve it, because I was lying about my drinking. But then like that. came to close, when I went to rehab. And I I didn't leave. My intention was to like go to rehab and get better and then go back. And I left. I went from humble I was living in Humboldt county up North in the state and went all the way down to orange county for rehab so I went really far away for 30 days is the intention and then I realized after 30 days like. I need more time, and so I stayed there to do the sober living program for like nine months, and he. He interpreted that, as I was leaving him that I was abandoning him and I had tried to explain to him, like. If I stay with you and don't do this like i'm probably going to commit suicide or drink myself to death, and I would rather you not wake up to a dead person I need to do this, and he didn't he. couldn't wrap his head around that he's still thought it was abandoning him, and so we just stopped talking for a long time and. Now we talk once in a while and that's kind of weird it's still messaged me a little bit and we haven't had a conversation about like our relationship or anything. But it's just. The I don't I don't know."
405.0,Provider,What what's the why cuz you're talking about what emotions a noticing or what's called hear about.
11651.0,Patient,"It hurts till. It hurts still because, like, I thought I was so sure that. I was really sure of it and. I don't know and it's been like. And this ended like three years ago and i've and i've processed it and I have no i've like been opens like meeting other people, but anytime i've met someone else like they're just a hassle and I just i'm like. Why did this not work out why can I meet somebody else's decent maybe I don't deserve that um. Maybe that's not for me like some people just spend the rest of our lives single like that's fine but it's not like. What I wanted and. And maybe it is because, like, I am a repulsive person, you know. And it hurts, and then, so it hurts talking about it hurts thinking about it like this, and being honest about it, and then I feel shame myself because it's like. it's been like over three years now you're going to still sit here and cry about it and i'm ashamed because, like I like i've said i've even tried. To like. be open with other people and an explorer like something else, and something different, and and I have and it's just turned into crap and. And it's like why, why does this not work like why Why am I doing things like let myself involved, but like I still can't like emotional in the mind. um. yeah so i'm ashamed of myself for that I feel like maybe i'm just being infantile. Yes to just like shane."
405.0,Provider,"I can see that if it hurts like you're saying, are you discussing with yourself angry with yourself or feeling those emotions to. feeling the hurt."
11651.0,Patient,"um. Not not discussed, but just kind of like um. This is why I wanted to get a dictionary of emotions because there's many emotions I don't know the words to describe them. kind of like. I don't know the right word to describe it. I would say it is under the umbrella of shame, just like come on now like you should be over this now like."
405.0,Provider,"saying I think that's along the lines of contempt or distain like when we could because, even when you before you describe the relationship kind of thing God damn it and, like an. inflammatory way and it seemed like usually and I think it is related to shane where contempt is like. Looking down at someone in an angry way but there's an error or of superiority and I think this is in relationship to yourself, on the one hand it's contempt, you should get over what's wrong with you. And then, at the same time you're feeling ashamed because of how you're experiencing it, so I think it's kind of like that that the that. That kind of pattern of like, on the one hand, or shame on the other hand, is contempt like looking down upon yourself in in that kind of angry way for feeling those feelings, while you're also feeling for shame simultaneously does that make sense."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah that's a great way, to put it, because, like, I was having this mental image of kind of like a parent. scolding our kid for. doing wrong when the kid knows better. Right and so yeah it's it's a lot like that."
405.0,Provider,"that's interesting though because they're that. Because I think you could tell them i'm just observing you and and then there. But i'm observing is. I think they. Did you try the weather, I don't know if it's conscious I suspect not it's I think you try to. Emotions can be overwhelming and so there's there's. A process within you that I think is automatic where emotions are kept a way in one way that's done is kind of focusing on details and facts and at the same time, the emotions come through anyway. or they may come through like. Without your awareness kind of like all like a flood or like too much you know and then and then so that can seem very unsettling if you feel like you're in control and then all of a sudden, you get these bursts of emotions. And so, then I was noticing that I think that you know that you were you were sharing a lot of details about what's happening and and I. And I think you were trying to come across in and like compose way to present the information, and I think that I was noticing, though the emotions were coming through. Like when you said God damn it or some of the ways that you were referencing yourself, or even, as you were saying like how could you. still be feeling these emotions like they're the emotion that you convey during some of those senses does seem along the lines of content. So I say that because it's kind of like there's the there's what you're trying to communicate and there is how you're doing it in the emotions. That are impacting your experience and all these different subtle ways that i'm just sharing with you what i'm observing about how you're coming across."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah no that's that's actually that's. Good because that's how I do try to approach things like not be so emotionally driven and just be very objective and just straightforward and matter of fact, because, like. Because the way that I was before, when I was younger was I was just so emotionally driven and I didn't care, and now I realized like well yeah like you can have emotions and that's fine, but like you don't have to let them drive you all the time."
405.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11651.0,Patient,But then I guess on the. other end of the extreme it's stifling it down and and not knowing how to be like appropriately expressive with them.
405.0,Provider,"Right after that that's a good way to describe it is it sounds like you, you became aware of how used to be too emotional and then now you've kind of. overcorrected with the more analytical sack driven at the same time, like you said you stifle your emotion emotion so we'll come up anyway so then it's, how do you find that that. That compromise where you're able to acknowledge the analytical the facts experienced the emotions, in a way that and by doing that actually helps to modulate them so that they aren't too overwhelming. Out of curiosity when, as you as you thought about us meeting today, did you think about what you wanted and make sure that you said, and like. prepared in a way, so that there's a sense of control, about how you present the information so that so that realizes the emotions and the surprise that could arise it theories and something structured you're smiling and laughing."
11651.0,Patient,"No, not at all, not at all the kettle no because I never thought of approaching therapy that way because I figured therapy is just kind of like. It can only be as authentic and real as it can be when it's not planned and I and that's where all the truth really comes out and even if I did want to like try to plan and manipulate therapy sessions I don't have time."
405.0,Provider,To.
11651.0,Patient,orchestrate something like that I have way too much.
405.0,Provider,"that's fair know some some people do that it's like emotion regulation strategy so then that's not your approach so, then I think the way you came up, then you will come across as here that you're kind of try it you're striving to be very. fact based analytical and then, and as we discussed that the emotions so come through anyway. And if you're a city in those relationships with people who are important to you, whether the romantic or otherwise, are you offering preoccupied with those people abandoning you are rejecting you."
11651.0,Patient,"There are. There are two specific friends that comes to my mind that I feel like one one abandonment and the other projection. and the one that I feel abandonment with. Our friendship, has always been kind of because she's in school, too, and she she actually she was a stem major but she switched to psychology because she was like I don't have a life. and I was a psychology major and I just switched to stems I have no life now. But because of of. And she's going to a school on a. On a term schedule, instead of a semester schedule so she's like she always has, like all kinds of school work to do. So our friendship is always been kind of like we'll see each other once every few months and, like we try to play phone tag and we'll catch each other, once in oil but, like the latency between. Our are responding to each other and communication lately has been a lot longer than what it's typically been and so that now i'm starting to feel like oh Maybe she like doesn't want to talk to me anymore and. Then the friend that i'm feeling rejection with is i'm not putting a lot of energy and effort into it, I already did a little bit, but I don't want to overstep boundaries for like we. We were friends and we were roommates were mixed once and it worked out really well and then like that house was owned by the Bank and the Bank was putting it back on the market, so we had to move and so. She got a place and I got a place, but then the place that I was in it got really. messy and then she told me that the the corner that she and her mom had moved into had an extra bedroom and they were thinking about renting it out. So I moved back in with them and we we weren't compatible roommates anymore, and we had a little bit of a falling out, and so I moved out and I gave it some space for. A good like three months I just was like we're gonna let it kind of just simmer and cool down. And then I got back in touch with her when it was her birthday and just to like hey happy birthday and like I. want to let you know, like, I still care about you, I hope, we're still friends, but I don't I also don't want to like be overbearing so if this bothers you let me know and I won't bother you, but if it's Okay, can we still be friends and she said, like yeah we can like we miss you too. we're going to this, a meeting on Friday nights Do you still like. I was doing game nights with friends on Friday nights but now I can't. But then we haven't talked since then and. So I just I don't know how that is that's. I don't know if the friendships going to be the same after the falling out I just say might be I don't know. But the friendships that I that I to. Have that i'm still in contact with on a regular basis. I don't have like. I don't give the time and attention that I. wish I could and wish I had. i'm part, partly because i'm in school and in therapy and doing another 12 step program now, but then the other part, is like. it's still hard to make connections with some people, because I know them from like a and sometimes I like. don't know if I want to still be in a day and so i'm like kind of hesitant about. Staying close with them, but, but they also understand like. they're also really forgiving because, like they've gone through periods of time to where like. They have a hard time reaching out to their friends and maintaining their their relationships and so they don't like. They never say like where have you been like Where are you calling me oh they're just like oh hey it's nice to see you again, so I never feel like i'm doing something wrong because they understand. Does that answer the question straightforward."
405.0,Provider,"Yes, thank you and Ashley as you were talking about. Something came into my mind, and I was wondering. Like you said you're you're busy with school and so maybe you don't you don't have as much time which I understand is there. This is all along the lines of what you were describing. At that deep level just feeling how repulsive you are and at one level, you understand that. People interact with you in ways that are not how you see yourself and at the same time, I wonder, though, that if if it. If it terrifies you for people to really see the real you because you would imagine that they would then be repulsed like you feel, and so, then I wonder then. With whether it's with the drinking, at a time, or whether it's eating disorder behaviors are with school when you're devoting your energy to those those are reasons why you're also not. Getting intimate relationships with people, and I mean you're not necessarily maybe you are maybe you're not necessarily you are thinking about it this way. When your attention is directed to those that that's a way to block you from actually forming intimate relationships that you would imagine would result in people, seeing the real repulsive you and I can imagine that we are terrifying so I was wondering what you thought about that."
11651.0,Patient,"huh yeah I definitely consistency that was like the the eating disorder behaviors this the school thing like. Like I actually really like when i'm studying and it's it's really beautiful stuff and it's just it's tedious and. What i'm hoping to do what i'm actually wanting to do and i'm i'm trying. With what little I do have to give to try is so. My one of my professors he just started a stem club at our at our school we didn't have before so he gotten started and. And we have like a discord server together and everything, and we do like monthly zoom meetings together just for whatever. And then. The instructor actually just got this started we're having our first meeting on. Monday, Tuesday. it's a peer to peer connection for all the stem club students. And it's like. it's going to be maybe like a monthly or bi weekly meeting of like just a small group of us, maybe like. five to six of us to talk about like life and hardships and challenges and successes and i'm hoping like what I really honestly like to do like if i'm yes, if i'm honest I don't have anybody to talk about this really because, like everybody knows from Tulsa recovery. If i'm honest i'd rather not be in 12 step recovery anymore and i'd rather find people that have like these kinds of interest, but also want to share like life stuff and rollable stuff and wisdom things and. But have a goal to like learn about the world around them and how they can contribute to society with the skills that they they build doing really challenging work like this. And there's not a lot of people in Tulsa recovery that. There are a handful of people that do go and like try to achieve things, but a lot of them just get sober like Well, this is my life now, this is what God wants me to do so i'm just going to stay here and i'm like I don't get so rich to sit in this room. and talk about my drinking days, and I mean like yeah it's nice to help other people, but like there's so much more to life I didn't get sober just saloon myself and. anytime that I shared with anybody and toast step behind like feeling about it, like I don't know if I really want to stay here anymore they're like. Well you're just gonna have to give it to God, did you do step work writing on it, do you talk to your sponsor like no because that's not really helping and so just feel kind of stuck with that. Does that answer your question about."
405.0,Provider,"You know I think you understand where you're coming from and you're right there's so many different layers to to your experience or what. Most people's experiences in terms of what motivation to do it, so I certainly understand what you're saying, and I was just thinking. That, I know that, as you probably know that the different age groups, there are different types of people who attend particular groups, and then there are some that are on I don't know if your area if there's whether it's a college campus or. Sometimes there are areas, whether it's related to like. I don't know. Sometimes, depending on the gut there's a wonderful and when option, though sometimes medical schools have a camp, there are a 12 step groups there and. I say that, so that there are different kinds of people who would tend them so maybe if there's an academic setting that there might be people who are more aligned with your interest if there was a group. That happened to be located in a place where there are more people say would be able to pretend that you're going to show those kinds of issues."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah there's um. I live relatively close to Davis, and so, like so uc Davis is over there and I know they have like a young people's group over there, but I live like. i'm kind of close to it by lives far enough away where it's like. kind of. inconvenient. it's probably like a 45 minute drive to get there from there. disgusting. yeah."
405.0,Provider,"I understand that it's a bomb so yeah these understand his accountant just that you're facing and. i'm glad to hear that there's this opportunity that you're going to take advantage of and see if you can connect with a few like minded people so that hopefully will be rewarding for you. And I know he's right right, so I appreciate everything you've been saying, and I just wanted to ask a few questions. Out of curiosity after you met with rhonda did you to talk about adjusting the meal plan or what justin calories I know that you start to freak out at 1300 you're typically limited to 1100 do you talk about doing anything differently."
11651.0,Patient,"i'm not yet she said, because I did I didn't I did binge on Sunday after I had my crying episode, and that was also like a wake up call where. I saw how is using food as the same way that I was using drugs but. She pointed out there there's progress, because it was my first. outside of the calories restricting it was my first. behavior in like three weeks and it's been a lot so that's a lot of progress and. And I didn't automatically just go to my behaviors before even having an emotion, like, I actually had the emotion cried amount and sat with it and then afterwards, when I was emotionally exhausted, then I was like well i'd rather feel better now."
405.0,Provider,And it was a.
11651.0,Patient,"conscious decision to just like. feel better you feel better in the long run, so, she said to just like. stick with what i'm doing and focus more on like if I, if I have an emotion, to let myself feel the emotion, but instead of she said. we're not going to cut any tools out of your toolbox so like you always have the option to eat after you feel emotions we're not going to tell you that you can but let's look at like. Putting other tools in your toolbox in your you have more options and just like going straight to your eating disorder. And like so she sent me an email so she wants me to focus less on. Adjustment food right now and more on like. What my other options are a fine start to have like. A really intense emotion. going to me eating disorder."
405.0,Provider,"A good approach to the other person accent. We had talked about it and I had challenged, you asked me to tell rhonda without her differently, asked me what was it did it seem like. What was that, like to hear me suggest that, and then you can use sounds like you thought about it and you follow through what was that process like for you."
11651.0,Patient,"um felt like. It was just basically kind of like well. i've already been knowing this entire time i'm doing something doing on purpose so like i've been aware of it and me, being aware of that, I know, like i'm doing something that. is more beneficial for me to not be doing, and then I open up about it and I told you so it's like okay now I put my truth out there, so like now that you've put it out there, like what good is it just like trying to hide it now, so you might as well, just like own up to it. And so it was just like. Just tell her."
405.0,Provider,"I. wonder if it's kind of like. I know we talked about this, where you won't necessarily live it, you might not necessarily share information on that someone directly asked you if there's a need, we talked about the control there's also something about like you're keeping. Your keeping these parts of yourself close to your close to you in terms of. you're aware of them you're you're afraid that all the other people becoming aware of them for how they might react, and yet. You might, in this case, you might share a little bit in this case last week you share with me, then you share with rhonda about it and then. It didn't go at it wasn't like we rejected, you were humiliated you one of the first things you said she didn't chain you. So then, you might be the more likely to share something and then, when you experience that people are still treating you with respect and dignity that. You might share more and more, and so, then that in itself might end up challenging experientially that that sense of feeling so repulsive there's something wrong with you that other people can't really know the real you and care for you or See you in a positive light that makes sense. So yeah it's, just as you can tell it like get ideas trying to understand you i'll share them with you and see if you think that q's about right. How has it been talking to me today."
11651.0,Patient,"um. it's. I think it's good. Because. I can tell that you listen, I can tell you listen and and. And you pay like you listen you listen and you're really understanding and. And I know the last time that when we talked you asked me about my experience with other psychiatrist in the past and I shared, some of them with you, and like you're the first psychiatrist i've spoken to her have actually felt like. Oh you're actually seeing me as a person, not just says like this patient where you're just going to be like okay here's your scripts things by. Because it's like, how can you know how to make the right decisions for your patient when you know nothing about them and. How can you know anything about them, are not listening and how can you convey their listening by not communicating back to."
405.0,Provider,"Excellent question. glad, so your feedback then about my approach is helpful and certainly adjust, if necessary, to either be clear or. Explain more effectively, so nonetheless of us working together, and so it means we're both contributing to the extent that I need to adjust i'll certainly be willing to do that. I went in so I reflected on last time and then I figured that today we won't necessarily decide on a medication unless you feel like there's an urgency to decide under medication is there a sense from you today."
11651.0,Patient,"Now there's not a sense of urgency. Because, like the last time when we saw each other, I. I remember expressing to you because it's the reason why i'm even inquiring about medication is because of that cyclical depressive cycle that I go into and. I started coming out of it before we saw each other so i'm not in that state of urgency, right now, but it's still something that i'm I want to keep looking at."
405.0,Provider,"mm hmm great so I understood you correctly, so i'm glad that you, you reiterated that and you still been sleeping okay recently."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah well I do so okay honesty I sleep well i'm also like. Taking valerian root and melatonin and benadryl one benadryl and to melatonin and 3 billion room. And I don't know like. I started taking it I i'm using a habitual way now I started taking it. When I was. Staying up all night like when I was really that bad in the eating binging and purging, and so I started, taking it as a way to like we'll just go to sleep and then you don't have to like you know sit here and like fight with yourself in your head i'm like. Are you going to do this you're not going to do this. I just go to sleep and then it's just become like a habitual nightly thing because i'm afraid of like not being able to sleep, if you don't take them. yeah but I but i'm not feeling groggy or anything but, but I am doing that."
405.0,Provider,you're ready for your honesty is the melatonin of those five milligram capsules three milligrams 20 milligrams.
11651.0,Patient,Here there's three milligram tablets.
405.0,Provider,"Okay, thanks. Thank you, do you know how much delirium capsules or tablets are."
11651.0,Patient,um I don't. know you want me to check real quick they're like right there.
405.0,Provider,"Oh sure, thank you."
11651.0,Patient,i'm taking three it says to take three. it's a 1500 90 milligrams per serving.
405.0,Provider,"Serving considered three or 123 Okay, thank you okay. So what what, in terms of the the the reason that brought you into seeing someone like me. i'm going to share an article, because I think it's helpful, I was looking for something that I thought would be educational in terms of you, you liking, the science, you are you curious and then also song that I could particularly. answer some questions about what you might be experiencing in terms of the spring the march time. i'll send it through chat. it's a Time Magazine article. One button. So there is, you probably heard of. Seasonal affective disorder so typically the associate as you see the link. To typically people attributed to because the research is on the research which is generally limited, most of it, focused on people who is depression get worse during the winter like that October November, December. And then, and then it starts to improve February, March, there are people with seasonal affective disorder, who is called reverse seasonal affective disorder where. It actually the depression actually becomes significant in March March, April and then lingers through the summer and then it starts to improve. In the fall, which I think is consistent with your experience typically the way that the manifestation of the reverse seasonal affective disorder. is different than the typical seasonal affective disorder, so the reverse seasonal affective disorder, a lot of what you just drive a lot more agitated. You don't really need to sleep, a lot more energy really suicidal thoughts more depressed as well, more anxious more revved up maybe not eating as much and it's in that kind of that constellation of symptoms Is that correct, I understand the way you described it directly. yeah yeah."
11651.0,Patient,"Definitely definitely that oppression and the agitation the suicide and the suicidal thoughts it's really like honestly. I can do, I can deal with agitation smell depression, because it's like basically my my normal my whole life, but when it comes like suicidal thinking that suddenly. This is. me start doing something."
405.0,Provider,"that's true. yeah so I, so I certainly understand the article has some good tips, which I liked as well because they're trying to find something that is also useful for you so. there's speculation about why this might happen for some people, so some of the speculations or that the increase light and the increase temperature environmental temperature. In the spring somehow impacts your your your brain in a way that then ends up resulting in more education than then that experience depression suicidal thoughts. The suicidal thoughts are thought to be associated with the changes significant changes in mood and so some suggestion that you feel better. Knowing that about yourself that in terms of non medication strategies that you could potentially try to avoid being outside in the mid day when the temperature is the hottest on the hottest, to the extent that you can. Then the extent that you can try to be an air conditioning during the hotter days or. cold rooms cold showers when you're able to some people are encouraged to try to take a nap to try to keep the room dark during the hardest parts of the day, ways to try to mitigate the higher. temperatures in the environment during the during the spring and summer months. bupropion or wellbutrin that's one of the antidepressants that the norepinephrine react take inhibitor so it doesn't modulate serotonin. So, particularly helpful for anxiety can help depression symptoms and it is approved for seasonal affective disorder and it's helpful instead of pressing anyway, and what I can tell you haven't been on that one before that right."
11651.0,Patient,"No, no, on. The lot, the last time I was on. antidepressants I I was on Prozac and. I didn't I was only put on a dose like a very low dose just to see if i'd have side effects before increasing to a therapeutic dose and I didn't like the side effects, so I didn't I just continue taking it and then before that. I was on. A few like it was when I was still drink I hadn't been sober at the time, so I mean it was like it wasn't really doing anything and I wasn't doing anything like to actually try to improve myself and. I had been on depakote before. And I had nightmares on that, so I stopped taking that and then I had been on abilify before. All while still drinking and using drugs and then. lamictal and select tsa. I was put on the limit on selects after. After I got hospitalized the only time I was hospitalized and then. I was on risperdal during that period of when I was."
405.0,Provider,hospitalized for going.
11651.0,Patient,"Oh, that was in. That was in. May of 2009."
405.0,Provider,"Okay, how come, you were hospitalized."
11651.0,Patient,"I had a suicide attempts. And so I had a suicide attempt. I had been using a lot of psychedelic. Drugs at the time, so I was. insane also and. and I had been drinking one night I had been suicidal for a long time and I had been drinking one night and. got in a fight not not a physical fight just an argument with my boyfriend at the time, and so I left and I lived on the other side of town and so I was walking across town, and I was on. The main road that goes around it's like it's on a mountain it goes like up the Hill and it's windy and it's like 45 mile per hour two lane road, and so I was walking in the middle of the road, trying to get hit by a car and a friend of mine. He had called me and I told him what I was doing so he called the COPs and the COPs Tommy and. I had I had abrasions on my arm from from previous self mutilating episode and so like the COPs found me and because I was under agent intoxicated and I had paraphernalia and substances on me they were they said. We could take you to jail or we could. Just pretend like we didn't see what we saw and you can go to the hospital and get helping you should probably do that, instead, and so I decided on that because I knew I needed help, and so I went and they did a. They did like a 16 hour hold. And it took me to a i've all i've voluntarily went in and patient because I knew because i'm. I was ready to start asking for help, but I didn't know what that was going to entail."
405.0,Provider,"Sure, for sure. Thank you for explaining that to me. And so, in the generally any antidepressants certainly reasonable for treating this seasonal affective disorder who program wellbutrin is has that indication by the FDA and so. oftentimes people are started on their the antidepressants at a month or so two months before say March, April. Sometimes the doses increase to a higher dose during the summer months it could be lowered and then person come off it or some people say i'm like a lower dose. Throughout the year and going to higher dose during that time so i'm just letting you know different strategies to approach that particular circumstance. As as i'm talking what kind of reactions, do you have."
11651.0,Patient,"um I. Do reverse seasonal affective disorder makes a lot of sense and I didn't know that like I knew about seasonal affective I didn't know about the reverse one. And it seems like really counterintuitive because it's like well the sun's out and like it's summer it's warm outside and I do like to be outside, and so it just seemed kind of weird, but it does make a lot of sense from higher describing it and. And so I just. actually feel better now you pointed that out and brought that to my attention so it's like oh wow okay that that does explain a lot of things. So. I and that's all that's, all I can say right now, because it's anything else."
405.0,Provider,"that's fair so yeah definitely feel free to read the article, and then there is a psychiatrist who essentially first coined the phrase season laughter disorder reference as well, so it is my perspective, it is legitimate article I can get it over time did a good job of. interviewing a person with the experience and then talking to professionals about it and I figured it just gives you a foundation something to read to kind of. tether you to what this what this is like, and if it does seem to fit with your experience, so this that's what i'm leaning towards now about that aspects and then in terms of US meeting again with next week around the same time, work for you. Okay, so what i'll do is i'll let amanda know in terms of the link and then we'll continue the conversation."
11651.0,Patient,Thank you so much.
405.0,Provider,Any other reactions to what we've covered today.
11651.0,Patient,"and Now I do I do just want to say, like it's nice to talk to somebody who's like. expertise in this kind of stuff that's not like a 12 step program person who's like well you just need to take a look at your partner to pray about it it's like. It doesn't it's Nice and it feels nice once in a while, but that doesn't feel like it's actually coming to a real solution of anything. So I feel like i'm actually getting somewhere."
405.0,Provider,that's important that's important to feel that way like you're getting somewhere else i'm glad that you're experiencing that. it's good to see you and i'll see you next week.
11651.0,Patient,Thank you.
