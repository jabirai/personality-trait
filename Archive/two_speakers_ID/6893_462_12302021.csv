462.0,Provider,"yeah. Good you know new year's is a night, where a lot of people are drinking and using and so, if you need to just keep yourself cozy and doors and stay away from that and that's pretty good plan. How was Christmas, I know, sometimes you go to family get togethers and there's people drinking and you'll leave early."
6893.0,Patient,"And we didn't go anywhere this year. My mom's pretty much got herself in quarantine she really doesn't want anybody they're not even. my sister goes there she's got a State so far away from her right yeah. Because she's really worried about getting sick. I talked to her everyday I haven't been over there, but at least talk to her okay. She gets her."
462.0,Provider,yeah. She wants to stay isolated a little bit understandably.
6893.0,Patient,It was starts feeling better I mean she's good enough to go home but she's still not 100%. it's only out of bed four or five hours a day. castaway.

So, of the last couple when we've gotten that little bit of snow shovel driveways for him, he had a heart attack Bush here."
462.0,Provider,that's Nice. We kind of talked about them group just doing acts of service for others it.
6893.0,Patient,was two storms I shoveled about. it's like it feels good. You said you make me look slow it's a don't relax I got it. Like when the car was down it bring us to the store take you know stuff like that.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like overall things are going pretty well, would you agree, or are there any major barriers or struggles that are sticking out to you right now."
6893.0,Patient,"Go back to sleep it's killing me it's like as soon as the diaspora tab where saw awake and go back to sleep. I get that for four and a half hours good, solid sleep."
462.0,Provider,Oh yeah that's. Something but that's not much is there anything that you think would help you.
6893.0,Patient,She tried me with gabby. That just made me feel like I was hung over the next day.
462.0,Provider,Okay it's not.
6893.0,Patient,"My body just learning to deal with the. way down with my eyes closed, I will fall asleep but i'll watch the TV or whatever I have been theater."
462.0,Provider,"yeah at least relaxing is helpful, are you able to take any NAPs during the day."
6893.0,Patient,I lay down try to put I usually don't fall asleep.
462.0,Provider,"At least that relaxed time is a little bit helpful right at least your body you're letting your body know this isn't time to be up and moving, but just resting."
6893.0,Patient,What happened to ain't worth of crap right now.
462.0,Provider,yeah you're having a lot of stomach problems has that subsided.
6893.0,Patient,"The so friend helps with the not getting sick in the morning, but I still get pain, when I eat pain in my stomach. i'm waiting to hear. They sent me to a gastroenterologist so."
462.0,Provider,Perfect that's good that's a good next step.
6893.0,Patient,"He literally would push great hearing it's like there's that hurt yeah that's the hernia. I don't understand how the guy went in with the scope and didn't see that it's like something is not. that's what I thought, again I said I was red flag at that hospital they don't take me seriously. So. he's got to find a doctor, that is going to take me seriously."
462.0,Provider,yeah. that's a good step if you don't feel like you're being heard you can seek a second opinion or find someone that you feel supported by.
6893.0,Patient,With darkness trying to find another.
462.0,Provider,"glad you have Dr McDonald, it seems like there's a really good relationship there, so at least you have that support."
6893.0,Patient,"yeah here's a good doctor. He was the reason I still have my notes, because they were going to make me choose. first thing shontelle told me that he. never make. choose between have to choose between your mental health savior. But that's not right they get that."
462.0,Provider,It is indeed.
6893.0,Patient,"I think i've done well to get myself down and four milligrams from where I was at I was at 32 milligrams at one point. A lot a lot. And i've. still been. it's not every other night, like every third or fourth night. i'll kind of. strip it down and try to get through the next day, with just two milligrams. So i've been able to do that, a few times."
462.0,Provider,So you basically committed to this as well that goal of continuing to taper down and eventually go off it seems like you're steadily working towards that.
6893.0,Patient,"Cigarettes for. A bigger month or two of you ready to go. Cigarettes it's the first 48 hours, the worst, I know that when I went through, for the first 48 hours to kill me when you really get the dts and you want a cigarette. But after that it was so."
462.0,Provider,yeah well. One thing at a time.
6893.0,Patient,they've said these nicotine inhalers. And I chew on it. I just shoot the crap out of them. And that's how I got through it.
462.0,Provider,"And it worked yeah so you can do what you gotta do to get through this I like the idea of one thing at a time right so focus on the smoking and then you can go back to the suboxone. Alright, so we've got some good goals, it sounds like the sleep is the biggest difficulty right now so maybe just keep brainstorming otherwise. try not to pressure yourself, sometimes it can even be mental where you're like I need to sleep, I need to sleep, maybe say I don't need to sleep and i'm just going to relax and it might involve putting some music on or TV or something and just being."
6893.0,Patient,i'm the opposite of most people most people when they want to calm down they put on something no one I need to calm down I put on thrash metal or death not heavy.
462.0,Provider,Are you.
6893.0,Patient,"In it calms me down i've fallen asleep to it, many. times and kim's like, how do you do that, I would never be able to fall asleep to that, I should just calm down."
462.0,Provider,"I have some metal head friends, and it does not work for me, but I do see the logic behind it, like, I said that mental thing where sometimes. Rather than just forcing yourself to sleep, maybe you say i'm going to be up and listen to some metal and that can work for some people, so if that works for you go for it."
6893.0,Patient,"i'm 48 but i'm still I still listen to music, when I was 15. motley crue skid row. I figured out how to do it on my computer, so I can take any video on YouTube download the music put it in my library, but i've been going through all the old."
462.0,Provider,"classic so that's great so that's something you can do when you can't sleep, maybe throw that on and. Just let yourself enjoy the music."
6893.0,Patient,"it's not my do that when i'm manic i'll do that i'll download music, because it keeps my mind occupied on that one thing. But i'm doing three different things at once i'm looking at the sugar P writing down the songs the same time i'm find them on YouTube download them put them in my library and then organize them all, at the same time it's crazy."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
6893.0,Patient,Five different things at one time. it's like. No problem but. Not manic it takes me a lot longer.
462.0,Provider,"giving you something to do that's healthy though right, rather than being mad again involving and something unhealthy you're just kind of doing all these things and it's there's no harm there, which is okay that's."
6893.0,Patient,better than sitting back and trying to deal with my head when i'm.
462.0,Provider,ready to go well for me.
6893.0,Patient,When I snap at people and I get.
462.0,Provider,yourself. To be able to just sit back and do it all in your head it's something physical and sound auditory can is is very helpful.
6893.0,Patient,"US musics always, then I was 12 years old, my parents bought me this great big huge boom box nice take it everywhere, with me. She did Columbia house and have my own book take out a bunch of music, like the doors Jimi Hendrix that. Black Sabbath.

Because, so my to make it up, she thought that, for me, so no."
462.0,Provider,that's nice that's a genuine gift.
6893.0,Patient,"that's The one thing that I used to walk around with those you know the little tape recorders. That one goes that I will record music on the radio and walk around with and listen to, because that's what the only thing I was into. That and efficient so. that's what I did. Okay."
