Like a schedule, like a work schedule again so i've been trying to just get used to it. And it's Okay, I mean, I think the hardest part of it is just like having to wake up early for me because I just i'm not i'm not a morning person so. yeah I love to sleep so that's like the only thing, but I am getting used to it, I feel better about it and. everything's been okay. I because i've been so busy I have not had time to think about like getting any pads anything like anything at all so."
416.0,Provider,it's amazing how that works.
8150.0,Patient,"I was like wow this is when you have more time on her hands it's like you have more time to think about stuff that you know you probably shouldn't be thinking about but um. What do we do is OK, I have a lot of experience babysitting and my job is kind of I feel like it's kind of like babysitting giving medications at the same time. I feel. lucky, because I have had a lot of experience with my sister's kids when I was like really, really young so. yeah like what two years ago i'm stopped, so I I feel great and then also have some other news."
416.0,Provider,Tell me.
8150.0,Patient,I applied for the Albion to oren bridge program here at my school. I got accepted.
416.0,Provider,"crush your book so great, when do you start."

416.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh it's right around the corner."

416.0,Provider,How long is the Program.
8150.0,Patient,"it's it's too it's four semesters which is around two years but we tested into it and I tested into the second semester so it's gonna be like the same thing as this program like a year and a Semester, which is like a year and a half. And it's it's kind of like. kind of long, but you know what is what it is at least it's not for some students. But yeah."
416.0,Provider,wow. that's crazy and cool.
8150.0,Patient,I know.
416.0,Provider,"What is it like what's your ultimate goal, what do you where do you see yourself professionally."
8150.0,Patient,"i'm my goal was to be just an rm like it didn't even matter if I didn't get like my bsn or anything I just wanted to be an RN but I had applied to the program and I got in to like the second phase of it, which is. Being. Being an alternate so if one other person, one of the people that didn't get accepted denied their place or. uh huh they don't want to go, then they would call us and then that's when I would have gone in, but no one did that, then that happened twice, so this time around. It was only three of our three girls from our class who were able to bridge over so."
416.0,Provider,wow that's amazing. your hard work is just really paying off isn't it.
8150.0,Patient,feels good feels good other people can see that as a volume.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So. What about all the things that you've been doing or you had been doing to like really. You know, manage mood and all of that, like are you still able to to do those kind of self care things like the journaling and the jam and."
8150.0,Patient,"journaling not really because I I have committed getting used to charting which takes forever for me right now. And when I get home i'm still charting sometimes I don't have, and then I don't have time to journal, but I do have time to make time to go to the gym and that has really, really helped. With the stress, because they do get stressed out sometimes. it's. I know it's kids tense just your sometimes. But yeah and I don't because i'm so busy like when i'm there i'm so busy in my head, I have to be like professional like I can't show that if i'm feeling like a sad or i'm feeling. i'm not even I don't even feel like soft or anything but like, if I were, I know that I have to focus on what i'm doing you know so um when I get home that's like when I start to feel like a little more stressful. And that's one also like i'll be like you need to go to the gym because I every time I come back, I feel better I just feel like I have no problems, you know, or sometimes. I have had like instances where we're in like spirited. Any little thing like. Just just. Just don't don't talk to me, I know you know. Normal or."
416.0,Provider,that's pretty normal.
8150.0,Patient,"yeah so I just do that or i'll take a nap because, like I said I would go early and i'm not used to that so soon, can I just take the like a short nap and then we'll open and good good so and like I said I have not had time to like feel any any type of. Like reaction any type of sadness or anger or anxiety um Why do come like I said I come home and I just feel super stressed like like 10 scene and like when you're tense all day and then how many wanna you you exhale on your a good, so the only thing I have been doing. Sometimes I will sometimes I will just feel like irritated and just want to like pop that I remember like. Just step out of of what i'm feeling right now and just get."
416.0,Provider,into your wise mind.
8150.0,Patient,yeah yeah so i've been doing that and that works that helps a lot.
416.0,Provider,"But i'm. The only thing that i'm hearing or that i'm not hearing in here it's like when do you allow yourself to just feel whatever it is that you're feeling yeah worry or sadness, or whatever that was before that's kind of what you were getting out through journaling."
8150.0,Patient,"i'm. Like so when I come home. Will during like will, after the gym after the gym is one I can like allow myself to feel because i'm not. i'm more relaxed i'm it's everything's not built up. I feel like after I can really process, I can talk so like, for example, before the Jen I don't want to talk to like my boyfriend because they. say I mean I do it's like not like i'm just seminary him, but like I can hold a conversation and feel, because I know where i'm going to feel. Like whatever we're talking about like it gets it gets me gets me emotions with like if he's having problems or if i'm having problems if I talk about it before. I do some type of like exercise or some some physical thing. we're going to the store something for me, I have to do something for me and I like. Go to the store and stuff. After that I can talk about it better to talk about my feeling second, even if I don't talk about it, I know, in my head, I can feel and just process like oh this happened today or. This was worrying me, but I can think about it now, and I can think rationally and just. yeah that's kind of like my journaling, but I do want to get into don't leave me alone, I do want to get into back into truly um it's just it's been hard, because I feel like."
416.0,Provider,"yeah you've got a lot going on, I get it."
8150.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, but I do do that and. I, that is my my best time to feel to let go to process, what happened to to not leave everything built up inside, because you know it's a good thing."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah. it's about kind of get out. Chris hello, are you still I haven't worked alone. Are you still able to attend any of the groups."
8150.0,Patient,"Because I will go in from. From. depends sometimes 730 or eight to 330 or four. But. yeah no I don't think so, unless I have to have to like ask if I can go on. Later, like 10 that day on Tuesday. And if that works and, yes, I can. Because I know like go group."
416.0,Provider,So we can switch how often you go. given your work schedule why don't we. do want to try and do like a once a month group.
8150.0,Patient,"Yes, I would go with me."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, but then you gotta get like do that, once a month right."
8150.0,Patient,yeah really good.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so who wants to go."
8150.0,Patient,And it can be can choose any any week that I go to.
416.0,Provider,Okay. yeah so see what you can do about it and.
8150.0,Patient,"i'm sure there will be a problem they're very lenient with what you pretty much can. yeah it's okay. it's Okay, the whole thing there should not be a problem with it."
416.0,Provider,yeah well and even if it yeah now like it's once a month. should be good. And I haven't looked at your. Release yeah you probably haven't done surveys for a little bit huh.
8150.0,Patient,"yeah and I, I have to do those as well."
416.0,Provider,"and The ones that I have for you, which stopped in October are looking really good. there. Your scores are looking very healthy and. Nothing I would worry about that's good. How are, how are you over the holidays. The holidays hard for you."
8150.0,Patient,"No, no, I will celebrate holidays, so there it is like a regular day for me like I don't know it's like whatever. Like that's like the only thing well my family. Is. Well, we all kind of feel the same sometimes it will get together with my out my mom's side so it's good it's like no there's no there's no issue or no problem with that, but yeah."
416.0,Provider,I know i've been talking to so many of my other patients about you know just the holidays are so tough for so many people. So it's good to hear they hear. You kind of opt out of them. Good and what's going on in relationships with your friends and your boyfriend and your parents everything.
8150.0,Patient,"But they're. they're good I think they're like. Better because i'm able to like focus on them more instead of just being focused in school, and I am trying to enjoy that as much as I can, because I know that i'm the go back and I know how. Like dreadful, that is to go back and like just focus on clean, so I just i'm trying to. You know just take the time to pay more attention to. My parents like when we talk, we were very it's just me and my parents like both of them. And my boyfriend I mean he doesn't love me he's he's he lives at his house, but I did the same with him a try to just be present, you know what we're just very united so every time we eat, we have we talk eating is like talking time so I tried to just be there and. be happy and the food going great my sister was like just struggle, sometimes in it, but it's it's always been like that so it's not like. Like a new thing you know. You kind of know about that so yeah. yeah yeah okay good perfect not perfect, but it's really good with my relationships, right now, and with my boyfriend as well um. yeah I have more time to talk to him now, which is great. and his his stress I don't pass on to me, which is something that I would do before because I would think like what can I do to help him like a half to turn something up to do something and I just don't. have to listen and that's in."
416.0,Provider,That you're not responsible. For other people's emotions.
8150.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,If a big lesson. When he realized that right.
8150.0,Patient,"Yes, that's like. Take so much weight was ticking off of my shoulders like you're right I don't want my don't have to do. Think so just speaking."
416.0,Provider,"Not only don't you but we can't right like we can't. I can't be responsible for. Other how other people feel. We can't fix it. Excuse me, just like they can't fix yours."
8150.0,Patient,"Exactly so. yeah i'm a lot of the stuff that we've learned with you, I do I do put a practice and it does help me along so grateful for that, because I would be really, really stressed out, but I just didn't know all those things."
416.0,Provider,funny husband skills just you know and even just more awareness can make a big difference.
8150.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"i'm glad that that's working really well for you, you seem you seem like you're feeling. pretty good I mean. You know it's not like we're trying to get rid of all sadness or anxiety because those are normal human emotions, we just don't want them to be like disordered or. mm hmm you know. So far, so far off, but you can't function."
8150.0,Patient,"And now that i'm working I try to keep us well, I have to eat when I when I leave. I have to. Just two things that are good for your body drink water stay hydrated. And I feel like that hasn't made a big difference to with like mental health my stomach and just everything like before I think I would really neglect having to. Especially breakfast i'm not just kind of didn't like breakfast and I feel like when you have a routine you kinda it's easier to do stuff you should be doing, you know, like. So so. I felt like an accident as well and i'm feeling."
416.0,Provider,"Huge. getting into a healthy routine I mean our brains and our bodies love routines. They love it. right we thrive on that our bodies learn to know even like your metabolism it learns like oh i'm gonna get some food I should keep going it's coming. Right and to your your brain knows what to expect, so it can kind of relax it's not always going what's next oh my God, how do I figure this out, what do I do you know."
8150.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,yeah they make a big difference.
8150.0,Patient,"yeah i'm kind of worried about school, though, because I know it's stressful but the only thing that I think now i'm worried about like, but I just told myself, I like talk like pep talk myself, you know, like. i've done this before I will be okay. Absolutely, I am going to have my support that I need and. I try to just enjoy the time that I have now because you know. You have to be hard."
416.0,Provider,So what will happen is you'll find another routine right there'll be an adjustment period where it'll be hard. kind of while you're figuring out your new normal and then you'll find a new routine and it might be a little tight it's going to be busy but you're right you've done it before.
8150.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,So just expect to feel kind of uncomfortable for a little bit. As you adjust. And then you'll get there.
8150.0,Patient,Yes. Thank you.
416.0,Provider,"So what else is important for you to talk about crystal. Anything else going on. Okay, we don't have to create problems."
8150.0,Patient,"I don't I don't. know, the only thing is i'm going to Mexico in. And in my sick Okay, so my my boyfriend is not Mexican me salvadorean. And he's going with us. And my dad side well he's his side is the one that's Mexico and they're kind of rude they don't have like they're not agree with, but they. they're not like hospitable they're not like my mom sign alongside his son my son, so I just. I know that they can really bring out the. Not the meaning me but, like the person who defends herself like if I hear from my dad say something I know that i'm gonna. say something and I just don't want to say something you know, I just want to. Be. I want to be at their level, so I really have to practice like what we talked about. stepping out and just kind of thinking. Control. The only thing that I have but, like other than that, I mean. To."
416.0,Provider,"Absolute absolutely absolutely I think it's really normal and. So being with being with extended family can always be tricky right so yeah definitely. I would say, first and foremost, take a lot of breaks mm hmm. And I kind of miss you for five minutes. Yes, right take breaks walk around the block. Get outside and just free to. Do it frequently like every hour and they'll keep you in a wise mind i'll even just that that will help a lot. And I don't know what your escape is like because I don't know if you're staying with them or but if it's possible to have a way to not you know to just to escape to have an out, I would say, you know, try to do that if it's possible. and have some distractions ready right like some. Some fake homework, you need to do, or some. You know. Something that is some errands you need to run. And just make sure that you're keeping up with the things that you know really work for you right like exercise if you can. bring your journal. You know just. yeah."
8150.0,Patient,"Yes, I will do that sounds like those are things that would help me because I don't want to be there, like the whole me either every miss me for feminine. And the good thing is that we have, like our little house or the place where we stay as a separate from. So."
416.0,Provider,I mean you can always have a stomachache can go to the House to yeah sorry guys.
8150.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah and then also just you and maybe practice if if you're on to like has some kind of normal things that she sort of always brings up that you don't like talking about maybe practice your responses in advance be ready for like a firm but you know kind response. yeah."
8150.0,Patient,"But other than that everything, everything is good, so far, I think i've managed my emotions and my stress and everything pretty well um I hope I can you know, sometimes. You kind of just you feel like like. or sometimes I just feel it like you said when do you feel something that just get home and i'm like I can't go to the gym today, but like. When i'm in bed like if I lay down like if i'm really sick to lay down, then I can I can it can get makes things easier for me to process as well, like everything down. I don't stay in bed, like all day because I have things to do, but I do, let us know."
416.0,Provider,"It sounds great yeah Take your time. yeah that's are all really healthy thing I mean, as long as you're not staying in bed all day like that's all really healthy."
