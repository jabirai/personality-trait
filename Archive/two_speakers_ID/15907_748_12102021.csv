ID,Role,Message

15907.0,Patient,"i'm okay. Well, you. You are punctual."
748.0,Provider,Well gosh thanks.
15907.0,Patient,nice to see you.
748.0,Provider,"nice to see you. you're not in the bathroom today, so I guess your dog has gotten out."
15907.0,Patient,"Yet today, things were a little better organized."
748.0,Provider,Monday wonderful.
15907.0,Patient,"that's right, I did have a session. It was a. Great memory thanks. For 19 years."
748.0,Provider,"wow and I I just moved, which is why my background so blurry so you don't have to look at all my boxes um, but I have been going through a similar situation with getting that routine down right. and making sure that I get my dog out at the proper intervals, otherwise mid session she's whining it's like oh gosh i'm so sorry."
15907.0,Patient,Especially in a new environment right.
748.0,Provider,Exactly Napoli yeah.
15907.0,Patient,I find moving exciting congratulations I hope it's all under the best of circumstances.
748.0,Provider,"Well, you know that's a really good way to put it, if you know my story is not important in this situation, but i'll share that I think it is under really good circumstances it's just daunting."
15907.0,Patient,"Yes, of course."
748.0,Provider,yeah it's it's moving. A lot into a very small space and sorting and purging and. Counting and. And and. it's really about prioritizing.
15907.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,"and Recognizing I don't know if this speaks to you at all, but recognizing how often we substitute stuff for a quality of life."
15907.0,Patient,that's that actually speaks to everybody who's breathing right now.
748.0,Provider,yeah so and it's instead choosing life.
15907.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
748.0,Provider,"yeah and there's a lot of grief involved, as well as things I. know and, of course, a lot of space. To opening up but anyway so that's my profound statement for the day or my nonsensical statement for the day depending on your view."
15907.0,Patient,"No very profound and I appreciate that you didn't take the lead from work to do this, that you're moving and you're still taking care of your patients."
748.0,Provider,"wow, thank you for saying absolutely."
15907.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,So tell me how you are you doing sound very. i'm.
15907.0,Patient,"Because I have taught myself with the help of a friend. um well my acupuncturist has become my friend over five years of seeing her in the conversations we have, and she reminded me that it's okay to not deny your your your your temperature your mood temperature the way you feel i'm just Okay, and she says, it has to be okay to say that."
748.0,Provider,APP so loosely.
15907.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,"it's not only Okay, it is imperative for well being. yeah because when we deny how we actually feel to take care of other people. Which is often what we're taught to do."
15907.0,Patient,Right it.
748.0,Provider,builds up and becomes Depression and anxiety and. reactivity and and and and.
15907.0,Patient,"Yes, well, I, like the reactivity which which really is my which will perfectly segue into why i'm just okay. damn you're good."
748.0,Provider,Maybe you are.
15907.0,Patient,I think we're a good team.
748.0,Provider,Here we go.
15907.0,Patient,"Well, I had an incident a week from today, last Friday. I was in a pretty stable mode, I went downstairs with my dog to the back patio but he just does this quickies. And there was a neighbor there about 20 years my junior. i'm not really, really close with anybody in the building, except for one person I don't see her a whole lot and she's like a real friend. I had an interest, I had a little problem with another friend just abandoned me suddenly out of the blue, but so this neighbor asks we start to talk and he mentions the name of the neighbor that abandoned the our friendship. And I. I made the mistake. Of not Remembering my. My purse my own boundaries, to protect myself and I kind of engaged in the conversation a little more than I should have been a mental. and Unfortunately. I snapped I didn't have any any any Gray Gray area I went from a good mood The next thing I heard myself saying was I don't need to be lectured once I heard my tone of voice, I heard the words I was using I already knew I was in trouble. um. We made up because I came upstairs with muffler and I was like what just happened because those are like car wrecks to me. they're actually lapses they feel like relapses."
748.0,Provider,good way to say it.
15907.0,Patient,"And all I could do for self preservation was like well, the only thing at this very moment that I think will help you get through this night and now has gone south is at least to eat crow go back downstairs right now and try to fix this. I went downstairs."
748.0,Provider,bro it's owning your behavior because you're committed to a different life.
15907.0,Patient,"yeah. Absolutely. um I apologize to him, I was really this regulated, I remember my teeth were chattering is I was trying to talk to him it didn't help that we were outside to. was very nervous chattering I was apologetic he was like no your language your body language was even different when you came back downstairs because he said that I really scared him. I don't think I realized what I look like from the other side. When I he says, I saw you he says, I saw your whole personality switch to something else."
748.0,Provider,"And maps that come, I mean i'm sure that he was being thoughtful in in his description to him, but that really comes across as judgment when when the reality and i'm not labeling him at all. I simply want to say that really where you went was an old self protective stance."
15907.0,Patient,Make your acknowledging now doesn't work.
748.0,Provider,"Well, because it pushes people away, rather than taking care of you."
15907.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yep and it, it has unfortunately been my default for decades. And then, it makes me feel. out of control. It then immediate shame, I immediately feel shame coursing through my body when that happens. it's just such a cocktail of horrible horrible sensations. And then we kind of solve is delayed a little bit, you know as much as I think we could, at the moment he was very gracious where he you know what I realized afterwards, was that he was drinking alcohol. uh huh."
748.0,Provider,So you had an unconscious trigger. That you didn't even know was there and tell you went back later.
15907.0,Patient,then went back downstairs yeah that's why he was choosing the words you that's why his his whole demeanor was flippant and glib because he was intoxicated. which I don't do well around those people that have a history in my upbringing.
748.0,Provider,"that's exactly what I was just going to say it was a huge trigger. you're the one who ended up. A taking responsibility you cleaned up your cited street, but he being blamed for the reaction, rather than ownership being taken by the person who was drinking for. You know yeah well I what i'm not really in the best state of mind, either because i've been drinking. Right right you're in the middle of drinking you don't own it usually."
15907.0,Patient,"No, you don't and, in fact, that the very opposite to what you just said it was while I was apologizing that I saw him take out the little bottles that they seven airplanes and swallow half of one in front of me. that's when I said Oh, this makes better sense. It still took me a better part of the week. actually have down from that experience. It takes me days. Especially I pretty much shot, where I eat. And I can't I can't I couldn't I wasn't removed from it it's it happened in my tables with a neighbor you know."
748.0,Provider,"Now, yes, and it was it reach rigor trauma."
15907.0,Patient,yeah yeah trauma about I guess my childhood trauma about my own behavior. I feel like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. And and i'm still doing better than I used to do Karen.
748.0,Provider,Like. The fact that you're owning it the way that you are. yeah my gosh that's huge.
15907.0,Patient,um this used to happen to me more frequently it happened to me almost every time I was in the presence of my mother.
748.0,Provider,"With your mother, the one that drain."
15907.0,Patient,"It was my father. My poor mother who tried, as best as she could she fell short in a lot of areas, but she had, I think I told you before she had mommy dearest as a mother so. What my mother pulled off was miraculous actually. But my sister, and I still didn't come out unscathed you know. So i'm feeling better about last Friday i've seen him again since. The first few nights when I stepped into the the first few days after that happened when i'd step onto the patio. I even felt different about the back of the building about that area. It felt like the scene of the crime, you know, it was not comforting anymore. That faded away already. um yeah the embarrassment and I pretty much came to the conclusion that, even if he talks to the girl who this was about the one who abandoned me. Because that's what that was that was the subject matter that I should have never entertained. That it would have been best had I not entertain that no should have then i'm trying not to shit on myself. Right um. It I really just can't to have an succinct concise. realization that. What the F do I care what anybody that that said 20 years younger than me and misbehaving and drinking and doing what 30 euros do, what do I care what they think about me at this point."
748.0,Provider,"Well, how old is the person who's having the experience of caring about what he thinks. It isn't it isn't somebody 20 years older it's probably somebody 25 years younger than the 30 year old. You know, with that young part of us that is traumatized that goes into the reaction. might have been you're angry team, rather than a little kids but."
15907.0,Patient,"you're right all my God. You had to go through all that schooling, all that homework well that's then just to give me that last of knowledge and two seconds. wow what a. lot of great spin on perspective. So it's not the 54 year old man was trying to grow up and own is it is that person."
748.0,Provider,that's the person that did the work. yeah. The words but that's not the person who reacted.
15907.0,Patient,The right.
748.0,Provider,"It was first the little kid probably like you're hurting my feelings. yeah. And then, it was then or team that you know that reactive person is in gotten his face."
15907.0,Patient,"Yes, and that I did. yeah."
748.0,Provider,"So, and those are those are self preservation behaviors those are those are the best. Acts of self care we knew, because nobody ever gave us."
15907.0,Patient,"Right right. And once I found my voice. As a young adult I was so angry and so damaged, you know that all I could do is fight back. that's why the minute my mother would come for me I just. And then you know the accident on top of it head injuries make people angry."
748.0,Provider,Oh absolutely.
15907.0,Patient,"that's a whole part of my life and my family never recognized and that I didn't until just recently. You know that should have been the main focus, when I was released from the hospital I wish that somebody would have told my mother your son's going to be a different person, you need after care I can't I went to one of the best hospitals in the bronx and no one told my mother that. One of the best trauma centers and he and he got and no one told my mother that. So that happened i'm feeling better about it, even more so now that you told me that it was my youngest Jason and reacting that this Jason I like that."
748.0,Provider,"yeah you know it's it that's one of my favorite ways to work with things, there are some who do. You know there's a whole. realm of work called sub personality work there's. A system called internal family systems and there's also the in the 12 step world adult children of alcoholism and other dysfunction. and All of those work with the parts of us that are still very young. And, and that never got nurtured to grow and evolve into full. Healthy. Self loving beings."
15907.0,Patient,We were told not to love ourselves.
748.0,Provider,don't be so self absorbed. So I find those models very helpful.
15907.0,Patient,"yeah well I just felt the instant change and how I felt. When. You know, great. When you said that to me. You know, correct me if i'm wrong Karen, but when you come when you when you're abused as you're being raised. and According to my research we don't have to be battered physically or being a car wreck or plane accident or anything to damage the the. The part of the brain of I want to say migdal up, but I think there's. Another part."
748.0,Provider,What the prefrontal cortex.
15907.0,Patient,More behind it in the Center where.
748.0,Provider,The fight or flight response.
15907.0,Patient,"yeah well, I think I can get my point across without remembering our brains don't develop our the injury of neglect or or verbal abuse or. That doesn't Let us develop into a proper adult. Exactly it stumped right the growth of that."
748.0,Provider,"Lately, absolutely and then what we're left with is that fight or flight reaction. it's reactivity versus the ability to. discern and make choice you shayla I told you. come here sweetie i'm i'll be right back. Yes, something that I think will help. temporarily and get around. So that trauma response does keep us in fight or flight it keeps us really stuck in that pattern and. In one second once I give her retreat so that she decides that she can be. Quiet for a little while. And nimoy made it possible impossible to get to dear. Yes, dear. No oh there we go oh. Right. There is a model that I really love see empathy."
15907.0,Patient,Miss Karen.
748.0,Provider,Not very much I studied it for years. And I. I never practiced it.
15907.0,Patient,"So, have you ever heard of dual lingo."
748.0,Provider,"Yes, i'm doing that, right now, with the Chaldean."
15907.0,Patient,Okay fantastic. yeah i've been doing it for years with French.
748.0,Provider,Oh that's beautiful.
15907.0,Patient,I have so much fun I love it that was that's one of my dreams have come true.
748.0,Provider,that's really cool.
15907.0,Patient,"That I made happen that wasn't contingent on somebody else's decision of you know my talent or my ability. I don't know why I wanted to speak French, but about the age of 25 I I don't know what your beliefs are but I kind of do believe in like that our energy goes and comes back here and goals and comes back here. Absolutely, and I think well for starters, when I go back this time i'm going to make it very clear that I want to go on leave I don't want to come back to earth for a few million years. And the other thing is that I think that I have some connection to friends. um before that's that's my phone i'm sorry I forgot to put it on mute."
748.0,Provider,Perfectly okay you saw what I just did.
15907.0,Patient,"It will be a secret. um. yeah and then I finally went right before lockdown so I was very lucky, if you want to think of it because I I flew right into the hornet's nest right before lockdown I went to Paris, Spain and Italy, all the places that were that the numbers were."
748.0,Provider,yeah exploding.
15907.0,Patient,going through the roof yeah and since I don't pay attention to news that much I got my ass on a plane like nothing was wrong in the world. And I went to Europe by myself and it was an amazing nine days. And my dual lingo French. was even complimented and that was.
748.0,Provider,that's beautiful.
15907.0,Patient,"yeah it's one of the happy experiences of my life and I wasn't feeling well. And my body was completely patchy from from I think I was overmedicating, so I think that had serotonin syndrome."
748.0,Provider,Oh okay.
15907.0,Patient,"But when I travel Karen. something happens chemically. Oh absolutely and and i'm just so happy that doesn't I could lose a leg probably an ad hobble around Paris of ads. yeah. yeah love to travel so um well i'm gonna go on to another thing I wanted to run by you. Because the one about the neighbor I feel pretty. I think I understand what happened and you've made it even more clear for me. And so that will lead me to this, so the other day i'm talking to the only real good friend, I have in the building she's the one that started my practice to recovery. She lives literally under me the apartment under me Okay, and just so that you know because i'll be referencing her from now on, that I tell you the story of how my dog got stung and I was very violent on how I responded to her when she hit my ceiling, where a broom."
748.0,Provider,No.
15907.0,Patient,"Well, that happened about six years ago. My father got skunked while I was downstairs with him, it was three something in the morning, I was just getting home from work."
748.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15907.0,Patient,"So between the skunk thing I was just home from work I it was it just was a. mess and I, and I guess, I was making noise in the apartment I tried putting him in the tub, then I have to leave him alone to go get the stuff in the supermarket and clean him and. And at this point of I guess that made me this regulated and she hit the MICE my floor with a broom from downstairs and before I knew it Karen I was downstairs knocking on her door, it was 330 in the morning. And I got in her face that could have been. I didn't know who lived under me at the time. wow that I could have been knocking on the door of a of a. Of a of a vet who have ptsd but a shot me in the face. somebody who was doing math in their living room at that time. Right could have been anything. um the next day after I don't remember much because some of that that whole incident was a blur the next day she wrote me a loving letter apologizing that she had upset me that much. Can you can you believe that. i'm needless to say, I answered her in the most grateful it's the first time I told somebody that's not really me, I have an accident in my head that never really I never did anything about. And I go into the spells so then she told me to that she's she was getting treatment from the Los Angeles county Los Angeles mental health Los Angeles county mental health department. And, and she sent me to her, I tried to see her are the same therapist that she had worked with and that's where it started for me."
748.0,Provider,that's beautiful.
15907.0,Patient,"mm hmm and she's a very dear beautiful friend of mine her name is initiative. and She and I were speaking, the other day and and we brought up the incident that happened in Michigan recently with the 15 year old shot three other teenagers and school. and it's very painful. and But this is where it gets ugly. This is where I need to understand why what happened to me when she told me. That, after the investigations had started that the boys that had killed the boys that were murdered by the other one. That they had been bullying him. I went. I went completely cold inside. Completely and I actually said out loud Oh well, in that case I don't give a shit. I hate bullies that I heard myself saying it. And as soon as I finished, I said to her, I said I need to talk to Karen about this as I can, as my therapist she's like yeah you do. Not because you said what you said, because you still there's something that's making you save that absolutely and that's the kind of insight she has to talk to me that way. Absolutely, because it wasn't judgmental. And I found that important it is that's a very strong thing to say about three boys about any humans really at all. That I really didn't feel anything for them."
748.0,Provider,And the fact that you're willing to acknowledge that and speak to it is so powerful so. As you think about that what is there burning up for you.
15907.0,Patient,"Well, my own my own bully. Because I was terribly bullied as a child. And one of them is this even more painful because it was the boyfriend of it was one of the boyfriends of my mom. So it was an adult. And he used to pretend we were play fighting, but he I remember, he would hit punch me so hard I couldn't breathe, it seems it's nightmarish even for me to try to recall it. And I, and even then I knew this guy doesn't like me. Because he's hitting me so hard he's pretending he's playing with me but he's getting his dislike of me out, and I think I was a little too I wasn't the the book he is the boy on the block, you know, and I mean. You could tell that I could I even when I was very young people say they they never knew but anybody who had any kind of insight to see I was a little light in the loafers. And I think that irritated him. Because he was a man's man, he was a cop."
748.0,Provider,Oh God okay.
15907.0,Patient,"So I think my own the pain of of what being bullied feels like for many reasons for being you know, like I said, like fish in the loafers for being Latino or being. them for being gay you know the list goes on and on and on. I just was like yeah I hate bullies and didn't care that they were blown away as like that'll teach in I just find that not a very healthy response from an adult."
748.0,Provider,"Well, being that you notice that it wasn't a healthy response means that you're pretty aware and healthy. And that being said, as you talk about it and think about them as being human beings. are likely traumatized."
15907.0,Patient,themselves absolutely.
748.0,Provider,And that's how they became bullies.
15907.0,Patient,mm hmm.
748.0,Provider,I said shift your feelings.
15907.0,Patient,It does.
748.0,Provider,It does all. Our initial response comes from will go back to the analogy or metaphors that we were talking about. yeah it's that young part of you that was bullied yourself and then probably the angry teen saying i'll show you.
15907.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"You hurt that young pardon me i'll show you. Right. And, and when you look at that 15 year old, to whose life is over, because he check other people's lives when you know, in this particular incident there's the the clear awareness that there are adults that could have stopped it."
15907.0,Patient,Absolutely absolutely.
748.0,Provider,"That day you know based he should have been sent out. At the bearings and and so, how many other pieces go into what we see about one human beings reaction or behavior."
15907.0,Patient,Right.
748.0,Provider,How many other elements are there actually and how few people take the time to look at that. So you're taking the time to look at that.
15907.0,Patient,"And you've even brought in a just, not because I wasn't thinking about all the negligent all the Net and other than neglect and all the adults that are complicit in that neglect. yeah so that's something like that could be that get out get out of hand."
748.0,Provider,"Well, the thing, the one that stood out to me the most that that seems the most that feels really painful is that they had him in the office, out of concern about this letter. And they sent him back to class with his backpack."
15907.0,Patient,right there.
748.0,Provider,"And you know his parents, obviously, but. there's just so there there's so many other layers that are occurring in any one situation that we are are dished up. Through the news. or through stories or whatever it may be."
15907.0,Patient,"Right right I I pretty much hate journalism. At least when it comes to report, you know people out on the field, giving their their account of something they didn't even see happen. The way things is spawn just the tone of it and it's negative all the time I it's amazing that the world can function. As this functionally, of course, but that it can function at all with all the garbage that's pumped into people's psyche all day. yeah they were three teenage boys, that if they were behaving that way guaranteed they were bullied themselves molested hurt neglected, and you know how I know because one of the biggest regrets in my life is that one time, I remember bullying somebody. And that's i'm still working through that. And why was I doing that because of what I was going through. It is this little boy Peter who have big ears and he lived in my building and I remember one time in the in the lobby after school and we were just getting home, I was just cruel to him."
748.0,Provider,So.
15907.0,Patient,"i've been on both and i'm still ashamed of that. 40 something years later, because I must have been on the about 11 or 12."
748.0,Provider,"that's amazing you. Are. Bad aware of a behavior at that age, which is just about the meanest stage we usually are. That you still remember it and what I sense is that you if you if he were here in front of you, you would apologize."
15907.0,Patient,"I would, in fact I don't know if this will ever happen, but if I I don't know if i'd recognize him as an adult or maybe the ears will give him away. But I would be so embarrassed also and I am I almost feel like I shouldn't because I was 12."
748.0,Provider,Do you feel embarrassed or do you feel ashamed.
15907.0,Patient,"Oh good good question, can you please. clear out the difference between those two."
748.0,Provider,"So there's a big difference there's a difference between. guilt and shame and i'm embarrassment can come up with either one of those. But it's usually a lot more acute with shame and other words a lot more intense. Okay, that you've carried it for this long. And it's still so big so guilt is that feeling we get one we've done something that we think is wrong shame is the feeling that we're wrong. Here utley wrong with us."
15907.0,Patient,Oh that's such a good classification yeah.
748.0,Provider,"guilt can be very healthy so feeling some guilt about having done that to somebody else is appropriate and saying boy I sure wish I had the opportunity to say something. to him it's really embarrassing thinking back to doing that, but I hear that it's so pervasive and acute that it's like your whole being feels it you don't feel bad about an action at a young age, you feel bad about the person, you are who did this."
15907.0,Patient,today.
748.0,Provider,"yeah shame has a legacy that comes out of traumatic and. Just function dysfunctional family systems. Were taught that we don't have value that there's something wrong with who we are, as human beings. And, and you know one. possible thing you could consider doing is writing him a letter that you obviously can't mail. You can send it out to the universe, in the same way that you're considering that you'd rather not come back to this particular planet and your next incarnation for a million or so years and. Knowing that that's got a reality, even though it's funny you know that there's that many layers to our existence. Yes, that message will get to him. Okay, wherever he is because it will be from a sincere place but you don't get to annihilate you in that little that little 12 year old. In the process of apologizing to him. Okay, and then you need to apologize to you for how long you mean you basically sentenced yourself to life in prison for that action."
15907.0,Patient,I i've been in a cell for 40 something years already.
748.0,Provider,yep exactly. So really acknowledging Is this a legitimate and fair sentence for the APP.
15907.0,Patient,right and it was it's not.
748.0,Provider,"No, no."
15907.0,Patient,But I know how badly I could have crushed him and hurt him in those few minutes yeah you know. He chances are he remembers that afternoon as well.
748.0,Provider,"You know it's it's possible, although it's all so if his ears were that significantly. Different than what was considered normal. Which is. The worst thing that can happen to us as as young people at that age. My guess is you're one of many people. Who did that."
15907.0,Patient,Oh God yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And and i'll share a personal story. I had the opportunity, about. Almost a month ago to have lunch with a group of nine women from high school. wow and a couple of the few of them, three, four of them. five of them, I guess, I had seen intermittently at reunions two of them i've seen more regularly than that because we've stayed connected. There was one woman and there were at least three women that I had not seen since we graduated from high school. wow long time. yeah and one of them, I had been carrying a memory of it, of a communication we had when I was really traumatized. In my own life. My emotional response in the moment had been ik carried in us having been overwhelming and unfair trefor. uh huh, and so I took the opportunity to apologize she didn't remember it at all."
15907.0,Patient,wow I.
748.0,Provider,"didn't remember it at all, and it was something that took. 45 minutes, I mean I was just a yeah I was emotional wreck and I was, I felt like I had burdened her so much and she said I don't remember anything I don't know what you're talking. wow So what we carry versus what other people remember. Just know that your sincere apology in your heart is going to get to him and then he probably holds no harm against you."
15907.0,Patient,"I shall do that, thank you for sharing that that's mind blowing that meant that I think we project our own importance of the incident right."
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely and and that's, not to say that you're taking responsibility for that the incident isn't powerful but it's powerful for you."
15907.0,Patient,Right.
748.0,Provider,"You know it's a gift to him and you're sharing that with them, whether you know it or not, or see it and who knows, maybe you'll get lucky enough to actually be able to experience him someday. But, but in the meantime it's taking ownership and looking at where the behavior came from and how is it played out in other places, and how can you heal that for yourself as well as for others. And, and before we finish because we've just got a few minutes left, I wanted to go back to where we were before. When my dog certainly she's getting Nancy again but and and when I got up I stopped talking about something that we were talking about when you mentioned the amygdala and. The whole experience of what happens with our brain."
15907.0,Patient,"When i'm sorry limbic system, as well as."
748.0,Provider,"limbic system, yes. But that's just what I was going to go into. yeah so. What actually what actually happens is when we go into fight or flight when we go into anxiety, this is our brain in this fist, this is the limbic system, the system that right here this. Whole limbic system inside the brain. The prefrontal cortex when we go into fight or flight the prefrontal cortex goes completely offline I know because of my camera and the fading that it's not showing up, so the only thing running us is the limbic. it's, the only thing running. And, and if the rest of our brain has been hijacked and we can't think clearly and then we blame ourselves for not thinking clearly. yeah when it's a natural response to having been traumatized over and over and over in our lives. So you need to be gentle with yourself and let yourself off. The hook, while you're practicing these new behaviors and."
15907.0,Patient,"And and closing. I will say that, no matter how. As a 15 year old boy can already look like a man in some cases."
748.0,Provider,Oh absolutely.
15907.0,Patient,"So regardless of how built and strong our or our men manly these these three boys who lost their lives, where. They were still boys."
748.0,Provider,They were little boys.
15907.0,Patient,"Whatever happened to them to make them behave so badly. is sad, they were also victims. um and bullying is heinous, but it should not be punishable by death. And, and then it doesn't stop there it's there it's their moms whose hearts have been broken dad's siblings grandparents. um. So as i'm you know I can feel yeah it changes how once I made them human again. it's very, very sad that, let me tell you Kevin after that first shooting Columbine 20 years ago it just seemed to it became fashionable to do that. A lot of copycatting."
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely and and, unfortunately, our culture has a love affair, with firearms that is mind bogglingly. My understanding. and on top of that all of the media attention fuels that sadly."
15907.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's a part of what I was referring to before. yeah they don't fix the problem they they exacerbated."
748.0,Provider,yeah there's a way that that's so so very true and so painful.
15907.0,Patient,"And we're all traumatized you know that if I have to go to a place like target now do you know that that's part of my consciousness that i'm going into an open public place now, I never used to think that way as a child or as a teenager. Now, when I go somewhere like I hope i'm not at the wrong place at the wrong time tonight."
748.0,Provider,wow. that's intense.
15907.0,Patient,"yeah, it is because the trauma hits hits the public."
748.0,Provider,And it's.
15907.0,Patient,You know.
748.0,Provider,it's very true.
15907.0,Patient,"But, and especially people like me who are a little compromised in that area."
748.0,Provider,"So I want you to really think about putting something around you to protect you before you go into those environments and seeing yourself, safe and then seeing yourself getting home safely. cry for you go in so you're carrying that. with you."
15907.0,Patient,When you.
748.0,Provider,Venture out.
15907.0,Patient,"that's a perfect way to end today, it was a really beautiful insightful session I think they all are that you really, really helped me today, thank you."
748.0,Provider,"honored, as always, thank you for your honesty and your hard work."
