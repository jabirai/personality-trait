Someone hit me so i'm going to court for that right now I did get granted driving privileges during court.

I love her to death, but like I didn't told her already you know my kid's dad is either now what she never liked him anyways but you know they got into arguing, and when her and I got into it. And all over just somewhere to live and my sister told her after all that was said and done, and we got out of jails that she couldn't stay there with her, so it was just all a big pointless hot mess so."
191.0,Provider,she's trying to stay with your sister now.
3645.0,Patient,"yeah well my scissors letting her stay with her now because she doesn't have anywhere to go look prior to go into Joe she wasn't going to let her stay there, so you know it's up for all this hot crap to go down before her my sister allowing her to stay there."

Okay. My tags lifted there's a block on my registration, so I couldn't get time to the b&b so I paid off, those I went and got my. I went and got driving privileges which cost me $124 I went to jail I gotta go to court, my car got hit it's just like as soon as something you know I missed appointments with you guys as soon as something you know good starts to happen, something he has to intervene and has to. Get taken right away."
191.0,Provider,"Right, are you safe now."
3645.0,Patient,"yeah I never was not safe it's just that my boyfriend it doesn't like my kids my son status doesn't like the fact that misty. You know, is just so disrespectful to me and stuff so he started being disrespectful to her and. I don't know I guess I probably shouldn't have allowed him to get into it as much as he did, but he did, and then it comes. And then it causes friction between her and I and then cause us to start fighting she's always been like that she's always put her hands on me she's. I mean, this is nothing unusual my whole life children's services have been in my life because she's. You know, put her hands on me as a child, so I just think she feels like she can do that."

They tried to send me, I think it was. Bobby hold on, let me show you hold on, let me show you can say hi they tried to Okay, so what they did was, I think they gave me the. First group that may have been called in what was it the the bridge restriction is that what it's called I think."
191.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I know we tried to catch you back. up so you'd be on the same time, picking them both up."
3645.0,Patient,"yeah that uh you know, yes, you miss early right. yeah I know my they're not picked up early trust me i'm behind if anything. So my issue was when I got out of jail, I called you guys, they were going to give me a hold on please. Give me a bridge prescription well I think when I just want to pick my because I actually got a refill from you yesterday. Instead of picking them up, yesterday I didn't get an opportunity to so now that I have arrived, this morning I went grab them and they only gave me eight till they didn't give me my two milligrams they gave me my."
191.0,Provider,"yeah I think you may have gotten off off some kind of way yeah because yeah because when I wrote them, it was with the understanding that when you pick them up, at a certain time will put you back on track. But it's been in jail, how long were you in."
3645.0,Patient,kind of talk to her. There yay.
191.0,Provider,"yeah he's fine when he's up at all hello, how long were you in jail."
3645.0,Patient,"One day, Dr so I got on the PR boring. Tuesday okay or i'm sorry yeah. that's why I call it. They were going to give me a brief description, but I didn't end up picking that up I. Talk to you, so I didn't know for sure whether or not the bridge prescription whatever so I went I went to pick up today this morning because I spoke with you for during group yesterday and got to read, they did not give me my to milligram tablets, and I only got. A link, which is fine, because i'm sure that's accommodating the four day stress with one. But I don't have my to."
191.0,Provider,Either so I just i'm supposed to be on 20 milligrams a day. So if you're if you get the 16 you'll have to end up taking two and a half. yeah because that yeah you should have you tues because every time I calling you and. They know your toes.
3645.0,Patient,"yeah they only if you want to call and maybe see what's going I don't know if I can call or or how you want to do it, but they didn't give me my two."
191.0,Provider,"So if you need to take two and a half, because she's supposed to be on 20 milligrams. So you can see. Where two milligrams are but you should have to because I sent it youtube's."
3645.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know they only gave me one and I, they said call your doctor. So I was like well I got an appointment to talk with her at two today so that's that's. Okay, that works. So if maybe you want to get Ahold of that I don't know."
191.0,Provider,"Maybe i'll follow back up with them. i'll call pharmacy yeah so we'll do that alright, so I need to share this with you because Andrea and i've been really concerned and we need to go over your chart because we've got. Several things going on. So you've chart is kind of your recommendations of change, because it does take an account how you doing and how things can change but let's look here for a minute. yeah so we've got here. If we look at your care intensity so that looks at your attendance."
3645.0,Patient,"If they had anything where I needed to be doing to be in compliance and they said. No, they told me now and then and hold on please and then Andrea said something about that I speak with you about Monday groups, and I said. yeah I thought so, but every time I call into the care navigators they tell me, nothing so I don't I can't even talk to you, unless I have an appointment scheduled or I speak to you during group."
191.0,Provider,Right so let's see. So this is what you care intensity recommendation. see it says excess of no shows three times a week or else high level of care and high level care means discharge. To a different place. And so you're supposed to be attended three times a week and so you've got an option.
3645.0,Patient,telling me no they're telling me I already asked him because I know you and I spoke about how many times a week we you and I needed to be or I needed to be attending roots. yeah so i'm going to get that.
191.0,Provider,"changed, yes it change like this is the first time or recently."
3645.0,Patient,"navigators have that in their chart because I just asked that guy when I did my drug here is there anything. He said no, I need to schedule for October for Andrea so that's all he did."
191.0,Provider,"you read. This and read right here, maybe it wasn't that I don't know if they didn't understand I can't. I can't clarify why."
3645.0,Patient,wow.

3645.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely I do."
191.0,Provider,"So we'll recap your groups, I think that may be beneficial, will do Monday one to stay 12 Wednesday 12 so 112 and 12 i'll let Andrew and Rochelle know okay. So for suicide risk want to put low risk modifiable triggers. Strong protective factors. And kaylee I think you're doing a great job you're as a mom you're there for your kids you're not abandoning your children. pat yourself on the back. You have your children with you, there are a lot of people. They don't like they love their case but you're there with. Your kids. And it's gonna pay off kaylee it's hard being a single mom or sometimes it's hard, even when you have somebody there. with you because they. They still come to mom mostly mama. Okay. and part of the reason they do, that is because they know they can they know they're so low. So I want you to just realize i'm proud of you, because you never gave up on your case i've never seen you give up and that's beautiful you're going to have a better relationship with your children. and your mom. And that takes a lot of courage to. to break. What is that what do they call it a family when. Family things that passed on from one family. to another family you're you're breaking that trend in your family your your brain. you're breaking that cycle. And kayla you could have just given up and. not done that, but you did it takes a lot of courage, because there's not like you have your mom helping you or your mom modeling it for you how to raise your children how to do this, how to do that a lot of that you had to figure out on your own. And that's part of the reason you able to kaylee's because God gave you a special gift you're very intelligent."
3645.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah you're right."
191.0,Provider,"you're very articulate so I just don't want you to get discouraged because of your current situation, sometimes we we reap the benefits of those efforts later on."
3645.0,Patient,"Yes, you're right."
191.0,Provider,how's your daughter.
3645.0,Patient,I hope that a lot.
191.0,Provider,We ask you both well.
3645.0,Patient,"she's doing so well i'm. Really wouldn't have both of them it's so overwhelming, but my grandma helps me a lot with her, she she does she you know she goes to school with my grandmother so she helps me a lot with a non and i'm so thankful that so very thankful i'm I missed me in there, I miss just, no, no. I just miss not doing this."
191.0,Provider,misha door.
3645.0,Patient,"yeah I do because i've never been without her before and just letting her stay there is really hard on me. I just miss not having like to deal with, like my own place and my own car and my own responsibilities, I just feel like I don't know I just didn't get enough time to be a kid I don't."
191.0,Provider,You probably didn't kaylee but you know something. that's sometimes. When you don't get enough time to be a kid is sort of like you can really appreciate your keys and and have fun with them why they growing up. Because you can't go back and get that time. But you sure can enjoy that time with your kids.
3645.0,Patient,"you're right yeah and she's really enjoyable she's you know she's fun i've already i've already raised a baby before I don't want I didn't want to have another baby I just didn't want to have to take on that responsibility, but now that I do and am you know I just. I appreciate it a little bit more it's kept me on my toes you know I started to kind of like let go and kind of just start little being careless or. You know, as she got so much older so now that i'm restarting over I just feel like. Maybe it was just god's way of being like you know, instead of giving up and going and doing drugs and stuff and you know why your daughter's out here, nine years old and. And then you know she's fine i'm going to go ahead and give you a baby, so that it just I feel like. In ways of so many their blessings and it's such it's such a blessing, but I I also feel like it's so hard, because I didn't ask. For this I didn't want this and i'm just kind of happy to know that he is in my corner and is being a dad like most fathers are not that he just muck lot of dads are not like him at all, I just want to thank him, you know secretively I guess between you and I want to thank him. for being here to help me."
191.0,Provider,"To respond if you tell him, thank you, does he ever Thank you."
3645.0,Patient,"yeah he thinks me, but he doesn't think me for like taking care of like is king thanks me for other things like you'll thank me for. helping them get you know back and forth to work every day or he'll thank me for letting me borrow money or he'll he'll take me for things like that, but he doesn't really tell me like. how appreciative he is of me, taking care of this kid and that's the hardest thing of all, I can you know I can let you borrow money or take you wherever but that's not what I want to be thanked for. i'd rather be faked, for you know, taking care of this baby every single day."
191.0,Provider,"which you know some that I hear you probably more matured and him, maybe, if you tell him, thank you for playing with him, maybe that are open something up in his eyes, because all he gonna do is play with them you doing food, shelter play and. Education and. there."
3645.0,Patient,"were right, you are and I I just kind of want to think myself for that."
191.0,Provider,"yeah well, let me do you to thank you safety I."
3645.0,Patient,"think so because I really do I just do the damn thing and I hate I hate I hate being non compliant. I already knew my favorite month read was then I already knew it was. I mean by that i'm still here, to be honest."
