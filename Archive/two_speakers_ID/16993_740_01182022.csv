Our ability to effectively cope with the full variety of life in varieties another long term. Long term or short term goal that you say they stated was that you want to work on your negative self talk. To develop more coping mechanism doing stress and to learn more techniques during your quiet time. um.

So that's why. i'm. manager is never set in stone so anytime you like. What. anytime anything needs to change just let me know it's never said install okay um so what's been going on."
16993.0,Patient,"Ah, well so i'm gonna give you some positives."
740.0,Provider,Go mama go forward.
16993.0,Patient,"First i'm gonna do two negatives first, so this is a so i've been working on myself when I drive. Because I noticed that before the suicide attempt everything escalated with me that included the way I drove, and so I in my quest for control, I can be very aggressive, and so I had two episodes where i'll follow people. about that, but that's what I did in so I remember that what overtook me is that when someone cuts me off, and this happened in the past couple of weeks, when someone cuts me off, that is a blow to my existence like i'm going to use some profanity. So that's. How I talk sometimes well most times. When I was like. You know this mother Okay, and so what I wanted to do is make them feel how I feel like you, you you put a little you put a lot of anxiety and me you put fear in me because I was in fear of being hit in so. I will follow you I had we have a thing, so that we can fail the dvr in a car. scan so that we can film people and I took pictures of the license plate, and so that's where I should have ended it, I did not. I did not, I followed this broad. For a good 10 minutes until she was scared. And if she if she all she had to do is pull away the police department, I would have pulled over to, and I would have said you almost made me crash into the middle divider you didn't wave or say anything like that okay so that's that one. The other one i'm a."
740.0,Provider,"We coming back to it, no, no, no, no, no, no Fred."
16993.0,Patient,"And so uh you know I said that's enough michelle's I think the other part of me stepped in and said okay that's enough, you need to go home, so I went home. i'm trying to remember the one I think it was on the freeway yeah another cut off another cut off i'm in a slow lane and the person moves over, and so I follow them. And I followed them until I got to where I was exiting I didn't follow them like right on a bumper because they could have hit their brakes, but I followed them where they noticed, and I did the same thing, I made a I took a picture."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16993.0,Patient,"Because the the thing loops too fast to get the get the identification of the license plate, just in case there was an accident. And so that's something that I do often when I see people driving crazy, but then you know, I was. I will say I was driving crazy, but what I would say is that every time they switch lanes I switch lanes and so what I noticed in me is that. I didn't expect the rage to resolve itself that takes time it was rage, what I can say about the rage, is that I felt another part of me that didn't want to take this. To the levels of getting out the car or are pulling over and trying to fight people or anything like that I was angry about the disregard for me being there. I took in personal i've been cut off before and i've had times, where i'm like Okay, you seem to be in a bigger hurry than I am, do you think and i'll fail back, but this the last couple of weeks, the two episodes so that's the the negative aspect of anxiety of fear of. feeling like an invalid. No, no, you you you don't you didn't even bother the local. So personal the the positives were that. That I assess myself afterwards. And said that's dangerous, you could have caused another accident, so the very thing you were trying to trying to avoid you could have cost. Your rage could have gone beyond the levels that he did the chick could have pulled out a gun. Here, because that's what people do which fear that they feel like they can't be someone a bullet to be everything. And so I assess myself and I journaled about the rage and said okay where's this coming from this is common from feeling like. Like i'm not secure like not safe like people didn't take my life, like, I am not here like you're acting like i'm not here, so I went into myself said this comes from childhood. This is what this was really about, and so both instances, was that that was what that was really about, what are we willing to do next time. Is. is my responsibility is to to to my best, the best of my ability is to keep from having accidents, if I can avoid it that's my responsibility it's also my responsibility as a driver to to not be reckless in my driving no other people can be reckless but I shouldn't be and I shouldn't. You know i'm not asking myself to be an angel. Because I can be upset within the car, but I cannot use the car. As a an intimidation factor against other people. Right oh that's what i've resolved to work on, when I drive because I noticed that when I get into that seat i'm a whole nother person. I turn up the music because that's what I like to do."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16993.0,Patient,And so what i've also done ayesha is that when I get in a car. have changed the music a little bit. Loud but.
740.0,Provider,When I.
16993.0,Patient,"started listening to Kenny lattimore he sings about love, and so I said, let me pump that into my my psyche instead of plan plan, a lot of the rap that make."
740.0,Provider,That kind of country make your life.
16993.0,Patient,"hey i'm like i'm that to a but I mean, I have to be careful with that because I. guess i'd be gunning i'd be gone and like I wish your money you know i'm like. Here in Atlanta, we should motherfucker word today. And so. say so, when I recognize that, in the car that i'm pumped like like this good to be pumped but i'm saying pumped to where we should motherfucker wood. ash I changed the music not changed it change it to love music so that that's coming into me and reminded me that it really is about that and it's about safety it's about my security so that's what i've elected to do with that, along with journaling along with. Just really along with assessing on the spot, I don't need. To assess. assess right after the other positive is that whenever any I anxieties come up with my relationship. i'm triggered by something. We had a talk, right after I came out of the facility to always share that. You had her house mock and my mind might want to say I don't want to rock the boat, this is too small, and the way that i'm going to look to him, but. Not every time i'm triggered i've seen. Good talk. I was triggered by this and it made me feel this way."
740.0,Provider,yeah this way.
16993.0,Patient,"So that my feelings have nothing to do with your intentions. Yes, feelings I don't know if you know this, but i'm sure you do is that last group meeting that's what I did I checked in. And these are my feelings and I get to do that today because. If I don't do that. yeah self destruction is in his way is is waiting for me to feel like an invalid and I can't today just wear today okay."
740.0,Provider,Right.
16993.0,Patient,I cannot have it so that's where i'm at night.
740.0,Provider,"Okay let's start let's start from the top. Because i'm i'm so, but the thing about it is, I mean i'm thrilled i'm thrilled that you were able to. um really process that the incidents that you were able to identify where they came from, and things of that nature and that you were able to kind of go through and be like Okay, we don't need to do that Okay, we because this is the thing. Right my thing is this i'ma say i'ma tell you some in real life right because I like to use real life examples. Because I never want your The thing that i'm just talking about the side of my neck, and I have not experienced in real life story Jay was this went to the store muscle man in my business. Looking for some smoked paprika. know what i'm looking for smoker freak was over there, the Spice out, it was a man that was opposite race of me course and he asked somebody. He asked one of the staff to help him find something. In the midst of him. trying to get assistance he was bagging back, as I was going out of the owl and he wasn't paying attention so he bumped into my buggy right he gave me this look like, he was just very disturbed and so he told me he said well. And I looked at him I said, well, Sir, you know I say, excuse me, Sir, and he looked he shook his head sounds I was there I was like well you know at least you could say, excuse me. And then he said whoa he said, well, you could have told me about the heat your book. And I said, well, Sir, I have my son right here like he's right here, on top of the top of the car and i'm you know and. He was like he said. He said we just we just go back where you came from. Oh no, and I say no, I said, well, so when I come from, he failed his I don't know, he said, but you didn't come from here. And I told him I said I don't be a racist Sir now don't be a racist and then I told him and then before I left, I told him I told him that Jesus loved him and he needed to be saved. Because I said don't be a race to see to have met necessary because we was on my Avatar the peak. And then I had to give him some good news that Jesus loves me he needs to be saying. That you know I didn't retaliate right I didn't work him outside of so you know I didn't I didn't run up on them, and all that kind of stuff. Because, at the end of the day, you i'm saying you know you have to practice integrity Everywhere you go I can kill my witness by being routed as man and then trying to tell us which Stella de lo and she stood up and did all this kind of stuff to this man to talk to him. Because, at the end of the day we can't control what people do. Right, we can just control how we respond right now man, I was looking around i'll say my blow one ball I gotta say that i'm told my boss said. hey guess what happened to me at the stone I hate racial slurs is a real thing okay it's always like me, and so I was on the phone while this list, and I was like. I just got my job because i've been to a side of the situation, though. Not I didn't I didn't give it to him, you i'm saying, because the thing about it is, is that you don't let people see you sweat. And you don't let people see you're saying that they got the best of you, because some people look for it, they take pleasure in there. You know i'm saying, and then you give them even more of a reason. To justify their statement as to why they feel like you don't belong. Right. I left. And I was watching my back because you know people be crazy and I have my son when he decided to make sure you know I gotta make sure he saved and. Let out the store bought about it, and I was like girl so proud of. You i'm saying and the thing about it is, is because of the fact that integrity is real and so this is what I say, I say Oh, this is a this. Is a you can't control what people do. You can't even Control have a draft don't we find without this year old guy does the standard stuff like that listen 5050 K outside a bully. Okay yeah you're saying that's the thing and i'm glad that you identified, you know um where they've stemmed from in regards to childhood. right because. That means. validity is an issue. So now we have to practice and focus on how can I validate me right, without being defended when you feel like others are not. say you always make a strange not done it to be real good, but even asked to do it, I still think he's trying. Well, as I think it's so strange he'd be yelling and a causes the other car in front of him. In front of them. And they can't hear nothing they say."
16993.0,Patient,yeah I mean they can submit.
740.0,Provider,"To God, I mean really doing some stuff making things and all that kind of stuff really get mad and I. And i'm, like the other, the quantum they can't hear you we exert all this energy right for folks they can hear us. At. You i'm saying and so. That is something that. We can definitely work on however don't fall and nobody."
16993.0,Patient,"Now, now, is it now."
740.0,Provider,"No, it is yeah don't want to know that."
16993.0,Patient,"i'm gonna tell you what i'm going to give myself a pat on the back for. i've done it when i've done this before I kept it secret and so that that made me justify doing that midnight kind of action against other people insane where they shouldn't have did this issue in the date so our he led to not share it with my husband. Because I didn't want no feedback about my behavior, but I think that would I want to give that pet a couple of pat's on the back, is that I shared it with him. he's elected not to be too too. he's not judging but he's just kind of like okay."
740.0,Provider,And I.
16993.0,Patient,"told him, where I believe it stems from. And so what i'm willing to do with that. At past action is to share with you, you helped me process that but you're absolutely right about the validity of myself and. I think that when I first got into bright heart that the gentleman I forget his name the initial contact with bright heart, he said that, I want you guys to do something it's kind of silly it wasn't silly it was to go in a bathroom you say good job Michelle. yeah good job she'll for today's interactions, and so I have to also consider the times that I restrained myself. Okay, so that means that it is in me it is in me to say. You don't know me. it's not personal. Right personal it was never personal you never know what people were dealing with in the haight always say that, in addition to drugs and alcohol and driving is thinking. When you have something on your mind and you're driving it's dangerous. You can cause accidents. Because you're not thinking about just around if you're not scanning, and so I. would also like to do. Is when I when I get behind the wheel when I turn on the car. mm hmm to be more mindful. I see things coming but be more mindful of the fights that i'm looking for like a like like like a in and say an affirmation may be and say no fine we're not looking we can we don't need to be fighting the day."
740.0,Provider,Before.
16993.0,Patient,The fight is really inside it's not out there.
740.0,Provider,Absolutely here.
16993.0,Patient,So that's what i'm willing to do with that too. Good so much to do.
740.0,Provider,It says someone wants to do.
16993.0,Patient,stuff it's good stuff. Is all for me.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16993.0,Patient,"And I, and I think that that will really contribute to validate myself. and say you are worth this this this help you're worth this this affirmation. protect yourself you're worth the security, you can provide security for yourself, you don't have to wait for other people to do it. Can you hear me. Yes, okay."
740.0,Provider,"um so I agree, one thing I will say is that sometimes we have to be careful because we sometimes we and i'm glad you mentioned, it is a media sounds we feel like the fight that we have within ourselves. moves from internal to external. And so minute so people can be doing things there's very miniscule to nothing at all, and we get on team USA, it is not film is us. You know i'm saying so, I think it takes it takes a huge person to admit that and to understand you i'm saying like yo, this is what I gotta do I gotta I gotta I gotta do this for me, you know i'm saying, and so, because. we're trauma is so much you you if it if it isn't taken care of in childhood then basically it spills over into your adulthood. And it reflects on your behaviors it reflects in your beliefs, it reflects on your attitude it reflects this position. You i'm saying it spills over and people say stuff like oh no you're not ours will have a good team, and I mean you know I mean no I mean no line Okay, but then you ask them Okay, why do you behave like you behave. And then guess what happens, we got to go back the six year old seven year old 10 year old where you're forced to you i'm saying, and so you know because, because when when when trauma is not dealt with it, it has a way of hiding in other areas of our life. You know i'm saying so. With. Not. feeling badly or not being validated, I would say, as a child. My really feeling like you're being cared for, because I instability right just bouncing around and moving around i'm know nurture things of that nature, I. mean it sounds like we did that means we got to do you know what you're right. Because you wait for somebody else to do it you're gonna be upset. But. On the flip side, sometimes we think that is up to the other person and do is and it's not. it's hard work. it's tough you suck sometimes it shows you i'm saying, but we have to do it. Because. When we feel like. i'm. When we feel like the winner being heard right there we're not being seen. This one we fill in data. And so that's why, with the car situation we get it we is like Oh well, they're not even paying attention like they don't even want to see me right, they just drive and and being reckless they're not even trying to see me So what does that do that triggers me. to other times that of a moment people were trying to see me, and so, then they would get in this fight or flight. To where we feel like what I gotta defend me now right I gotta stand up for me, but that didn't know by the Center for me so then we started driving and following up with a means. Because you want them to make sure that you know that you've seen you almost say. If i'm trying to. i'm not gonna say so you're you're defending yourself. You know i'm saying at the same time, proving a point. That you deserve to be saying, and you do deserve to be saying you don't have to follow people to do that. um because the thing about it is is Michelle is that you want to make sure that you're seeing by the right people right. because everybody who sees you may not know how to handle you. Everybody who sees you may not know how to treat you. it's like you always want to make sure that with being seen that you've seen you first. And the person that you want to see you portray that person. You i'm saying is is it, it can be a difficult thing to get rid of old habits, why because we understand that our habits die hard right, but they do die. You can eliminate them, you can do something different, you could do something, you could do something fresh you i'm saying you can be something. something better than what you are it just takes it takes a willingness, it takes a belief and it takes a whole lot of work. But you're doing it. You are so you should be proud. However, let's get back to the beginning. With the validate So what do you feel. Because my engine one mom i'm empty and what day to date and with great grand mom and dad and grandma. We can't do nothing about the animal. However, what do you feel that. You can take away from those situations. and be more and be better towards yourself to to to to feel validated inward."
16993.0,Patient,Which situations that are driving the past past.
740.0,Provider,"What happened big name, because this boy stand firm."
16993.0,Patient,"Right yeah right, so this past week. Was resurfaces to molest well. This the rate. For my father and that's really more in the forefront. that's so that's really steered me. More so than the physical abuse and verbal abuse from my mother."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16993.0,Patient,"And I think that's because I got a chance to see her in 2014 and she apologized. For them, and so I can put that in his place somewhat the thing with the father is, of course, is shatters is shatters a lot in me but as far as the what I could do for myself say that again say that again."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, it is most of low when you going in the right direction, what you feel like you can do for yourself. You give yourself a validation that they give you."
16993.0,Patient,"Right, and so what I noticed that I did when that came up a few times is that I remind you, I look around what Greg that's my husband. Did was he put up my associates certificate, I mean my diploma and that's where I can see, I have a big picture of my daughter she's beautiful. On there, and so I have a nice pictures nice picture of my niece she's beautiful and what i've done is i've looked at the extensions of myself and what i've accomplished, and he says, you should also always play show accomplishments where you can see them. Absolutely of who you are, I remind myself that i'm 52 years old, I am not 13. And i've done a lot since then it's just not about the negative aspects of my life i've done a lot of positives people have reached out to me because I brought something positive to their lives and so to remind myself that i'm gifted. In. My communication i'm gifted in the way articulate my feelings i'm gifted in the way I can touch other people. When i'm mostly gifted in the way that I can reach my innermost self and pull out what's really gone on and understand that. You know I can you know you know, we in life there's the preserver there's the LIFE preserver you know the other person throws out the LIFE preserver to save the person. I remember, I used to say this, and a long time ago, is that today i'm willing to participate in my own preservation, today I am willing to participate in my own saving a mile in life. And so the validity part comes into the footwork that i'm willing to do and really acknowledging that that's what I did is that's what i'm doing today I do quiet time for me. I do my readings for myself, I do. The as far as the past coming in it's gonna come in it's gonna you know it's what occurred I can't forget it, unless I bumped my head and get amnesia permanently I can't forget it at the same time, what is his influence in me right now. I hurt that hurts. It really hurts me it shattered the fact that. This relationship, and then I did. I am in I am grieving. I am grieving what was. yeah for that, and so I have to understand a death was happening to me is that i'm grieving who my father was to me. And after that he wasn't anymore, and so I had that thing where i'm. No longer the daughter. And so I went on, with my life all over the place promiscuity, and all that stuff but today i'm in a relationship, one on one first person i've ever been. faithful to. yeah in, and I consider that a huge accomplishment."
740.0,Provider,This is.
16993.0,Patient,"Eight years and counting. I can send it up ever slept with anyone else now, I can say that that's a big thing. yeah I can say that I have extended love i've never loved this long consistently have never been willing to take this legally and say i'm going to be faithful to this guy and so that's a big huge."
740.0,Provider,deal to me.
16993.0,Patient,"This, for me. And so the i'm a work still in progress, as everybody is, but what I want to also share with you that just came up. Is that I just want to make sure you keep track. Is that before the suicidal ideation. I was feeling that. I was stuck in. A role. And being a shared that with you, but I didn't go deep with that I want to go deep with you that's okay."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, please."
16993.0,Patient,"But I felt their sex, was a dude. And I have to admit out loud that. I would schedule it to appease the relationship. But I would disassociate. From my body. And I also would act as if. And I had been doing it. And so, when I got married, which was the in in July of last year. As I said, I said to my internal self like now, I have to do this, until we get too old to do and I felt trapped."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16993.0,Patient,"I love this guy he has not done brought any harm to me. But this is how I felt. And so I, this is my I feel tears come into my eyes, because this is my first time bringing this to the forefront another person that this is how I feel, and I say felt. Because the strangest thing to me is to do a suicide attempt, and then come through that facility in sacramento and component to you guys and. I don't know what happened to me. Or maybe something a portal open up a me, but today, this is not how I feel sexually toward him. I don't know if god's grace said we're going to open some up something up within her and allow her to trust. This Union trust this Union. This is non bill, this is not him. The you are not 13. You are sexual being as well as a bacon one, and you can trust."
740.0,Provider,and
16993.0,Patient,"Your security and safety of being a sexual being. yeah oh that's what I wanted to share with you that. The conflict of. It being taken from me and by someone like that. And then transferring it into my adult life. And and. Trusting. That. I trust in this body that i'm in now, and it can be open to being sexual in a safe and secure place. So that that that's what I got to say about that."
740.0,Provider,"that's good right because we're trauma what child that's normal. Because usually we used to be when you're used to having a predator. or perpetrator to abuse you and when that person isn't there anymore, the we become the abuser. is normal to disassociate is a mom is normal to detach because that's part of our survival right right that's how about. If I just play like i'm not there. Yet i'm saying and eventually you do it enough to where you become good at it, to the point where you only one as you doing it right. And then one day you decide. That i'm going to do something i've never done before and i'm going to commit to one person. Right and initially you i'm saying it is difficult. Because i'm doing something that i've never done before, however, at the same time, my practices, has always been to detach. And to just fulfill a world. But then. We make the decision. On one day we realized. He really does love me. love you oh. And I wouldn't want to give myself down he's not my predator right he's not my enemy he's not the perpetrator to do this to me. If anything he loves me pass my pain. And he wants to see the best so, the more you are in the marriage, the more he reveals himself, the more you trust what he reveals the more it allows you It makes you want to open up right. So I think I think that's perfect I think it's literally i've had situations like that, before i've been in situations like that, before um you know i'm saying and. You know it's one of those things where people going to ask you how did you do it. What happened, you know what change, you know because it's so many people who are going through there who feel like they have to fill a world you know i'm saying, but they but they don't know what intimacy feels like."
16993.0,Patient,Right right that's the word.
740.0,Provider,"Because, because it was an intimate moment, there was taken away from them before they even had the chance to speak to really feel what it feels like. You know i'm saying and so. You know, many people think about how I get this back. You already get it. So I think you know. That this This could be a way to help others I can you going to meetings and things like that, or you know something to share, you know i'm saying like this can be this can be a means to help other people who who suffer from this same thing because you're not alone yeah you know. And the fact that you are able to be. With your husband and truly be in love it's a fully be intimate without any reservations and what that indie hindrances without the the the the trauma sneaking. In and messing with you. And that you're able to give yourself fully and wholeheartedly to him it's amazing."
16993.0,Patient,"It is yeah it is and it's like I don't even know what happened. This morning, so I think that that's another thing that I have to also add to my practices is that uh you know questioning so many things god's grace is real. Questioning how it is kinda. UK I don't know what occurred, and what I something know trying to exit myself and a couple of people are told outside of that, and they were like. They were shocked and I said it's just an accumulation it's just been accumulating in I don't know what occurred while I was unconscious but. The God the angels, they have come and they surrounded me and uplifted me and allowed me to be open to any assistance that I could get. And to really jump in in in and support myself first and then then allow to support the command, but this other thing that I looked around like I can look at the pictures, I can look at the marriage photos. And not feel so foreign to that that is me that's. An hour that I don't have to be this one magazine cover for nobody. For myself, but you're absolutely right when you said intimacy and when he what that incident did, is it made my approaching sexual feelings that were beginning to. You know because I hit I hadn't hit puberty all the way, but I was beginning to like boys. When they make."
