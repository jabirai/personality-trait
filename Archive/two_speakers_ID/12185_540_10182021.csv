12185.0,Patient,"i'm trying like i'm going to reach out to a few people see if I could like a bit like you know just like network, I was thinking oh yeah. So I was supposed to work and by Lisa I was supposed to look into miley cyrus because, like buying. I know her makeup artist and she told me, she was going to work with her because it's like this for things that physical with my with my ex and it was, like all over Facebook and share to you my friend, please don't be so I feel like. Good bad or like maybe like it's waiting so like I don't know right like the space which, like the right, because I feel myself to them out and it only feel social anxiety like, if I were to go and lunch at claridge's I was thinking of like maker for lunch."
540.0,Provider,"So, are you going to meet the friend or your meeting the friend and miley cyrus."
12185.0,Patient,Meeting miley cyrus make it okay.

540.0,Provider,say in one text yes and.
12185.0,Patient,"What okay. But then, because you know how, like me, I feel like a lot of you know out here it's like you know, and you are when you go for lunch or somebody you kind of have a good intention like Oh, why should they cancel lunch. Well it's like. You like what like do I have an intention, I just like because, like I don't I also don't really care about working with miley cyrus mean like i'll be cool like it, but I don't really have an attachment to it, you know, like. But it's I think I just like mainly just like you know, like like saying like i'm better. Like you know she she she's brought me on to like some jobs, like my first fashion shows were 30, which is how I work and she loves my work, it was just that one thing you know that kind of like by to change her opinion on me yeah."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean you could say like hey do you have anything going on, like why don't we meet for lunch and catch up, or something so that she can get to like see where you're at now."
12185.0,Patient,"But, would it be weird like would it be considered a catch up with like a personal relationship like that, like you've never really met up for lunch or anything. So many times the job. So it's so good to catch up, not the right word."
540.0,Provider,Okay yeah so that's more professional working relationship right.
12185.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean I wouldn't like it, but you know she's really sweet, and I do like her, and I mean I know we're kind of worked with the husband on a movie and like you'd like to make food, but he definitely like he I. You see more need than than she had and so he knows like make it easy and you and they're like when I was working with him and I was beating my ex. And there was you know when I was working with me about a time that I tried like just like randomly in the car, because you like to bring those distances feared and means, and I think I just can't wait to feel. Like really great in any cloud cheating on you, I think he might I think we did see. I mean this I don't know I mean, I think I really think but yeah. But yeah and So yes, I was like so CC and leave it emotionally and like I was under onside I was kind of thinking a lot drinking a lot, but I would drink and then I saw I just feel I feel like normal and like relax like because I look like I had like might be. You know how it seems it's. Not at all times. Before my before physical."
540.0,Provider,"Training and spouses, you can at that point until you could address it right."
12185.0,Patient,"yeah, but I just wonder if, like he kind of really bad temper the gobi desert sunset or whatever, but like it was like the crew with merrick like the blue and I read through it, you know, but I mean, I would just gonna say something to him. I don't know. I would."
540.0,Provider,"say yes, I would just I mean at least try to have lunch with her if she doesn't have anything for you to do, maybe just try to reconnect with her."
12185.0,Patient,"But how would you how would you phrase, the proposal."
540.0,Provider,"I think the first way you said, it is good so just asking about like if she has anything and if not, what you want to link grab lunch."
12185.0,Patient,"yeah. Anything yet yeah everything going on to see if I can help you in If not, we need to grab lunch."
540.0,Provider,"So key word in it differently, a better kind of differently before."
12185.0,Patient,"What did you say everything going on with sleep. Yes, glad to be down. moving down to. grab. lunch. And it's like super late notice should I mentioned like oh i'm like i'm sorry might be like i'm sorry it's like such short notice by trade should I acknowledge that. I feel like that's something that's very like I don't know like. This is like my insecurity, like my. ADHD that like I don't notice, people are I don't get blown up like not enough notice."
540.0,Provider,"That it's like oh hey yeah. So maybe in the beginning, saying like I know this is short notice, and I was wondering if you had anything, this week, or if not, if you wanted to grab lunch."
12185.0,Patient,"You know. Another short notice, but the have anything going on between thought would be good to get mentioned one is amazing."
540.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12185.0,Patient,I noticed on short notice is that it's not too cold I know if there's a warmer way of saying that I know.
540.0,Provider,"I know I know last minute or like Oh, I know."
12185.0,Patient,"What I was thinking, I was deciding between like well use last minute or short notice, like when when I was like. You know what communicates warmer. But I also don't want to give up at air like Oh, I only I only want to talk to her because i'm begging for miley cyrus yes. Maybe I don't want to see I don't want that because I don't really. Care if I get it, but I just I just want people to know that Okay, maybe."
540.0,Provider,"Last Minutes be like I know this is last. minute. Well i'll. just say like i'll be in La the next few days so like if you have any going on, or if you wanted to grab lunch. I would love to maybe like just like reconnect and. catch up. Because I think ketchup ketchup doesn't. Like it allows it to be somewhat like so it's still professional but it's also like just enough to be personal."
12185.0,Patient,"We can I can we can I can catch up okay. Okay, I know this is kind of last minute, but i'll be in La. For. or. Wait wait a way out, so I I notice is kind of last minute, but i'll be in La for the week i'd love to weekend I can catch up, do you have anything going on this week or so what I stayed late, for I meant but i'll be in the latest The other thing going on. it's not letting me down to get bunch of time i'd love to reconnect can catch up. yeah okay. I just like to race okay Oh, thank God, for that anybody. I hate when I do, that I erased all of it. I put an emoji. hey channel it's all it's all about small but i'm in La for the weeks. A fox they seem like it's like the types of the same like ulterior motive the right."
540.0,Provider,"Now, no, no, I think that sounds good yeah."
12185.0,Patient,"that's like that's like my biggest insecurity, but like working in living in La it's like I hate how. transactional thinking, but also it's. Also understanding. The nature of the business. I think what it looks like like that had Ray be like a replica. think like. paid for like you know, and I get people out of wiping to like feel like call a minute."
540.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's definitely hard to having but understanding like it's professional relationships as well, so you guys met professionally it'd be different if you just like knew her and then. You didn't ever work with her before, so I think you guys already had that dynamic where that's that's part of connecting."
12185.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,Getting tested right now.
12185.0,Patient,"No, I just like I just I just walked in a park like down the street from my friends. bardot. yeah. wow but megan."
540.0,Provider,How are you feeling.
12185.0,Patient,"Good I definitely like a better reaction that I had last time, like, I definitely feel like the mindset change like I definitely feel like I was definitely different person before I came here and so another valley and others what kind of validates my enlightenment is like i'm just. Because I kind of had like a traumatic react non traumatic like whoa like but. I did what what's a traumatic record let's not downplay it out, because I didn't get like to get like anxiety like being back here like kind of a culture shock, but like I don't know I just have like. sense of peace and I don't I really don't. i'm not sweating anything I just create literally just bought I bought I bought mine lightman or whatever how government see like everything so clearly like it really feels like a fucking like. Like like what do you call it it's like not like a like a like an God trip God complex like where you feel like I don't know not a power trip it's like it's like you don't talk about you know where i'm looking for."
540.0,Provider,I think it's not God complex so.
12185.0,Patient,Like.
540.0,Provider,you're talking about.
12185.0,Patient,"it's like it's almost you feel like God, but it's like it's like not that like you know I know I don't like I don't I don't I don't hold myself to like that you know, like oh i'm like amazing i'm like i'm above everybody else, no I don't feel that but I mean like it just like I just. it's just so strange how I see the world now like it's so Lear and like it's like it's like I psycho analyze everything it's, not even in general, you just like. whoa like you know, like and I don't know the weirdest thing that I like that Oh, this is another thing that like makes me like oh shit like definitely am artistic. is like is my hyper empathy because, like a lot of times like when I do fillings as my own, because, like i'm not feeling thoughts or anything. But it's like the people around me anxiety and like even at bardot like I could feel his anxiety, even though he was like well I. didn't feel like he doesn't really know what i'm like he's like you, like you, like the weather, he fainted so here's the thing of it but yeah we as a and. treated ADHD and it's like the intrinsic anxiety that I feel from him but he's like I know where i'm like i'm kind of like educating them on ADHD in children. who's on that journey now. But yeah and i'm realizing everybody around me like we like we just hanging out with each other, like oh my gosh so whenever funky friends and like no wonder, this but I. don't know like I really anyway it's like it's like I have been like building my community without even knowing it, you know."
540.0,Provider,They are seeing it I think you're seeing the deeper meaning and your all your relationships they're going to feel a bit deeper now it's a good yeah a deeper level of life.
12185.0,Patient,than just.
540.0,Provider,Being on the surface.
12185.0,Patient,yeah like seriously like life is so like i'm rich like. I don't know like. it's really cool like it's really you know i'm really happy to be here.
540.0,Provider,it's amazing girl that's.
12185.0,Patient,"amazing Thank you and, just like I mean I just switched like everybody can think the way i'm thinking like it seems so like simple like I really just like shut off everything like I learned all like very like false and they also have like. The human experience basically well because I was like what. He instructed to be like oh."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I think, so I mean change so a lot of people changes uncomfortable so it's a lot easier to not change, then, to take the risks and sacrifices and just being able to allow yourself, and this is what you've done and a lot of people aren't willing to do it."
12185.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I probably heard that too, because, like it is so scary like this is the scariest the hardest thing i've ever done in my life like ever and I thought that, like. My whole escorted drug addict perhaps was going to be the hardest and at that time it was the hardest, you know because I wasn't like aiming I wasn't like working for something bigger I wasn't aware of something bigger you know."
540.0,Provider,"that's scary and a lot of people, they just instead they'll do the tunnel vision to say, like in a comfort zone, even if that means having like a. kind of life."
12185.0,Patient,"Well yeah but. Even Eduardo like I used to look up to him so nice because he is like he's he's like a genius and like functionality like his genius and then look at the world me. function like you know how to get it and that's and that's kind of like our key that is being famous is being hyperactive and like big overhaul. But that's kind of how my market but it's quite I don't know it's like there's a business. there's a there's a level of peace that like I feel like people can make. A light switch by some like thinking, like the slave. I don't know like he is scared to the dmp but in concert with venturing like like i'm going to take way longer than that and he's like kind of like using his child that's like. You know I say. We want to make sure everything's good for the child, but like this is kind of like awareness is going to kind of help solidify your father, the venue. But i'm like like kind of question but i'm just like oh my God like it just it helps so much like you know I didn't like you know I did I use. I never wanted to seem like Oh, I did like I enlighten myself, because I didn't I didn't like psychedelics and i've been working on it, but I didn't have that intention of reaching enlightenment, but I just like reach that I. just been working on myself on a and the empty was a tool that helped me see more. But it definitely wasn't because of you know, I definitely wasn't like because of the empty like I just woke up and i'm on my end, you know it's not it didn't work that way it was like a lot of like mindset mindset shifts and changes."
540.0,Provider,"One thing that you have to understand, too, though, Carl is I mean you've you've gone into this experience with. With the wanting of getting something from the experience mental health wise, whereas say someone doesn't have that readiness doesn't have that insight that you've been collecting. I mean you've done research on it you've really put your on it, you have counseling your readiness was there to reach that deeper level, but sometimes some people, I mean they may not be ready for that, if that makes sense."
12185.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I feel like I feel like I understand it, just like it is look where the you know my mom said preach meeting by this point get it from. Anybody have any. Of you haven't told you about the. num yo hollering take to the Buddhist chant yeah yes oh my God, I did, I think that is so crazy like I wasn't even like intending on like I mean either. I kind of like half ass believe that I was like you know, but let me just give it a try and I just can't believe it work and I didn't I don't know like I didn't put like my fully into it and, like that, but damn thing is for you even."
540.0,Provider,"When it's one of those things start to connect you start to be able to kind of open your mind open your eyes and then sometimes like the universe, it just it flows together, and I think that what you've been seeing."
12185.0,Patient,"Because oh yeah totally. Like I was just thinking in the bus like. I would not change a single detail of my life like I fully believe in the circulation theory and, like the D. The butterfly butterfly you know it's like it's all connected and it's like empty desk you know and pre destiny and freewill like all of that. is making inroads if you know and it just like I don't know I just I just having this like solid understanding and acceptance and like this it's like. it's just like I know it really makes me feel alive so much, but clear. yeah I don't know I just think."
540.0,Provider,"there's less noise less distraction, because now you're seeing really I mean you're seeing what you are able to see that other people aren't able to say."
12185.0,Patient,"I know it's just crazy It is crazy, I mean. I don't know. I never thought I would like so secure ever at this, I would just fill it up like i'll give you those good how about you know. Big shadow about racing."
540.0,Provider,"And I think that not only has your spiritual aspect allowed you to embrace it, but once you learn that the things that you've gone through who you are it's not about. It like dampening who you are but it's embracing."
12185.0,Patient,"enriching who you are enriching yeah like trauma is a superpower Oh, he doesn't tell you about like Oh, if you like, I read that when you go through physical abuse like your brain makes more dentally they fight back then. Oh so um yeah so when you go through physical abuse on. Your brain just starts to make more giveaways than before. But thinking about it, an evolutionary standpoint that makes total sense, but you know, obviously, like Thomas your superpower like it is often next and like. I guess like the evolutionary standpoint like if you are in danger if you keep getting hurt you know you have you have to flexing evolve mentally to get yourself out of that physical pain, you know. But and so that's another thing that's very like. Like yeah you know, like that's another thing that i'm like totally i'm so proud of you so like thankful for the drama it's just like basically like saying, or even, I think, but like yeah like. Every single piece of my mind, but even just like my my you know my access sister showed me that movie like little beads called mattered so much like. butterflies. You know."
540.0,Provider,"One thing I encourage so like I know you'd like to Ted talks if you have a linkedin. I doubt So if you make a linkedin account it's it's somewhat like a professional more research E type of like. Facebook instagram, but there is so much it's amazing because you can follow all of the people like the person that you got the book."
12185.0,Patient,what's up a school bag. And Laura. yeah.
540.0,Provider,i'm. But. That person that like you got the book from you can follow her like there's so many things that you can follow and research.
12185.0,Patient,What do you learn from like like if I go in and buy gold for him and then like i've never used that also should. I do feel like by industry work through legs would.
540.0,Provider,"You I mean you should. Have that even like a professional but it's i'm like I always kind of brushed off linkedin as a one of my like old coworker she talked about it she's like it's so much better than Facebook like there's so much on it. And I finally like connected to it, and it is amazing, you should really you should look into it."
12185.0,Patient,out like you.
540.0,Provider,"And like in the morning and it like gives you so when you follow different things, and the morning it gives you like news today and it's not like Facebook, where you're only getting like one side like it's giving you like like real like research information. And like in the morning, oh yeah most articles that you like Ted talks you like I follow Ted conferences. I follow, like all like the psychology people that I have like always liked the finance business people. it's really like it's like Wall Street Journal like there's so many different like research stuff that just all over here so yeah definitely try to download it like psychology today you'd probably like that stuff."
12185.0,Patient,Do I need to like fill up my profile to like yeah. he's like.
540.0,Provider,You can.
12185.0,Patient,be like a watcher or reader.
540.0,Provider,"You can make like a profile, but you don't have to, like all this information and. Like you don't have to."
12185.0,Patient,"Like a crazy profile. I mean, even just."
540.0,Provider,Like Carl P and don't even put like Carl don't put anything and you could just do it to basically watch and that's what I do I don't post anything I literally just use it for the research and the I don't I have not posted one thing on here.
12185.0,Patient,Oh.
540.0,Provider,"yeah definitely something to look into at least. The researching and learning more and it's such like a nice like little instead of like Facebook, where you just kind of scroll and go now where."
12185.0,Patient,"Are you Oh, my goodness i'm articles or whatever oh my God this you can find it. But it was. A screenshot. But. You know, like this, like. Okay, so there's just like I thought it was like. It was like the question, what do more enlightened people know that others don't and if it's like it's like lung cancer on flora. And I was like Oh, my goodness, this is exactly what i'm talking about like either like it's crazy okay well i'll send you i'll give you the last paragraph is like that, but. Okay, so insured they like the enlightened individual is really only seven West unclean about the truth which basically all of us spend our lives and willingly trying to avoid. He doesn't learn some new obscure truth only unseized everything that was already untrue and other words, there is a falling away that was. Most always false, not the acquisition of something in the truth is that this whole universe is one will and therefore. All their individual attempts to control it, and it resists or hold on to it or not only the child, but begging begging efficiently absurd like a dog chasing its own tail. We are a planet full to the brim of lunatics to actually find the sticks into their own in their own, and you can you cannot stand the fact that we are all one process. We can extend it, because it means that we can hold on to it, you can hold on to each other or the world because there is no is fundamentally separate from. From that dynamic template for dancing so what I run it and then, then the in the end it will be our attempts to control the world that will be what. That will be. john O w what destroys it. But. it's an exciting whether it's like expands on it for like are you have, like several jobs."
540.0,Provider,Do you have like the.
12185.0,Patient,Billing whatever. yeah okay what. Do. I tried to eat this. Food but it wasn't so hard for me to understand.
540.0,Provider,yeah seems like it has to be something that is red and processed.
12185.0,Patient,Wherever seemed like i'm crazy or i'm gonna let our vendors that weekend.
540.0,Provider,"So I think that I really think that you've you've just found that deeper meaning of life, and it may seem crazy to others, because once you hit that you can't really drag anybody into it, that I mean they call it like awakening like that's really what they call it so. You find men they call awakening and you can't force other people to be awakened."
12185.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,hmm.
12185.0,Patient,I didn't think.
540.0,Provider,"No, no, no that's okay. Okay sorry I didn't know if he were still there."
12185.0,Patient,"Oh, I found it. Today, so."
540.0,Provider,Can you put it in the chat.
12185.0,Patient,yeah there.
540.0,Provider,Are you still there are no.
12185.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, oh so must be in the people i'm hearing in the background."
12185.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean like a disease state. Like sparkling water, but just make the best."
540.0,Provider,Are there many people at the park that you're in right now.
12185.0,Patient,"And you're. Like where the homeless people I mean. Again, like those those the homeless people are talking to you that would like bad. they're just there's like I think that's a good."
540.0,Provider,"What kind of bag, do you have."
12185.0,Patient,A story.
540.0,Provider,Okay well that's cool.
12185.0,Patient,I love the articles are you eating the link.
540.0,Provider,"I just i'm gonna make us my homework, so I just put it so that I don't know that. that's good."
12185.0,Patient,You didn't understand. Or you kind of skip through.
540.0,Provider,Now sorry i'm just going to save it to my desktop to make sure you're good.
12185.0,Patient,I hope you can understand it like before I was like oh my God the dnc people that are you talking about and like oh my gosh now I get what you're saying.
540.0,Provider,"it's inside your brain has grown, but some people their brains hubspot."
12185.0,Patient,"i'm gonna get you know what else we can do to like make your brain grow so something I was doing like during like my relationship, I had this red light therapy and would read my with like nine oh like nano something coloring or whatever, I think I like. What frequency, but you can penetrate like like to interest into your stall by like putting it like it's like a it's like a one but, like the red red red, orange yellow and like you'd like infrared lights and then it's like it makes your brain grow like is it basically like is it a. energizes the mitochondria yourself so whatever countries is mainly for like the wrinkles but it, but it can penetrate into so i'm doing that for mental health any like it really works like even when i'm going to like even with like with angel likes it really helped me."
540.0,Provider,So. Far.
12185.0,Patient,yeah I have a one I it's it's like it's like red light therapy for wrinkles I did it for like skins.
540.0,Provider,So you own one.
12185.0,Patient,"yeah yeah but I liked you know me I didn't delve into research about identity. and babies that for like. For people with dementia, like the video intranasal one they like to play like red lights here and then that penetrates like the prefrontal cortex so it really hot really hot like these people with mutual so."
540.0,Provider,"So that one red light therapy, yes, yes, and my."
12185.0,Patient,"hair, but you gotta wait for like for like two weeks Oh, you know it's crazy. Impact yeah but you know it's crazy like I can breathe like I feel like when I meditate now I can I can bring awareness to like my brain like I can feel. Complete prefrontal cortex like you know that, like that meditation where you like rain, do you like, where you're holding your arm and on the forehead and then. You feel it and it's like, but I can do that with like my my screen like I can do it in a different part of the brain like i'm not feeling my forehead skin i'm feeling my frame what embedded page like it just kind of like it off it's almost like a headache click on it kind of like. That is that it doesn't hurt but it's like there's like a little bit of. Pressure yeah from just meditating almost like whoa like this is powerful like the power of intention like."
540.0,Provider,"Well that's. So is like a perfect example where some people aren't able to do it, but those people that are you can you can literally see them like spiritually and levitate like you can see that they're going to a different place and time like they're. Aware of their body they're able to read different like people that meditate like they can sense injuries throughout their body they can you're in tune, in a way that, like many people aren't they are in tune with the universe you're in tune with yourself and your part in the universe. I myself i've never been able to meditate but every single person like the guru's that i've like met, that is something that like people should like if if you can understand that there is like a higher connection to the universe just watch someone do meditation that can really do meditation."
