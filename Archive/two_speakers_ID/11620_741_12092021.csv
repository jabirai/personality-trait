11620.0,Patient,became a big deal.
741.0,Provider,And became a nursing home administrator but I knew going in that that was not a job for me and the reason that I knew that was because I care too much about people and their quality of life and i'm not going to jeopardize their quality of life for some corporations bottom line. me and the corporation didn't get along. Because I understand how much money was going in their pocket.

11620.0,Patient,I understand that too.
741.0,Provider,"I took my mom my child to my parents and said here, take him because i'm homeless I don't want to drag him and homeless shelters. yep, and so they took him and then. file for custody. and Then it took me seven and a half years and a court.
