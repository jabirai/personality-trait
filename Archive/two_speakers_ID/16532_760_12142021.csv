16532.0,Patient,"Oh, my husband has the. My second to the youngest and I have a youngest one that that's with me and the two other boys are in school and I had the third one that passed away, I still have still grieving with that. um you know I live with the demented grandmother. And my mom and my brother."
760.0,Provider,"You may have another demented meaning, she has dimension. or arrested okay."
16532.0,Patient,"Like we're limited and caregiver because they had a cool visit recently, so we didn't have anybody, so we had to like me and my mom helped to like help her out, but my mom just recently had a surgery she's on monster she's on disability as well. For her own carpal tunnel. she's going through depression like me. You know just everything I mean i'm trying to be normal but also you know what's going on with the pandemic it's just making hours. i'm also injured doing my back to my epidural procedure. So i'm limited on what I do so that's another stressor and other factor right get the press a lot, because I will try to be as organized as possible, but when pain starts to hit in you know."
760.0,Provider,So what what happened to you had an epidural procedure was that during childbirth or a different time.
16532.0,Patient,"That that off on the fourth power. Well it's during during childbirth. Okay, the day before I delivered my child. yeah it was, I think, was done more than five times and it was in a different direction in my back so the pain and suffering from like midline chronic low back pain without sciatica."
760.0,Provider,Are you are you in care you've been treated for that.
16532.0,Patient,"Chronic pain i'm in treated for that, but if they just never goes away, I mean my ability works, but i'm still limping you know I can spend spending for like I would say, at least an hour, maybe like 30 Minutes that most. Okay um I could try to walk. Through you know to ease up the pain, but you know limping is hard, and when I carry things it's hard to. But I don't want to go through surgery. So I took my doctor."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16532.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"All right, well that I just want to make sure that you're being treated the tribune seen I mean that's not something that we do with you here, but when we meet with you. To help you improve your mental health we're looking at the whole person, you know you're obviously you described it your best yourself your chronic pain affects you it affects your mental health and and. Your anxiety so that's why i'm asking about it just to kind of get a picture part of what we're going to do is you know, of course, we have to do everything we can, which means we're meeting with our doctor, but then maybe working towards some coping skills to help you manage this. You know you, you say you want to be normal Christian, but in the short time we've had this conversation you've you've listed a whole lot of. situations that seem quite overwhelming. And I would suggest, for you to consider that perhaps. You know. it's it's common for people to feel overwhelmed when they have all these things you know you'd mentioned caring for your grandmother with dementia, I know what i've done that with my mother in law, so I know exactly what that means. I know how much stress that creates. Take being a caregiver having your own chronic pain your own stuff it's it's a lot of stuff to to juggle so that's. Maybe it's a normal reaction to. A massive amount of stress would be another way that I would suggest that you put look at it, because a lot of that stuff is outside of your control."
16532.0,Patient,"I just I was just like the type of person back. Then this can like manage, just like it just goes off like the roof off my head when some stressor. Just comes to me because. I work at the control Center at the airport so. I manage stress way more than everybody else can handle that because you know we overlook the airline, and right now I feel like I cannot even multitask I can and that's what I need I need to get that back."
760.0,Provider,"Well, the other thing that I would. ask you to consider is that you know managing the stress of come, you know planes coming in and out is all just like a thinking. kind of organizational kind of management of stress the kind of stress that you're describing as not only the thinking part, but it also has a whole lot of emotions that are tangled in there, and the second, we tangle emotions with that that adds a whole layer of. Difference you know, and you know we didn't even mention the grief that I know you're going through so. The first thing that I would ask you to at least consider and think about is that you do have a lot on your plate and it's not normal stress it's not everyday stress it's it's. emotional you know family relational stress and if it's a lot so it's something that we can work together to unpack and and to learn how to cope differently and think differently. So that was that would be what I would encourage you to consider as we keep going. yeah okay. All right, so describe for me Christian your mental health symptoms, right now, you mentioned that you're feeling anxious or was it anxiety."
16532.0,Patient,"anxiety. I was having panic panic attack in the morning again like because whenever like you know the grieving part. And I would think of my way. dead son he's he's about four years old, I had a stillbirth that's why for like 38 weeks in the 30. So I like it gave birth to him so every like the middle of the night seven week a week in by you know by. Just thinking about him sometimes dreaming about him okay like today, something like that, so I get panic attacks with that get anxious really anxious for the whole day what's going to happen, I mean it's just so many things as bothers me. yeah and then I have to get this gets ready to school when things doesn't get done and i'm so helpless I get it race, just like emotionally right now. it's happening it's attacking."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so how long have you struggled with these kinds of symptoms of depression, anxiety panic attacks like."
16532.0,Patient,"it's gotten worse, ever since I gave birth."
760.0,Provider,To about four years.
16532.0,Patient,"During my son's birth I didn't know how to catch up with how to like deal with my. Depression because, when my son passed away about four years ago, I guess, I I was so hurry to go back to work, because I just got a new career. And I dealt with it internally I wasn't able to let it out like I was too it's more like a pride thing that I."
760.0,Provider,So you took the emotion and the grief and you push it down.
16532.0,Patient,Is that what i'm understanding like I just put them inside like I didn't let it out.
760.0,Provider,You you held it it.
16532.0,Patient,"helped it in yes, yes."
760.0,Provider,Okay.

760.0,Provider,So you're losing appetite to.
16532.0,Patient,"i'm losing appetite and there's some times that I would gain appetite it's just it's weird like today, I haven't eaten breakfast. uh huh um I guess i'm not going to eat until afternoon or maybe i'm going to fall asleep, and then, if I eat, something I would eat like a big meal and that's it I don't want to eat in a more. or less some days I would be. I don't know when they feel comfortable, then I would eat the most of the time I don't so I was wondering how come i'm not losing a lot of weight me because i'm eating just whatever."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. The question for your doctor, sometimes I think it can be hard. to lose weight after you've had kids, especially when you can't exercise in the way, maybe you used to, as you said, he seems like you were pretty active in the past dancing."
16532.0,Patient,"used to go to the gym like I. yeah I did intermittent fasting and all that, I mean I can do all that but i'm. i'm breastfeeding, and i'm not walking on not like I used to I need a nice up to an hour of you know. of cardio or something. to lose all this water we."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Any other health pay a health problems other than the the back pain you've talked about is there anything else going on for you physically, but we haven't talked about."
16532.0,Patient,nothing except mentally and my emotions decides.
760.0,Provider,"Okay well that's Those are my questions so i'd like to kind of shift gears because the next step is i've kind of like to get a feel of. You know the development of what we call a treatment plan so a treatment plan would be the areas that you're going to focus on and that you're going to focus on while you're attending your your groups and your individual sessions so Christian. What are some of your goals that you would like to like start maybe. Two or three things at least that you would like to change. work towards you mentioned about wanting to be normal you wanted to go back to. Being able to manage your stress better like you used to, but can you. Give me a like a concrete goal that you would like to like start with."
16532.0,Patient,"I want to be able to manage my own time because right now. I really have anything for myself, because I, I would say, I can get a little bit of help, but not a lot of help and with four kids i'm a busy mom you know."
760.0,Provider,yeah and then your your your husband is gone a lot because he's working.
16532.0,Patient,"And so, he has anybody."
760.0,Provider,"come home at night, a lot of times."
16532.0,Patient,"yeah so like we're today he's here so. It gives me time for my appointment. Good it will be. So, like when it comes to like my physical time for myself the whole lot of work is here like laundry and all that I can do all of that, I have to wait for my my eldest son to get you know here and. help me with everything, and I have to do their homework, you know. it's just mentally it drains me. drinks, but also, I need time for myself to relax. Which i'm hoping, I can get it anytime but. i'll try to do that the time for myself and relax."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, is, do you think it's fair to say that when even when you do have the time, maybe your head is like worrying or. there's anxiety or depression going on, or you know feelings that you're experiencing and that maybe it's hard to take that time and be productive with actual and true time for yourself or so self care you think that that's true or not true for you."
16532.0,Patient,"I think that's true when I have the time that's when i'm mentally not capable. Okay, so just attacks me and that's when I tell you right like when I have the seven hours of me being depressed instead of me being productive that pain is you know comes to consistently attacking me."
760.0,Provider,"So you feel more physical pain, when your emotional pain is high, is that what you're saying."
16532.0,Patient,"Is kind of happens, both at the same time. Okay, because when you're physically hurting then you're mentally hurting too."
760.0,Provider,"So you want to be able to manage your own time. But so if we take that information that you know, even if you did have say seven hours like you said that you couldn't really use that time, like the way you wanted to, so what would be another goal. Would there be wanting to improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression, so you could be more productive, with your chores and then also be protect more productive, with your self care activities does that sound like the ball, that you would like to work on."
16532.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay yeah go work or maybe, if I can at least get rid of this pain, so I can like think right, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Get get rid of this pain, you talk in physical and mental. Physical okay well that's something that you'll have to. Work with your doctor and there's the I don't know I know a lot of people struggle with that what is your doctor say to you about your physical pain and a possibility that it's going to. improve."
16532.0,Patient,"Talk to my thing management, which I have to do the MRI soon. Ever you know there's no what's going on with all this insurance thing that they. referred me about almost two months ago and I just recently got qualified and the doctor order is what they're asking, so I mean if a doctor's order to refer me to get the authorization for my Armor wasn't that an order, I was just confused with what the hospital is asked me, you know. Because they can't find out what's going on with my back until I get them right."
760.0,Provider,And the insurance is giving you.
16532.0,Patient,it's not the insurance right now it's pretty much. The hospital yeah.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16532.0,Patient,hurting right now. Because I just recently got my own physical therapy approved to after being gone for almost almost two months to.

16532.0,Patient,me didn't have instead of having it like you know. weekly didn't stop so it feels like i'm starting again okay.
760.0,Provider,"Well, I would encourage you to consider Christian. Getting all of this stuff back in track is going to be a process, you know getting the new medications worked out getting the MRI and the medical care process continuing including your physical therapy. You mentioned about grieving is that something that you want to work on is like the grieving process is that something that you want to do."
16532.0,Patient,I do. I didn't.
760.0,Provider,"What do you think has, what do you think the effect has been for you. Since I understand that you had a new job I understand that there was like a stress and we have a tendency to put our work like really high priority, but when certain really traumatic events occur in our lives and we repress those feelings, what do you think happens emotionally or physically."
16532.0,Patient,"Yes, we're going to get the press."
760.0,Provider,that's right. yeah.
16532.0,Patient,"Because at the time that's why I chose the job, so I could alter my mind from the depth of my son."
760.0,Provider,"So, to use some disruption."
16532.0,Patient,"So to my distraction, but when when things goes haywire my job, and stress attacks me over there force I get emotionally and like things start stop. Start bothering me just like this pandemic, just like how like it's just you know, like with bird getting mad at you getting rejection and stuff. It just everything goes back and that's when you know depression is starts on me that's right this whole pregnancy every since I found out with all this covidien because I."
760.0,Provider,"Think, the most recent one of your daughter."
16532.0,Patient,"yeah, the most recent one, so I had posted and I think my boss all got mad at me because, when I had covert supposedly which my symptoms are actually morning sickness from my pregnancy, I never had my result from my. You know covert tests. Because it's due to the La county. They all got mad at me because I mentioned everyone's name and they probably had like two or three people on the left at work."
760.0,Provider,"Then. They don't they only can can you repeat what you just said, getting quite get that."
16532.0,Patient,"When I went out for a leave for coated. um. I work in different date so I got exposed to so many different people so, then the. 12 people. And yeah."
760.0,Provider,So it affected their functioning. Functioning because yeah.
16532.0,Patient,"They only are they kind of took that out beautiful. They kind of took it out on me and I, you know, I was pregnant at the time I was in my early early months like for one or two months. So I had to go through that whole pregnancy, because they're not giving me the respect that I need it's like i'm bragging, but I can get exception i'm asking to work. shorter hours in they're asking for a lot of people it's like they don't want to prove me because it's kind of like a payback that's how I felt. i'm during work and that's the reason why i'm too scared to go back to work. Because even now, the last time I talked to them. it's like they're not quoting me right i'm supposed to be in the medical leave but they're putting sick and paid so it's like are you trying to get me in trouble, so I can get I can get terminated or something it's just they're not helping me out."
760.0,Provider,And so you left that job when you when you gave birth to your daughter.
16532.0,Patient,"Yes, and giving birth to my daughter. Is not I gave birth and she's premature she came up earlier than expected so stress from job."
760.0,Provider,So that's another issue. She didn't okay now.
16532.0,Patient,she's okay. she's healthy hadn't how old is she.
760.0,Provider,How old is she right now.
16532.0,Patient,Is five months today. Okay yeah.
760.0,Provider,"All right, so you're contemplating going back to work."
16532.0,Patient,i'm contemplating going back to work because of that. Like we were not in good terms when I left.
760.0,Provider,And that's the. that's the airport. working at the airport.
16532.0,Patient,"working at the airport i'm not like I said i'm not trying to like you know, have an excuse, because of what's going on with my situation but. One of my anxiety was and depression was due to my job to. You know when when they use you, you gave it all and you're nothing but just a number, you know. it's just sucks. You did everything for them, you know you would put up parties for them. And then one of us just all of a sudden they're just gonna pull you up in the office they can terminate you because of the school situation you're violating hipaa when I only like talk to a coworker about some text messaging about you know, because when during covert outbreak, we had. We know exactly who's missing at work or just to aware that not to get it from anybody right."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16532.0,Patient,"So it'd be nice as a co worker, if you would just like hey I think I might have exposed you to myself why don't you go ahead and take a test, but I guess it's not like that you know. So I was just having text conversation with one of my colleagues, but my colleague when when and turn her back around from me and just ask management, so why get management involved for just talking as a colleague, you know."
760.0,Provider,So you feel you feel that your confidence was we trade with that one coworker.
16532.0,Patient,"One coworker and. yeah because she's been there for a very long time, of course, some people might think differently. yeah so that's another way and that's when. Like I said I used to do everything from my bosses I used to put a parties, I used to be one of their great employees and I just stopped performing the way I used to."
760.0,Provider,I just and what do you think. What do you think caused you to stop performing what what was the event that made it too hard to.
16532.0,Patient,reject the way.
760.0,Provider,Rejection from from your coworkers because of this whole coven situation and. Yes.
16532.0,Patient,"Okay, that hipaa thing which I believe I did not violating any hipaa laws, because it was just a conversation between me and my coworker. I just don't know why she had to ask my boss or do I have to tell anybody about quite expose myself to, and then they asked who did you ask oh it's Christian. Of course, you know that's when my name come out they had to talk to me and stuff and they were saying you know you're very big nipple right, so you can get terminated for this, or you get sued for that and i'm like you know it's between me and my coworker. Of course they're not going to mention the person, it could have been nice if they brought up the same person who actually talked to them confidentially. Give him the right to actually you know have talked to me face to face that you were offended by what I said, or you know that's something text message between me and my coworker."
760.0,Provider,"Christian how how, how do you think you would do going back to work because you've described, you know difficulty with. The Depression and anxiety and also the chronic pain, do you think it's possible at this point for you to go back to work, is that a full time job that you had at the airport."
16532.0,Patient,"it's a full time job I sit for several hours and to get to my to get to my job. If the one and only elevator. actually works, then I can get up there physically. But then. The elevators mostly down, then I have to get up to like 10 flights of. floors which, as you get the fifth floor you."
760.0,Provider,Probably can't go up steps.
16532.0,Patient,"yeah too much is too much and even at the parking lot you know parking lot to get to the bus. it's I just can't walk to phone. Just can't be physically i'm not and then mentally dealing with all the stress when cancellation happens. Is because sometimes we have bosses, that is, relies on you to do everything, even if you're short, you know staff. mm hmm I get to overwhelm I used to be a good manager, you know, like handle like the gates. And then you know when things are delayed and stuff like. You just have to think of another how you're going to create another game, you know."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16532.0,Patient,"But you know some other people are pressuring you're like oh what's happening with my game of law, you know. Okay, or maybe a turn coordinator that's when we call delays, what happens to like the in arrival or the departure flight, you have to watch the full like like you know baby said. or traffic to. handle calls like I said I need to be able to be a multitasker again which mentally i'm not prepared."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I just question a bit even physically would be overwhelming to be up that much just due to the just the physical pain I don't know that's why i'm asking, so we can we can work on i'd like to work with you on. Some mindfulness things being in the present moment. Some do some exercises exercises if that's something that you think you might like to try. That would be a way to kind of get a handle on the panic and the anxiety and as well as the depression. Does that sound like something you'd like to work on."
16532.0,Patient,sure.
760.0,Provider,You know okay okay all right. Have you set up your next appointment Christian. For with me you already know how to go about setting up appointments with the virtual clinic.
16532.0,Patient,"Or you asked him to be like a mental health advisor for me, because I have one outside."
760.0,Provider,You do okay.
16532.0,Patient,"I mean, I like how you talk I just don't know how is that going to be, because I have another one outside, because this is before I got referred to my psychiatrist."
760.0,Provider,"I see. Okay. Well you'd have to get that checked out with your insurance is that that I can't speak to. But, should you want to schedule another appointment Christian. With me. contact the virtual clinics and get that setup. Okay, and, but you are attending groups right."
16532.0,Patient,i'm attending groups here.
760.0,Provider,"And how is, you said you went to one."
16532.0,Patient,I went to the one on Monday so there's another one next week and the following Monday yeah.
760.0,Provider,yeah it's every Monday okay okay. All right. Do you have any other questions or anything else.
16532.0,Patient,You think of qualify for a long term disability.
760.0,Provider,That isn't all in me. That would be a big legal question you'd have to apply for that I can't I can't.
16532.0,Patient,"No, no, why because I just received my this long term disability paperwork already arrived in with what I discussed with the company because that's one of my benefits on the first financially i'm struggling to. yeah i'm."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I would just advise when you get that paperwork when you get that packet that you break it down try to be in the moment with doing one task at a time, not, I think people get really anxious to get this concept of multitasking and sometimes that multitasking is what causes us to. feel it kind of feeds the anxiety and it builds mindfulness is a process of being in the present moment Now you can you know you can certainly make it a list of. tasks that you want to create, but when you're doing the task try to be in the moment and do things one thing at a time whether it's the laundry whether it's a certain paperwork for your disability, whether it's making a phone call to your. Insurance or your doctor, for your for your to treat your chronic pain. take things one thing at a time. Okay, and kind of break it down because, otherwise, that in society, depression, it just spins. And we can only really do things in the moment. So."
16532.0,Patient,"that's what I try to do that's why I can do little things. yeah just like not i'm just getting a little bit overwhelmed. Okay, feel like it's attacking me again okay."
760.0,Provider,"Remember to breathe a deep breaths break things down one thing at a time. and be gentle on yourself, because you know you've got this a lot of stress and it's a lot of emotional stress it's a lot of emotional things that you've described that are hard and when emotions get tangled up. it's hard to focus because emotions have a tendency to be kind of like irrational sometimes and and you know it's it's not the same as directing traffic in the airport."
16532.0,Patient,yep i'm sorry.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you want to set up another appointment with me reach out to your care navigator or the virtual clinic and set up another appointment. But I would recommend you call your insurance and find out about that part the financial part of that."
16532.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Okay asked him if anything, because the group one doesn't cost me anything because there. Was I can do insurance so."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16532.0,Patient,"Or maybe I can probably reconnect back sometime in January because I told my other insurance, you know if. I can't afford her to pay every you know every The co payments, because I didn't qualify now that i'm out on a medical leave they didn't give me a spending account. um last time I have a spending account, I have a few thousand dollars so right now, you know if i'm going to have to go through like them. I told her I might have to use my secondary insurance on you, because I can't afford a $25 copay fee every time, but what if this works out, then I might have to like. You know."
