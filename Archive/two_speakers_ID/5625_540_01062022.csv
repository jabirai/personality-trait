540.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so I guess maybe it would be better anyways to do."

My addictions also so different from like you know, like somebody that uses to get high that it's like i've never been able to relate to that, but it's also those just like common sense that doesn't exist so. annoying."
540.0,Provider,"I understand them, because I mean we've talked about it before, so it is somewhat different for you and how you got into this, and I mean you used everything that was prescribed to you, you never abused it so it's not person yeah. I mean, and you have to also deal with on a daily basis with work and just that stressful mentality of the."
5625.0,Patient,"yeah I mean where it's yeah work is work. i'm able to like compartmentalize that out like none of that bothers me because i'm at work and i'm getting paid to not be bothered by it. But I still like. I mean, I have so much addiction in my family that it's like that's where I deal with it on a personal level. And it is."

5625.0,Patient,"Ever find I mean it was it was fine wasn't too bad. it's just the same thing, every time, like the family's pretty good my brother in law like you just can't function on like a. Normal realm it can't even be like Nice or respectful about like getting gifts. So that's just it. I think it's just."
540.0,Provider,Her how she been acting since.
5625.0,Patient,"I mean she's you know she's. A broken human. and I know she you know she does nothing to better herself and that's like I mean it's. I don't know like I haven't lost a baby, I mean I like I had to lose a pregnancy, that was hard, but like. I didn't lose like a kid that was two months old. But I feel like at some point it's like you still have a kid like that's here and it's a miracle baby so like get your shit together and figure life out for that kid. it's kind of embarrassing and I appreciate what she. Has yeah. yep when you focus too much on the it's like she wants to have a talk with my nice about the. shoe and have a talk with my niece about the baby that you know that she just had to terminate and it's like I don't understand why you need to put that pressure on a six year old. And she's like well for me, I need closure and i'm like that's true both selfish thing i've ever fucking heard. it's just."
540.0,Provider,"asked her to be like well, what is your. What what have you like asked her to be like what does your daughter need, though, like."
5625.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah but she just she's like why I think it's important like she asked why I was sick all the time and i'm like Teller you have fucking Kovac like. I just thought she said she's not even gonna remember this shit like she's not gonna remember that her mom was puking every morning that's ridiculous. Oh, my God it's just like she's creating trauma for this kid this kid to resell fucked up when she's older she's gonna be like me and the bums me out."
540.0,Provider,And do I mean do you got any time with your nice alone.
5625.0,Patient,"yeah okay. yeah I talked to her. Like we might my dad to like we both talked to her we both asked questions in a way that like opens the floor up to her like like so. What did you do this morning and she'll kind of it's always the same of like well like dad mom slept in and then. He got mad at mom because he had to make breakfast then he took like a two hour long shower it's always like this chaotic storyline that then we can go like okay well how do you feel about that. I mean she's just she loves her parents so much that she looks at it, as it's like oh that's just mom and dad yeah just know and it's sad it's just yeah. it's just so sad, they are they're very selfish parents, the two of them like they don't set up playdates for their kids their idea of like. Her like her going out or her doing things it's like making her go on a hike to forge mushrooms with them and then like if they do go out at all. it's to like their friends party somewhere where everybody's drinking a lot and like that I grew up like that and that's fine but it's like you know, like set up a playdate she's six she has friends that live in the neighborhood it doesn't mean you know it's like I just."
540.0,Provider,And how much time does she get to have with you.
5625.0,Patient,"Well, it used to be darn covert it was a lot, but now it's like not as much she's in school now like real school. So I only see her like twice a month now. But when I do see her like. my sister my brother in law are always always bitching or how they can't control her she's like she's such an out of control kids and listen and i'm like I don't know what kid you're talking about like. If she's with any of her answer, or gloves or my parents like this case she's so well behaved she doesn't ever step out of line, like every now and then she'll do weird like six year old stuff you know, like I caught her. stupid thing I caught her like shoving her, but my dog's face and i'm like what do you think they're like can't do that but that's like normal six year old stuff you know they do. Really weird. But like. She and then I caught it. I caught her like she she put her hand on her pants like down the backs I repent and. chef to her finger in the other dog's face like. What is up with you in the butt. So weird. But that's like normal stuff for kids do. weird stuff so you can't even be mad at. me. But it's like even that if I go like Fred you can't be doing that it's like my sister will go like. They mean she's just having fun like that's. kind of weird problem teacher, not to do that."
540.0,Provider,Did you ever sleep over your House.
5625.0,Patient,"yeah. house yeah she loves getting out like she loves going to my my parents house she loves going to her other aunt and uncle's like there's six kids on my brother in law side. And so, like she spends a lot of time with them it's just. I don't it just that. my sister used to be such a good parent and then it's like she let my other niece passing just like. Destroy her."
540.0,Provider,So that's when it change was.
5625.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it started changing. A little bit before that, like she. her and her husband they started getting weird prior to that. But. It really went downhill, which I understand, like my sister went through such a severe depression that it like she dropped like. Probably 35 pounds, like her skin was like eating away at itself, she was losing her hair like she went through it was really bad. so bad, but. Like my brother in law, he just been a piece of shit since like two years prior to since really since frail was born he's just he never wanted kids he's he has a God complex the guys have fun. Just just the worst. The only way to describe it is like he is the worker he's never really worked. He doesn't have responsibility is just shot individual. And my sister just placating she. leans into it and. it's not talking to her anymore."
540.0,Provider,"Do you I mean I know you said that she did a somewhat not too much counseling like after the incident, but she opened eventually going back."
5625.0,Patient,"I know she says she's going about like she said she's doing it, but. I don't believe that like. I know everybody's like therapy is different, but it's like if you're really in therapy like eventually you start to show minor changes, even in the way that you like interact with. Like your siblings or your parents it's like you pick up tools and how to deal with things in therapy you think you'd start to see her using that but you know she's just. The worse. I mean, she seems happier now than before, but like it's all. I, like everybody else, like all my brother in law siblings and because it's a whole so like my brother in law's younger sister and I. we've been best friends, since we were seven and then my my sister and mark met through us so they've been together since high school like it's just. Our families have been really close since we were kids so like i'm really close to his siblings which isn't that common, but when I talked to them about it, they off, but they all feel the same way. That it's like. You know it's just this like he's kind of a lost hope but they'll go like well Anna seems like she's happier now and i'm like yeah but don't you look at it like it's so fake it doesn't look real it looks like. it's like if she's talking about plants or mushrooms she's like kind of happy. But I feel like she looks fucking miserable. Even when she's smiling she looks miserable."
540.0,Provider,"And I know that, like they have like different like retreats for people to go on. yeah loss their child."
5625.0,Patient,Like yeah.
540.0,Provider,She thought about like that.
5625.0,Patient,"i've brought that up so many times, because my mom is willing to help. And like she's willing to pay for all this stuff. It used to be like I don't know, maybe, and now it's turned into like I can't meet for for that long but what's dumb is like they'll go drop Frey off at my sister in law's house for like a week and a half and get nothing done while their kid is gone it's just incredible they. I could talk about this for like 20 hours straight just the ridiculous shit that they do, but it's just not going to change this like no point in talking about it."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I think the important thing is the role that just you haven't for his life can be at her home, but you can just give her that stability, because usually it just takes at least one person solid structured stable person and a kid's life and sometimes it's not the parents."
5625.0,Patient,"I want them. Well, my for me mine was my step parents, like my parents didn't really enjoy me when I was a kid so they made that note, but like. The thing like freya. I think part of why she's so well behaved all of our houses like she has this like beautiful blonde curly hair. my sister doesn't make her brushes she's that parent where it's like okay like stand here and we'll brush your hair really quick it's going to hurt a little bit, but you'll be fine but she's like I don't think she wants to keep doing it like who the Fuck what like. cool so you're just going to let your kid be a pussy first of all, and you're going to let her have like she has like. Like the dreadlocks forming in the back, like to the point where it's hurting her neck it's like that matted. And I feel like that's a little bit child abuse right there but that's like such a minor thing, but like when she comes to stay at my house or like grammy and POPs his house, the first thing she'll go like so do you want to brush my hair and she's like yeah yeah, why not it's just it's. It blows my mind that it's like how is she so out of control at your House, but if she comes to our House, she takes her shoes off when she sits on couch she says, please, and thank you like. The kid does not step out of line unless she's doing some weird thing that's just normal for a child to experiment like."
540.0,Provider,"What kinda reminds me of something I read. A few weeks ago it was like this video, and it was talking about like kids and if children are somewhat like trying to just like get your attention and like they'll do get get on instead of punishing them give them what they need, which is attention."
5625.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's what's happening at their house when they say it's all right, like anytime they have to be somewhere it's hours later, like they will be 40 minutes late even it's like three hours late. And it's always like oh freya was out of control and we couldn't get her dress she wouldn't put clothes on and it's like you do understand like you're the parent but also like. I think she this kid just wants to be a kid with her parents so bad and they're like. don't be a kid be our little minion that we bring it around it's like she's almost like a purse like she's an accessory to them."
540.0,Provider,"which I mean the older she gets she's going to start seeing some of this too, I mean she was six so honestly she's gonna."
5625.0,Patient,"Be already. yeah it's just that's why I think it's the everybody in our family thinks it's a horrible idea to tell this kid like, by the way you had a another baby sibling that's dead now. which also is like the baby yeah it's fucking horrible but like you're four months pregnant it's not. Like they wouldn't fucking. They wouldn't legally terminate the baby if it was a like fully formed human they wouldn't do that so like. I know that's like a really harsh way to look at it and that goes against a lot of people's views, but for me i'm like if you can legally get a termination that baby is not officially like fully formed doesn't ever. Thinking conscience doesn't have a soul it's something that like we are attached to and yeah it's horrible and said I went through a horrible termination of a pregnancy and it was really is a bummer, but I also looked at it pragmatically it's like well at least they weren't born yet. I mean it, but like stop holding that like. She is willing to die on hill to be depressed and sorrowful and it's like. glitter ruin her."
540.0,Provider,"frustration that you have to because that happened to her and then knowing the odds of it happening again, she did it again, and then I, you said that she's going to try potentially again right."
5625.0,Patient,"Probably and it's not it like it's also the fact that, like your marriage is such a shit show like it is such a fucking problem yet you're gonna go and like keep. Having sex with this man that you have so many issues with like what you're risking your family I just it's like figure shit out before you guys have unprotected sex with Nicholas. Most irresponsible thing ever. And, as I asked her know that she's like going like through."
540.0,Provider,Her stuff is there any way that you can like talk to her about any of this like.
5625.0,Patient,"Oh yeah she came over the other day and I asked her I said, like what like. What are you going to do from here like what is the plan in life. And she's like Well, no, she know just said to me, she goes well, I think if we like clear out the storage shed and get. All the storage that my brother mark keeps a garage full of junk at this woman's house this woman is like. she's the woman of the town that collects like the lost souls, like the little boy lost souls, and my brother in law like I swear to God, they have to be fucking like. It just doesn't make sense it's the weirdest situation he spends all his fucking time over there she's like this folder weaker it's so gross but. Either way, when she's like we just have to clear out storage is and then we'll be great i'm like are you. Just the dumbest shit have ever heard come out of somebody's mouth like. Your problem isn't too much shit your problem is your marriage is a fuckin sham like they're so codependent at this point that she's willing to look past. Everything so."
540.0,Provider,"Just after her, though, about the marriage."
5625.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah we've all told her like this is just not working out it's not going to work out. She don't she doesn't want to hear it, and then she'll go well things like change because of what happened and me getting pregnant and i'm like no they didn't, though, like plenty of people get pregnant right before they get divorced, you know what they still get divorce, because, like. I just it's like we come from a very successful divorce. Like she doesn't view it that way, but i'm like big buck our parents got divorced like they got divorced, when I was six months old So for me it's they were not a thing. And the few memories, I have of them together were like very violent so it's like Why would you ever want to keep doing them front of your kid. it's just like. Any she's the dumbest person, she was so she used to be so smart she's so dumb know it's like talking to a wall she's just she's like dumber than a bag of hammers know. Socially."
540.0,Provider,And I mean you talk to your parents.
5625.0,Patient,"Right oh yeah this is good it's gotten, to the point where like this is all we talk about there's nothing it's so frustrating to all of us that this is like our main topic of conversation, which is a bummer for all of us, because it's like. sweet now our whole reality just stems around these two fucking losers and if they didn't have a kid like. Say Alavi it would have been done in God, a long time ago, but. Like friend needs to have. Stable people to look up to and that's unfortunately her grandma and grandpa and her in and like. I you know it's sad but I do think that's why she thrives in that environment she's a she's an insanely smart kid super smart, but she is living in chaos."
540.0,Provider,"Which she's resilient so she's. that's The thing is, she has. She has the grandparents and hopefully at some point when your sister gets out of this cloud, and I mean that's hopefully if she allows herself to."
5625.0,Patient,But leaving guys.
540.0,Provider,"You know, think so."
5625.0,Patient,"No she's she's just she's always been like a selfish prima Donna always our whole life. But now it's got it she's just. she's like I don't even know how to describe it. she's so fucking high and mighty about her stances and beliefs in life but it's like. I can't even like fucking take care of your own kit like I bought their kids Christmas presents and put from Santa because. Like you couldn't even afford to get your fucking kid Christmas gifts what, how do you go from making $130,000 a year to living in a shithole without a fucking theater when it's 42 degrees outside like. I didn't it's like child neglect that's what blows my mind is like I feel like somebody will get the kids take it away for the shit."
540.0,Provider,"Have you ever asked her sister if maybe like I know I don't know if you guys can do it, but maybe if you guys like held on to freya for a little bit until they could figure out their."
5625.0,Patient,"stuff Oh, she would never. She is so codependent. On that kid and her husband like it's just. it's just says she is just using she use she's using my niece to make herself feel better. Such a sad thing. But i've told her like. You know if you leave your husband like you have we've all told her my mom and my dad my dad he brandon like we've all told her if you separate like you can come and live with us, we have a room for them at each one of the houses. But it's like she's like oh no i'll keep the apartment if anything it's like you're super missing the point. You guys need to be in a stable environment. yeah, this is the issue is, we all get so worked up talking about it but it's nothing in our control. there's nothing we can do about it."
540.0,Provider,I mean really the only thing you guys can do at this point in time is just being there for potential collateral damage.
5625.0,Patient,"well. What a sad way. to live like it's just shed. One day they'll get it, I guess."
540.0,Provider,And then they don't then there has to be some type of. Time that your sister. has to see what's best for her daughter.
5625.0,Patient,"yeah you think, but then you look at, like so many people that. it's like they just. never change. They live their life as like what's best for them all the time and not like Oh, maybe my kid should do this not enough people look at it, as like. yeah you love your kids so much, but like let your kid go to give them a chance at some kind of normal seed, even if it's just for like a month or six months or a year, sometimes people need that. This kid is going to need it she's just. She is on the break."
540.0,Provider,You froze sorry okay.
5625.0,Patient,And you said I know i'm just not talking I just stopped talking.
540.0,Provider,"But you're doing as much as you can Sarah but it's I think that it's going to be somewhat even like debilitating for you guys, because you can't do anything about it. Other than mean either for that collateral damage, and I think it's more frustrating for you, because you also know what it feels like and in a sense, to be freya."
5625.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And you want to be able to protect that for her, because unfortunately her mom's not protecting her on that."
5625.0,Patient,"yeah. But she like my sister never went through stuff like that, so I think for her it's like it's so easy to look the other way and just be like whatever like yeah things are hard but they're not that bad, but it's like they really are. Pretty sad when you can't turn your heater on in your fucking house. kids."
540.0,Provider,What is their sister does she work right now.
5625.0,Patient,"I know. She was the accountant for rockstar energy drink never heard of that. She was like accounts receivable in the accountant for rock star for 15 years. And then they fired her because she was gone because her baby was dying and she also handled that fucking poorly and then also didn't Sue them after she like snapped out of the immediate cloud of like you lost your baby but either way like. She. got fired because her baby died, which is that sounds horrible but that's like actually why she got fired it's pretty gross so tough company. But then she just was out of work, living on her savings and also they lived on the money that we raised for sequoia when she was sick. which was supposed to go pay hospital bills, but it then and then. She just stayed out of work. Her husband doesn't work coven happen, they lived on unemployment during coven he's still on it, which blows my fucking mind but. Now she started gardening which my parents like it's amazing that she's doing something she loves and i'm like that's cool she's a landscaper for her parents like. that's not a real job you guys are paying her because you feel bad for her so not a job and then she started working in apothecary like this little tiny shop in town that is going to be there for like two years, maybe before it closes. Really. she's dying it's like she's digressing to a high score like she just she had a great job and could still go get another job like that, and she is choosing to act like a fucking 15 year old. Okay i'm just. A dog gets concerned when i'm yelling."
540.0,Provider,"Is there anything new happening for you, though, I mean plans for the two of you."
5625.0,Patient,"Know listen. I have to go get up to my dad got me this apple watch for Christmas and it's like. He got the newest disease so damn big it's like wearing like a phone on your wrist it's just huge. But it also like I wore one time under my sleeve, and it got a scratch on it, which I feel like has to be a defect because that's crazy if they're going to scratch that easy, why would anybody buy that so I gotta go try to return it and be like Fuck you guys give me a new one. Which for apple they'll probably be like no. But that's it, I think, maybe we'll try to go to Disneyland in March, because they're doing a villains night, for the first time that's cool, which is like my jam live live villains. I think we're going to try to do that if, like the coven laws and super it's getting psychotic on in California again, especially northern just. We have a new rule at work that unless you're clocked in you are not allowed to hang out at the restaurant, which is. The stupidest thing I think i've ever heard. If we all work together. We like why can't they sit down and drink after work if we all are working together for eight hours that what is the difference in. them."
540.0,Provider,So with you guys can people not like come out to eat if they're not vaccinated.
5625.0,Patient,Know that's what's so dumb is we don't ask for proof of vaccine. In like the county i'm in we don't have to ask like we can't ask for that so it's like. Well cool but we can't like we should be if we're banning our employees. are hanging you know. yeah they were.
540.0,Provider,Well i'm sure that they don't want customers.
5625.0,Patient,"Will that's how dumb they are is they don't understand that, like our customers are they hang out with our employees that any restaurant works, the customers go where the employees are. They come to the bar to hang out with us so if the regulars want to hang out the servers and the servers are allowed to sit at the bar after work they're going to go to a different bar, so it is destroying our late late business in that is. Just. it's yeah."
540.0,Provider,Oh how's I. manager.
5625.0,Patient,"she's so she's just awful just awful. yeah she's but I got I got to this point, where I was like. Because they put a lot of pressure on me to like manage these kids and make sure that things are going well. And I was finally like you know we're gonna we're word you and make you pay her to do that so she can come and be here at night, if these kids need managing like i'm not trying to be the bad guy and not get paid for it. i'm basically like I have a manager title. Just because, like they all know nothing about a bar so they needed to give me that tile to they like to make the bar work, but other than that it's like they don't want to listen, they don't actually want to listen to my experience and. it's day, just like. Before we had a different manager before coven and she got it like she understood like you lean on people if they have a strong suit so she would lean on me to like. run the bar with her this chick it's like she throws hissy fits it like i'm bringing back one of my old coworkers who's like the greatest employee ever he's like he's just. He is the fucking greatest it's just incredible is such an asset to any business. And it's like we're good friends like good friends, we work together for two years we're good friends, so of course i'm talking to him about coming back to work, and she threw a hissy fit like well, I think I should be the one talking to new employees and i'm like. What like that's what you're worried about is me talking to somebody i've already worked in this actual business with like he's, not even a new employee he worked here before I. took over."
540.0,Provider,These new sub she's younger right.
5625.0,Patient,"No she's like almost 40. Years older she has two kids. She wants to be younger that's for sure. she's just she has like a 15 year old and a four year old guess he's like five or six now. I don't know she's just. she's like my sister. man. But i'm so good at just like. Like can you do you, you want to do that go ahead now all. i'll let anybody think that they are better smarter stronger I don't care I don't want to be number one and I don't need to be number one yeah."
540.0,Provider,Which made you a good manager.
5625.0,Patient,"I get yeah it's it's so funny because, like all these kids I call it my kids because they're all like 21 like i'm a decade older than them so joke around and calling them my kids. But it's like they all. They all like love working with me prefer working with me and like there was a situation that happened when. Like the manager, she was mad at me for something like a personal issue, she was mad at me and so she. Like went and got one of the one of the guys that works there, who was like trying to bang her. They like banded together and went to the owners and made up all these lies that, like the employees are scared to work with me and i'm so mean, and so I had to have this meeting with them. And i'm like did you."
540.0,Provider,have now.
5625.0,Patient,They were.
540.0,Provider,"that's the manager, you have now."
5625.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Oh yeah she's. Real petty real petty real overture I mean she could have just like talk to me separately and been like hey. I didn't like that you said that to me, and I would have been like I don't give a Fuck because i'm not gonna lie to your face i'm going to tell you, if you're wrong, but instead of being an adult about it, she was like i'm going to try to get her fired. you're so cute because I make so much money for this place yet can. But I still had to sit down and an hour long meeting with them telling me what a piece of shit I am and how everybody scared to work with me and I was like you know what. How about you go ask every one of your employees who they prefer to work with and then come and have this talk with me. And then they never brought it up again. yeah okay hi. So that's my life, surrounded by stupidity."
540.0,Provider,"OK, I can hear you now was laughing you son."
5625.0,Patient,"Oh, I said that's my life i'm just surrounded by stupidity."
540.0,Provider,Because you're smart. So I think it's not even being smart it's just having common sense it's like that's.
5625.0,Patient,"Common sense and not having to be better they I think that's a big problem with like. The generations now is like they're being taught on like I don't go on social media I don't like it, I think it's like a really negative space. i'll go on instagram like once a week and look at animal videos cuz that's probably the greatest invention ever. If they just made it like funny animal videos That would be a great platform yeah but no it's like nasty and conniving and it's just so I don't got it, but I feel like all these. All these people I work with now like that's what they do is they sit on social media and they are being told, like your number one everybody is below you, you have the right to do whatever you want in life, nobody can say no to you and it's creating this like. Like sociopathic environment it's very scary."
540.0,Provider,yeah it's definitely a me me me.
5625.0,Patient,situation I guess.
540.0,Provider,Media is just kind of like me centered.
5625.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Less community and a lot of it it's it's so much filtered information that you're getting too so it's it's always going to be whatever someone wants to show yeah of their opinion versus the actual whole truth, so it's."
5625.0,Patient,"it's definitely it's just gross it's gross that humanity is so dumb I mean they've always been this dumb like they did it with magazines, they did it with like the penny dreadfuls back in the day, you know it's always been like this it's always something that's convincing humans. yeah that something's happening that's not, but I think now it's such instant gratification such like instantaneous visual propaganda that for. Basic humanity like they're not educated enough to. Put it aside. Just real dumb."
540.0,Provider,"And there's I mean there's. A little too much information that's just readily accessible to our fingertips, and a lot of that. Yes, awesome skewed."
5625.0,Patient,Oh yeah like 90% of it.
540.0,Provider,Oh absolutely.
5625.0,Patient,But not animal video.

540.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness, so do you want to schedule out so we're looking at April."
5625.0,Patient,"Okay yeah and I think I think Monday might actually be a better day because I forgot like I have Thursdays off, but I still have to work. I still have to do, like all the ordering. So I was like trying to rush through it to get it done before we talk."
540.0,Provider,But this time now just on a Monday.
5625.0,Patient,yeah I think that works better.
540.0,Provider,"All right, you want to do, Monday, the fourth of April 1pm."
5625.0,Patient,"yeah that's fine. i'm trying to figure I last. Monday April 4 i'll just writing on post it. I just I guess I didn't put up the new calendar. Okay, so Monday April fourth. I also have like from our new the new doctor I don't really know like if it's her the pharmacy but they still haven't. Like filled my prescription which is, I still have it like from the old prescription but. i'm going to call them today to find out what's going on, but do I have to call who do I call back if I have to like get it recent."
540.0,Provider,"The virtual clinic and they can connect you with the I think the rx team, and they should be able to handle it."
5625.0,Patient,Okay. April 4 1pm right. Okay.
540.0,Provider,Yes.
5625.0,Patient,I do.
540.0,Provider,"Oh sorry, what do you do."
5625.0,Patient,No good.
540.0,Provider,"definitely try to do it sooner than later, even if you have like a good amount of medicine from your last script just try to do it sooner than later, so you know that it's not going to come or be an issue. Especially that you're gonna have longer scripts to."
5625.0,Patient,"Okay. yeah i'd ever since the longer scripts it's been kind of like it takes like way long it's weird I don't know. Maybe I yeah I guess I guess that's it and then also the. I never like when I was in group last time I never went over when I should go back to group, like I forgot to get a timeline on that. So it's two months right. Yes."
540.0,Provider,"Two months and then that's when you're going to be changing to three, so I mean I can try to see when the last."
5625.0,Patient,"June, it was December 22. right before we got this drummer 22nd is the last time I had group, so it would be February 22."
540.0,Provider,So it says that you're due march 16.
5625.0,Patient,works. How does that make sense. Right. Unless it's too much. I think you're frozen okay.
540.0,Provider,I think i'm.
5625.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
540.0,Provider,"All right, um I don't know how that so just try to calculate when you're hold on I should do so that's what it says you're supposed to be do, but maybe."
5625.0,Patient,"I wonder if, maybe like she filled it for a little bit longer. Maybe I wonder if that's why it's there's a whole to."
540.0,Provider,"be a potential. Because you are here on the 22nd of December so. yeah cuz that would be three so that would be three weeks in three months so unless Maybe she already did quarterly for you. Okay, potentially."
5625.0,Patient,"I think. they're I think Maybe she might so. I had that issue again last month, where they were like they said I was missing appointments and I had to call them to be like no i'm only on like every other month. So out, you know, hoping they don't do that again, but I might have to have her call them like remember when Dr Gala had to do that."
540.0,Provider,"yeah so she may have to call them, I know that I I don't know if the pharmacies have been having like an issue with the change of provider, because I think that there's a few people in group that have been having some issues."
5625.0,Patient,"Oh, they have a new provider like. A new provider."
540.0,Provider,"But we do, because I used to be Dr O Gala and. Oh yeah I don't know if that like whole transition has been difficult for the pharmacy. yeah but."
5625.0,Patient,"I don't know. When they I Dr Gallagher wasn't the first doctor I had, and there was no issue one yeah when the I don't even know the first woman's name I only had her for like two weeks before she left."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I think I know that there's 11 having issues in our group, so it could just be I yeah I would just call them so call your pharmacy if they can't figure it out call the virtual clinic and they should be able to."
5625.0,Patient,Okay cool.
540.0,Provider,"All right, well i'll See you in a few months."
