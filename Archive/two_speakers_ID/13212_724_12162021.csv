13212.0,Patient,Thank you.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean I kind of use you as like as like a metric for like a lot of people when they talk about trying to get off of it and really got to know to expect and i'm like well. You know there's definitely resources out there, you know i'm sure you probably. You know, you might know somebody in treatment that's done in the past and now they're back, and you can kind of pick their brain, but they got like the. You know blogs and reddit posts all kinds of stuff that the information is out there, so you can kind of get like an idea what to expect. But what I tell people you I was like I was like this kid came in. You know, he was here for like 60 days and then decided that anymore, the taper down and within 45 days he's pretty much done it now he's pretty much done with it, and I was like, and you know at the worst case scenario, he had it was like. You know stomach issues, for you know, a couple of weeks, but after that it was pretty manageable and I was thinking so far has been like really, really good so. I was like anybody really could, if you have like the right mindset, you can get it done you can't be scared of the unknown that's what anxiety is it's like you just gotta like you know. You know jump sometimes to just get into it and you know play around see everybody's going to react so people like Oh, really. yeah I was a kid but he's still like in treatment, I was like we still talk so you know that's one part of it, you know the medication is always always just been one part. of you know, getting right and getting on, like the the path to recovery or whatever you want to call it, but like. The medication just handles the physical stuff like that the hard stuff is like this, you know and then changing behaviors changing your thought patterns. I was going to it helps us stay like in some kind of treatment for some accountability and just to be able to check in you know that way you don't forget like what you've gone through."
13212.0,Patient,"The mental game is definitely insane like this is like my third like actual time like getting sober but the first time was like seven days or something and then the second time was like nine days like. I made it through like the worst parts of it, just like cold Turkey gang but then it was like oh Fuck here we go again. yeah I remember that second time was like right as I got the job at the gas station and. I had slept through my interview is what it was, and then I just was like Fuck but like he was okay with me coming back for like like an interview, the next day, but like I was like stress and so hard about it, like I just went right out and there goes my nine day is. But um yeah so no it's good it's i'm super glad i've made it this long and I don't plan and I don't have any cravings so yeah."

I don't know about you mean like like for me when I get the blind man or I was like I was expecting scary like hill House because he'll house was scary. scary as hell, and I was waiting for that, and never really got to that point, after a few episodes and I realized what the what that season was going to be and I was like oh okay all right now i'm on board. You know, it was like a topic love story, and I was like okay now i'm on board, I like it. And then, and then midnight mass like, for whatever reason, I think, got to like the second episode, I was like I feel like this is a vampire story like I. was like I feel like this is going to be a vampire stories and then like as it. play it out, I was like that's an interesting way of doing it, I was like I can dig it yeah I like it a lot."

Good yeah I mean you know the past 90 days you've had major changes, you know physically mentally environment like environmentally you made like a lot of positive changes, socially, like all that stuff so. you're doing all the right stuff all the right moves keep your head about us, you know, like the only thing that I get concerned about with. With people is like things are going really good like don't get complacent, you know what I mean like like hold yourself to a certain level of expectations and just be ready at all times, you know what I mean yeah. But other than that, like it's solid like. yeah remarkable progress. If you look at where you were like six months ago you'd be like you know what the hell and now here you are it's like a totally different person, and this is like the part of treatment that I like. You know, getting to know patience is because this is probably who you really are not like the Shell of a person that I first be you know what I mean. yeah, so this is like that, like the cool part of like like this gig is like seeing like people like genuine. genuine change their life and they better for like i've only had like. You know if I had to count on like two hands like success stories, you know what I mean like they're far more on successful stories that i've had in the ones that are you can just kind of tell like you're like alright cool man. Like you're going to be okay you're gonna make it so it's good yeah I see that with you."
13212.0,Patient,You know yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But don't get arrogant, you know there's a fine line between being confident arrogant you've got to tow that line, a little bit, but. They are very similar very similar so just just be careful don't get too caught up with with the chick shit you know what I mean like it's important that she knows exactly what your boundaries are. And if she respects that that you solid you know what I mean so that that's a good check if she's like on board with you know what's what's best for you to keep you around to keep you in the state that that's a solid chick but treat her right."
13212.0,Patient,I will.
724.0,Provider,All right. Any upcoming appointments doctors appointments medical issues concerns.
13212.0,Patient,I can't say i've been to the doctor or the dentist or like anything like that years like literal years like maybe. Like since I was like 17 or something like that.
724.0,Provider,So you know even the dentist. But even in primary care and dental referrals.
13212.0,Patient,"So i'm getting medical and dental insurance coming up in a so after two months of working out of this place so once I get like that I might check out a dentist The thing is, my teeth that like in the past, like i'm really good about brushing my teeth and flossing nowadays, but. I don't know i'd say when I was younger like I could totally tell when i'd have like a cavity or something and it's like also like sensitivity to like drinks and like just like certain spots all hit when brushing but that doesn't happen anymore so. I think my breath smells good too so."
724.0,Provider,"Well, I mean if you're going to have dental insurance and you're gonna pay for the student, you might as well take advantage of it at least go get checkups wouldn't hurt they're gonna be like yeah your mouth is. Good to go where it's like you got a handful of cavities and then we'll cover it and you'll just go in it's you know what I mean if anything gets you know cavities are pretty easily banished nowadays so. yeah if you know if you're going to pay for the insurance and what it will use it it's like one of those things. Totally okay so you're going to come off your your parent's insurance once you get your own."
13212.0,Patient,"I guess that's the plan I don't really know exactly how that works, but since I do have it offered to me i'm going to take it and I don't know if, like that automatically strips me of my parent's insurance or if, like I have both or what the deal is."
724.0,Provider,"i'm not sure all. i'm not 100% sure on. My initial thought would be yeah you get pulled from the other one because, like the insurance companies and really it's like double dipping. rubbed out entirely sure I would definitely have your your parents follow up with their human resources or whoever they deal with for their enrollment and then find out if that's the case. it'll eventually save that money if you come off of it right."
13212.0,Patient,Totally.
724.0,Provider,"So that'll be cool. All right, well that's good. After that yeah well i'll work on getting you like, like a primary care referral, you know what I mean like i'll find out like what your insurances and. provide you with like a list of you know PCP people around the local area and. you'll have to call and schedule an appointment and all that kind of good stuff but it's really important, you know what I mean like you're still pretty young. But what you want to do is have a medical record that follows you so having primary care. Even if you don't really intend on using it outside of getting like a yearly physical, then you should still do that because they'll do blood work on you and you know check for like your vitals all that kind of stuff and the best the best. He fence for like long term medical issues is like an early offense. You know I mean so having like some early interventions, you know they could tell you, if you're going to be diabetic are going to tell you, if you're. developing high blood pressure, all that kind of stuff and because you're young you could make the adjustments early in it, you know as you progress you'll have like this continuation of this medical record it's called continuity of care so it's important that you have that so."
13212.0,Patient,Totally.
724.0,Provider,You know.
13212.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that sounds good, you can give me some the dude to. Adult thing right there."
724.0,Provider,"A little bit of adult and you're like yeah I got I got my doctor, you know what I mean like stuff like that alright so we'll work on that. It will do the same thing with a dentist you'll probably end up with like delta dental and stuff like that, and it will be able to like fight one local forward to."
13212.0,Patient,cool super.
724.0,Provider,how's the dui stuff are you done with it yet.
13212.0,Patient,"completely done with it and they actually called me while I was at work on Friday, I think it was so I couldn't pick it up and then I called them back. I don't know it was like a couple days ago and i'm like hey like why'd you guys call me like i'm done with this and they're like Oh, you still have a final payment that you didn't pay off and like we gotta like get that scheduled before we can send you the certificate. So I was born so. Exactly, and so I paid it and they're like all right seven to 10 days will send it to the dmv or whatever, and then you can get the restriction removed. And i'm like all right, thank you."
724.0,Provider,So what is it what restriction that we're going to take off the log or.
13212.0,Patient,"restriction 99 which makes it so that restriction 99 means I can drive other cars. So now, I can drive other so what my work was actually telling me about it before I got hired here like a like I assume like i'd be driving or something like that and i'm like hey I have a dui like does that stop me from getting the job and they're like no. That just means you can't drive, one of the trucks, which is what the weeds do and it probably take you a year to get there anyways and they're like you just need the restriction off of your license, and so I assume that's what they mean by that."
724.0,Provider,Now. Are you going to get this dui light like because it's your first time offense did they give you the option of like completing X amount of chores and then having it like wiped off. or running or indoors not at all.
13212.0,Patient,"So when they had court for this actually I was homeless right, and so I went into court and i'm like hey can you just throw me in jail and like not make me do like probation and like. Like whatever you're going to give me and they they said what was it, they were like are you sure you want me to do that and i'm like yeah i'm pretty sure and they're like in the dude was all like. talk with your public defender and he's like the public defender comes up to me and he's like we can get you unsupervised probation for three years and. Like you'll just have to do he's like i'm like I don't know he's like you don't even have a car anyways like you'd like you'll have dui classes, but you don't have to do them immediately. And it's I don't know some other shit this was October 2019 is what it was when I had the is with least when I had court I got arrested June 2019 so. anyways so we go back. The judges all like all right, you get three days in jail and three years unsupervised probation and they're like turn yourself into the jail I go to the jail i'm all like hey. i'm here to turn myself in and I give the dude my stuff comes back out i'm asleep on like outside on the jail, like in the dirt where the trees are. And sheriff comes up to me he's like all right we're gonna put you on workforce, the I got like time served for one day for like the night I spent like the holding cell and. i'm like all right, so you have two days of workforce left or you have two days of workforce i'm like can you just put me in there, like i'm homeless like i'm hungry. And he's like all right, let me go ask and so he walks in and he's i'm like I go back to sleep outside he comes out he's like the jail is full we're not letting any more people in. And i'm like are you serious he's like what you can do is get away. or like something like that and i'm like a les like what's that he's like you got to go back to the Court and like requests that i'm like God damn dude I not want to go walk my ass back to the Court. But I think I know, are you exhausted starving tired it's been a long day it's been a long few months at this point. So i'm like all right i'll take the workforce. I go back to the jail, the next morning the Dudes waiting for me and he's like I have nothing for you to oh no, no, no, so uh so right there on the spot he's like all right i'm going to give you credit for today, it just it's just sleeping out you're like are. You have one day left to go I show up the next morning, I think I either slept in on like the bench in the same city. or I might have been able to catch the bus from the spot, whereas sleeping in the woods that don't actually remember but um anyways I roll up there and he's like I have nothing for you to do signs off on it he's like congratulations. yeah. So I don't know how this story started but um. yeah my DIY stuff is i'm still on unsupervised probation for another year and a half or something like that year, maybe. yeah."
724.0,Provider,"All right. Because I know like when I worked in drug court sometimes like like did pay layout conditions that if you complete X y&z then they wipe it or they knock it down to like a lower chart so it's not hurting your insurance, but if they didn't really offer you that that's."
13212.0,Patient,"So i've actually in my dui class I heard something like that, but this came from like people who had like paid lawyers and like by the sounds of it like good paid lawyers yeah. That was not my case he was a good lawyer I liked him like genuinely but like it was a public defender the girl who got a was able to just like get it completely removed off her record was like a like a site psychiatrist or something like that. Oh yeah and she talked about she's like yeah I got a lawyer, I just have to do. I forgot I forgot exactly what she did but she's like it'll go off on my record and i'm like are you lucky. So."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean that there are options out there for people with money, unfortunately, you know what I mean when they talk about like the legal system being impartial that's not entirely accurate it's a partial if you have like a big checkbook that's for sure."
13212.0,Patient,I heard something like the courts aren't racist or the courts are racist their favorite colors green.
724.0,Provider,"I think that's the reality and like like everything you know when people want to talk about like discrimination like like. there's like a like an underlying discrimination that that exists that everybody just pretends like doesn't isn't around it is it's like the only the only color that matters and politics and the world or anything else the color green. mean, like all these people that are anti whatever has an establishment anti tech anti security and COPs they always have the things that they're anti because they need it like you know lately, the politicians are against border walls, but if you try to go to like. The person's House I got like a SWAT team, and they have high fence. You know, surveillance and stuff like that it's like okay. Okay, all controlled accesses stuff you're like I get. A big game. And they just had like a what's her face she's like the head of like the the Senate, or whatever Nancy Pelosi she's such a casual 81 years old she's like out of her mind right and. She her people in Congress can't get busted for insider trading with stocks, you know what I mean so they they get away with some crazy stuff so she's on a salary of like. What does it say like 120 $5,000 he is what she's worth 120 million dollars and she's been in. Politics, like her whole life it's like, how do you get that much money right and it turns out it's like Oh, because her husband takes out all these. stock options on things right before these bills get side so it's like. You know, Microsoft was up for a big military contract, you know what I mean, and she eventually signed off on it right before she did that he took out like a bunch of stock options on Microsoft. You know the Bill Gates fast they get paid in and he makes like a whole bunch of money, like for. instance like so somebody tried to call her out on a day and a press conference and they're like you think like people in government should have access to the stock market and she's like yeah. Like no shame whatsoever it's a free market and it's like yeah but you guys all have like the inside information like that's that's not fair, like you, are I like. In automating she's like Oh well, like not even no shame at all and, like in her district is like underwater with crime and poverty and she's like. yeah that's how that that's how they operate so yeah the color green that's, the only thing that people care about. For the most part, you know the rest of us in the world are just like God, but just getting by. that's just life. um what else, what else, what else, so the work thing is good so looking for a new place to stay."
13212.0,Patient,"I feel like. I am, but I haven't been actively looking so. um yeah."
724.0,Provider,"I think I think you've got a lot on your plate and you've made a lot of big moves, I think this one thing. it's pretty stable for you right now, so you could probably scale a little bit take it easy you know help out around the House help him out i'm sure they enjoy your company, they are old. Save somebody you know what I mean give yourself a nice little buffer that and then you know, look at it in a couple months, maybe for the."
13212.0,Patient,School after the holidays or something.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know, like that, like there's no rush, you know, the only person that's rushing to get you know get the free to get out is like you like you're just. you're eager to get your own spot, but right now, things are probably pretty good for you, so one less presser you know what I mean so. i'd probably i'd probably take it easy a little bit on that on that front, how you get a girlfriend you don't even she might want to get a place together someday so you know not complicate matters, if you both have leases different areas so. That that does happen."
13212.0,Patient,"Well, I think that's yeah other than that i'm trying to think what's been going on in my life like besides all that i'm just been steady like a word. I come home like I go to bed at like 9pm something like that, like. Responsible yeah wake up at 5am usually kind of just lay in bed until either 530 or six you know shower brush my teeth breakfast matta house. get to work 715 720 clock in at 730. yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Good after so is your work, close to you."
13212.0,Patient,And let's see it's 23 minutes exactly from my house.
724.0,Provider,Of ED pretty standard commute. A House a car running.
13212.0,Patient,"I love my car actually it's it's running great it's like it's nothing fancy but like after having driven like a truck and an SUV having a car like I wish I had this car, like all along, like it's so nice to just like park with ease. ease."
724.0,Provider,It is true.
13212.0,Patient,I started off with my uncle's truck I had that from 15 to. 18 I think it was and like just learning to drive on that thing and like go every morning like going to school and like parking and all my buddies like watching me like Fuck it up. Like. Just scarred from driving anything big again.
724.0,Provider,"yeah people don't know unless they start driving big vehicles like it is a hassle of like the kind of park like. Like on a dime where it's like oh that's fun it's like you can never park up front end like like a big truck it's like I was gonna park way back here, you know I mean it's raining out at socks, you know what I mean like yeah it's it's a hassle. park in a parking garage and college and, like the lanes are like super narrow and I had like a I think it was like a 95 GMC Sierra like long bed single cabinet and just going through the parking garage it's like I gotta go away the top because there's no way to. jab into a parking space, it was a disaster, you know."
13212.0,Patient,2000 GMC Sierra with the long but.
724.0,Provider,yeah there was a 95 who's like this old truck and it was like a five speed was a total nightmare like.
13212.0,Patient,"that's hilarious yeah. I would always get stuck in the mud and stuff too, so my poor buddy's house dude I swear every time it was like two wheel drive right and i'd either be backing out yet, I think it was usually, when I was trying to back out like he had this like muddy driveway. And there's like just like this one part where it gets out and there's this one time it happened. And one of our English or English teacher was his neighbor, and this we have like just rolled up or something this was in the day, not at the night, this time and we got stuck and. Just kicking what up and whatnot it's like a rainy day two we go over to his house and we knock on like Mr more is like like like i'm like my truck is stuck like you have a chain, like any bullets out. And like we're putting like wood planks under it and to like the time he gets over there, like my truck and just gotten out or like oh sorry dude like."
724.0,Provider,here's a teacher teacher.
13212.0,Patient,"yeah like this is us in high school too so like we're all like super stoned or I probably was I don't remember exactly will like if that paints, the picture anyway."
724.0,Provider,Of course. that's where. Well yeah so what it's a camry right you're going to Toyota.
13212.0,Patient,I have a Toyota avalon its base it looks just like a camry.
724.0,Provider,it's their bigger one and.
13212.0,Patient,I don't I don't know exactly it might be a little bit bigger.
724.0,Provider,I think they have a lot it's like it's supposed to be like there it goes like. corolla camry avalon.
13212.0,Patient,Like okay.
724.0,Provider,"The vehicles go. Full size thing, and it really the avalon it's like the equivalent of like the the lexus G, not just the lexus vs model, so you essentially got like a lexus at the avalon is like the high end Toyota car, you know.
