184.0,Patient,Oh yeah I want to go back skirt share to get my ged. Maybe they just haven't. I had looked up some stuff online. And I haven't like put any applications or anything just cuz it everything's going on.
226.0,Provider,"Now so maybe we could put go back to school as a long term goal like something that you could continue to reports. Okay, and. So maybe save by February, March. and have the application filled out."
184.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Was that soon, I mean does that seem doable does that seem realistic."
184.0,Patient,yeah no that's good.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and then in terms of that application would you just need somebody to help me fill it out, or is it easy enough to just you know it's not complicated."
184.0,Patient,i'm pretty sure to do it. I haven't filled it out send one out before so but i'm pretty sure to do it.
226.0,Provider,"Okay that's good so we could put that one that's a long term goal that will you know, continue to work towards. Okay, maybe like a so here's an example, Greece, no examples of short term goals can be taking a medication as prescribed. And it can be making sure that you're attending every group. can be that you meet with me twice a month. It can be that you. You know, maybe add another day to work now Those are just some examples so."
184.0,Patient,"I was trying to look for. Another job, a part time job, so I can have to."
226.0,Provider,"OK OK. OK, and when do you want to start doing that, like what's a realistic time frame to start doing that."
184.0,Patient,"I actually wanted to start once I was able, once my my kids are. don't have to quarantine yeah so. let's. just released soon here."
226.0,Provider,let's say like January ish.
184.0,Patient,yeah and I started getting my blood drawn to I haven't been able to go anywhere.
226.0,Provider,"Okay we'll put down to blood drawn. And we'll put that just for January as well okay. Okay cuz I know with the holidays coming up it gets a little bit hectic it gets crazy. Are you are the holidays stressful for you, or are they okay."
184.0,Patient,i'm. Summer good I guess it's Christmas that's stressful.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
184.0,Patient,This is i'm hardly working and. it's just my kids are expensive.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, so what would be know what would be helpful to go over. Today, what would you like to talk about."
184.0,Patient,I don't know I really. suck.
226.0,Provider,"So make sure when you come to group or mean when you come to the sessions, that you have something that you at least want to talk about because remember this is your time. And this is. Maybe some. Like a topic that you can bring to individual counseling is something that you don't want to talk about in group or something that you didn't have enough time to talk about in group or anything kind of comes up in a kind of stress that comes up any kind of. pattern. Like relapse pattern that you can think of. Talk about know ways to stay clean like coping skills now coping strategies there's a lot of stuff that we can just go over. So i'd like you to just have."
184.0,Patient,Some heated.
226.0,Provider,And i'd like you to just have something that you can talk about.
184.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,kind of put me on the spot.
184.0,Patient,"They think. I guess there's some days, where I want with my medication try not to take more because I gave you and I said I will get cravings. yeah It makes you want to like take more to where we didn't have stink about it."
226.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah. who's the prescriber who's the doctor.
184.0,Patient,"I think, Christopher."
226.0,Provider,to prescribe suboxone.
184.0,Patient,"Christopher Allen you think. And that's kind of hard to because he's been doing it for days at a time, and I can go to any other pharmacy and. it's hard when they run out because this pharmacy a lot of guests, a lot of people go to it. And they run out a lot and then there's some days, where I won't have them because they have to order them and then like they can just transfer it to another pharmacy because they had me locked in only to that pharmacy."
226.0,Provider,Is that for insurance purposes.
184.0,Patient,yeah because I was taking. bendel's. A couple months ago and they said that's why but I told him I was not i'm not taking it no more and that way you have to have the doctor call and. I know she just stressful sometimes with that.
226.0,Provider,"Have you been able to take this a boxing every day, or do you do run out because you're not able to get the financing."
184.0,Patient,I know there was one time because they had to. They had to they didn't have none so they had to order it.
226.0,Provider,How long. Did that take.
184.0,Patient,"Two days like a day and a half pretty much and. They tried to transfer it to another one, and then they said the other one, so that they can fill it because I was locked in. So the pharmacist is like well, maybe we could just fill in and you could pay for it, so Finally I had to pay for it just I wouldn't have to go any longer without it."
226.0,Provider,yeah how much was it a lot out of pocket.
184.0,Patient,Now so for details like. I think there's like $29 and think okay.
226.0,Provider,yeah but. You know I know that I know that clients do run into that where pharmacy thrown out.
184.0,Patient,yeah and there's always have to get this pharmacy because a lot of people go to it. yeah and if they. If they run as fast as CVs.
226.0,Provider,"Yes, yes yeah."
184.0,Patient,"had tried to go to the other CVs. yeah cuz I was not as busy, but my insurance sitting at me."
226.0,Provider,"So my guess is that because it's a controlled substance, their only ordering a certain amount. yeah no. i'm hoping that they're trying to. remedy that situation I haven't heard it as much it was really happening, like a couple of months ago and it was prayed some chaos for clients. yeah, so I think that they're trying to really get that taken care of. So here's the deal just make sure that you go to all your groups, make sure you fill out all your surveys you do drug screening and you meet with me and then you can have extended this box into like a week right, so you won't have to keep going every day so it'll be a week with a refill. OK. OK so just know that you can you know you can work your way up towards that, but they really need to have you in green you know what what I say, when I say in the green."
184.0,Patient,"They sent me a drug, the drug test, but I still haven't got it and then I have this thing on my phone, where it says. I can see any email that I get. yeah and it says that it's been delivered on Tuesday and I never got it I. haven't got it started off it's still in the mail or. what's going on but. It shows on my side that it's been delivered."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so what you want to do is you want to go back to the virtual clinic and you want to let them know that you did not get the cup you need them to check to make sure they have the correct address in the system, this has been happening a lot okay. So it's not your fault it's something that's happening with bright heart and then, once it gets in the mail, it is in getting to clients okay so make sure you go back to the virtual clinic and let them know explain it to them so they can note that, so you don't get dinged for that. So that's a way to just get yourself to a place where you don't have to go to the pharmacy every four days."
184.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's hard to because shining a ride, all the way over there it's hard."
226.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. So. You know just just keep that in mind and and and let. You know, let the doctor know. What your situation is that you know."
184.0,Patient,"I have. yeah I had did let him know and told them that, like what was going on, and he said that he did it for a week, this time, but when I went there and it wasn't like that it was 40s any ratio, but I just said okay."
226.0,Provider,"i'll make sure that my him know that because he'll have to communicate that to the pharmacy sometimes the stuff just slips through the cracks. Okay, and again is because it's a controlled substance, so they monitor this stuff that would close it. i'm having missed any groups at all. No okay okay good So what are like what what are good days for you and I, to meet so we'll just meet twice a month okay. works for you."
184.0,Patient,Tuesdays and Thursdays and.
226.0,Provider,What about Thursday December 23 at can you do. 12 noon.
184.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"put this on. Okay, so some things that you can. Brain to session to talk about our. Stresses that came up for you. Any triggers that came up for you. Any old feelings and your memories anything that you feel would be helpful to discuss and help with coping skills. And you know kind of brainstorming ways to stay busy. Okay, to reduce stress, you know. Really, being aware of like what created your relapses in the past, so you don't keep repeating them now."
184.0,Patient,People have it. Okay.
226.0,Provider,"staying away from people that used to use with. stay out of situations that you know can be very stressful triggering or create a possible relapse. same really focus just you know your children your job, and everything to do. Not keeps you busy right."
184.0,Patient,My son is like 10 kids and one.
226.0,Provider,Is your younger one right. People want to see an ADHD. yeah. So yeah any questions does that make sense.
184.0,Patient,No. yeah i'll make sense.
226.0,Provider,"All right, so i've got you in for the 23rd at noon okay. Okay, great perfect and i'll see you then."
