12453.0,Patient,"It all know, because it was a silence stroke so just kind of happened. Recently a couple of months ago they don't know. So they were gonna read more tests."
540.0,Provider,"How did they find out, so what brought you and the high blood pressure."
12453.0,Patient,"You know because I was. So i'm trying to do more work these days and and I don't like my handshake it's hard to show now but. Sometimes my hands will shake and I thought there was something else going on, like parkinson's or some shit or some stuff right, and so they. They ran a brain scan and they found out that I had a stroke. And so they found out that they found out I have. To cervical. bulging discs in my neck, and they say with those discs pressing on a blood vessel there's low blood flow to my brain. And so, which probably caused a stroke okay. So."
540.0,Provider,Have you been hanging in since everything.
12453.0,Patient,You know i'm fine like I don't let it drag me down but it's just like I get exhausted by like my body refusing to the body. You know.

Brazilian steakhouse or something we need a bunch of meat which is bad, which I won't ever do again. But yeah but it's like I you know. Now I really gotta rein it in like it's something that's. I think it's the compression of the disks and low blood flow, which is not helping matters, but then my insurance. disapprove or. denied that client or didn't deny it, they. didn't approve it. It tests to take the test is called tcp test test the flow of blood and oxygen remembering and they shut it down so we'll see what happens."
540.0,Provider,"and have they said that they want to do any tactic, because a lot of times insurance they'll deny a test but they'll say you can do something before doing that test have they said anything about. Know insurances."

And i'm just I guess after the stroke news like i'm just I guess try to pick my fights now like. Like i'm just holding off on arguing because there's just sometimes I was laughing walk away, you know yeah that's, the only thing I could do because it's just like I just don't have time to waste on stressing about stupid shit anymore."
540.0,Provider,Once again it's also understanding that you can change certain things you can't change other things you can only control yourself.
12453.0,Patient,"Oh, of course I don't plan on changing things. yeah just letting people know that they're part they're there. there."
540.0,Provider,are no.

540.0,Provider,"But right now, are you just trying to not let it go underneath your skin."
12453.0,Patient,"i'm just overwhelmed with homework, so I think I don't have time. For. It so it's like i'm not as stressed out, as I was about it. I guess you know."
540.0,Provider,"Now, your stresses being put to other places like your medical stuff still."
12453.0,Patient,"school. So it's like I just in doing and doing that I feel like. Like I feel like i'm. Just kind of marching forward with it in a positive way, because it's like. My brain is not sitting idle anymore, because of school, which is great, and like I have a lot more things to focus on in my life and to not pull energy to it, you know to that kind of. digging or are you eating whatever."
540.0,Provider,I like a waste of energy right now. that's a lot lot going on since I last.
12453.0,Patient,"I was I don't know anymore man i'm just like whatever. But not negative about it, you know, like. I guess to me it's good to have a peace of mind that you know my body is messed up as to knowing it, or feeling it's messed up but not knowing for sure. You know. So."
540.0,Provider,"Having like a actual diagnosis and being able to get that treated. yeah and. it's like a weird reassurance because you're now able to know what's going on in your body. Because you you brought up the shaking the past few months, you brought up that handshake. yeah yeah."
12453.0,Patient,Well that's what what it was. gosh tokens bulging discs they're pressing on the nerves and the blood vessels and yeah right but.
540.0,Provider,Do they have you on any medication to help try to lessen the inflammation.
12453.0,Patient,"Well i'm taking high blood blood pressure medication and. i'm taking aspirin every day like one aspirin every day. problem two is you know, I was going to say, possibly start taking adderall because of school because I swear I have to do, double the work that these kids do or not double the work but double the effort in. A concentration is like over the place, you know. And so. chantelle was probably going to prescribe me. Like something either adderall or comparative or whatever and. The good thing about that well besides that enhance focus, but the good thing about that is that they're finding that adderall is good for. When you survive a stroke it's good for the turnaround like through re."
540.0,Provider,My re like.
12453.0,Patient,"Gaining back help I guess brain how I don't know it's kind of weird but the high blood pressure, says nope to add or also."
540.0,Provider,Our really.
12453.0,Patient,yeah which i'm you know.
540.0,Provider,It the I guess it could yeah increase here.
12453.0,Patient,"yeah because I researched all the all the drugs that are either prescribed to the year that they want to prescribe to me, and so I always research into. a stroke recovery gets is the word. Right yeah. So yeah. One thing that i'm having trouble with is. Remembering deadlines are not deadlines like I got my like my phones loaded up. But it's like. With school some of the homework like I procrastinate, to the point where it's like it's done some of it and I just don't send it in and it's like. I don't know what the deal is like I forget and then i'm like in a place or you can't do it, and then I did I forget what i'm in a place that I could do it then it's like I wake up this morning, like Oh, is that our homework. Wesley."
540.0,Provider,Have you thought about getting maybe like a paper schedule buck.
12453.0,Patient,"We talked about that I think huh yeah. Maybe that would be better, I mean, because I do get alerts and everything to my events or events school and doctors and whatnot. But, like those alerts are like an hour before. i'll forget. You know, like I forgot, and then I jumped on for you and then it's like and i'm going through all the mishmash of. The care providers aware though they call them. And then. And then it's like oh my God to you, it is just like all this this leaks, no longer available. But. It was all my fault, you know i'm perfectly fine i'm letting my guilt. But yeah you know it's like, if I have reminders own it's like the only thing I could see a paper organizing. Is that. being effective as if I carried around all the time. yeah i'd have to do that, like my brains get feeble enough where like. i've literally, the other day was looking for my glasses and they're in my hand. Like what is going on here like."
540.0,Provider,"it's like being on your phone looking for your phone. My phone. See I. Am the same person, where I mean I am like a grandma with technology, where it's I need like the paper schedule book, like, I have the the calendar like on my wall. Like yeah i'm dry erase one like that's just where my brain works good with like the deadlines, because with my phone was telling me I just feel like I get so many notifications that. yeah just another one."
12453.0,Patient,"I hear that yeah totally hear that because I usually have a day before notification for each of it and an hour before. So I think I just got to start tightening that up to like a half an hour so then now it's like Oh, because I literally have to be here like 1520 minutes early to get through those guys and you know just to get on so."
540.0,Provider,"how's everything going on, like the group and house by house group on on stuff."
12453.0,Patient,I haven't been a group twice. Once. Like I had to get homework done.
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12453.0,Patient,"And then, this last Wednesday, I had a Doc emergency had to go the doctor, not the emergency room but urgent care, so I had to I was stuck in line my elbow swelled up like super big."
540.0,Provider,holes that Proust.
12453.0,Patient,"I don't it's weird it's red. Is the hour on there so it's red, and it has something to do with the. congestive heart failure. So."
540.0,Provider,it's like circulation.
12453.0,Patient,"it's a circulation thing and. When they call it the got an x ray of it was. yeah it has something to do with the blood flow and circulation and i'm like what like. I think the pandemic kind of kicked my ass like because when I was before the pandemic, I was always up and doing things and now it's it's a pandemic happen and it's still going on, like. And like my disdain for humanity like it's made me more of a. solitary wanting to just be home and. yeah not deal with jerks and public and stuff like that. So, like I tend to this. I really like, and you know I I went out this weekend that we had friends that stayed at our House from out of town. and We went out had a few drinks and then we had dinner. And it was Okay, for the most part, but I feel like. there's a large group of people that are either super cautious, which is great like I get that. or there's just some assholes that forgot manners or were never given man or learn manners."
540.0,Provider,This group where they know manners.
12453.0,Patient,"No manners no oh my know my friends are good, my friends, I always."
540.0,Provider,hear from God okay.
12453.0,Patient,yeah um but like people out in public. Okay yeah. So it's like societies all weird right now.
540.0,Provider,"As yeah it's hard nowadays, I mean especially just with everything going on with coven and then everything else in the world."
12453.0,Patient,"And like i'm sorry to make it political but I can't literally understand. The ignorance of like trump supporters. And it completes I can't understand how one man is pushed to divide so wide. That, I think it was probably something that was kind of brewing underneath the surface, for a while, but that definitely kind of pushed it all out, you know."
540.0,Provider,"I think I think it's a hard thing I mean because i've been talking about it in groups, a lot, because the topic just keeps coming up, and I think that political so we talked about parties and, like that's already a divide So if you think about having parties alone that's dividing us. yeah there's going to be democrats or the Republicans was going to be, obviously the independence but we're already a divided country and."
12453.0,Patient,"About like everybody kept it. kind of their cordial about it, I kept it under wraps you know, like even when I was younger like. Some guys at work would be all you can't talk about politics, you. Like Okay, you know. Whichever student."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I think we lost boundaries, too, so I think that we've lost the ability to talk about different opinions, in a sense, like, I feel like certain things it's just we. it's like one way or the other, and if somebody doesn't believe in the ways that you believe in a lot of people, just like cut them off and they're like oh you're wrong. And our society is like we're so shut off to each other and that it's just if it's not our way then it's not your way and it's we can't have like a common ground where someone may be right in certain circumstances, and then the other person may be right in other circumstances. yeah I, so I think that we've gone off course with. I don't know. 15 respecting each other yeah respecting each other, really. yeah that's a good way to put it respect. yeah. That can respect that."
12453.0,Patient,"should be they even remember having conversations about politics that it's been fine and we were. On different sides of it, you know yeah, but I feel now it's so one way or the other, so extreme."
540.0,Provider,Oh it's so extreme right now.
12453.0,Patient,"i'm like why's everybody fucking crazy right though, like."
540.0,Provider,"I want to when it comes to we don't understand, like the certain words we put on things like so calling people vaccinators and non vaccinators that's dividing us even more. yeah that's and some people they don't get vaccinated because some people. They are scared of the risks, and I mean we have to respect their opinion and there's it's just like any vaccine to where some people don't get other vaccines, because they have religious aspects or metal medical aspects. yeah, but we have to respect people that do get vaccines, because there's also they're the reasons that they get it, and the people that they care about and it's. it's like people are like no, you have to get it now, I have to get it and it's just head to head."
12453.0,Patient,"I think you're right though, like there's such. Like you know how it used to be just kind of like a. I don't know kind of just a. kind of interweaving path now it's just like two separate paths, you know."
540.0,Provider,yeah we could exist as individuals.
12453.0,Patient,"yeah but the language that people use like anti baxter's. Q and on. conspiracy theorists like you know or or like. Because like. it's weird my sister was a total like little hippie deadhead chick you know and. When this whole trump thing came to. came to. The surface, like all of a sudden she's an Anti back, sir. And she's like pissed off to sell. And you don't like so. I think it's good to probably remove the division names from our conversations."
540.0,Provider,"I think it changes it to I mean. I, I think that we are so stuck on trying to get away from segregation, that we have created so we're very, very diverse with our segregation now I just. yeah where everybody's divided and everybody's just but we can't solve the like one like united."
12453.0,Patient,"I feel like I feel like the better of us like the better of us the best of all of us like want that to happen when be united, you know but it's like I feel like i'm referee referee in like. five year olds, you know. or i'm on the outside looking in because it's like I try and get the blast people, but I do use the devices or the division type names, you know, like. But it's like I have a friend who voted for trump the second time i'm like. You know i'm not going to get down on him but i'm like wow, why did. You know it like my sister, and all that but it's like. I tried, I tried my best to kind of. be kind of more of a. Like you know, like I tell you for like I I look at the situation from different angles so it's like. I understand a bit of their like the interaction i'm not gonna i'm not gonna fucking downplay that like that's legit that's scary shit like they need to chill a bug out. I know what they're thinking, but they're not doing a good job of it, you know. But that's me."
540.0,Provider,"By think that's so many things to I mean like in groups like i'll have something like certain groups that they'll go and bash police officers like and no other. And i'm and I tell them like hey but think of their shoes they get called for the bad they don't they don't get called for the good, so their interactions are bad bad bad bad."
12453.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
540.0,Provider,50 years of that like that's.
12453.0,Patient,"Every every time I hear a sub 20. Something or younger save a cab like I just want slap their face like you know what. We could do without the police i'm like no we can't obviously it'd be. way more complicated society, the net. Like I understand what they're saying, but I know for sure that we live in a society where we need some kind of."
540.0,Provider,structure.
12453.0,Patient,"structure organization people being accountable, you know, like and people that are there to make sure people are accountable. You know."
540.0,Provider,"And it's, sad to say, though, I mean if we didn't have police circumstances like maybe not as dramatic but, like the purge circumstances like that will it would happen there habitable."
12453.0,Patient,"I know. yeah only the ones with the money in the power, the wood, well, I mean it's kind of like that now, but like they would just eradicate people."
540.0,Provider,yeah the survival of the fittest oh yeah. yeah it would we would just like without that civilization we wouldn't be like the other countries that it's just like you know you make your own laws so it's just. yeah yeah it's just. yeah.
12453.0,Patient,But I just hope at some point. You know there's still always I think there will always be a part of me that has faith that you add he will. Make it come back.
540.0,Provider,yeah make it so parents.
12453.0,Patient,will be like well shit we're all fucked up. As new things you know I know.
540.0,Provider,"I think that's The thing is we're we always just repeat history or history repeats itself, and we have to learn from history and until we're ready to learn. I think that if people had more mindsets like ours, where you can see, the other angles, where you could see how other people can be impacted and search like a situation, but until people are ready to open their mind and eyes up it's going to be. Because it's some a tunnel vision, right now, and I think it's the parties is an example of it like black lives matter police lives matter like we're just so fast to divide ourselves and that's, we have to be ready to come together."
12453.0,Patient,"Absolutely look at dating profiles it's ridiculous it's like everybody's political opinion. Oh, my God I don't want to do all this shit about you already like. You know, but yeah it's funny."
540.0,Provider,"And I was watching one of the 911 documentaries and it and it was saying, like how far we've gotten away from being like that unified USA from like the day after 911 to now it's just like unbelievable how we've gotten away from that like just strong from. yeah yeah."
12453.0,Patient,we'll take it like after World War Two you know I mean that's why.
540.0,Provider,I know.
12453.0,Patient,"There are the what will they call themselves. We were just like best generation, or whatever."
540.0,Provider,"I think it's big it's, not because we haven't had like those extreme events that kind of make reality click you know how like your stroke like it makes your reality click in a different way. yeah like those incidents they it's not that they benefit us, but they do make us like reality click like the Boston bombing like Boston strong like if you walk in Boston still from this day. You can just feel that like everyone's like connected New York is different New York, you can walk and it's just I mean i'm from New England so New York, you can walk and it doesn't feel any different really. than like from the day that you like walk into Boston you can feel the energy in the air."
12453.0,Patient,You still feel that.
540.0,Provider,yeah it's just like Boston strong yeah.
12453.0,Patient,"No, we had the earthquake here for so i'm in the Bay area i'm in oakland California. Okay, and I was around here when the 89 loma prieta earthquake happens. Like that created a lot of unity yeah and a lot of ground yeah I mean there was some shit like you know stuff going on, but like pull most of the people together, which is great that was a long time ago."
540.0,Provider,"You think something would bring us together, like a global pandemic but."
12453.0,Patient,yeah well well you know what the problem is that that that meet a political.
540.0,Provider,"yeah which I mean in any rightful mine, I mean the politics they're going to grab whatever they can to get their parties, so I mean if they can make a political day well."
12453.0,Patient,No problem is the politicians.
