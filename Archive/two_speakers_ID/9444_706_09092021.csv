706.0,Provider,"So. You get suspended from school, you have to go to a hearing."
9444.0,Patient,Now he's already on probation but the principal called his probation officer. and conservatives don't like each other want money. don't know yeah you're sick like that you're not going to school.
706.0,Provider,"Why would you take that step and call the probation officer, if there were actually wasn't an altercation."
9444.0,Patient,"Right, so it was a threat I it's like now, I told him I was like dude they got to pinpoint in their want to pick out you all the time and they are."

9444.0,Patient,Now i'm going to beat your ass meet me after. School yeah.
706.0,Provider,"They don't really follow through with that it's just a bunch of talk, you know and so until it happens until there's actually like an altercation Why would you turn somebody into their probation officer when you know they're already struggling."
9444.0,Patient,Right hi thing it's flat out ridiculous honey just keep what you have on on we're not going anywhere I think they come out to the car and test you.
706.0,Provider,Oh. yeah grab up and they test you. that's crazy though oh my gosh as a parent i'd be really frustrated.
9444.0,Patient,"Like Why am I, like he doesn't fucking touching."
706.0,Provider,"And then you see, you have to go to a hearing for violation of probation even though you technically didn't violate probation does it say information you can't like verbally have an altercation with somebody because."
9444.0,Patient,They said it was a threat. yeah but so.
706.0,Provider,People threaten all the time to do things it's it's just words until you actually follow through with the action.
9444.0,Patient,Right. and
706.0,Provider,"Simon says mom had beat this person's ass and I was, like all of you, do you know that's not good, but you know if you're going to start a fight, be able to back yourself up as much you're gonna get your. Money you know i'm like I don't want you to fight your words are much better weapons to use, you know, try and talk it out or walk away, but these boys and their testosterone that's a region."
9444.0,Patient,that's not what they wanted to know my boys seems like once they started fighting and seeing that they could fight oh my God. Like I mean.
706.0,Provider,yeah well. what's a lot of stress on you.
9444.0,Patient,yeah because if they put an invoice for even for a weekend I will be devastated. So I don't know. yeah it's a lot of stress on now.
706.0,Provider,"And then you've got your daughter, who has a serious health condition who's obviously second all this craziness going on the coven and just the unknowns of all of it. Because nobody knows people that are vaccinated are getting it people that aren't vaccinated are getting it. Right going kids are getting at adults are getting it and just there's no rhyme or reason. They say if you're vaccinated you get a lesser case of it unless you have an underlying medical condition wow that doesn't really you know I mean it depends on who you're talking to but I mean it's just scary as a parent, I mean it's scary for me and my kids."
9444.0,Patient,Ever all.
706.0,Provider,Right health conditions I couldn't imagine what you go through every day.
9444.0,Patient,it's a lot what on earth. Yes. Go tell him tell him to start a sport. And then you need to hop on a laptop into your school work to. My grandma's we've been one second okay. yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So with all this craziness going on, how are you doing, how are you feeling."
9444.0,Patient,"So, last week I felt like shit. Because every can taste the taste it funny and after four times with my sister and after the fourth time I said something about some cases funny I was like holy Fuck and I brushed it off because there was no really no other sometimes I just. uh huh everything not not one thing case it's funny I had to pack of cigarettes and almost two months I bought a pack of cigarettes, just to taste, it sounds like maybe i'm just. crazy. And it gave me excuse backpack cigarettes, but anyways. I didn't taste anything but now i'm you know i'm fine I. never had a fever, so now i'm wondering like if that was me and I didn't go get tested because I fucking time and I gave it to her for like a piece of shit."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
9444.0,Patient,"No, I mean like."
706.0,Provider,"you're gonna have more than just that, though, you would think you'd have a sore throat or cough or runny nose."
9444.0,Patient,I mean there's we all.
706.0,Provider,we've all had sore throats yeah.
9444.0,Patient,But also the weather's changing. yeah and like like with her it's just hard to tell she already has a lung issue you know what I mean so.
706.0,Provider,"I mean if you had it last week, when your sense of taste was off and you were tested like today, when you take her into get tested, he would still show positive yet."
9444.0,Patient,When I probably have much less testing.
706.0,Provider,So these will not give you peace of mind. So you don't sit around feeling guilty if she does.
9444.0,Patient,i'm just getting.
706.0,Provider,Really sick or.
9444.0,Patient,My oldest son he started a job at walmart. Making $14 an hour to sort out.
706.0,Provider,isn't that crazy.
9444.0,Patient,"yeah that was like. don't go to school, neither he is the only game. it's like 70 and. They get off the damn game."
706.0,Provider,that's the problem with homeschool too many things to distract you.
9444.0,Patient,100.
706.0,Provider,"So. So what do you think that, like if she if she does test positive will they take extra precautions with her like will they put her like in the hospital or anything since."
9444.0,Patient,We don't I don't know um. I asked well this was like last year and code first happened. I had asked him like you know. Okay i'm on the phone i'll be in there to do with it. get your blankets picked up. I can't stand him anyways um.
706.0,Provider,Which one was that.
9444.0,Patient,"My 11 year old. yeah he's pretending to cry like his all that don't pick up his mind Mike it. is simple, but um. Oh, he said that like worst case is that should be putting the hospital for two weeks, which is what happens with our tune ups, you know, which is that often she's put on has a PIC line ran through and. it's pain in the ass that's hard on me and her and all the kids that's just hard. But hopefully. she's had a cold."
706.0,Provider,yeah hopefully cross your fingers. So i'm. So you feel probably overwhelmed anxious kind of just all of enroll one. which also might be why you needed that pack of cigarettes.
9444.0,Patient,"I smoke needs, but at the same."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
9444.0,Patient,"I smoke these in the House, because I obviously can't smoke. cigarettes. So I don't know."
706.0,Provider,So what have you been doing to cope. With added stress.
9444.0,Patient,I don't have time to cope.
706.0,Provider,You know. You just go through the motions.
9444.0,Patient,yeah I have to go like. Luke oh oh also Lucas a suspended 30 days off of the bus 30. Oh jeez how far 30 fucking days.
706.0,Provider,After school.
9444.0,Patient,i'm sorry 12 minutes 10 minutes but.
706.0,Provider,Every day and pick him up every day.
9444.0,Patient,"that's bullshit because I can't marry up and burn the truck. there's no one here. there's no one here to sit with her, you know why go. says it's just me in them."
706.0,Provider,What happens if she ends up having coven they're going to expect you to get her into the car take him to school.
9444.0,Patient,alone.
706.0,Provider,Well yeah.
9444.0,Patient,You guys can figure it out.
706.0,Provider,So why did he get suspended off the BAT.
9444.0,Patient,For Sunday night.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, for the same thing."
9444.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So, was it on the bus and it happened."
9444.0,Patient,"Why, for me, or I told him that I need to call walmart. Or, he said, since i'm pointing to my mom let me come in oh they're letting you can then use that for a mask you know say okay i'm on the phone call okay hold on. i'm. Saying."
706.0,Provider,You were explaining what happened with the situation with the best.
9444.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah I guess he had triptych in and they kept staring at him. And Lucas said, if you don't stop sending mail and i'm not sure you. know."
706.0,Provider,"That. yeah, I think, just because of the probably the past history that he's had. yeah issues he's definitely. Definitely yeah and that's unfortunate, is there any kind of programs there's."
9444.0,Patient,No one.
706.0,Provider,Is there any programs through school that can help him like with behavioral like an IEP do you have those there.
9444.0,Patient,Now he has an IP.
706.0,Provider,He does.
9444.0,Patient,All my voicemail.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so and they're not doing anything to kind of like step in and help."
9444.0,Patient,"he's supposed to see a counselor at school, once a week and that's that's it like that's pretty much it they don't have any MC or the door again."
706.0,Provider,"They don't have any. kind of like safety net type things like where he can go when he builds frustrated, they can go to like a space and take time out take you know take time away from class or whatever."
9444.0,Patient,you're not sure.
706.0,Provider,So I mean I just feel like maybe he doesn't have enough supports.
9444.0,Patient,"that's it that's in the House, we bought everything in. We when do we drive the car. I think some teachers push him on purpose."
706.0,Provider,They push me yeah oh yeah.
9444.0,Patient,To get a reaction.
706.0,Provider,Oh yeah. They poke him like a like a bear to see. zinc explode.
9444.0,Patient,"So why can't he play the a white what's happening, he can play the game it's not that big a deal so neither did you it's fine. Okay, and she said. it's fine I didn't send them. And whatnot they didn't want to go I didn't send them. A snack snack show but guys go go now i'm going to. Show."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh I can feel the tension was. Like I can feel your tension like from you to me. yeah everything that's going on. So it is it's a lot, I will tell you, I have a 13 year old with ADHD and he is very challenging and he also has an IEP. school and kids at school, do the same thing to him, they poke him until he."
9444.0,Patient,And then he's the bad guy.
706.0,Provider,"And then he gets in trouble yeah so I know exactly how you feel. yeah you know, and I shouldn't say know exactly how you feel I can relate. Well, but um. You know and it's it's stressful as a parent and it's stressful as just a person, because you feel you're constantly defending your child."
9444.0,Patient,"I know I do and then yesterday move hundred. Out of here hunters teacher called me. And I called a principal because I was so fucking person. I think I have a voicemail haven't checked them, I never took one voice most but. She wasn't given hunter as lunch until he wrote two sentences. It was it wasn't an essay that wasn't so paragraph yo do everyone certain thing i'm not baby i'm just saying. anyways."
706.0,Provider,I don't know if they can win. lunch I kind of feel like that.
9444.0,Patient,"Which is why I called the principal because i'm like he might be an asshole whatever. And I he's lazy you don't. Like to do school work whatever you. commissions and that's like you already took his recess away so now you want to take his fucking lunch way and so, by the time he gets lunch guess what it's called."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
9444.0,Patient,"yeah give me cold pizza she she was like I do you mind if I keep them after school and I was like and he gets home now and she's like the best with a sister I was like No, let me talk to them like speeches fucking nuts. None of my kids she don't like any of my kids and they didn't like her, all of them. I got until summer this Emma wrong, he said, good luck with her. Like I want I don't want to be at this thing I want to be mostly hang on shit another box of rocks no."
706.0,Provider,"No. stars, I mean because they give you the curriculum. So you don't have to know. All of this stuff up but Oh, my goodness, how stressful would it be to keep your boys and."
9444.0,Patient,"Girls when they went, we went to virtual learning loss, whatever one code first. We didn't do the fucking thing we didn't do know so like I didn't know how they didn't know how, and I was just over it. It was a mess it was a flippin mess, I could not think straight."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no, it was stressful for our parents, it really was. very stressful so um So what are you doing for you so that you can cope."
9444.0,Patient,"Because, after that I got in the refrigerator and. When you say. Round I do this lovely thing."
706.0,Provider,To kind of get yourself back into that centered space.
9444.0,Patient,"Nothing I. So I have to take her to school three different times, she said you don't pay, we can you can tell me that in a minute i'm on the phone. She didn't even get to that. Okay, so that's that I don't like you either go. Okay, so and I get it she's a bitch I get it go. out in the fridge what. Time do you like, I said. So."
706.0,Provider,When your days gone when it's done like What do you do.
9444.0,Patient,"Finally, here, instead of the fucking wall. Like what you're going again tomorrow."
706.0,Provider,Do you have trouble sleeping.
9444.0,Patient,Sometimes yeah.
706.0,Provider,um do you feel like you have racing thoughts.
9444.0,Patient,"yeah sometimes or sometimes it's like my brain shuts down well so i've lot of times I feel like I shut down. mentally a lot. A majority of the day, really i'm just like you know going through the motions. To get everybody where they need to be, because it is overwhelming."
706.0,Provider,"Do you take, do you take any medication for anxiety."
9444.0,Patient,No say i've already I never really thought my nerves are about I guess um. But maybe I don't know.
706.0,Provider,And my MIT something. To talk to. Are you with Isaiah.
9444.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And I thought got too many patients i'm. To talk to Isaiah and just explain kind of I just I feel you're really frazzled and I and a lot of it's situational, but I feel like maybe something that you could take for anxiety like abuse brown or something like that is something you just take once a day. or twice a day depending on like what your doses, it will just help you be feel more calm and kind of more able to. deal with the situations that are thrown at you, because right now I just feel like you just feel frazzled like you just. don't have any more, to give you don't know what to do so, you just go through the motions which isn't healthy because eventually. All that stress and anxiety builds up and when you know when you're in recovery, you want to hit those issues head on, you want to deal with them before they become too strong, because you know people in recovery go back to what they know. They go back to the comfort and that's what we don't want to see happen so um so maybe talking to Isaiah about trying something for anxiety and just see if it helps because if it helps you'll know."
9444.0,Patient,You know you'll be like oh my.
706.0,Provider,"And if it doesn't help, well then, you know you don't lose anything out for trying. Right so."
9444.0,Patient,"I think my biggest problem of trying new medicines as because I don't have time to like well because I deal with Lucas and switching medications and he had gone. he's switch nurse and so many fucking times and I had to deal with, like the outcome, or you know, like the. Side effects of it but. I was I just but I don't have time for anyone to deal with mine, you know what I mean like."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so there shouldn't be so like an Anti anxiety is like it's like an Anti anxiety slash anti depressant kind of a month you shouldn't unless you have an allergic reaction, of course, but otherwise you shouldn't have any major side effects, you should just feel better, you should just. Be clear headed not so overwhelmed not so like snappy like i'm sure you feel like sometimes you just snap."
9444.0,Patient,"All right, I absolutely do."
706.0,Provider,"yeah that will help with that too, so it just just helps with like mood regulation anxiety depression it's actually mean it's a pretty common man that is prescribed and with everything that you have to deal with this."
9444.0,Patient,Which one is that.
706.0,Provider,it's called view sperm. And some people call it the aspire.
9444.0,Patient,Okay i've heard what.
706.0,Provider,"yep so I mean it's pretty common but um you know with everything you have going on with the boys and your daughter, and you know it's just kind of it's a lot for anybody to handle. um and plus you have you're in recovery So there you have that added stress, you know there's all this stuff."
9444.0,Patient,"Oh yeah it's it's. it's a lot it's so much and. I mean, sometimes I. envy the people that have like this. Have a dad in their life, or whatever you know uh huh or someone to help like yep. Now. Matthews friends and she takes them every other day or picks them up every other day from practice."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9444.0,Patient,"So that does help so every day I don't have to, but I still have to pick up Lucas, so I mean it's."
706.0,Provider,"See, I have two boys, but when it comes to so he's he's just a tad there tantrums but my 13 year old definitely is challenging but I have my husband so. And that's that is sad his biological dad my oldest son, but he really steps in, and he has a dad so i'm really lucky to be able to have that, because for a long time it was just me and my oldest son, and it was challenging. And so I can imagine what you're going through."
9444.0,Patient,"yeah it's a lot. A lot of times I don't like cleaning I don't feel like. When I do, I have to stop and leave and run my time back, I want to fucking do any like and cooking separate that's even in task because. As much as I run and now the own started working on, I was licensed that's taken back and forth to like mm hmm it's just a lot it's just a lot."
706.0,Provider,"So is there anything that maybe we can brainstorm together, where we can try and simplify some of the tasks of your day, so it doesn't seem as overwhelming if anything that you can cut out. You know everything is a must do."
9444.0,Patient,"yeah about say everything that they do. isn't like. for fun, you know I mean it or is it isn't like. there's no extra running like there's no going me drive them to the friend's house picking them up. Now, when I do have time and they asked me, sometimes I will sometimes out, you know I fall out say no, and i'm not running day and i'm like running around home day before, do not ask me more to do anything. i'm exhausted I don't want to run and i'm not running. So we."
706.0,Provider,"Do if you get kind of your what I like to call your Center back kind of that place of peace, which is like where you don't have as much anxiety and that frazzled feeling. That takes a lot out of your body, it makes it will make you tired, so I feel like that will also help kind of with your energy levels, because you like, I said you just feel frazzled all the time. When your body's on that in that constant state of stress and you've got your you've got that that constant chemical like just pumping through you and you're in that like kind of that fight or flight mode like."
9444.0,Patient,whoa.
706.0,Provider,"that's a lot of stress on the body that makes you really tired, so if you can come out of that a little bit, you should also have more energy and more to. feel that you are more balanced and you might be able to balance things better um The one thing I was gonna try and throw out, which I know is probably challenging but you have you have some older boys, there is there's a reason that they can't help make dinner or something like that."
9444.0,Patient,You want their nasty hands and like.
706.0,Provider,"Well, obviously wash your hands before you cook food."
9444.0,Patient,"I just I don't know I think I didn't really learn how to cook until I was like us. My mom is just real big on that, like get the hell away from the truth and even now, to this day, I make their plates, all of them like don't come over here and. Well, so I guess I could work on that, I mean."
706.0,Provider,"yeah What if you try something new. Just for you know, a short time to see if it works, maybe you have you know, one of your boys and you. Make dinner I think it's good, because I think it's good for to have that that time. But it also is teaching them a skill that they're going to have to have I mean God forbid, something happens to you in a few years and then you've got your older son, who is living on his own and he hasn't had to cook."
9444.0,Patient,yeah that will be him.
706.0,Provider,You know. I think that you know some of that skill building will then some take some of that pressure off you too.
9444.0,Patient,"yeah they 11 year old he does he cooks with me a lot like he'll come in here, and so the Hamburg me or. With any gets bored of leaves but yeah but the other voice probably should be the ones in there and watching uh huh now they can put stuff in the microwave because i'm big on that to like make yourself something there's a kitchen there's food figure it out."
706.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and sometimes you need to do that and that's Okay, sometimes you need to say go microwave some whatever pizza rolls whatever it is that you want to eat. there's moon, and then you need to go and you need to take a bubble bath and a book and read for like 20 minutes and have peace because you have. Health care time, especially with all this chaos around you because you can only go at 100 miles an hour for so long before your engine is going to break down, so to say. You know what i'm saying like."
9444.0,Patient,You can't.
706.0,Provider,Have a car that fast for every day for 10 years like. It will bring down and that's and that's what i'm seeing i'm seeing a lot of wear on you you're just.
9444.0,Patient,worn down.
706.0,Provider,"And so maybe that's what you need to do you just need to your boys are old enough, they can fend for themselves. They do, and if they don't know how to do basic things, this is a great time for them to learn."
9444.0,Patient,"so that you can donate they can do a lot like they. Know Oh, and he. He is pretty helpful, I mean, I have to like be on his ass all the time, but like. helped me get these boys up for school like since he was quarantine help me get them up. Even though you're not in school you're asking you want to get up and you're going to help me like don't care I don't care what you're going to help because sometimes it takes forever to get Lucas and 100 up and going like. not always but. Financing why hundred hateful like he hates it. And why called the principal initially that was one of the things there's no tell her no kitchen hate going to school that much so, whether it be him and being an asshole where your teachers, making him phil how are you feeling, but it needs to be fixed mm hmm so."
706.0,Provider,Is there another school or just the one school.
9444.0,Patient,"Just this one and I thought about looking for a place closer to my mom and eaten Ohio. Which is only like 10 or 12 minutes from here. Because there's nothing here, nothing. there's like a ball court, but right across the Boards it's something crackhead pedophile or mother hamper."
706.0,Provider,yeah don't mean that.
9444.0,Patient,"New so that's where you look, as you said he would get Lucas drunk you and giving lead, he would so that guy don't like or I don't like that guy and he knows it."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no I don't like him either. So maybe for the next couple of weeks until we meet again maybe try that maybe. Look at your day and look at maybe things that you can you know kind of pretend like you're the manager of the House, and so you basically get to decide who has what tasks so. you're the main manager so ultimately it all falls on you, if it doesn't get done, but how great would it be if they did you know if they did help with some of this stuff."
9444.0,Patient,And I don't know a lot.
706.0,Provider,"God yeah like. Our Martin it's important it's really important and you need to have that self care time that's really important, and maybe I don't know put some kind of a. You can you can even like put like a positive reinforcement to a you know, like you know they you know and kind of give them some power to so. And it might be like sit down as a family and kind of have that discussion, like Okay, this is what's going on this is how we need to change it, so you know, one of you is going to need to make dinner once a week."
9444.0,Patient,Yesterday we had a chore chart started and LUCAS decided to drone but i'm. Happy first day I ran. So much that i've. You know. What.
706.0,Provider,"So you have to take him to school pick them up, he said Fuck off practice right. And then your oldest son to work. yeah okay so once you take them to school and while they're not in school, right now, but in a perfect world, if you take them to school during the day, what do you use."
9444.0,Patient,Your time sleep I fucking sleep.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're just exhausted."
9444.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't always sleep like sometimes i'll have.

And I just don't have have me to go like I just don't. want to go."
706.0,Provider,"So yeah I wonder if you're not experiencing some situational depression, as well as anxiety because that's gonna."
9444.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I can pull into a store like an actual grocery store because I hate grocery shopping if there's too many cars, I leave or more Elsa in my car in the parking lot for like 15 minutes and then honestly like i'm not going in there and go to the dollar store and God wherever I can."
706.0,Provider,And will you be in group on Monday.
9444.0,Patient,night I can be.
706.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm just going to say, if you come to group and you stay like a little bit after. Maybe you can talk to Isaiah and."
9444.0,Patient,see things going on vacation.
706.0,Provider,He is going on vacation but I thought he was going to be there on Monday.
9444.0,Patient,I don't know my groups or Wednesday now.
706.0,Provider,"Oh. Okay you're on the Wednesday group now. Yes, he is going on vacation so you wouldn't see him on Wednesday, so what I would do, then, is maybe when we're done here, get get hooked up with a vc and set up a medical appointment for him. so that you can talk to him about your anxiety and kind of your sometimes, and I think he's probably a couple weeks out, maybe, but at least get on his books. Then, when he gets back from vacation, we can also I can also address it, with him, I can shoot him an email what time is your group on Wednesdays. So you're."
9444.0,Patient,"Okay, oh yeah keep it in you."
706.0,Provider,"yeah he has two groups on Wednesdays, because I have a group with him on Wednesdays, but it's at. Maybe. Two o'clock your time."
9444.0,Patient,"i'm. Also, like the only thing I have done was miss our last minute last appointment my phone died number on. During our last appointment right when we was doing the time. And my phone had died. that's, the only thing that I have done and. i'm not in the green which pisses me off, because I should be like I don't I do all my surveys I. Go to group every single week but. What and then. So I say is like i'm going on vacation on right everybody a script for three weeks, you know. Three weeks out. I got a week source like so now, what do I do like."
706.0,Provider,You you probably got a week plus refills.
9444.0,Patient,Maybe okay. That makes sense.
706.0,Provider,"So then, you get a week and then you have a refill so you. have to go back and get your refile is probably what. Okay, but if, for some reason that if there's an issue. With your medication. contact the vc because there is somebody that is kind of like as backup for Isaiah Well he has gone. Believe Dr sal is the person who's taking over his groups."
9444.0,Patient,One is today.
706.0,Provider,today's.
9444.0,Patient,yeah you're right it says to refills okay.
706.0,Provider,yeah so that should get you through till he gets.
9444.0,Patient,"so worried, I was like what my moment."
706.0,Provider,"And don't ever get worried about your meds because, if something should happen, where something's not right and you contact the vc whether your doctor is gone or not there is somebody they can get Ahold of to get you your medicine. So don't ever panic about not having your medicine. You know."
9444.0,Patient,"I sometimes wonder is the medicine, so my problem to suddenly get I feel like the medicine keeps me going."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I mean yeah it will keep you going, I mean there can be effects to it if you're if it's not high enough, sometimes I mean those are all things you can talk to Isaiah about, but I honestly think it's just there's just chaos kind of all around you all the time and."
9444.0,Patient,"It just wears is constantly chaos look at my notes I haven't even had them done and I don't have like I just don't and if I write like you said when I. When the kids do go to school, and I do have the extra time I just."
706.0,Provider,shut down.
9444.0,Patient,yeah I just don't know like I don't mm hmm oh my gosh.
706.0,Provider,"So um so yeah, so I think talking to Isaiah about maybe trying something for anxiety depression just from the things that you've been telling me might be helpful also. Like I said, you know delegating some of the some of the things in the House, you know. Yes, let them, you know make their own food they don't have to make your food, but they can make their own food."
9444.0,Patient,You know.
706.0,Provider,You know they are you can teach them or have them help you or you know they can help with laundry or I mean there are things that they can do they're old enough that some of that stuff needs to come off of you so that you can.
9444.0,Patient,"yeah like there's like piles of clothes in my kitchen like in baskets or whatever. And I have told them for over them it's been I know it's been over a month, it was before school started, if you guys didn't miss these clothes i'm throwing them away because they're just sitting in the fucking kitchen it's ridiculous. And if your guys's rooms aren't clean enough to have clothes and then i'm going to throw everything away in your room and I do do that, like. They don't."
706.0,Provider,follow through.
9444.0,Patient,"My kids. yeah my kids don't have toys, they don't have like. there's nothing I can take away from because they don't have anything."
706.0,Provider,What about the game system.
9444.0,Patient,"yeah the game, I do, I take that all the fucking time and i'll hide it outside my car i'll send it to my mom like I."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
9444.0,Patient,"So, like when I do say i'm taking the game they didn't they know absolutely no I mean business and they'll get up and do whatever they're supposed to. Do I mean just little things like I try to tell them this House would never get method you guys would pick up after yourselves."
706.0,Provider,yeah that's.
9444.0,Patient,Not something pick it up pluck it.
706.0,Provider,"it's a pretty common I think it's a boy thing I don't know I don't have any girls. I always wondered if I had a girl if it would be different, but my son's the same way, he never picks up after himself I literally go from room to room and tell exactly what he's done because he leaves a trail. You know."
9444.0,Patient,"So Lucas clean the living room last night because 700. insisted that we are going to the dollar store to get something to great before it closed and I didn't have anything here and. They stress mountain that source so fucking bad and I got home I wouldn't talk to me, and when I was like you know if I can talk to me. get away from me like I was so pissed off just because, like they seen it as no issues like we wouldn't even do anything you're playing tag and fucking store you guys would like a bunch of little hoodlums. mm hmm. and Anyhow Lucas came back this chapter is like mom come in, I got a surprise for you and I wait a good 20 maybe 30 minutes for him and came back in and he was laying down to time, but he had clean the living room because he knew that. He had pushed my buttons. yeah but like if they would do that all the time, like."
706.0,Provider,"So I mean family meeting and you just delegate and you say okay on Monday, so, and so does this on Tuesday so and so's doing this and Wednesday so and so's doing this. You know and and just delegate and blake and if these things don't get done, then there will be a negative consequence, I can't keep doing this on my own. And like as far as the clothes that are sitting in the baskets I tell them one more time, this is the final option get down here go through your stuff or i'm bagging it and garbage bags and it's out of here i'm tired of walking over it, and follow through. And just you know, and you may even have to necessarily throw it away."
9444.0,Patient,Because I don't know author like because I don't wanna. I don't where there's no point in.
706.0,Provider,Not stuff that they were okay.
9444.0,Patient,"No, not that. No, they don't."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so then yeah bang it up give it give it to good well throw it away whatever you need to do, because the thing is is. You know when when you say something or and i'm guilty of this too same things over and over again, but then not following through like. That they'll do it, maybe Maybe she won't. yeah I know. i'm guilty of it, too, so you just have to do it."
9444.0,Patient,yeah no.
706.0,Provider,"went in my son's room because he did not clean his room with a garbage bag and I just started throwing stuff in a garbage bag and he's like don't throw that away, but I told you, if you did not do something with this room, I was just going to toss and Sure enough, he cleaned his room."
9444.0,Patient,"yeah I did that I threw beds away and all like i'm not fucking kidding because Lucas, so I. Lucas and Matthew both with a bed until I don't know in Matthew doesn't Lucas does sometimes but he's on medicine that helps them but. Like I kept telling him like if if you don't I shouldn't have to remind you every night to take your medicine like you're old enough to do that, like but. he's better now, but I was mattress away because I can't stand the smell for one. And for to like if you pee on your clothes put them in the fucking washer it's fucking simple. Lehman the fucking bathroom I cannot stand that Fuck I can't stand that. So he's better with that now, but I mean when he has his without moments like he has a dresser of their flipped over upside down and me and him both broke the door off of the. bedroom door and I it's just. God."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no I mean you're under a lot of stress and I just really think it's it's that time that you need to delegate. With those boys, give them some responsibility and have a negative consequences they don't follow through and during the time that they're doing something so that takes something off your plate do something for you. yeah, whether it be take a nap take a bubble bath go for a walk whatever it is, during that time that they need to be working on whatever task, it is that you assign them do something for you, because it's going to release a lot of that tension. And before you go to bed at night, I want you to practice breathing so taking deep breaths in and like kind of vision that you're filling up with light. And then, when you breathe out vision envision that you're getting rid of all the negativity and stress like it's just leaving your body. And do that, like three times it'll put you to into like a relaxation place and hopefully clear your mind a little bit so you can relax and hopefully go to sleep."
9444.0,Patient,Okay. As I know you're not supposed to or what's your name. Sarah so. Okay.
706.0,Provider,um I mean she's she's you know. she's in the group that you were in I mean she's I can't really tell you a whole lot obviously I know that you guys kind of get really connected and. um when you could I suppose you could try and find her if you wanted to reach out to her like.

She was more talkative this week, but she's not how she was, and I know people get in their stress my senior under stress, which is how I know like there's a difference. Because i've seen it where he stressed out and i've seen I don't know I just uh huh I feel like you ever she's around is not good, because clearly people get higher on their chest market i'm sure."
706.0,Provider,"yeah like I said I can't really I can't really say anything but if you're if you're concerned you mean you can try and definitely find her and reach out to her and just say you know hey I mean that's completely up to you, I just obviously. As it there and."

Real situation definitely try and get an appointment made with Isaiah I will also try and. an email and let him know that you want to maybe look at taking something for anxiety. You know, even if it is you know just until things calm down a little bit. You know, but it might be that you like it so much and how you feel you might just want to stay on it, you may have had anxiety and depression, this whole time but everything so chaotic you just couldn't identify it."
