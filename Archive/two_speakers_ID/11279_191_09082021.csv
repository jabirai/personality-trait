11279.0,Patient,Dr saw.
191.0,Provider,"hello, how are you doing miss JASMINE."
11279.0,Patient,"I think i'm just going through the motions of not knowing what I should do, or knowing what I should do and not wanting to. there's a lot going on with my relationship and stuff so. I know the last time we had talked on I told you that there was a little bit devotee going on and stuff well. He had told me, it was done talking to her and I caught him talking to her again under a male's name and her phone and. This is someone that you work with and sees every day, and so I basically had to frickin manipulate in to get the truth, out of them, but I got the truth, out of them as to what was really going on with this girl. um and it will it's something I needed to hear, but something I didn't want to know what same time you know but i'd rather know they're not know. So now, now that he's caught he's apologetic he's crying he said I think it's just like a front to get me to want to stay. And i'm really having a hard time believing anything right now so um I don't know I I am working, a few days a week, which is it's Nice, it gives me a little bit of a sense of purpose um but i'm having a hard time wanting to come home from work. At night. Because I know he wakes up from me and. I don't know if I need to just take a break, or what but i'm struggling."
191.0,Provider,yeah I think the last time.
11279.0,Patient,"Last time I was in this headspace of because i'm not emotional anymore and i'm in the i'm just like I feel nothing anymore i'm like lost like I don't know what to feel anymore and i'm like shut it off somehow. And the last time I was in this headspace was um was when I relaxed I stopped taking my meds I stopped doing everything I stopped going to appointments I just I didn't want to feel like this anymore, so I think that. I don't know i'm trying to. Do this the right way, instead of. I don't know stead of screwing up this time because I don't want to screw up all of my sobriety i've come a really long way and. I know this is a lot that's going on, but I don't I don't want to I don't want to screw up my life, just because i'm going through hard times so."
191.0,Provider,"I think that's a lot of wisdom to say debts, and I want you to take it, not only to I don't want to, but Ashley. Saying i'm not going to because. So far you, you have it. And you know something it's a question that comes to my mind, where you were saying that I, I, like the fact that you've been honest about this so many people will just brush it under the rug and live a lie, I love the fact that you chase after the truth. yeah so that's one form or strength, so now that you've chased after the truth is being strong enough to handle the truth and. looks like you're handling is."
11279.0,Patient,What i'm gonna.
191.0,Provider,"yeah what you're going to do with it. But you know something. One of the most important thing, sometimes we think we got to get from point A to Point B, but the truth is assaulted in between that you really got to deal with and. and honestly if you're sober in the in between you'll have the strength to do with it, so if you go out and you said you've been in this headspace before I like the fact that you recognize."
11279.0,Patient,"What you've done in the past, do. You recognize when i'm in the headspace I just I don't want to do it anymore, and I don't want to deal anymore, and I just get to this this web of. effort you know, and when I get to the headspace that just screw everything it's not a good place to be for me because that's where I screw up the most so what. i'm really feeling it right."
191.0,Provider,Would that benefit you or you.
11279.0,Patient,"know all right, no not at all."
191.0,Provider,"is really what it will hurt you, it will really hurt you, you could lose your kids I mean that's what happened. A lot of women, if you throw up your hand and say I follow this and yeah that honestly I hate to say it that's that's that's given up that's the easy way out in the pain. right that pain that numbness it's like. That escape yeah. yeah. And you know some JASMINE. It hurts it, even though you don't feel it you see it in front of you, and sometimes you're asking feel your. pain, even if your heart is not because you see what's gone it's like you're walking through this this movie and you're the main character, but you can't necessarily get."
11279.0,Patient,caught up yet. yeah.
191.0,Provider,"yeah, but I want you to stay strong you have so many good reasons to stay strong you got a lot of support and a lot of good direction from the group yesterday."
11279.0,Patient,"Thank you, I really appreciate that group I I missed it today, because I think my insurance only covers one appointment a day and I really wanted to have a one on one with you. So oh little girls up hold on one second baby we go."
191.0,Provider,she's actually already. Beautiful.
11279.0,Patient,"People sleep on my bed, and I let her sleep on the bed, but she's moving around and in scooting herself now so oh i'm scared to leave her home in bed."
191.0,Provider,"Oh, see look."
11279.0,Patient,When she wakes up it's gonna fall off.
191.0,Provider,"she's getting so quickly, look at that beautiful. Okay, oh. Oh good day. See you see that just brings up that does bring something out and make a. Decision a beautiful laughs Oh, my goodness. You got so many beautiful reasons. You get so many beautiful reasons just what. You do, and I know that yeah."
11279.0,Patient,"I want to believe that. It can sorry, and I want to believe that you know he's a lot younger than me, and you know he we just had a baby and he engaged to me and he's kind of using that as like a. he's he told me that it shocked him realizing that you know we were going to be together and we had all of this, and he didn't want to accept it and I get that that's a totally normal thing. to happen, but. The part where he really screwed up is i'm a very rational rational reasonable person and. If you feel like you need to find something somewhere. else that's fine, but you need to have the respect for me at least to talk to me about it first. And I think that that's that's where he must he didn't want to talk about it because we didn't want to lose me and he didn't want to lose our kids and he just wasn't sure what he wanted to do. And again that's fine but. You got to tell me when you're in that headspace and I want to believe that he sorry but there's just so many lies tied into this I don't know what to believe anymore."
191.0,Provider,So i'm.
11279.0,Patient,asking you to go up.
191.0,Provider,"As a lot sounds like at that point in time, he wanted to have his cake and eat it too. You know. What i'm hearing and you can tell me if i'm hearing this he. He enjoys. He liked loves the fam. The idea of faith family but it sounds like he wanted freedom, so he wanted to have tubers and one. In these two hands. But he has data, he can't have both because you have not. know it to a poly. amaury relationship. where he can. Have a relationship outside of you and be okay with. It you see what i'm saying."
11279.0,Patient,So that's shells reactor yeah. yeah very.
191.0,Provider,yeah.
11279.0,Patient,"I am. Oh, he said that he screwed up and he sees he sees his mistakes and he's not going to do them again, but again i'm having a hard time believing that I know that, right now, he feels that way but. I do, I know a couple months from now he's not going to jump right back into that the right the next. The next person, you know that brings a little bit of joy out of them that isn't me how do I know he's not just gonna I don't know i'm just i'm really struggling with this and, in the sense, where, if it was worth it to risk it, then why isn't it worth it now."
191.0,Provider,"Like you, you bring up a good point, because the truth is, you don't know you don't know, but what you do notice, you have to make a decision."
11279.0,Patient,"For your peace of mind, I."
191.0,Provider,"Think part of your it's sort of like making a decision will give you this, too, because you're very you like having a foundation. And that's what Jamie has represented to you, you knew what you were going to do. Because you knew, you were committed to him and committed to your children you got up every morning you had your plan so now everything is like this. And the only way that you're going to stop it from being like this, because the trust is out of the relationship is that you're going to have to make a decision based on wisdom based on evidence okay. know what can decide what you're right or wrong is i've known some women who have. Women and men so it's not a gender thing women and men who have stayed in the situations, but they made up their mind is that will stay with this i'ma give it a chance. And I will be at peace i'm not gonna keep beating myself up in my head, because I stay and then i've had some that say look, this is my personality type, I know I can't stay i'm going to leave, and if we reunite later on, then we reunite because."
11279.0,Patient,that's where i'm conflict.
191.0,Provider,"Right, the conflict is trying to make a decision, where you can move because right now it's hard for you to move forward, one way or the other. yeah and it's it's a decision, ultimately, it is really it's really in the decision is really in your lap and I understand you don't want to make the wrong decision but. The truth be told, a lot of your decision that's being made is based on faith, if you stay is with the belief that he's going to not do this again. And if you leave with the belief that you can't believe that he won't do it again, but you don't want to mix kicked from under you again like that what i'm hearing you say because i've been listening to yes so. But the main thing, the main thing right now JASMINE is your safety understand what he's done understand what you're feeling on understand your decisions for right now, if you're not safe your children are not saying we're here for this appointment. And one reason only ensure safety. What do we need to do to be."
11279.0,Patient,"Ultimately, you know."
191.0,Provider,I know we.
11279.0,Patient,"talked about. I know we had talked before about me, maybe upping my prescription, this was before I was in this headspace and I thought that I could handle it, I thought I knew the whole truth, you know. I thought that I was going to be able to deal with this properly and now I just feel like it's bigger than me and I don't feel as rational, as I should and. I think, maybe we should have my prescription for a little bit."
191.0,Provider,Why do you feel you need a dose increase I need to understand your head space as the medication.
11279.0,Patient,"Well, because i'm my triggers are back my night terrors or at a peak i'm not sleeping I can't eat I feel like it's not lasting as long as it should, and I feel like. I feel like a lot of that's tied into the extra stress and."
191.0,Provider,Never signed on Americans. Are you able to sleep.
11279.0,Patient,"No i'm shaking I sleep, but I I wake up at least three times a night and it's not even due to the baby it's crazy. i'll fly out of my sleep at 12 and then again between two and three, and then i'm up between four and five, and when i'm up the middle time when i'm up it's like it's like i'm up up like I can't go back to sleep. Okay. When I don't know. Sometimes it's from like a bad dream, but. I don't know I just had this whole sense of. I don't know i'm just really struggling right now."
191.0,Provider,"And it would be like you're more in a panic. Okay, have you been I want you to meet with the therapist more to, because the truth is mm hmm the coping, we have to. Work with the coping and the comfort. And, and you you're such a expressive person you express yourself extremely will. Just lead. And, and that so therapeutic the way you communicate this is how I feel this is why. you're very concrete about how and why. So you don't leave. Much of an argument. To not just admit the truth or anyone, because you. seem like you're. Not you, you talk about your emotions, but you also. Talk about the facts."
11279.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know I think it's just a big old case of heart over mind right now, I just have to choose between my heart and my mind, they really, really, really got to think about it, because. that's where I guess that's where that's where a lot of this ties in because I don't want to think about it, I don't want to deal with this, I don't want to be in this situation, but I don't have a choice anymore so. I don't want. Right."
191.0,Provider,it's a suggestion I want you to think about taking your power back you have a choice. You always have a choice. Okay um.
11279.0,Patient,I know I just. And I don't have a choice but to make a decision right now it's i'm struggling making the decision.
191.0,Provider,"Exactly, and you know just Lynn. And this may sound really odd you're not a victim. Okay, you, you were at home, taking care of your family you're working together, he made a decision you're not a victim that was well that's his mistake and that's the thing I want you to realize in this situation you're not a victim. Okay, this is not a defect. This is not a defeat, because you couldn't control what he did."
11279.0,Patient,Right.
191.0,Provider,So sometimes you know when we make a decision standing on a mountain top versus. standing in Valley. We make better decisions when we can see let's see see the horizon. yeah see the horizon for what it is don't make your decision in the valley. stand on a mountain because you're not a victim. you're not beat down you're not second class your day any of that he made it he made fusion this doesn't change your value or worth.
11279.0,Patient,"You say that's how. that's how I was before I found out, he was still talking to her and what it really happened and stuff I was just in such a state of anxiousness I couldn't stop crying I mean, I still wasn't sleeping or eating, but it was like. It was like over emotional. She didn't know how to function. Now i'm functioning, but I don't feel any of those things all i'm seeing right now are that and um. I don't know I feel like I hate using the word hate but. I feel like part of me hates him right now and i'm trying to figure out. Why like what like what what is the purpose of this like, why did this happen, and how is it not going to happen again."
191.0,Provider,Right.
11279.0,Patient,"Your anchor and I think if I don't get entered if I don't get answers from that, then I don't know if I can stay here, how are we going to the what is the plan to you know. know how to not get yourself back into the situation again because he has to go to work every day and see this person i'm really struggling with that too."
191.0,Provider,We but that's a good. So.
11279.0,Patient,If they have or do. They see their everyday.
191.0,Provider,"that's Do you realize JASMINE that a lot of people will be in that same situation, let me get this straight this personal is cause all this, one of the calls causative factors of all this pain you in her you still go and go to work and Syria, every day, so it's still like. The temptation is there is right there every day. Eight hours a day, five days a week. No that's very valid JASMINE that's fair about it, can he be transferred to a different location."
11279.0,Patient,"I told him I said i'd like for him to look for a different job I didn't ask him to quit or anything but I said i'd like for you to at least look for a different job and he said um. He said no, which is understandable, he makes $28 an hour he's the only mechanic for it's it's like a trash company he works at the landfill. He works on all of their equipment he's the only mechanic there he makes really, really good money and I get it, but right now, it doesn't matter to me right now that's not with me, so I don't know I don't know."
191.0,Provider,"Right so so you have to deal with that potential because there's always. Like a contract it's like a conflict of interest you feel like every time I go to work, no I get it."
11279.0,Patient,"Right. He thought, really, really hard to keep this girl in his life and all the secrets all the lies all the deception and I just I have a hard time believing that they're just not going to talk ever again, you know I just I can't believe that."
191.0,Provider,message oh that's a very logical conclusion.
11279.0,Patient,yeah oh we're going.
191.0,Provider,"horsey ride the horses, so you have a very logical conclusion, but once again. Your your safety is paramount. Your safety as parent is the most important thing right now, and your safety is linked. To the safety of the children So how do we keep you say. You say in that you have triggers. Are you having created are you having withdrawals."
11279.0,Patient,"Yes. Yes, what."
191.0,Provider,Are you here.
11279.0,Patient,"um well, I think, I think that the the repeating patterns of. Things like this happening before and me going into the effort headspace I think i'm working and not wanting to go home and just finding any excuse to not come home to go out and like drink or go hang out with friends that aren't really safe to hang out with or like."
191.0,Provider,Have you been hanging out with us for i'm.
11279.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I haven't done anything like that, yet I mean we may not coming home late at night so far has has been me going to walmart for a couple of hours and walking around English. But i'm scared for that to turn into something else. Like it did the last time."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so how are you going to prevent that medicines and not going to prevent that what are you gonna do."
11279.0,Patient,"I know I know I know i'm gonna. I don't know, I have to get up really early every morning i'm just going to really, really tried to stay on my horse not get knocked off of it."
191.0,Provider,Okay well let's start with one show next.
11279.0,Patient,um I have to make one I think it's next. i'm going to make one with our next week for next week.
191.0,Provider,"So you're going to see your therapist next week, because sometimes when we're feeling vulnerable, we need accountability. Right just called accountability see therapist next week, do you need to see me. again next week."
11279.0,Patient,"um. it's up to you if, maybe I I think I think seeing one of you a week should be good for right now."
191.0,Provider,I see Stacey next week.
11279.0,Patient,Maybe the week after.
191.0,Provider,And then you have your group on Tuesday. Okay. Do you have a friend or anybody that you can call and check in with. Do you have a sober friend that has a family that.
11279.0,Patient,"mm hmm I have my sister, and I have my sister in law okay sister is my best friend that's how we met in my sister, which is my brother's wife. they're both kind of my sister in law but they're they're the only people beside him that are my sober rocks on this earth they're really the only people I talked to outside of home so yeah I can call anytime. day or night to talk to them, and I have, I have been utilizing that you know I mean they both know everything that's."
191.0,Provider,been going on.
11279.0,Patient,"Just in case you know I were to make a stupid irrational decision you know they could understand, maybe you're gonna fall. I don't know I just I want them to know where my head's at what's going on and right."
191.0,Provider,We want you to his. You know.
11279.0,Patient,"Before before I wouldn't I would handle everything alone and not talk to anyone about it, and nobody would know where my head was at, and I feel like that ultimately led to me screwing up faster."
191.0,Provider,yeah I feel like if I tell everybody or the couple of people that I talked to in love and care about what's going on with me and then it'll it'll keep me.
11279.0,Patient,"accountable, I guess, no."
191.0,Provider,yeah kiki.
11279.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"very wise very, very wise, so if we see you missing beautiful baby look at. So we see you miss and we're going to be concerned. Because the isolation healthy or you have any withdrawals."
11279.0,Patient,"i'm. Not right now. I feel like they at night at night I think it's because i'm working more it wears off a little bit faster at night. time I come home. it's not working out sure, but right now i'm okay little girl you're going. Oh okay we're gonna put she's freaking me out. yeah she's got."
191.0,Provider,"A little wiggle she's like look, you know they turn to those little. wiggle arms at that age, you know."
11279.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,yeah we'll go right off your hand.
11279.0,Patient,"You know, when she feels like she's not gonna fall and nobody's somebody's going to be there to catch. His little girl not have to jump out of my hands you silly."
191.0,Provider,girl there you go. I understand your concern if anybody holes and they just wiggle and move so much oh. yeah.
11279.0,Patient,yeah she's she likes to jump around right now to figure it out for the scoop she just messaged me pulling yourself up and crawling any day now.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, it looks like we'll think about adding the lowest dose to a nighttime. Just the lowest those to the nighttime dose."
11279.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and we'll just watch it. Now, when it comes to this, you know you got to go through prior authorization. Yes, why that process oh gosh I could take days okay. So what I usually share with people is that me at the at the next appointment. Let me just add that lowest dose there we'll and we'll talk about what's the lowest subs off dose to."
11279.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,Let me pull up your different.
11279.0,Patient,"Okay, I think i'm taking the i'm. doing the 2.9 what is it the half. yeah. yeah i'm taking. breathing breathe air right now, so I don't know if there's anything lower than that."
191.0,Provider,"yeah we have a really low dose at point seven and the thing to keep in mind is buprenorphine is really potent it's more potent and morphing right living more powerful. And so, ideally, you want to start with the lowest dose because we've got you on the three times a day, and those are going well, so I was looking at and a 2.9 and Adam one of the lowest doses to the nighttime dose. yeah. and And then that way it's it'll be easier for you to win back down to but yeah and as we're called this should be cool until about the to have this box on so. I actually have some people on like a 10 milligram and it works perfectly well for them, because it is potent I don't think people realize how important it is. yeah so we'll look at doing that, so we can add that, during the during your next group, you may have to pay out of pocket and then get reimbursed for okay. So that may be, what they'll that's usually how they'll they'll do that for you Okay, are you able to wait until that time to add the baby dose on to it."
11279.0,Patient,"yeah I can wait, I think the one that you sent me yesterday I should be able to pick up tomorrow. Tomorrow or the next day, so that one will last yeah it should I should be fine until next week."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and then, when we add should be. That plus the the little one back on, then you should. Have a. baby to get through that while they try to work on the slight dose increase."
11279.0,Patient,Because your insurance company.
191.0,Provider,"learn about our team will be working with you on it Okay, and what is withdraws that you're having wears off at night, not less than 24 what are you noticing."
11279.0,Patient,"yeah I just all around body aches and a little bit shakiness I don't have much of an appetite I don't know if that's nice what's going on, or."
191.0,Provider,"Know right, so a couple of things to do to increase. What okay wake up and sweats."
11279.0,Patient,And when I wake up in the morning i'm extra achy lately I don't know I don't know why.
191.0,Provider,"Yes, sometimes anxiety, I have people when their anxiety anxious when their tents you're not sleeping your cortisol level is. up all of that, and if your diet changes i've known people notice more pain with increase sugar. Because a lot of. feeling very bad especially emotionally we we eat things and do things that increase our propensity towards pain and when you're not sleeping if you're not eating well yeah so yeah you'll start feeling more discomfort. More discomfort day. So definitely want you to increase your therapy and do want you to do some walking Okay, I know you're usually a physically active person."
11279.0,Patient,increase the free i'm working hard.
191.0,Provider,"and decrease pop. In the caffeine, if you can because a lot of times you see what happened if we're not sleeping we increase pop. And caffeinated beverages cheeseburger and that's. not bad. yeah increase and. copy up that increases the cortisol level okay that's where your stress hormones, so you kind of see how how we how we were emotionally how we end up just kind of doing things that I increase our chances and not feeling good. Right yeah. yeah and let me ask you this, are you. Are you i'm. Working with your team in terms of depression, because you're on the abuse by so it sounds like you've got a lot of anxiety, have you talked with them about seeing an increase in that dose and how that could potentially work with anxiety."
11279.0,Patient,"Well yeah we actually lowered it because my depression was getting really bad with postpartum and stuff they lowered my anxiety, though, so i'm wondering. I have an appointment with them the next couple weeks, I was going to talk to them about maybe raising my anxiety medicine back up to normal. yeah because right now i'm sure. That I am depressed so. Right, I think that there are perfect. The perfect mix of medicine for me the. will be around makes me tired on its own in the world view from the future and makes me anxious on its own, but together they like perfectly balanced each other out for me so. I know it took me a really long time to find something that wouldn't work and it's it's Nice that i've actually found something that works. yeah I really feel like it. yeah the."
191.0,Provider,"Wrong taking that up so look at the anxiety dose or talk with your mental health provider about increasing the be spiral because we're only going to do. A short dose of. Low dose of the up North I mean yeah the buprenorphine subs off and the thing is is. For many people want to increase that boost fire on it. addresses the anxiety, you may feel that your sub solve it's better to because it's all working within body, because I noticed with subs all. Those medicines people know it helps with anxiety to okay. You can write quick question any thoughts of plans of harming yourself or anyone else."
11279.0,Patient,know.
191.0,Provider,Seeing or hearing anything that's not there.
11279.0,Patient,No.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so we've got that taken care of. For you, and. I know we'll continue to work on that got your medicines any medication change. And you said no known drug allergies, is that the same."
11279.0,Patient,Yes.
191.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, great great and what are you doing for birth control."
11279.0,Patient,I have an iud. Okay i'm done Marina.
191.0,Provider,"Okay gotcha okay do, and I know you're currently dealing with us some anxiety and depression, are you feeling depressed."
11279.0,Patient,i'm. A little bit. of that.
191.0,Provider,"And so, keep working with Stacey because I know that you all have she has a lot of great ideas and and it looks like you're kind of. way and how you should do it, and maybe the next couple of days, to give you a good idea, but I like what she recommended in a group also support it was getting away. So you can just be at peace and not have a feeling like you're up next so you can pull away and have a neutral place to make an objective system decision based out of wisdom, because if you're seeing me you constantly have the emotion of anger anger.
