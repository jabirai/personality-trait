15460.0,Patient,"yep i'm feeling a lot better and and i'm starting to you know just like. I mean, some of the feelings that I was like numbing before like it's just like a lot of things that I would like to like as far as films and so now like it's almost like if it's a rush of everything like i'm constantly thinking. And I didn't do that and I need to do this and but as far as like physically and i'm doing a lot better."
304.0,Provider,Good yeah you know you mentioned that on Tuesday how excuse me it's like yeah you you're finally attending to those things that you neglected. yeah that you neglected first you know just yeah bills piling up for just things around your House so.
15460.0,Patient,"Now for sure and and, of course, you know being like. Christmas time and, like. i'm i'm lucky i've got no money for the kids for Christmas but it's like you know i'm not working right now. So it's like a lot of times like i'm just like at home during the day, while the kids are at school and so. Like it's just more getting through that you know, just like the regret of like how much you know this last year that I just think we did so that's you know that's hard but but i'm working through that."
304.0,Provider,"yeah in, and you know kind of reflecting on that, but also just thinking that moving forward and how you're you're doing so much different now this time around."
15460.0,Patient,yeah no for sure. That important me.
304.0,Provider,And how old are your kids Angela. 14 and 714 and seven okay oh and um you said you're not working right now. I know what kind of work have you done in the past.
15460.0,Patient,"Up until like I always worked in like an office setting until like three years ago I moved back down to where i'm at now and. Then I started cooking in a restaurant and then, once I like started like before I started this is all became too much for me, so I. ended up quitting that job, so I i'm not even sure like what i'm going to go back you know if i'm to go back and try to do for office stuff like I did over your over the years. um I don't know if i'm go back to any restaurant type of work but but i'm out i'm exploring that right now I guess."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah kind of weighing your options yeah yeah and just sort of right now you're kind of focusing on your recovery and just sort of getting physically better and okay um and what what kind of support, do you have at home Angela do you have family or a partner."
15460.0,Patient,"um my I live with my my kids and my mom was across town and my husband you think you've been recovery to like such a. Good like if if you took addiction out of it we've been best friends for like 17 with such a good relationship, except for you know being to addicts and a relationship is so hard because we feed off of each other Okay, he. He wants to get on this program to, but he he kind of like nervous because he saw how like I put myself into withdrawal at the beginning, so much because i'm still using so he's like right now he is sober but it's like you just like a hair trigger away from from not be. So note back from so I can have privacy. yeah."
304.0,Provider,yeah and you know people don't have to be like in full blown withdrawal to be eligible so yeah they can come in anytime if if they wanted and needed.
15460.0,Patient,"Why Thank you see you now like that, now that everything, even out that it's like because we years ago 10 years ago we were on suboxone um but. The insurance only covered, it was like a two years lifetime maximum so at that point we tried, as hard as we could to pay out of pocket, but it was so expensive that we. shouldn't, and I mean that neither of us had ever failed a drug test the whole time that we are on it, you did so good, and then you just saw like how come so this time around. he's like it's just it's so different from the last time i'm like I think it's because the last time I was like. awesome everything, for you know I wasn't just waiting for to be sick enough to take it, I was already off of everything for a little bit, but um but yeah so that's so i've got a good support my family is very supportive and he's very supportive. So so yeah and it's just hard with two addicts know trying to be in recovery."
304.0,Provider,yeah so i'm like you guys have been kind of using together for a lot of your your relationship really.
15460.0,Patient,"We did it for like at the beginning of our relationship. After our oldest daughter was born so we've been together for about a year it was about a year after she was born, we we both started it started out with. pain pills that were prescribed by a doctor and the doctor, was it was like a huge just prescribe anything, and we were young and stupid and didn't really realize like you know we didn't know we are addicted until we were basically so that yeah so over the years. we've both been. Using we usually are both you think, but they were injured covered, we always look at the other one hops on and we stay in recovery together it just ends up something you know triggers one of us and we fall off."
304.0,Provider,So that seems like it was really tricky if one of you slept than the other one would.
15460.0,Patient,mm hmm.
304.0,Provider,"yeah I would really encourage him Angela yeah that that he could get in the program to. yeah just for him for both of you guys, for your kids and do it together. If you guys like are not comfortable being kind of in the same group, which I think we're going to kind of start looking at that, because we have a few couples, so we do now have three doctors in Illinois. And, and several therapists so you guys feel more comfortable like you can't be in different groups. So yeah but yeah that's that's part of what you guys will kind of have to learn to yet to kind of change your patterns and sort of break out of that. You know. Your own addiction patterns, but then your your patterns as a couple and kind of that codependency in. Seattle around recovery yeah. Well, you got a lot you're dealing with a lot Angela. yeah, what do you feel like is your biggest motivator right now for staying clean."
15460.0,Patient,"My kids. Yes, I. I just don't like when you know when i'm working and i'm and i'm."
304.0,Provider,sober and feel like.
15460.0,Patient,"Like you know we're always doing things and we're always going places and I don't want my kids to miss out on you know the the good things in life, because you know i'm struggling with addiction, so my kids are definitely my biggest motivator."
304.0,Provider,yeah and I bet they're already noticing the difference in you.
15460.0,Patient,"know they have. yep. Now, and you know and with my younger one. You know it's just it was easier because you'd be like Oh well, i'm not really feeling, you know. i'm not feeling good steak or whatever you want like older what he or she she noticed that you know everything you know, and so, and if they do that doing and I don't want that to be something that they look back on it, you know, have a shitty childhood because because of their mom."
304.0,Provider,"Right, so what are, what are your goals for yourself Angela like you know short term kind of just being in recovery, but like when you think about your long term goals, like what what sort of comes to mind, for you long term."
15460.0,Patient,"I want to start working again and I want to get that. Financial stability that I that I. had before, and I just want to work on the the relationship in my life with my kids and my family in general I want those become as strong as they were when you know when i've been in recovery. So really like that getting a job it's it's really important to me just as always, as always been working and when i'm not I almost like a sense of like. I don't know like i'm just I don't feel like i'm like contributing I don't feel. Good about myself."
304.0,Provider,yeah just that sense of.
15460.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And you know if you do something like with with office work like you've done in the past, maybe if it's during the day, like your kids are at school. yeah yeah. Reza you know restaurants, I think, are are okay, you know we've had maybe one person, and she was pretty far into recovery and she started working at. Like a bar like a very far far and it was kind of routing and she's like you know I forgot what it's like to be around all these drunk people and. i'm like yeah you know, maybe not not the best environment for for somebody in recovery, but yeah you know I mean but, but you know restaurants, who are are different but yeah maybe find what you like, and maybe this will be a chance for you to try something new."
15460.0,Patient,"yeah that's true and what I like the last time I like really like looks for jabbing years ago and when i'm like look i'm like. there's just so much actually out there more than when I was like setting and i'm like I do have feel. way more options than some kind of what I thought before I first moved here, you know I didn't have my car wasn't working so I had to find somewhere close that had to you know to be able to get back and forth, but now. I don't know so i'm it's looking like a hopeful it's just a lot, right now, especially around the holidays so i'm probably just gonna wait until after Christmas to actually really like putting out with you should I just don't want to start anything like right before Christmas."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely and I think like you said just. Taking that time to repair the relationship with your kids like you and your husband are also going to kind of have. Some new things you know to learn together and then just us an individual like you were used to like Oh, I feel, something I don't like that feeling so i'm going to use something. Excuse me, and just like yeah numbing those feelings and so learning how to really cope with those feelings and not run away from them. yeah yeah and healing your relationships that's that's all all part of it so."
15460.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,Well i'm i'm so happy that you're here Angela me I really hope it if your husband feels like he just wants that support. For him to give it a try.
15460.0,Patient,"yeah I think he's gonna go and we're going in that direction for sharing everything that I gave you, but I go back home like. I think he's a boy he's like feel better i'm like I do because it's like i'm you know, in a place where you know, everybody, you know. They understand, and you know everybody's going through a lot of the same things that and I was going through. I said, if you really you should just you know, keep that same insurance, so you know he can do it too it's like. I just know that it would it would be like the best thing for both because, when one of us is it completely on the other, ones that it never works is always full you know, on the page that works yeah."
304.0,Provider,"And you're going to be such an amazing testament to him, because if he's feeling like you know he's just barely hanging on by a thread um. I think like you know when when he meets with the doctors they'll tell him all of the things about how it works and it's filling those receptors like right now his brain has opiate receptors are just like wide open. For you know those opioids and so having the suboxone just fills it and just closes that gap. In it, and you know the cravings the withdrawal, like all of that, and then kind of like the way that I think about suboxone is it it then it frees people up to actually like do therapy. You really can't feel your feelings and think about all the things that you want to change in your life and. The reasons you started using and cope with your feelings your cope with your trauma or whatever when like you're in withdrawal and you're thinking about pills all the time that you really can't. Work on those things you know."
15460.0,Patient,"ya know. And that's like the truth, because it's like it that. That was always number one in my mind, no matter what. Other priorities that has, you know that was like the first thing with getting right, you know, and then, then I could feel you know and instill all my still not you know, but I know for sure."
304.0,Provider,"And even to stay sober if it's like don't use drugs don't use drugs don't use drugs and that's like all you can you know if someone's not on on suboxone and they're just like don't use don't use don't use and it takes all of their energy. Which is great like that's great that they're not using but like it just takes all their mental and emotional energy to have to just don't use don't use you can't really work on all the other stuff. So that's kind of how I would present it to him and yeah for you guys to do this together, I think it's just going to be the best thing for both of you, and like each of you in as individuals as a couple as a family."
15460.0,Patient,For sure.
304.0,Provider,"yeah cuz you guys are like a couple, but each part of the each part of the couple of each part of the family has to get as healthy as they can be you know for the family to be healthy."
15460.0,Patient,yeah you're right.
304.0,Provider,"And you guys want that. You know you want that for yourself and. You want that, for your kids so."
15460.0,Patient,We definitely do.
304.0,Provider,"What was so good to see you Angela gosh i've been talking all day. um yeah it's gonna be I know um yeah i'll See you in group and then yeah whenever your husband's ready, you know we'll get him plugged into, however, that works for you guys, I am taking like a little bit of time off around the holidays.
