383.0,Provider,hi Joe how are you doing.
5644.0,Patient,Good how are you.
383.0,Provider,"pretty good thanks. So I was just wondering how things were going we had talked about transitioning. Why needed. To get into services. In your county, how is that going have you gotten any. calls from from the county or anything. Oh, I can't hear you."
5644.0,Patient,"What happened here oh there. Okay um yeah so we. got a hold of the the. For the for the county and they set it up, Dr webber for her last week, she went to the doctors appointment they evaluated her and they said that. You have yeah they said, because that she's not it's not mental health mental health issue where she it, it was born like that or or natural health issue that. That they couldn't do no services for her that they wouldn't have to recommend her to another non county entity. For services and I was like well she has a therapist and a and a psychiatry other like Oh, she does wow okay well that's all we're going to do is prescriber you mean get her a therapist would stay agreed and all the things that you know we already know that you know she has. The tbi and as you're covering and but they're just saying they can't do nothing for her as far as the county because. She is not it's because of a traumatic traumatic brain injury, not a mental health issue. So we've tried to get a hold of shontelle again when you're trying to set appointment for her and we wanted to talk to you about it because. They said that within 10 days 10 business days they were going to call and refer her to a therapist or another actress But then when I told them that charity had them a non county. You know, through bright heart health and she they were like wow okay well that's all we're going to do all we're going to be able to do. The doctor told me that, from the county."
383.0,Provider,So the doctor that you went to see from the county was that a psychiatrist that you went to see or was that a primary care doctor.
5644.0,Patient,"I am not sure man like. It was a county doctor but i'm chantelle it gave us a number on the referral for us to call to get find out, you know the evaluation and the doctor, so we did that. And i'm being honest with you i'm not sure if it was a primary care or a psychologist but. He evaluated juanita and it was basically like psychiatry I believe you know the questions in the thing she had to go to the appointment she had and they that's he that's what he called back and said hey, this is what we can help her with scanning services because she's not. it's not a mental health issue."
383.0,Provider,"I mean The thing is, is that she's had mental health issues right, I mean she's had she had this psychosis she had the depression. And those those are not present for her at this time I mean from what you are observing."
5644.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean you know the book because of the medications she's taking and you know I think things are on a good good note right now. Well, six months ago they weren't. You know and."
383.0,Provider,Right right right.
5644.0,Patient,"So you know and then it's been up and down since it happened, but I was all new to us and i'm we're just doing the best we can. And that's what they. that's what he told us, I wanted to tell you, and john tell what Would he say cuz I was like stuff you know, like."
383.0,Provider,Right sure.
5644.0,Patient,we're going to refer to you guys for coming services and you're telling us we can't get them like.
383.0,Provider,"Well, what what the thought was is that she needed a higher level of care, which means that you know if you if you're. physically in a certain place, you can actually go to a certain office. You can also maybe get in home services that could help her with like activities of daily living, which I think would really benefit her to have someone maybe come there to the House and maybe do a functional assessment and maybe help her with some. day to day organizational things do you think I would be helpful for."
5644.0,Patient,"Her that's exactly what I told them because that's what we ensure to tell and I had discussed she said that she was she wanted and with your. input as well that's exactly what I told the doctor is what you just told me now, and he was like well. she's not it's not a mental health issue it's a tbi which caused it so there's nothing there's no services that she's qualified for, and I just was like okay well, what can we do so we're waiting for them to call they were suggesting another. None yeah with Reinhard health or with another one I forgot the name of it. yeah but they gave us your number back brand hard helps number we're like we already have psychiatrists and. therapists with bright heart and they're like oh wow Okay, we we didn't know you had any services but that's all we can do for you guys."
383.0,Provider,What shawnee county do you do you reside.
5644.0,Patient,San Joaquin county.
383.0,Provider,"salad King county okay. i'm. Okay. You know I am not privy to all the services that San Joaquin county has available I worked for another county and I know that we had services that involved connecting. You know, going. To people's homes and so forth, and helping them and. You know there's there's other anyway, I of course. I we were hoping for a higher level of care, you know sort of. something a little bit more hands on a little bit more."
5644.0,Patient,"exactly when I told them like I said and I was perplexed that they said that you know the side of. You know, mental health issue it's a tbi that caused it so it's there's no services, we can do except for for you guys to another, you know to a therapist and on county. Right."
383.0,Provider,"Here, he has he did you let them know that she had had auditory hallucinations and she was. You know, struggling with those. Yes."
5644.0,Patient,When she when she went to the appointment sorry good.
383.0,Provider,he's not on medication there's a likelihood that does symptoms would come back.
5644.0,Patient,"Right so she what she had the evaluation she reached records to them to see everything you know and they we talked about everything he. was able to see everything and he knew everything, but he said well because because it was caused by a traumatic brain injury a car accident that they couldn't do anything."
383.0,Provider,"Now I mean I don't I I will discuss that with chantel, but I think that that's a pretty. Not not a really solid reason, if someone's having. health problems, including auditory hallucinations psychosis whether or not it was physically induced or you know it wasn't something that they had you know 18 that's not a reason. To not. provide. Services, but I guess, we were shocked we were shocked, but."
5644.0,Patient,All we can do is relay the message to you guys and we hope that you know with you guys's input it'll change because we did all the steps needed to to to try to make that happen right basically tonight.
383.0,Provider,"Right right well i'm glad you made the effort to go over there. So you went over. physically to an office. or an appointment. Yes, and when was that appointment with last week, you said."
