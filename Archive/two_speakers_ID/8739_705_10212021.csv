705.0,Provider,Oh that's good you're out of the twos where they're no longer that age where they're trying to figure things out.
8739.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it was just harder this year with my my older son my 17 year old he never had that separation anxiety like he just did it he just went he just did his thing, and my younger one had a lot of that separation anxiety, so it was really hard. it's hard for him it's hard for me the mornings just start out bad and I don't want to go, you know we're not doing that anymore walking to school happy he always liked school he just didn't like the aftercare part of things, so I find I found them or write a good place. Finally, got a good place that he's happy, it took him. took him a while to get settled in there, but. But now the last couple of weeks things seem to be going much better, you know he's interacting and playing with the kids and. Participating and things they're doing and stuff now so. I was kind of a loner for a while."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, all I suggesting and making friends."
8739.0,Patient,"yeah so it's getting better it's getting better. And then we have Halloween coming and my my youngest one is turning five I can't believe he's turning five. Not this Friday, but next Friday um so yeah I don't think i'm not this Friday i'll be fine for group, but the following Friday is his birthday, and I think i'm going to take them on the train somewhere so. I may or may not. Be around for that meeting."
705.0,Provider,"No worries and I will check to because you remember last time we met, we put where you and I are going to check in monthly and then it's twice a month for groups, you can come more, but at least twice twice a month for groups. If you meet that frequency. Then you're doing well remember when we talked about it would allow you some more flexibility."
8739.0,Patient,"Okay, I know that I I didn't know that I, I thought it was every Friday so that's good okay that works better, for me. My works better. Roi I do it a couple times a month and I come more I come more I just. It just gets hard you know anyway it's just my job, I have already like taking liberties and my job because i'm dropping kids off in the morning and picking them up in the afternoon. And then i'm doing taking an hour out of. My day to do my group meetings and so i'm just catching a little slack from."
705.0,Provider,From work site. Okay. It it went out for a minute Aaron do you mind repeating what you were sharing. You were coming. No.
8739.0,Patient,I was just saying i'm getting yeah i'm getting a little flack from like you know just not being event.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
8739.0,Patient,"Here I work. Okay, because I get in we start work at eight but I don't come till like nine because i'm dropping kids off at school, and then I we we are open till five, but I have to leave by like 330 or four. To pick everybody up and then i'm also taking an hour out on Fridays for groups so they're like Aaron and i'm like I know, but these are thing I. I can't not pick up the kids I can't not take them to school and I can't miss my meetings."
705.0,Provider,"Oh no patient will probably re enter. Your back, yes, and so the last time we had talked I had adjusted the care intensity to you and I one time, a month and then group twice a month, so i'm I looked at the groups and you did too already. So with groups if you're not able to come in, you don't need to call in if you come every week, no worries. um you're muted on."
8739.0,Patient,Can you unmute sorry. yeah I am muted i'm sorry i'm it when it cuts off and cuts back on and automatically mutes me I don't know I.
705.0,Provider,"Know it's part of part of zoom but so so what that means I didn't know if you heard the end of it, you come to you've already just keep track to at least to. Two meetings per month, but you know what to Aaron i'm going to put this out there, too, because I go by, when you and I talk if you feel like to because of work, conflict and they're giving you some. flack I can reduce it to one someone you can come more if you can."
8739.0,Patient,"Okay let's let's just keep it at twice right now and I let you know. You know if we need to adjust it more, but I I like come it's not if it's hard to miss a group and then come back to group, and then you missed what they talked about the last week so you're not like. With the group on everything so it's nice to come, because then I know what's going on, and I can keep track, you know I can add in or not. So I don't want to miss so many and then it's kind of weird for me to be in God I don't know what's going on, you know."
705.0,Provider,"i'm absolutely Aaron and I would encourage you, if you can to come to come weekly if you can I understand, too, sometimes with work that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that."
8739.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, if I can log on, and then I will, and if I can't then i'll make sure I do my twice a month, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Okay. And then Okay, too, if you stay in that care intensity, because if let's say we have you at weekly and sometimes you can't make it and there's a cancellations and there's no shows. Then, your medication, you would only be able to get like maybe four day supply or sometimes they'll Bridget to 15."
8739.0,Patient,But if we go.
705.0,Provider,"Why some on but you come every week when you feel like you need the support, then that wouldn't happen with the care intensity because you'd be in compliance and it didn't then adjust with how many beds, you get."
8739.0,Patient,"Okay okay I don't want to mess with that I might my meds are good i've been on them for a long time I don't wanna. I don't want to mess with that it's fine it's thing things are fine, the way they are, I don't want to change it."
705.0,Provider,But good i'm glad that then that's had a therapeutic level and you're sleeping okay.
8739.0,Patient,"yeah I am I just I haven't what I I never I didn't know if i'd like restless leg syndrome, or something two nights this week I had like a weird sleep but. I mean, I went to sleep on my normal time but I woke up at like two or three in the morning, I also think, I had a urinary tract infection going on, so I was going getting up to go to the bathroom and like you know that's miserable. So I I think I had a combination of things going on last thing I stopped great it was fine. But I don't know. two nights this week I had like weird sleep, you know I just kept waking up and my legs are like crappy. But I got up walked around went to the bathroom and then I went back to sleep, so it was fine I think everything's fine I mean it was just a fluke thing but. Mostly I when I go to sleep i'm out I can't I since i've become a mom though I do they I I don't sleep as soundly as I used to, but like if i'm out i'm out, you know I. don't know takes a lot to wake me up."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is but it's also something like that you have that mom alert. Where it's like yes, you can be an idea sleep, but if some if if a kid I was wrestling around your library. yeah. yeah like it."
8739.0,Patient,"depends on the noise, I guess it's certain noises I will wake up for certain ones I. Oh, that was the ice maker."
705.0,Provider,"I like to that you brought into group, the other day that was nice."
8739.0,Patient,"yeah I saw somewhere and I don't even know where I saw it, but it was not it just I don't know if it just sat with me mm hmm so I wanted to share it with people there yeah. Maybe it sits well with somebody else."
705.0,Provider,"Did Aaron and I have met with a couple of people to an individual where they're like oh I don't know her name but I like what she brought in, and how she brought that into group is really neat and I was like yeah and anyone can do that so breathe it. So you started a tree yeah cool yeah cool."
8739.0,Patient,"Thank you yeah it is. Maybe people I mean things like that you know you really I don't know. Just in stressful times thinking about those kinds of things just kind of gets you through like you know you can do this just you know. Things are you know, everybody has bad things in their life we all have bad moments, but it's how you like deal with that moment, you know I don't know just. It can break you or it can make you stronger so let it make you stronger, you know learn from it grow from it. Not everything bad is bad, I mean we learn stuff out of the BAT so things you know."
705.0,Provider,Even the way you say that Aaron is self soothing because it doesn't sound like we're going to catastrophizing it's just like no bad moments we even learn from them and I liked how that's your interpretation. yeah yeah.
8739.0,Patient,"I mean nothing I can't be all peaches and cream all the time things happen things come up it's just the way you approach it and deal with it and. i've just become less stressful as I get older like I don't know if the care so much what other people think, and I do still, to an extent, but i'm going to do what i'm gonna do no matter what you think so. I don't know it just that. I guess it depends on who it's coming from as to who you if you how you take the advice or not, but you know. We all have to live in like mistakes to learn, like you, can't do everything perfectly and learn, you have to you learn from mistakes you learn from mistakes so don't want you won't do it again right."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and just like you were saying that, as you get older you care less because you have experienced and you're like okay inner circle, maybe I care what their feedback is outer circle, who cares."
8739.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to still a people pleaser I still i'm like one of the you know I want everybody to be happy, and I want everybody to. I just care about everybody's feelings and i'm in tune with other people, but. I don't think that's going away, but the caring less about other people's opinions has definitely gone Oh, a lot a lot down from what it used to be."
705.0,Provider,"And people pleasing to you know if it's had a healthy, where you like to help others, and when you can you do. However, if you really your plates to full and it sounds like you do this, where it's just like if you have like one of your kiddos has an appointment you're going to be like no I have my kids and I gotta do you know secessionist for work. yeah is it out."
8739.0,Patient,"So you can go with me. To the organization like I am not organized i'm not working eyes so having the phone how because I can put a. calendar. But sometimes I forget to put things in the phone or I don't know and then just juggling so many things all at the same time, something always something has dropped, hopefully, is less important thing that gets dropped, I mean when you have 500 things going on something's gonna give. So. I don't know I need help with organizations like I can clean, I can do that, but I can't organize very well I don't i'm not very good at like. This should go here at decorating right yeah I don't know what the word is like. When I have a bookshelf and it's just like a catch all I tried to make it look nice, but things there, but you know what it always becomes this catch all thing and then, once a year, I get over it, and I go through it and throw."
705.0,Provider,"Patient will be back hurt Internet has been in and out so patient usually will come back there, she is. Our right, I know it went on mute again. If you'll. there. yeah so I heard so it's a catch all until you're trying to get some organization, even within the home."
8739.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I think it's important for my get you know for my kids to see that and learn from that and the to be organized themselves i'm just not very good at it. So i'm working on that, right now, like i'm working on trying to declutter simplify we don't need so much krista I mean we have stuff. Like we collect stuff you know it just there's cars everywhere there's toys, they need to get donated clothes that need to go through i'm. Just never end. up with."
705.0,Provider,Were you in the Group Aaron that we were talking about setting the alarm and putting like 15 minutes and then setting the alarm and then that was done to the clutter.
8739.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I don't think so no maybe. No, but that's a good idea, so just said okay give myself a half hour to clean up or organized or do something and then just do it, and then."
705.0,Provider,And then.
8739.0,Patient,"The timer goes off be done. yeah yeah. Okay, good idea."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, you can try it and then that way you know, instead of stressing because it's like you look over the House and it's like one project to the other it's like oh look at my closet now look at my sons and bedrooms and it could go on. yeah just to do that and then it's like i'll do what I can."
8739.0,Patient,"yeah I like to pick an area I do that, like I okay today i'm gonna. i'm. just getting that drive to get up and go do it."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly I hear you Aaron and it sounds like to you're coming up with your system of what's going to work for you and, like 111 bedroom one specific task and that's it. Maybe yeah."
8739.0,Patient,kinda how I.
705.0,Provider,huh. yeah yeah.
8739.0,Patient,"Man I like checklist. You I like. I like the right, if I have a lot going on i've things to do, I like to make a list with no goals and time like Okay, no it doesn't have to be done by a certain time just make the list of everything that needs to get done and then. just pick one thing off the list do it, and then it's so satisfying to cross that off of the list, like Okay, I did that that's done and list out me to yeah."
705.0,Provider,Patient probably will return she's having connection problems.
8739.0,Patient,MAC I did the meat thing sorry okay well my Internet is so spot.

You know, talking about to like doing some counter statements. yeah I was wondering to wear when we first started the conversation about i'm not. Patient will be back she's had having Internet troubles. Okay here, did you hear what I started off with about being organized and if you encounter it."
8739.0,Patient,"know how do you count, what do I do."
705.0,Provider,"yeah what I was wanting is maybe Aaron you can do a counter statement, so instead of your you're not organized i'm hearing that you're working on some systems and things like that, today, can you share like. A better like of what it is."
8739.0,Patient,"I will get more organized i'm going to make it happen. You know and. I will I. I think it's beneficial for everybody, you know. First, it makes you not so grouchy when you wake up, because you wake up in a messy House and you just start your day that way so that's for me I don't like makes me like you know I can't see that. So I like things to just be you know i'm not OCD but i'm two lakhs on you know not putting things away so I need to get better i'm gonna get better at organizing."
705.0,Provider,Better because i'm already hearing you have different systems you're exploring trying it out. And nothing's wrong with if you're trying to see what's going to work and sometimes that might change too.
8739.0,Patient,yeah yeah exactly.
705.0,Provider,"If there's ever a time to Aaron that in between does I know November 18 is a ways if there's something that you want to talk about always you can either text the virtual clinic to set up a meeting or call them. Were. You know just because we're once a month doesn't mean that we can't meet more often, if you need it."
8739.0,Patient,Okay. Okay sounds good.
