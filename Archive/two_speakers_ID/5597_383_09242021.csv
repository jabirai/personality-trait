5597.0,Patient,hi amanda.
383.0,Provider,Good how are you.
5597.0,Patient,"Good I know it's been. Like two and a half weeks or almost three weeks. I may speak in a kind of lower tone because i'm up the family cabin. That, I have a voice machine, but let me know if you can't hear me or anything."
383.0,Provider,pretty much.
5597.0,Patient,"A hush hush to voice. i'm just i'm yeah i've been talking Oh, I made it out of Texas. Which i'm kind of relieved. and happy for the most part with how a lot of things went down, you know the show, I think, is a success in some ways, I think, in some other ways it's not. it's it helps me, I think, to not be there to feel maybe the pressure day to day, and also the fact that it wasn't really a traditional job and the sunset. Some of these responsibilities, I felt the weight of I don't think I like deserve to feel the weight of or I know a lot of it kind of ways, more heavily as it should, on my boss who's kind of the person renting the space and kind of the principle of the space. But it's like I it's one of those like i'm okay with like how I did or I guess i'm just jumping right into what I feel inclined to talk about which is you know the last month and a half or two months. it's like I feel good and content with my performance, but I also feel yeah like there's things that could have done better or there's. places in which I got tripped up by old habits or behaviors that I just continue to want to work on and I wasn't anticipating being here at the cabin at the family cabin and that's been pretty nice actually the last couple days. I was kind of in transition, I was going to maybe have this third interview for a job in upstate New York. And so I was in California and just figured I would come up here my mom was up here and i'm also visiting with my younger brother who's had cancer scare recently that came up and my sister in law so it's kind of. Nice, I mean I feel like already i've been so tested. With stuff i've kind of you know, expressed her frustrations or struggles i've had kind of, say, like with my mom. i've already kind of feel like i've been tested my last few days, but at the same time, like. i'm very proud of how i'm able to kind of handle these situations."
383.0,Provider,that's great.
5597.0,Patient,"So I feel. Like kind of a for our session started, I was like I wonder what I want to talk about today are kind of you know, I sometimes think about that, before. A meeting with you. And I don't know I guess one thought I was having was like. I feel like I haven't really felt like really genuinely like happy like had like extended days of like joy or happiness or contentment and even though. I can recognize say that, like i'm certain things are like better or i've improved in certain areas. Partner images, just like messes feeling, just like happy. And I think part of it is because I have maybe been so transitional like i'm missing like feeling grounded in my own space and realizing how. Important having my own spaces. and finding happiness and what I can do with my own space. feeling like I can settle and feeling like i'm having that desire to but also like nothing really is happening and I continue to stay optimistic because there's no lights it's like i've already spent enough time on my life and pessimistic, but at the same time that's kind of like. Just feel it often like i'm just charted in water and just waiting for things to happen and hoping that eventually well. But yeah that's kind of and then. Okay, wait a moment."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's good um. You know happiness, is something that is so. I think, as we get older it's connected to you know just it's different than that youthful sort of just joy. That comes without responsibilities and just sort of the free feeling. I think later we feel more this like sense of contentment just having like accomplish things that you set out to do, or that you did your best and. And then you know, try to find that happiness more through kind of spiritual. I think that you know just the bubbly happiness is something that's more of a evanescent thing that's hard to. You know grasp and."
5597.0,Patient,"Because it's like I do reflect back on. Like even what i'm trying to pinpoint describing that kind of state of being and it does feel like it's come before these you know pretty significant life changes, whether it's like losing my dad are going through a breakup or. Like I almost feel like the. kind of. The way those all just build on each other. it's like it doesn't keep keep me from feeling happy like here or there, but it's like it's just like a weight that I feel like I will always kind of live with. and learning to live with. But it's like wait, but I feel also does prevent that kind of effervescence and. you're right like I. Like I don't know I mean maybe it would be helpful to accept that that kind of happiness and may you know I probably will never experience, where I won't because it was you know the way i'm thinking about it. You know, is connected to the certain time in my life and maybe just you know being appreciative and grateful for that time I mean that is something even while Mr fly feel like I was actively. You know just I had written down on a notepad just like gratitude so just constantly trying to see silver linings. or grateful for my situation it's like yes, I feel like an Indentured servant servant, to a certain extent, but at least they have a home, and I do have a job and I have food and."
383.0,Provider,My intentions.
5597.0,Patient,"are well just with that job like because it was kind of like part of the pay was housing, so it kind of was like not an ideal, you know. Payment you know plan or kind of job that you know when I was 24 I had a full time nine to five salary job in which you know I could afford to live on my own and now i'm having to take work where. Part of the trade off is living in someone's House and you know it's kind of like okay i'm grateful yes for this opportunity, but at the same time it's like i'm still just like waiting and waiting and waiting and trying to do what I can to get back to that kind of. stability that i'm really, really knowing that I need. And i'm just like. So yeah it's fine it's like I mean honestly in this very moment, I feel like i'm kind of on vacation. Because I did just spend a couple months working, and you know i'm not working as intensely now, and I can take a little break. But yeah, these are all just."
383.0,Provider,still working out why that same lady.
5597.0,Patient,"or open on like a help her like and kind of. It left. On really good terms and that, like, I felt like I very much like. kind of stood up for myself or was able to express what I wanted moving forward. In job, and now it is more of like a kind of supporting her like I was kind of like a side project. And not you know working for her consistently there. or even kind of being in this kind of trade off role, because ultimately I don't really want to live in marfa and she knew that, and so I think, deep down, she was kind of hoping I would maybe. My opinion may shift or. That I would maybe a kind of ultimately mold to what she's looking for. But ultimately you know she expressed a lot of gratitude me the same we left on a very good note and i'm still going on, or here or there, but you know that being said, like, I was supposed to have this full this third interview for this job in upstate New York. And that was supposed to be like any day now and it's just been annoying because I haven't heard from HR etc, but. You know so it's like i'm still. Like at it."
383.0,Provider,"Right right and so. That mean that that's sounds like that job was. Even though it was kind of you know didn't have elements to it, I mean that had elements to it that you didn't care for that much, but it was. still keeping the wheels turning which sometimes That way, you know it's on your resume you've got you know that's good that's good for people that are needing to work."
5597.0,Patient,"or wanting, and I felt very challenged, I definitely felt. You know, like I grew from the experience in many ways. You know and it's interesting for me now to be in a place, like the cab this cabin where I feel kind of comfortable in certain ways that maybe I didn't there and to reflect on my time there because there were some really intense times. and intense structures. Where I felt very, very alone and isolated. In a way, that I don't think I had felt since maybe like Hawaii but like early on in Hawaii before I kind of had a job and new people. And that was a really pretty intense experience and I don't think I had anticipated, I mean I knew it was this remote place, but I think I forgot. How. triggers trigger or just how my anxiety can be really exacerbated by feeling, really, really isolated, because even though I really like appreciate my alone time. Like it like it's yeah i've been somewhere where I don't really have solid relationships is hard for me. And I don't always feel encouraged inspired to try to build those and new places, because in my mind I get lazy or i'm like I just would rather be in a place where I feel that already. You know I mean ultimately I kind of like wish I was at the personality type that like wanted to make friends everywhere, I went but, honestly, I find the process of trying to make plans really exhausting. And really hard in a way that I just don't want to bother because I feel like okay."
383.0,Provider,With.
5597.0,Patient,"say my friends situation, but then again, sometimes I don't like sometimes I worried that. i'm. I do feel really grateful for my friendships, but I also worry, but I yeah i'm going to express this to you before like i'm not really feeling like I have a strong sense of community, even though I do feel like I have strong friendships. And so. You know this is also tied to like my desire to. Like find a real steady nine to five, where I can afford my own place and feel like I can start to settle, because then I will feel more encouraged to. just going to be. out and about more, and I know also it's such a crazy time, but the pandemic. So there's kind of about two. You know. i'm just again and another little kind of many, many transitional period, but I don't feel like stress. about it man Sara Lee, even though I do. feel like i'm having anxiety, but I always like."
383.0,Provider,"That better you seem like you're actually in a more stable place than you were before you went to New York. And like you're kind of more just grounded. and I think these experiences were good for you, because you did stuff you know."
5597.0,Patient,"I think like cuz yeah you're right and you're. Like place like New York for three months and Martha for a month and a half. You know, like having to tackle. obstacle obstacles or challenges that I didn't necessarily like shy away from. Even though it ya know like it's kind of like face just you know facing fears. and I do want to continue PENA without momentum cuz you know, I think that, I mean I think that's great to hear from you that i'm sounding more grounded, because I do think you know, being in New York and reconnecting with so many old friends and that sense of grounding was so important. And standing and Martha and kind of working with artists and kind of grounding me in a creative way like amongst these creative people. You know, after you know I guess. It was a year. A year and a few months of you know just kind of a pretty intense living situation, I mean I remember when I first started a bright heart, it was so much so about kind of my current like living situation and. Certain stuff that I mean you know, not to say a one ever come up like again, but it was certainly a kind of perfect storm that I don't think will happen again, though, that set of circumstances. But yeah I mean, I guess, I do feel good about how I am constantly trying to like see the positive see the light see that see that so far i'm lining etc. But I just kind of feel off my can kind of just continuing to wait for you know. things to come my way and I know that I also have to work for them, but. yeah getting."
383.0,Provider,"clarity about what you want to come your way you know we've talked about that. In the sense of like I want you know my job, and I wanted my own place and that's kind of what I want to create I mean that is what I want to create getting clear about that I think when you're clear about what you want, for your own self for your feet, you know."
5597.0,Patient,"That and I did I thought was also always tied to this idea of like a really specific career or whatnot but also, I really liked now just thinking about like. What do I want or need and that to me at least right now it's like having like a creative studio space or a space that I can like really make the work that I want to work to make and that's kind of. You know what I aspiring towards it's like, not even the steps after out of you know, whatever what happened with the work that i'm going to make but it's more like feeling. Like that's just what i'm kind of reading and wanting, and probably have needed and wanted all along, to a certain you know, to a certain. degree, but um. But yeah like it's I think it's really challenging to feel like there's all this work that I want to make and I can't make it because of Nice. Situation and maybe some of that's an excuse that I can some of that is true, like. Literally not having the physical. space for the freedom to say make three dimensional artwork that I really feel compelled to make and. So that's yeah that's kind of part of it, too, but I do like kind of stripping down the thought of like what do I need, what do I want like for it's going to help me feel my boss, and feel good, and you know, sometimes it's like focused on the site works like career or job house, etc, but. Also. I think i'm turning that God like maybe committing even deeper to kind of create a path and that's also. What is kind of grounding in this moment. it's kind of like resolve that. You know I may never make a lot, a lot of money, this level of that it's like I know that from me it's like I do honestly probably my greatest value comes from my creative output and I haven't. yeah I just i'm I would love to strive towards making that continuing to make that a priority to have. A real dedicated works base. So I can kind of yeah maintain a practice."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well as you're visualizing what you want, you include that or you make that a big part of your space that you're imagining you know inhabiting at some point."
5597.0,Patient,And I think it took like that's for me like why somewhere like this position upstate or you know it's kind of like it would offer me certain stability at all for me space would all.
383.0,Provider,Like.
5597.0,Patient,"It would, I would you know be trains right away from a city where I have a lot of connections."
383.0,Provider,So what does it entail.
5597.0,Patient,"That job is a product coordinator position at a hemp farm and Hudson New York, so I can they have two big farms and they make like hemp products. So I think it would be like assisting the products. I don't know product manager product Director or something. And i've had a couple of interviews. For the job down they wanted to meet him for some items on supposed to at some point meet them in person, I mean I hope they still want to meet me in person. But. You know it's kind of like it's a job, where, if I were to move forward, it would be like okay. you're going to get an apartment upstate you're going to go to cover you're going to take all the steps you're actually really going to move forward with this like. Life plan you know, but on the other hand, it's kind of like there are certain freedoms that if it were to not move forward it's like you know it's kind of like. Like like it doesn't freak me out, you know, or it doesn't even upset me the thought of not getting this job I mean, I guess, it would be a bit of a bummer but it's like I know if I don't it's like okay Well now, I would have more free time to. Maybe go to Mexico for two months, or maybe apply to residency or maybe apply for work in the city. So I don't feel like yeah anxious or stressed about. Like that future which. I don't know it's weird I feel like I was so stressed about work so. For so long, I mean it was like the biggest. yeah it was just what I was so so focused on, I think it has helped knowing that. You know, there is a chunk of change of inheritance that I could have access to you know if I absolutely needed it and so maybe I don't feel this. Real real rusher that's overwhelming you know, in terms of finding work, but I also don't want to like be lazy because I do know that I want to continue to work towards like stabilizing myself. And not relying on. You know, a trust to do so or whatnot or you know it's yeah so. yeah so I don't really know again like. Where i'll be in a month or. Four months. I feel like I pasta hurdles like even having like I had this really nice day off where I got to go see one of the big artists who was Mr Fo one of those branches and I went what to wear the artists that we were showing and. haha they kind of have this really unique access that it's just like incredible. and afterwards they came by and saw some of my work, and that was like the first time that i've had. Like who I guess I would do my professional artists come see anything i've made and my. Year yours. was like a really big. hurdle, and there was a split second where I could have very easily made the decision to not have them over to like kind of further likes hide my worst like further. not try to engage and I chose to share so."
383.0,Provider,I was a huge that's fantastic.
5597.0,Patient,Thank you Magnus said she was impressed Michael said he thought there was some the workplace. resolved. Knowing archie that's a good thing. Is a kind of positive yeah.
383.0,Provider,Right.
5597.0,Patient,"So that was really need to get to do that. and You know and that's probably also why I feel even just in the last week, like one courage to want to. really have a dedicated physical. Space because, as much as I can always kind of like our climate like to my environment, you know or make work within whatever space i'm in like. there's something for me to really be said about just having a place where I can get really, really, really, really messy and not have any concern for the floor, like that's a really big thing. That I haven't had for a long time. Because i've been working in apartments or i've been working and houses are coming it's like. Okay, if I were to get this job and Hudson that's like to live in Hudson maybe for a while, but then you buy a little tiny, tiny home, and you know take down and put it towards real estate and then we have a whole basement for your art i'm not to me it's now like my dream. You know, like. it's really tough to have. My own space. I mean that continues to be. The goal, but really specifically to have it, so that I. produce work how I want to. So you know I don't know I mean no, you know I know i'll get there a vent to lay it's just this kind of roller coaster ride of not really knowing when. You know that'll come about, but. But again yeah like. Seeing the positive like. yeah now trying to pat myself on the back when I can and not shy away from the things I may be thinking or doing that aren't positive or that I do want to change."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think that. You know, again just keeping that vision. My direct of your dream like you want a basement that where you can do your art. And that's important that you have your own space and. and keeping that kind of in the forefront of your mind as you move, you know, through these different other these byways but you're kind of moved that's where your want to get to. and You know. I think when we know what we want. Then we can get there may take a while, but you know before. I mean I i'm sure it's been this way for you as well you know before you got your art degree you wanted to get an art degree, you know before you did such and such you wanted to do that. You did it, you know and some some things take a while big things like I mean unless people just have boatloads of money and just can just say oh i'm going to go buy a house, you know with the garage where I could do my. Where it doesn't matter that I, you know. But. But even even the location, you know you want to be thoughtful about that you just want to like get a place anywhere like you said you know you want to be thoughtful about where and but knowing what it is you want and kind of honing that I think it's."
5597.0,Patient,"it's interesting to like to like not. Let my mind trick me into thinking about what I want now is what i've wanted for the last like five years you know, because there was a time you're right like I wanted to move to Hawaii and I moved to Hawaii like I didn't you know, want to have this plan of. You know, necessarily living. Well, you know it's only been the last like year and a half that i've been kind of set on being back on the east coast, so there has been a little time but. yeah you know, like having that clarification is very helpful and you know for me it's important to remind myself that I have one at all these other things that I work towards you know achieving are getting and I do think. It can be incredibly daunting. You know, really thinking about what I want and knowing the amount of work that's gonna have to go in to to work on. But that's okay yeah no I mean i've already done so much work in my lifetime so it's."
383.0,Provider,"And things didn't get broken down into smaller you've got a big project, and you can break it down into smaller pieces and you get people to help you and you know it's it's the. Things are work but. You know what are you going to spend your day with. Otherwise, you know. Making sandwiches and watching TV, I mean. You know the alternative of what are you going to do if you don't work toward a goal is kind of not that not that interesting or can be just seem. kind of empty."
5597.0,Patient,uh huh.
383.0,Provider,You know what I mean.
5597.0,Patient,"I do, and. I definitely relate to like I was actually been talking to my sister in law about this earlier. About like being okay with having the really big goals and training in the sun, for me, like. I don't know like sometimes I mean it's almost like I have a moment where I feel sad that I don't remember that I have these big goals and dreams, because in my mind, maybe I like felt to the past or something to like remember these. dreams, and I mean that makes me sad, on one hand, but then, also in this present moment right now I do feel. grateful to. You know, again kind of have a little dedicated time to think about these and reflect on you know what those are and. you're right kind of it's it can I mean it has to be broken down or for me it's so many different kind of creative outlets that. You know, like figuring out like maybe one day make a drawing one day, right up page of text one day. write down some residencies you could look into etc. And yeah like I definitely. I it's kind of like I know that I have to do those things because you're right it's like the alternative. is like that there's just doesn't seem to really be like an old term turn it of. Like is it was like living like that sounds really dark but it's just like. It sounds like does the opposite, you know, and I feel like i've experienced moments of thought words like maybe I have. spent four days watching TV and not really doing anything else and that's what I mean when I kind of, say, it sounds like death because it's just like not utilizing my depths, and what I am able to kind of do and what I enjoy doing and. and You know it's it's like you know I have moments where it's like where's my self esteem where's my soul Council etc so it's like I know that I need to be continuing to do these things, because that will help me build these things and. You know it's kind of like I know what I want to be doing. To you know, bring better man to my life. And i'm trying to kind of continually employ those. strategies but it's yeah it's just a day to day, you know, like, I mean the fact that i'm reading more and maybe not watching as much TV, I mean that's been a big shift. You know, probably, since the spring so that's something i'm very happy about. But you know it's kind of like some of these behaviors. can take a long time to shed or. You know there. can be such comfort and. You know and hiding from the world, but I know I can't hide and I don't want to hide. The world forever and. Now."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think, when you have those moments of. where you can really say Oh, that was a moment of progress, like when you showed your art to to these professional artists or or and or when you had the insight that golly I would love to have. I can just I would just love to have a floor that I didn't have to worry about messing up you know. getting excited about that you know. Those I think are really. Key stepping stones toward you getting creating the kind of life that you want to live, you know, one of the terms that dial that marsha linehan described as a goal is to create a life worth living. And that is just like such an amazing just statement because your life that you think is a life worth living is going to be specific to you, and what what what you know what is interesting to you, you know someone else it's going to be different and. You know, I was just in a group earlier today, and ask people to share I think i'm know if this we did this in our last group, but just share something about yourself that other people don't know something interesting or fun fact type of thing. And everybody shared so many different things, and it was almost like we had this like amazing like smorgasbord of talents and. And I was just like if everybody followed in a way, like following your bliss like this one person really loves cooking and this other person, you know. Is talented in languages and. So anyway back to this thing of creating a life worth living your life worth living could be you know finding that little place with that you know that garage that space where you can do your art. And you've got the space to do it, and then you start to build on, you know, making and maybe having a show somewhere whatever but. You know, moving in that direction that's that's creating a life your life worth living, you know, and someone else going to be something else but it's important to just think about what is it what is a life worth living."
5597.0,Patient,"Meaning mm hmm. yeah cuz it's like It just seems. Like a goal that like doesn't sound like a goal, you know, like it doesn't sound like it's something that i've thought i'm supposed to do you know or that's caused me so much. anxiety because I haven't like lived up to X, Y Z you know, thinking that that's what i'm supposed to attain or do, and you know something like finding a floor it's like. I mean it sounds like there's just something sustainable about it in a way that I really like. On that I can just does bring me joy like knowing like oh I can't wait until whether it's a month from now, or three years from now, when I finally have my floor and I sat there and told amanda all about this for that I can't wait to like totally fucked up because. yeah it's really exciting for me. yeah to like yeah like really. You know, like hold space for these moments, where I am able to kind of like enjoy those thoughts. and think about. yeah challenges i've overcome those on good."
383.0,Provider,"yeah and and and to be in touch with your dreams, because some people their dreams are so buried in their depression. Who like you know, really, really, really very they don't. So."
5597.0,Patient,"it's just. it's like I I do know because it's like I feel like i've related in the last few years there have been periods and it's like maybe because i'm. just having a day, where i'm really attuned to what my dreams are or goals are what not but I definitely know how they can just like slip from your. Just yes what from yourself my new to kind of sink into these. Just real real intense periods of depression. and That just makes me really sad like really sad. But sad that yeah so that that happens to people, and I saw, but it has happened to me, but also, knowing that, in this very moment, I know i'm not now right now."
383.0,Provider,"yeah and I think you really trust yourself. I going to New York, I think that you push yourself out of. just out of somewhere where you were like a like a little cocoon or something, and you, and that that push that you did was really good for you."
5597.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like I look back and you know May and June were so great, for me, I mean, I think there were things that came up in July, you know that were challenging and by August, I was in Texas that. you're right like I you know I look back and it's like there were things that were really, really jelling and a fantastic way that I really want to work towards replicating or. You know I can think about what they were and that's like I didn't even have my own place, but I just had a big big room and someone else's place and it was my own, and I could lock the door and. I could have my artwork towered and I was living in a city where I have lots of friends and I felt really pulled by lots of people socially in a way, I hadn't experienced for years and that. yeah that's what it was like I know that. Those were great two months to have kind of stability and a lot of ways to have grounding and others and. Certain ways and. You know I think circumstances changed into a lie, and you know I encountered some other obstacles, but yeah I mean it's, not to say you know. How things were in May and June are definitely like a stone's throw you know it's like I can feel that already if you know certain things were to align. I mean, I could yeah so it's it's good for me, I think, to reflect for sure on. yeah I think."
383.0,Provider,that you have a demon yeah I feel like i've conquered.
5597.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know and it's kind of you know, I think, like. Something I know it's come up that, like the inquiry before like almost like the idea like sitting kind of with your discomfort or. Like. You know, like if I think about my you know, like say my goals or, if I can slip into them thinking about what it's going to like hold me back to not necessarily like. instantaneously like have anxiety around that but to like be more accepting of like okay like you know there's been times, and you know, like, for example, time I like social anxiety like okay there's been times, where i've experienced that etc and that's like Okay, you know, like it's. Like being just more accepting of my own like faults or what's holding me back, while simultaneously like yeah i'm being yeah appreciative and recognizing of. Positive inroads i've made kind of in those same places to. As you know, it's kind of like being okay with things but also still wanting to change and move them forward and not fixating on my. On like the wrongness, of the other or like the inadequacy or you know failures are all those things are even if I feel like that it's like it's okay to feel like that or."
