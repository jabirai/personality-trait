480.0,Provider,"beat. me to it, like you know bacon what the heck that's not even."
4686.0,Patient,That ain't gonna be good if you did do something like. That I. Know y'all are incredible he started doing something like that.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's The thing is, like I get it's good money but there's a lot of consequences to that I don't think we necessarily had time to talk up all the way through and group. But. yeah and that made me a. little nervous. For sure."

4686.0,Patient,yeah. I like it when they take me and stuff but. Because I don't want to talk to anybody I only have my phone because doctors appointments and stuff and I just talked to the girls when they text me.
480.0,Provider,says okay with you talking to the other girls in the group. Like he doesn't have an issue with that.
4686.0,Patient,You don't know me.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Good because I know that was an issue to right he was very. Controlling over like who you talk to, and when you can talk. And whatnot."
4686.0,Patient,"yeah he is he don't want me on my phone at all, he says i'm always forwarding and I don't know why he does, that I did cheat on him when he is in jail, that when my baby Daddy. And I guess that's probably why he is he is an. actor been over four and a half years ago. I mean, since that Members only you know it was, I guess, I was long with well done it because he went to jail and he he was acting stupid in there and telling me, we can break up and stuff and I was like okay i'll. Talk to my baby's Daddy again and. yeah if we now have some you know the following, so I did that one time and i'm I couldn't have done it. Regardless but."
480.0,Provider,"that's The thing is, it was a mistake, so if he's not gonna move on and let it go he needs to stop throwing it in your face because that's not healthy for him to be holding on to something that happened, four years ago."
4686.0,Patient,"that's what I told him all the time i'm like any calls me a horn is what no I don't know what all he calls me but. i'm like Bruce, how can you stick call me that whenever I don't never leave the House that will come on everyone else's if I leave with either grainy if he needs to go to the store i'll Robin her because I don't want to go on sale. We can everything he hit me with the top we haven't been very close, I mean I don't do much, with nothing will ever. I hardly talk to her at all. But. i'll go with him and her family people i'll leave the House with. I don't talk to my family at all, and he asked to get called them nine and I told him. You know you're gonna have to let the past go and move on, because we're we're stuck in the mid life or on a roadblock. Or we can't get past it you won't let it go and that's just dragging us down we're not gonna i'm not gonna put money into the trailer down here and then get it all fixed up for us to movie and then you say well you're not moving down there with. exam before to me and i'm not doing it again."
480.0,Provider,Do you have any suspicions of him cheating on you currently like has that ever been on a pro okay.
4686.0,Patient,"ain't never, never anything like a not that person. yeah based on body needs with them bernstein never gave me no reason. Not not there."
480.0,Provider,"yeah, so in that case, then I. think that him constantly calling you a horn a slot is just coming from his own insecurities. Because he's scared you're going to leave he's scared you're going to get tired of his bs and. and leave. People like that don't understand that the. More like it's almost like they're they're doing. These behaviors to try to keep you, but the behaviors are pushing you further away, and they don't see that they're pushing you further away by calling you names are not letting you talk to friends or any of. That stuff. But it does all come from his own insecurity I. don't think it's about you at."
4686.0,Patient,yeah well thanks a lot thank. You that his days insecure by.
480.0,Provider,"yep and that's unfortunate because you still have to deal with it, even though it's not about you it's still doesn't feel good to have someone calling you names all the time. Have you ever tried to set a boundary and say like please don't talk to me like that."
4686.0,Patient,yeah but I don't know.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
