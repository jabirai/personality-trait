When my kids my family, but I think for a moment to moment I can go from being like feeling okay to feeling sad, you know, even if right, especially if I get thinking too much or and I don't have a lot of time to do that just sit and think like I really don't so. But I do I do find that. it's I mean. I would say it's kind of like a roller coaster a little bit."
759.0,Provider,Like a little bit of a roller coaster okay.
15724.0,Patient,"It goes up and down, you know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah So it goes up and down. In the way that you okay. uh huh alright, so you know, like up and down let's get more specific. up and down. And bubbly like are you like up didn't mean said, your optimal on you know you feel good you know about yourself that's the up family right you feel good."
15724.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like you know when I get like I when I accomplish something or you don't have my happy moments just things that make me happy like for a time, or whatever, but then the down moment will hit me and all. filled kind of like just. I don't know I don't want to say hopeless because it's not totally hopeless but sort of that way you know."
759.0,Provider,Like hopeless okay.
15724.0,Patient,"yeah just like what you know I worry about the future, a lot, like, I think I mentioned that last time I do worry about the future, a lot like just because i'm a single mom of my kids and. How i'm going to take care of like that kind of stuff worries me probably more than it should, I think so because I mean I should be living more in the moment sort of focusing so much on the future. But I can't help it sometimes I mean I feel like where, am I going to be even in like a year from now, like wherever your home where my kids are going to be doing, you know. What am I going to be doing. Like I just I overthink things and I think that does kind of make me. it's kind of like that roller coaster like I was saying, I kind of feel like if I get too much thinking about that, I do get feeling down and worried. Oh no, I have to do something, you know, like and that's why i'm doing school i'm doing the best I can i'm doing things I know I need to do, but it still kind of worries me, you know."
759.0,Provider,it's like where's.
15724.0,Patient,Failure failing like if it doesn't work out.
759.0,Provider,yeah. And so yeah.
15724.0,Patient,that's that's kind of where i'm at.
759.0,Provider,"Worst one thing that worries you about the feature, you know you mentioned the kids and where you're going to be. You know it's one Pacific thing that kind of keeps you up at night."
15724.0,Patient,"um well. Like I was just the well being of my kids mainly I mean even more than so myself, because I know they depend on me. So I pretty much have to. You know it's all on me how they're going to be doing, and so that pressure of that kind of just lays on me a lot, you know."
759.0,Provider,it's good that.
15724.0,Patient,"But that's, the main thing that I worry future wise that i'm like where my kids are going to be, you know and how they're going to be doing."
759.0,Provider,Because it depends on you.
15724.0,Patient,"yeah because it falls on me and I just feel, and I do have my support system, but I don't like to depend so much on them, you know just because i'm i'm the kind of person where if I if it's my responsibility to do something like I don't want to put it on other people. You know, and I know I should because they're my family, you know, and they want to help me, but I just feel like I want to be the one to do it myself, you know. You know just being the mother and stuff I don't want to be like Oh, or like even my kids going to preschool I feel like i'm pushing them to another people. Which is like i'm not but that's just how I feel inside like when they first started going, I felt so guilty. I was like Why am I having like in a daycare preschool you know why do I have Why am I having them go there i'm gonna just because I want to do school, but I just feel I felt that guilt, you know, in the beginning. Like that I was just pushing them off on someone else, and I should be doing it, but. And i'm trying to get over i've I feel like little while i'm getting over it, because they've been in preschool for a couple of months now. You know so that's kind of i'm realizing it's really helping me to get stuff done that I need to do that I can't really do when they're around you know I could, but it would be a lot harder if they were here, you know. i'd have to stay up late nights doing homework and I just. That I wouldn't get sleep and then I wouldn't be as good of a mom because I wouldn't be sleeping as much as I needed to. You know, and so yeah I just I don't know I have that guilt that mom guilt. sort of that model yeah. yeah there's a lot of moms probably get it, you know it's hard to talk about because, like for me it's hard to talk about it. I don't like admitting that I feel that way but. I mean, I do you know."
759.0,Provider,You have some guilt yeah.
15724.0,Patient,yeah I do.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"Even though. I know, needs to be it needs to be done because. My boys do need to be socialized I know they need to be social with other kids and. So I try to think positive like in that way you know, like it's this is going to help their future. You know. As much as it's me that's needing them to be in daycare right now I think they also needed as well, just to be socialized and. Be around other people, besides me all the time, you know. So yeah that's I tried to do, I try to think positive and that way when when I do start feeling weren't like guilty or worried, or you know. sad about it."
759.0,Provider,yeah sounds like your. Overall you're doing your best.
15724.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like I do you know i'm not one of those people that I get depressed and I can't get things done. I mean i'm not saying it couldn't get to that point but with my kids I feel like I don't feel like I really can. I mean, as hard as some days are, I still get up and push through it, you know yeah. yeah because it can get really hard, but I just do it anyway, you know, and I just said, tomorrow, might be a better day you know, hopefully it will be a better day tomorrow and one day is hard you know. we're having a lot of struggles that day I just I always hope that the next day will be easier."
759.0,Provider,"You know yeah. I just hold on to that hope. You know, like the next day is going to be easier. Because it does sound like you have a lot of stuff up in the air. yeah kind of like in terms of you worried about this one thing going to the next thing. was mostly just worried about you. right if you're going to be able to show up for your kids yeah way that's for them."
15724.0,Patient,uh huh.
759.0,Provider,"So, in terms of dad says that's like their primary worry. or concern let's talk about how you know, like maybe you witness before in your life, you know when people didn't show up for you that's the case."
15724.0,Patient,I mean yeah their fathers.
759.0,Provider,Their fathers yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"You know, have kind of just left the picture I mean my daughter's father, for some reason, in the last two weeks he's been trying to come around more which I don't know if his mom was pushing them into it, I don't know. Why it's happening, but it he's come around like maybe every other day he comes to my dad's and he'll spend like an hour there, but she wasn't even coming around at all before and he was always hiding from us and wouldn't even want to see us or anything. So I don't know what it's kind of weird that all of a sudden he's trying to. come in the picture I don't want to say weird, but it is kind of weird because it's like why all of a sudden now are you deciding to come into the picture. You know I don't really he doesn't really like to answer questions when I when I question about stuff because I do sometimes and he just blows me off like he won't answer it. You know, tries to change the subject, so I he's really kind of like talking to a wall and why it's like there is no point really to try to talk to them about anything. Because yeah you know."
759.0,Provider,tell you like how. How he's feeling yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"No he doesn't like he already admitted doesn't like to share his feelings which, in the beginning, he lied to me because he told he pretty much told me he was an open person. He just pretty much he's a whole different person than when I when I first met him like it's just weird he just totally flipped the switch on me. and it's I mean it's bothered me a lot, but you know there's. really not much I can do about it. You know I could just say single until I find somebody that's not going to do that, to me, but now i'm trusting men, because I have been kind of like."
759.0,Provider,screw us yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"uh huh. yeah. i'm a little scared of leverage getting in another relationship, I feel like i'm going to be single forever. And that."
759.0,Provider,will hopefully not.
15724.0,Patient,"Hopefully, not I do want somebody in my kids lives, also been in my life that's all going to be a positive, you know male figure in their lives, so i'm not saying it's never gonna happen right now I just feel like I don't think I could open up to anybody really like. I fix myself before I can. Be with someone else you know. So. I know i'm throwing a lot of stuff for you here i'm sorry."
759.0,Provider,No it's okay. If my thoughts are just.
15724.0,Patient,Coming out.
759.0,Provider,"And i'm just saying, whatever."
15724.0,Patient,"yeah I guess that's what therapy is, for I guess right."
759.0,Provider,"Yes, yes it is. i'm just trying to help you narrow them down a little bit."
15724.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"it's like Okay, so the bay worry is okay, am I going to be able to do everything I need to do for my kids so just trying to kind of like break that down a little bit more for yourself. Like in terms of trying to if there's something that we can carry act that worry with like some evidence that you, you normally do show up and you have people in your life that show up for you. know, such as your family shows up for you and you know, like you have been showing up for your kids since they've been born. You have been taking care of them, you know so just reminding yourself. You know, like. i've been doing this. I will keep on doing this, you know, or he bond. You know, caring for my kids and you know the best mom that I can be for them. mm hmm."
15724.0,Patient,"yeah now I feel like i'm never gonna be as good as my mom was, which is obviously you always want to be better than your parents were but. My mom was like perfect. that's how I saw her. No, I I just that also like measuring up to like you know other people other people's motherhood, or whatever you know, since i'm in a little different situation I feel like sometimes it's not possible, but. I mean. I don't know as long as my kids knew I loved them, and you know I they were they were happy and they say they had a good childhood, you know, for what it was then I should be happy with that you know. But I just feel like since I had such a good childhood I want my kids to have that and now i've already kind of messed that up you know. They don't have two parents in the home, you know, like I you know I wanted it to be that way and I made the mistakes that I made that caused it to not be that way. And I definitely admit to that you know I know that i've made it so it's not that way, and I think I beat myself up over that a lot, you know I just if I can go back in time, I definitely would been married and like how my parents wanted it to be, you know."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah that's another thing that I just I.
15724.0,Patient,"can't I can't seem to let go of that, I mean i'll try but it's like it's really hard for me to let go not."
759.0,Provider,yeah.

15724.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I think that obviously happens probably a lot of people, you know i'm not the only person going through that situation, but I do feel alone, sometimes because I don't really have. I have a couple of friends and they're like Okay, one of them is divorced, and one of them's married so. They got married you know what I mean before they had their kids or actually know where they were okay neither and we're married when they had their first kid you know, but still I don't know I do compare myself to others see, I have so many like just issues."
759.0,Provider,convey yourself that people.
15724.0,Patient,don't.
759.0,Provider,"Like air, you know how you're doing in life, you know compare in comparison to them is is something that's useful to do, probably thought because."

759.0,Provider,"happens i've known Apps open on my phone so. Okay yeah that's fine so. Sometimes we call or text it yes yeah yeah yeah. yeah okay so yeah is it useful to do to compare yourself to other people, probably not Drake."
15724.0,Patient,You know.
759.0,Provider,"yeah like, but I think it is normal. And you're not doing when you you're not when you're at want to be at you."
15724.0,Patient,know.
759.0,Provider,"pete to look around and compare yourself to other people. But yeah it's not well, we are establishing established as not useful. In something on yeah normally. You you do you know people do that you know, but you know comparison is this quote, that they say comparison is the thief of joy. And realizing that you're at you know different stage stage in your life, then your friends are right now. If you're in a growing stage in your life when you're in the season of taking care of yourself, so you can take care of other people in your life like you're you know, working on yourself in terms of your education. Now therapy. You know you're working on yourself, right now, so you're able to better show up. for children. yeah and you know so maybe you're in the season of of growing. and learning. So just look at it in that way to you know. It doesn't have to be so much as. i'm not where I want to be, but i'm getting there you know i'm i'm working towards getting to where I need to be and therapy to learn more about yourself, so when the next time you a relationship does come up our relationship does happen, he you know more hilde in the way. you're not picking the same men."
15724.0,Patient,You know.
759.0,Provider,"As he did before, like you're learning things about yourself right."
15724.0,Patient,"yeah no that's true. yeah i'm not going to be as trusting I know that's bad to go into a relationship in that way, but i'm just going to be more cautious, I mean. Knowing that people can lie to you, they can say one thing and then be totally opposite of that which i've experienced both in both relationships. They were just totally different than what they. portray themselves to be. You know not not physical wise, but just the way they are you know. So it really it has kind of. Like made me worries scared to like even just date anybody because i'm they could be seen perfect and then you know or seeing. You know, and then they are just the opposite of that. does worry me a lot, so I need to but you'd like you said I need to focus on myself, which is what i'm doing right now. And when I keep I keep planning to do that. You know, for as long as I have to if unless maybe i'll be 50 when I find somebody I don't know. That long. I need to make that be fine you know that's that's gonna be fine like. it's as long as it takes for me to get to a good place where I feel you know."

You know, and that I that I did that realizing that I did do my best for them like even as a single mom because you know. they're gonna they're gonna die me right now there's so little I don't think they really it's not really they don't really realize, you know, but as they get older they know they're going to start realizing it. they're going to see friends that have both parents, you know they're going to see and i'm just going to have to explain to them i'm going to tell them the truth, you know about what's happened to me. Because I don't want to i'm not gonna lie, you know i'm going to tell them my godson bad relationships and when they're old enough obviously i'm not going to get into this one or two young but. yeah they're old enough to understand.

Things that I go to when I was like losing my mom I told I think we talked about it last time i'm sure we did right. yeah and so that, when I get sad about that, which I do often you know I miss her and stuff, but I just look at my kids and I see Okay, I still have people here on this earth, who who love me, you know.

You know, like it men reason i've had good times like they were happening at that moment.

759.0,Provider,You think about it yeah. yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"i'm trying to think of anything else that I mean. keeps me up at night, I actually get okay sleep."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good good."
15724.0,Patient,"i'm not somebody who's up all night worrying like I you know for saying i'm depressed I just have depressed moments. I wouldn't say that i'm. Always depressed all the time, you know, but I do have depressed moments, where I just I feel worse than, then I feel like I should you know. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"But yeah I do. sleep, are you currently taking medication."
15724.0,Patient,i'm not.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, and is that something that you don't want to do."

759.0,Provider,are no longer okay.
15724.0,Patient,"yeah right now i'm okay. yeah the moments don't last long enough to where i'm like I need to be on medication, so I feel like until if that ever does happen, I would definitely let you know, like, I feel like I need medication to help me but right now I feel like I could do it without."
759.0,Provider,Making yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"I want to do more like physical I go to the gym or like stuff like that it's more like a natural hide and. You know that, until you know, or like a medication, you know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah not that. The past where you you feel like you know, like you need something extra to get you motivated to do something."
15724.0,Patient,"So. that's because, if it was daily, and I was like that all the time, or like more than. Like 80 90% of the time, then I would say medication would be an. option for me, but right now I feel like I feel like i'm like 5050 you know."
759.0,Provider,A good.
15724.0,Patient,"No, I totally get that 80 90% you know if it ever gets to that point, which I hope it doesn't. If it does, I wouldn't be opposed to medication, you know. it's not off the table, but we're not right now."
759.0,Provider,"For now, for right now okay okay so let's talk about your treatment plan by you here in therapy. Now, what do you hope to get out of therapy."
15724.0,Patient,"um just like you said learn about myself, you know. Learn like coping mechanisms, mainly for well for the grief of my mom that's that was one of the main reasons why I started to is that. When I first started looking into therapy, it was like right almost right after she passed away. So I was grieving a lot more about more than I still am now, but I feel like it was worse than and so that was one of the main reasons why I started, and I still I still feel like I can learn coping mechanisms now because i'm still I still have. moments, where I feel like I need that you know. So yeah that and then what else like Oh, I also started just being a single mom was one of the reasons I started, I feel like it just maybe some. Encouragement ideas that I can do is being a single mom stuff like that you know. Okay, maybe even hearing, I don't know if you, you probably can't tell me other people's stories, but just even hearing that i'm not the only person struggling. yeah definitely helps out."
759.0,Provider,"I think you know, like a lot of people, especially like. It doesn't matter if you know they're with a partner they're married some people just have that mom guilt. yeah doing enough yeah."
15724.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah not enough, you know it doesn't matter you know they're you know single parent or not, they can give some common for mothers, you know, like who might be struggling sometimes and feel like you know they're not enough. You know, like in just reminding themselves that they're doing their best. yeah. Like in and just to be encouraged to not play you know i'm trying my best i'm giving up you know, like if I need help i'm asking for help. yeah like I, I know, like when to ask for help, and when you know, like I need to rely on myself, you know just different things of that nature."
15724.0,Patient,yeah that's true that is in it like I said just hearing other people's stories does help me to.

Just you know. Like I can sleep at night so that's good, but when up during the day i'm always thinking like about I feel like i'm always stressing out.

759.0,Provider,yeah what are you doing these days for yourself to help you relax.
15724.0,Patient,"Honestly, I mean I don't really do too much for myself that's like really you know that helps me. Because I would go to the gym and do stuff like that, but it's hard with my kids that were definitely helped me a lot if I could go to the gym I know i've decided say that so much and i'm pretty sure everyone, I told that to is probably tired of hearing it. But that is something before I had my kids I It made me happy like. You know, gave me that that natural good feeling that you get from working out, you know they say. For me it did like It made me feel good in every. way like physically mentally everything you know, so I know that's something I need to start like I know you're saying what am I doing now, but i'm kind of going towards what I could do that would make me happy, you know."
759.0,Provider,Like you.
15724.0,Patient,"can make me like just. Have that you know that. Good feeling I don't know. yeah yeah so right now I can't really. say I do focus a lot on my children's school. So I don't say I do too much like. I do go to sleep when they go to sleep at night I don't stay up and do anything extra for myself i'm too tired at night, so I just I go to sleep, so I don't really do anything really extra."
759.0,Provider,What time did they go to sleep.
15724.0,Patient,I usually like. 839 800 bed pretty early.
759.0,Provider,in bed because. Like.
15724.0,Patient,"30 ish you know, like i'll stall because I still have to do stuff after they go to sleep I like to shower at night so like i'll do that which I guess does relax me. You know, but that's kind of something that you have to do as a human. hour, so it was all like that something extra. You know, but some."
759.0,Provider,"scarring books doing something extra special for yourself like maybe. You know, like some people like when they shower like listen to music or light the candle just some extra practice test for you, you know they're still good."
15724.0,Patient,"Music, so now, you mentioned that I do listen to music, you know. Okay seems to help my mood or it can either make me feel worse or it can make me feel better."
759.0,Provider,Oh no well we don't want you to feel worse.
15724.0,Patient,"If it's a sad song i'll just passed by it, but I mean. So so sad songs and i'm like oh shoot No, this is gonna hit me hard drive to change. yeah. yeah it does help I feel like it helps more than it doesn't help so."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
15724.0,Patient,Okay yeah let's see now you're making me think you're making me realize like there is some stuff I do that i'm not even really realizing you know.
759.0,Provider,"And sometimes you know it could be the way that we care for ourselves, like some people they like some clients have told me like they like to moisturize at night. yeah they have a special care."
15724.0,Patient,You know lighting.
759.0,Provider,"and care routine or you know, like and just doing things for yourself like. It can be you know, like especially special kind of scented lotion that you like to put on yourself at night and then like the smell, and you know get used to be something that's like that, but you're taking. yeah like a you know but yeah it can be something that you're going to take care of yourself."
15724.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, those are ideas, then I should start doing I should start making some little night routine, even if I ever stay later to do it if it's gonna make me feel better I feel like it's worth it, you know. Just jump right in bed don't brush your teeth jump right in bed just do you know do your shower and make maybe do a. bubble bath I don't know something like that. That would be nice."
759.0,Provider,yeah that would be nice yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"It sounds nice right now. On this call it's like cold here, where I am so it definitely is like all gloomy and stuff so that sounds kind of Nice right now. But yeah just things like that i'll just start like you said you're helping me a lot think of things, you know that I probably wouldn't have."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. And also like it's impossible for you to go to the gym by yourself, you know, to have time to do that when someone's looking after the kids."
15724.0,Patient,"Maybe not every day, but at least, even if it was just a couple days a week my dad my I mean, I still need to like talk to him about it but. I have mentioned it to him before he's kind of my little boys kind of drive him crazy he's like 67 or something so he's always saying i'm too old for this. be left alone with them, you know if i'm there it's fine, but if he's left alone with them like I come back and he's like you know, like referring his hair out, you know the hair. he's like. i'm like i'm sorry guys, but I deal with this all the time you only have. A little percentage of the time, so please just help me."
759.0,Provider,"Exactly you know and he's it's not like, I have to bake or anything but."
15724.0,Patient,I do feel a little bit bad like leaving them with him when I know that he's like that you know it gets in like that.
759.0,Provider,So that'll do yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"I try not to do that, you know if I do have to go to the store, so I do have to leave for short times like that, but to go to the gym would be like an hour and a half, you know. Probably hour hour and a half, so I feel like that would be plus go into the store to you know I just I don't want to do too much imposing on."
759.0,Provider,You know yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"Not losing his wife watched my mom losing his wife he's that's really hit him hard. I feel like he needs therapy and i've told them dad you need to. Talk to somebody because he's he gets really down to about it. You know, and so I don't know I just don't want to impose on him too much in my my daughter's grandmother, you know she works, a lot, so I can't really depend on her. You know. Too much either you know. which I actually do it, but it'd be like one day a week. She did and then that's her day off, which I don't want to intrude on her day off."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"See I don't really have too much when they're at daycare and I have to be doing my schoolwork that's what they told me, and you know that was like the one of the requirements for me have even having this day care for them. Was that I had to be home during my school work. At least staying at home, I can't be out shopping or doing anything extra you know. And so I try i'm trying to follow the rules. You know, and I do, that I do need to use that time for school right now. You know, but since i'm going to be off on this break I don't see why I couldn't start that you know. yeah maybe we'll have to talk to my workers and I worked with and just seeing that would be a possibility, you know, while they're at daycare still before the holidays, if I could just start the gym well. You know, and then my dad would watch my daughter, because he said she's easy you know she's easy peasy so he'd want. But with them inviting all three of them like it gets just too crazy for him so."
759.0,Provider,yeah I guess.
15724.0,Patient,I totally understand i'm that way too and i'm their mother.
759.0,Provider,You like i'm a mom and I get it.
15724.0,Patient,"I get it start wanting to rip my hair out sometimes because they just they're just mild. But I love it I love the kid like not I don't love the chaos, but i'm just used to it, I guess. that's like been my life for the last three years, so it's like an everyday i'm used to it kind of thing you know. yeah. I think i'm going to look into that because I know for a fact that that would be something that would help me a lot."
759.0,Provider,uh huh yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"And then getting back in shape, because I was telling you how I overeat I know if I started going to the gym i'd be more cautious about what i'm eating too, because I have noticed that, before I was really good about you know eating better when I was going to the gym. Okay, not going to the gym I will eat whatever's in front of me pretty much. So just that there will help you know that's another thing i've kind of stress about is like my overeating but I can't seem to like stop. You know, and so it's when i'm here at home, all the time, the fridge is right there I could just go get food out of the gym there there's no fridge there for me to go get into you know. But even if, after a workout I feel like I just I don't want to eat like overeat you know because i'm like what's the point we working on it i'm just going to go and eat like a pig. So, and I know that will help."
759.0,Provider,"Okay well you establish you know, a couple things that you can do. You know, like in terms of you know, helping you along with your mental health journey but just you know we're gonna you're gonna look into the support group try to establish like a nightly kind of like routine. kind of like Charlene listen to music under buildings and you're going to try to put into practice, going to the gym."
15724.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,We got like a couple of times so we.
15724.0,Patient,"can even to two days a week, would have been better than nothing, you know."
759.0,Provider,yeah so that was nice. So that's your homework for next to. like this. Oh yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"sounds good i'll work on all three of. Their time Sir i'm able to you know the gym is the hardest one, but I could still fit that in."
759.0,Provider,I think I know Stephen Devon yeah.
15724.0,Patient,"You went home workout but the thing is about working out at home is it's not the same as the gym. yeah i'm just like no I can't do this and I just quit you know because i'm like i'm here at home there. I like to be where there's other people working out or I could you know I have that motivation watching other people. And even people watching me, I will work out harder when someone's watching me, which is like totally weird because I. Nobody else knows that way, except me that, like out of my friends and people i've talked to you they're like when. You like when people watch you i'm like what makes me work harder. So I don't mind it. Even to create those that do it like. You know they're watching, so I have to work out harder. yeah it's just I don't know that's just how I am I guess."
759.0,Provider,"that's just how you are okay yeah so. You know let's work on that, and you know hope you have a good Christmas, you know. And you know, like you continue to make those special memories, for you and the kids and as goes okay to remember what it was like to have your mom there is to maybe celebrate her in a way, does kind of like something traditionally that you guys do together as a family to stick. Those traditions alive."
