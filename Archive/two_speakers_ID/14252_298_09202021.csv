298.0,Provider,"No, it burns out of your system in five to six hours, so you you, you have to take a second dose of it in order for it to even get you through a whole day."
14252.0,Patient,"Because yeah I was just kind of curious because, like, as I was reading it was saying, like Oh, you know the problem if you take adderall is that. Like your brain is now going to be dependent and like. it's going to require that to function at that at any level if you were to not take it."

I am pretty high functioning, but I feel like i'm really tired because of what I have to do to be high functioning if that makes sense. So i'm kind of curious like wow if this could really help me like that would be amazing if I didn't have to like do what I have to do now to function like. it's just I feel like it's like low key like manic what I have to do to like make sure I get all my everything and don't forget and stay focused. And it's like I would really like to experience if it can be easier."
298.0,Provider,"Right and I tell all my patients anytime you want to take a drug holiday feel free anytime you don't want the second dose. don't take it, so you take as much as as many doses as well, you take two deaths in a daytime if you don't need the second dose fine if you do okay. You have have a day that you just want to lay around all day Okay, but you know you're at home, you don't need that you don't need that focus that's okay with me too now there's a lot of providers who say no, I want you to take it regularly i'm not one of those providers, I think that. Taking the brakes is good for the brain like you're yeah."

298.0,Provider,"Okay. So how I like to prescribe the adderall is I like to do a 10 milligram tablet but, for the first like four or five days cut the tablet and a half and just do five milligrams. 10 milligrams is nowhere near a top dose but I know that we're going to go up and there's no point in asking insurance to pay for you know, a higher milligram when I need a lower milligram when I know i'm just going to have to go up so. My dad saying. Take five milligrams take it twice a day and see how you do if you have irritability after taking it those are things it tell me."
