3573.0,Patient,yeah barely but. I don't know what's wrong with my bluetooth but.
540.0,Provider,"Well, if it if it ends up being a problem, and you can't hear me, we can."
3573.0,Patient,"reschedule for another. Okay, I turned on my values oh."
540.0,Provider,No all right how's everything been have you been feeling.
3573.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, I did not have well I didn't test positive for golden but i'll tell you what is it yesterday I was still. I mean i've just been laying around and not going anywhere not doing anything I was feeling wow you know I don't know what I had but it hit me hard."
540.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness, are you feeling better today."
3573.0,Patient,"Today yeah, but this is Wednesday I got up Sunday morning and I felt pretty good I went to church and by the time Church was out and I got back home boy was all I could do just to hold up my head. So I mean I don't know if there's a bug going around or."
540.0,Provider,It could be it's also that time of the year as well.
3573.0,Patient,"It is but usually you know when you get sick with something like that around the time of the year illnesses or whatnot you don't usually stay sick for a week and a half, I know. But my daughter came by today, she was off of work. Because her sinuses act she just looked like death warmed over. well."
540.0,Provider,"that's the thing too is when we live like a pretty sterile life, you know how like the past year and a half we've been very like huge on making sure everything's sterile. A lot of times when we get sick will get even sicker because our immune system bacteria is good for us and building our immune system, so when we're always like disinfecting and keeping everything so sanitized it, it does weakened our immune system as well."
3573.0,Patient,"My grown up all through my life my grandmother even would tell me and my mother, that I was born anemic. I only weighed like six pounds when I was born, I had a twin and um we were both born premature, we spent the first three months of her life and incubators in the hospital and stuff. So anytime I ever got sick I got sick twice as bad as anyone else and kept it twice as long. And then pretty much I mean I would hear okay. That was me Tucker. That was one quick. I knocked on wood, we thought someone knocked on the door. You froze."
540.0,Provider,Here you are you're frozen.
3573.0,Patient,yeah you were to.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so your alley."
3573.0,Patient,"yeah i'm feeling better um I. need you to check on something for me cassie. um you have access to my profile or whatever um. it's been I don't know it's been a month now, I got in touch with the virtual clinic and they said I had been chosen for the random drug screen. Okay, I in two weeks ago in talking with you, or maybe it's been three weeks now i'm I gave you the name of the place and you got the fax number, and all that stuff. yep yeah I went to the local my compu night here, they said they didn't have anything oh."
540.0,Provider,So.
3573.0,Patient,"So I come back home, and then I had my. Cup was in the mail. So I had the urine drug screen in the Cup. So I got online and I did that, through the compliance department, while I was in compliance the Navigator told me that she was going to. cancel the random. Okay, and then I think it was last week I got another text from Joe telling me to go to the virtual clinic so I did. And it was because they said I missed last week's meeting. But it wasn't my week to come to the meeting last Thursday, I was sicker than a dog anyway, but."
540.0,Provider,yeah but it wasn't your week.
3573.0,Patient,"And I told her that you know I I bi weekly is when I do come that seems to be causing so much confusion. I wouldn't hurt me to come, every week. I just want to make sure that everything is up to you i'm in compliance with everything yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Well, let me."
3573.0,Patient,think it was.
540.0,Provider,Because you want to do twice a month counseling right.
3573.0,Patient,What.
540.0,Provider,Do you want to do twice a month counseling or once a month.
3573.0,Patient,Council we're doing twice a month.
540.0,Provider,Twice a month okay.
3573.0,Patient,"yeah I was sick last week, but I had already scheduled this one, and then two weeks from now i've got one on the 20th."
540.0,Provider,"So I have i've updated everything but I what i've been doing to is sometimes when people question the frequency i've been adding it into their notes, so what i'm going to do now as well, on top of. I updated everything to make sure that it's all squared away but i'm going to add like a little note to the top of your chart. Would you say that you're coming to. group twice a month, so it's like the bi weekly alright so."
3573.0,Patient,"What i'm doing is holding my microphone to my ears, so I can hear you pretty good I. i've gotten turned up all the way, but lady speaker isn't very loud I don't know why. So how do you. recommend people dealing with depression handle it."
540.0,Provider,"So a lot of it, so it really depends on the depression and the levels of them, because sometimes there are hormonal imbalances, sometimes there are. The brain or on imbalances, so it depends on obviously if there's circumstances that are going on in your life there are the natural ways of dealing with the depression as well, but sometimes people need medication to help an assistant, but. For the therapy portion of it a lot of it is going to be really talking about the depression trying to get it off your shoulders. So a lot of it sometimes is forcing yourself to do things, even if you're feeling so tired and drained and down. Like getting outside for five minute intervals throughout the day or trying to go and do something that you like, even if you don't want to do at first eventually it'll form a habit of wanting to do it."
3573.0,Patient,OK.
540.0,Provider,"But, so what what's going on with the depression."
3573.0,Patient,"I just I find myself every day. I think most of my problem is, I am bored. sheer boredom. I was working on. The inverted diamond art. I was doing diamond art like crazy and I think during my recovery time from two surgeries I had last summer I got burned out on it. So it says here all day long, I mean i've got a table still set up me, so I mean with my."
540.0,Provider,diamond are.
3573.0,Patient,"Like pad and everything to work on my, but I just I haven't touched it in probably three months. i'd literally have to force myself to get up. And then I find myself sitting in the rocking chair recliner sleeping all day. I used to cook. I love to cook. But. I had a scare here oh I don't know it's been priced six months ago I was diagnosed with hepatitis that I didn't have. I yeah I will come back and show to add to anybody, because I was. that's needed. But when they told me that I mean I did research on it, and everything because it scared me but it said not to cook for anybody, because my, even if a droplet of my sweat. dropped in I could invest people. So I quit cookie. I haven't gotten that desire back."
540.0,Provider,at all.
3573.0,Patient,kind of wonder if. i'm on the wrong medication. I don't know I take 20 milligrams of turn telly. I can't hear you.
540.0,Provider,"All right, I think I can hear you now."
3573.0,Patient,Can you hear me.
540.0,Provider,"I can hear you now i'm so you said you think what it, what did you say after you think that."
3573.0,Patient,"I wonder if i'm taking the proper anti i'm different depressant medication I. mean I haven't seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist in over a year. When I moved down here is the psychiatrist that I was seeing up North gave me a bridge over the medication and then I found a nurse practitioner, and she just kept prescribing for me, because they obviously don't want to go off of it."
540.0,Provider,"which you want, so we have a mental health program with us, we have psychiatrist would you want to meet with somebody and talk about the medication what you've been on and they could make a change of your medication, or they could try to test something new out."
3573.0,Patient,"You know what I thought about that. And the problem with that it would be interactions with other medications that I take. Long with that, I mean i've got so much anxiety I twitch from heaven anxiety and I sought out professional help here. Probably four or five months ago, and everything that he wanted to prescribe for me had an interaction either with suboxone or the turn Alex that i'm taking. Okay."
540.0,Provider,So I mean a lot of our providers that's The good thing about.
3573.0,Patient,You froze up on me.
540.0,Provider,"I mean one one of the benefits about bright heart is the fact that all of our providers, they really collaborate together and many of them know the interactions say it's suboxone say other medications they'll be able to determine what would help you most. Because they'll know the interactions yes, I will be very interested in doing that. Okay, so i'll put in a request for them to call you to set up an appointment because also anxiety and depression, they go hand in hand they're like best friends so. They rely on one another, they got each other, going so maybe doing a medication that's not just an Anti depressant, but it could be a dual medication. we'll talk to yeah so all request for you to be seen, they may do like the evaluation and then see what you've been on before they are obviously already have all of your medications because you're already in the Program. So that probably is the best bet and it allows you to have that continued care with both."
3573.0,Patient,"OK. OK OK. look forward to. All right, good winner is right around the corner and we all know, with winter comes the blues."
540.0,Provider,"When some words, let me right."
3573.0,Patient,"And I you know I i'm old enough, I know i've been through it, I get up every morning open up my blinds slit sunlight and if it's not nice enough to go outside and I just so many things to try and help myself, but I cannot get out of that rut. I mean."
540.0,Provider,Did the diamond paintings help you at all.
3573.0,Patient,"um they did. I don't I think I just got burnout on them and then I got new glasses and I started I can't even wear them now, I have to go back to the eye doctor there. I don't know if they don't sit properly or if the Bible was in the wrong place, that when I where Am I get headaches okay so that's kind of stopped me from doing it."
540.0,Provider,Is there so maybe getting back back into the cooking do you have like a recipe book that you see us or.
3573.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I was thought to cook by my grandma I, like all the old comfort foods, I used to always make in cooking for my daughter, and her family, basically, you can think pots and chili and I made homemade spaghetti sauce and. bake beings or just a pot of beans green beans, potatoes and ham know topper, no, no. But I stopped doing that and it's I mean."
540.0,Provider,"Well, maybe, maybe going forward try to pick one day out of the week to cook something up and whether or not you know you're going to see your daughter, or something. And whether it's Friday Saturday Sunday just make sure that that's the day that you were going to do it and then keep on doing it, even if you're not feeling like doing it. And then eventually you're going to grow that habit that habits going to form again because a lot of times when we fall off of things, it takes us a little time to get back on the routine of it."
3573.0,Patient,"Well, it took me a year, almost well, maybe a little over a year. To get what I call in home services down here like I have an aide that comes in twice a week, and this is allowed to help me do household chores and stuff gets you know, to get. There, something is I just can't do it, I mean it's really hard for me to stand and run the sweeper because I can stand for very long and stuff like that, but. And I haven't really had the services even that long, but I have found them twice now just in the last month last six weeks i've cancelled her. For just because I don't feel like doing anything. And I know that when she comes I can go sit here, I can tell her, I want you to do this, this and this and then he can get up and do it, I don't have to. It almost seems like I just I don't even want to be bothered with her. And that's not good, because I fought so hard to get this service. i'm telling myself I get in that. depressed state of mind I just don't want to be bothered."
540.0,Provider,"So maybe going forward, maybe, let them know that maybe let them know that you've been dealing with some depression and that you began to isolate and push them away and it doesn't hurt to apologize, and just saying i'm sorry that i've canceled on you and. I really I don't mean to cancel that, then I just kind of like you said, where you just you end up wanting to sleep all the time, and you don't want to do anything and. When you know that they're going to come over to it's that kind of the reverse psychology aspect where even if you're not going to have to do anything when they come over you still have that social aspect of it."
3573.0,Patient,"Well, when I when I do have her come over and I don't feel like doing anything hey it's it seems like it's a vicious cycle for me if I don't feel like doing anything I feel guilty asking her to do anything for me. So she'll sit here which they call that companionship."
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3573.0,Patient,"You know, some don't sit here and watch TV with me or you know she's a couple of times she's took my dog for a walk whatever but me just I don't know. Something is going on, psychologically and I need to get out of it."
540.0,Provider,well. Hopefully there can be if there's a change of the medication that can help you. It can take some of the burden off of you.
3573.0,Patient,Okay i'm willing to give it a try okay.
540.0,Provider,"All right, I don't know what medication all the but will our psychiatrists are good and whether or not even if you went to one of the NPs they're really good with us so. yeah I think that should be our plan is to do that, sooner than later when's the next time your caregivers are supposed to come."
3573.0,Patient,Tomorrow okay.
540.0,Provider,So our first step is to not cancel on them right.
3573.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I canceled on her on Monday so she is coming tomorrow. Okay, good, but you know after like I said Sunday, when I went to church, I actually just absolutely did not feel good On Monday I couldn't hold my head up so."
540.0,Provider,"Especially with the sickness and this week you still want to go a little slow, though, because your body is going to be trying to still heal so make sure when you're you're not just over exerting or so."
3573.0,Patient,"Well that's another thing too I. used to when I was younger, you can get antibiotics for sneezing. You know it's one in and told the doctor that you had an earache or whatever they might look in here, but more than likely they would just write you out of scripting and. It and biotics and it's gotten harder to get antibiotics, so when I was supposed to have my heart catheterization I went for blood work and my blood work was off so they prescribe the antibiotic for me right after I stopped taking antibiotics that's when I got sick. So I mean I don't know if it took some of the good stuff along with the bad I mean that's what I do but. My body is I I have found this to be true, as i've gotten older things that affected me less when I was younger boy, they are now."
540.0,Provider,On and I think it's so I mean if you do have anemia and antibiotics they kill all bacteria it's not just that good or bad like you said it's that anemia is going to come into play as well.
3573.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"So i'm. Sorry i'm just gonna plug my computer and. we're dying over here all right um. But, so I mean, for instance I I mean I have anemia and I was on all these antibiotics for H pylori which was like a stomach infection. And that the antibiotics that was like the worst treatment ever it just completely like takes away like all the bacteria in your body and your body just feels it, so the antibiotics it's it kills all the bacteria. But that's all the bacteria so and then your immune system kind of weekends, and then on top of that, having a navy it's just it's the trifecta so. Making sure that you're also kind of boosting your immune system so whether or not your doctor can prescribe you like vitamin C or get those vitamins up."
3573.0,Patient,I take prescribed vitamin once a week okay. it's a big green capsule I think it's vitamin A. But. i'm scheduled to go back to my primary care doctor here first part of November I got a month and i'm going to wait until then before I reschedule my heart cath i'm just so scared.
540.0,Provider,When is the heart cath supposed to be now.
3573.0,Patient,"I have been rescheduled it yet. I had to finish taking the antibiotic and then, in the meantime I got sick, so I have a call them back to reschedule."
540.0,Provider,So what what is the. So what are the complications if you don't get.
3573.0,Patient,What am I afraid of. I can't hear you. I don't know what's going on.
540.0,Provider,Can you hear me Sandra.
3573.0,Patient,yep no I can hear you.
540.0,Provider,um So what are the complications if you don't get the heart cath.
3573.0,Patient,"Oh i'm. That they didn't early. it's it's more of the last ditch effort, I guess, to try and help with circulation so. I mean I how much worse can my peripheral artery disease get. yeah i've got. Huge plaque buildup i'm i'm not. What do they call that. I take a medication for cluster I don't have high cholesterol, but I mean I just I had to take a do a questionnaire to ask me things like you know my lifetime fatty foods and stuff like that, because of cholesterol and the build up in my arteries and veins but. The reason why they suggest I do this heart catheterization is because of a. blockage is I have in my order at the bottom of my heart in my gut and they're telling me that there's really nothing they can do about that blockage. bye they may be able to prevent it from getting worse. So."
540.0,Provider,So do you feel like that's gonna be something that you still need to do.
3573.0,Patient,I don't know i'm scared.
540.0,Provider,How do you talk to your doctor about it.
3573.0,Patient,Yes.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, and what does she said."
3573.0,Patient,"She said, if it wasn't a mandatory necessary to life saving surgery that he didn't want me to get it."
540.0,Provider,"And is this a life saving surgery, would you say."
3573.0,Patient,"I don't really think it is. I mean I just had this thing replace my run to my legs, but the amount of improvement was very minimal. Okay did, allow me to get my right hip replaced, which was so bad, I could not walk without a Walker or wheelchair um. And it remains to be seen if i've got to have the left side down now to get my left hip replaced right there i've got so many medical thing going on it's just mind boggling. and"
540.0,Provider,"Maybe being honest with your specialist to say that you're very concerned of the risks that are there, and you don't know how to outweigh. And maybe ask them like what are the risks to not getting it. Specifically, like lay them out, for me, and maybe have your daughter there for you, for support to say Okay, these are the risks and then these are the risks of getting it, these are the risks because i'm not getting it. So that you at least now what you're actually dealing with so that you're not I mean it's a gamble. But yeah want to be able to see what you're gambling."
3573.0,Patient,"When I when when the cardiologist and I were talking about this procedure, the way that she put it to me was that we've done, he said we've done everything that we can for you, the next step is to do this and from there, go from there. um because with this abdominal aortic aneurysm and blockage that I have it can't be on done i've had it's been there too long, I they can't reverse it. And i'm remember here oh it's been probably a month ago, when I was had to go to the hospital, because the doctor's office called me about a CT scan I had yeah That was the scare okay that's what they said, you know, I was pretty much a walking time bomb. But that blockage has been here a long time."
540.0,Provider,"So it. really is there anything, naturally, that you can do to help the blockage or."
3573.0,Patient,"No, they said it was it's been too long there's just absolutely and my body, I guess, as compensated for that I guess i've grown I can't remember the term that the doctor used but i've grown smaller games that go around that. blockage OK."
540.0,Provider,"OK, so the vans have grown around and."
3573.0,Patient,"Gone around us, yes. And they're trying to compensate my body just I guess. detected that there was something wrong and that's my body's way of healing was to grow smaller veins to get around that to see blood supply so."
540.0,Provider,"I mean that's a beautiful thing about our bodies is they'll adapt and adjust to the things that we needed to but then obviously sometimes we need intervention so yeah. I mean, first step, I guess, I wouldn't talk to the specialist and just try to outweigh everything."
3573.0,Patient,"Oh man. Did you see anything in my chart about having to go for that random. I mean I my income. Is are they still using that red, yellow green."
540.0,Provider,"yeah I don't think that, yet the red, yellow green will go away. I, I know that they're trying to make improvements as they go with the system all systems aren't perfect, but we definitely try to change the system, so I know that they're always going to try to make the system, a little bit better. yeah let me. Thanks sometimes providers can see things that we can I mean everything for you looks to be in the Green, I mean it says labs completed no financial issues. No uds problems, it does say surveys that you have to complete."
3573.0,Patient,"And I do those every every time I come to group I do it, and I think that's one of the reasons, because I don't do them every week."
540.0,Provider,yeah they're still doing with the weekly.
3573.0,Patient,I asked to do me do this I don't come to group.
540.0,Provider,"yeah yeah we didn't think that you had to at first, and then we ended up finding out that you guys still have to do them weekly I mean, some of them are once a month, like the patient satisfaction survey you shouldn't have to do that, I think that's."
3573.0,Patient,monthly. Every once.
540.0,Provider,every three months for the patient satisfaction survey and then the.
3573.0,Patient,bandage cute.
540.0,Provider,yeah.
3573.0,Patient,"Two weeks ago, when I was in group I had a private conversation was Berta she told me that there's two surveys that have to be done before group now and it's pH Q and then the BAM yeah."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and so she a lot of times, sometimes they don't know that people are bi weekly so she may not have known that you were bi weekly at that point."
3573.0,Patient,"I told her, I was."
540.0,Provider,"You were OK, so those two are still weekly. So. yeah so maybe just try I know a lot of people what they do is they do them sunday's to just like have them out of the way so that it's you take the 510 minutes every Sunday and just do them get them out of the way. Okay, because I know. I know a lot of people yeah."
3573.0,Patient,"that's the first i've ever heard that I did not know I thought they were supposed to be done before group when you go you attend so that's what i've been doing, but."
540.0,Provider,"Now I know. Every everything else is in the green you're good on everything else it's really just those. And if you start doing them weekly, then everything should be good."
3573.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
540.0,Provider,Was there anything else you wanted to talk about today.
3573.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so i'm i'm scheduled my next one with you as a 20th and now being group tomorrow."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good alright, so what I want you to do until the 20th is I want you to try to cook at least once a week. So try to make something like meal wise once a week okay."
3573.0,Patient,"Okay. All right, that's it tomorrow honey."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, see you tomorrow."
3573.0,Patient,"All right, my."
