383.0,Provider,Right.
10873.0,Patient,"And a premium was shontelle on Monday email conversations with shontelle over the weekend. Okay, Tuesday, so I think I got through the weekend bye Kevin contact with shauntel early. really meant a lot to me that she. wanted to talk to me, instead of just let me move on to another doctor. And then. That like we actually were having back and forth conversation. And there's festivities going on in my house and I remember she's like hosting I think her daughter's baby shower this weekend, with a whole bunch of family I think that's three festivities but either way I was like oh crap go do your thing. But that she took time I that really shows like a genuine caring and compassion for me that's very real very deep and not like. Deep in an inappropriate way, but like. A healthy relationship between you know you want your third this to. You guys as invested in your therapy, as you are, I guess. At least during the appointment set. off."
383.0,Provider,So did you guys. come to any conclusions regarding your medication and. How was that discussed and what was the outcome.
10873.0,Patient,"We discuss I basically and by the time I talked to her, I was at a point where like she was like what do you need, you know how I usually am able to. put together some sort of idea of what I need from you right, I was like I don't know I literally like i've had i've no idea what I need anymore like I don't know what's right what I need I just no i'm not okay. And, and so, she was like how about I give you some options and so she gave me a multiple choice option and I chose the 2.5 quantum it Point five milligrams of coffee at night for sleep. It works, really, really well last night I was reading a book that I think that also helped in some watching TV. Before bed. I I saw a friend of mine in town that I haven't seen in like a year getting that funky pressure my head again. Sorry, I keep getting this heat I don't know I think it's a hot flash of pressure in my head is that normal that pressure in your head during off flash. flash. Sorry. Okay um i'm not used to that weird pressure I had. That I saw my for any tana and she has in the last year, written a children's book and gotten it published and she has. she's in progress, publishing her recipe book for food to treat autoimmune disorders and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. So i'm i'm trading her medicinal medicinal cannabis for she's putting together oils and recipes specifically for my. Mind specific that says diagnosis. And situation and so i'm i'm going to start taking i've just started feeling more control coming in in little ways. Like you know i'm going to be changing my diet and i've decided to take my diet way more seriously and ate a piece of salmon last night. I won't happen again. But I tried it. I just I looked all over every cabinet, we had for vitamin D 12 um I just I really want. Is. Seen Tara was like a light in the dark in a weird way like like shining something on like a whole bunch of tools, I forgot I had you know food. I treated my. My daughter's bipolar my husband's autism and depression and my son's autism, and my bipolar and my anxiety with food for a long time. I was on a crap ton of pain medicine, so it altered my mood i've always said that was the best mood stabilizer I ever took it was six years of being doled out my dose so I couldn't Fuck it up. And I did great you know my pain was manageable, because it was the right dose and I wasn't able to Fuck it up and I did the rest of the treatment with food and taking us on camping trips and hiking and morning walks. me and my son used to go do photography in the morning out by the creek before school."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm sounds like have some lovely memories to reflect upon.
10873.0,Patient,"yeah I have to use my number is now because my son doesn't want to see me so. You guys want to see me for Christmas either. Oh haley's pretty pissed because i'm justin said I talked to eight and eight in this to stress to have mom's home for Christmas and kaylee said, did anyone think of asking me that's my mom to. You know and. So she's going to come down here for Christmas and see me at some point, because and she's not going to see my parents she's just coming to see me and some of her friends."
383.0,Provider,"Oh. yeah did you discuss that over the weekend that one of the things you, you did over the weekend is kind of."
10873.0,Patient,"A sudden other positive thing, I mean it hurts that my son doesn't want to see me but it almost is like I hurt so much they. And it was kind of like you guys have already hurt me so much this is just like what I expect from you know and it didn't hurt as bad and shauntel. Because this is starting to that i'm becoming emotionally numb, but I feel more like. there's only so much space that i'm allowing pain from them. Like yeah like I I did a meditation where I I, it was a beautiful meditation it was a guided by someone else and the meditation was like to like open space was eat you guys overview weird if it was. But like imagine is space inside of you. It was for like allow yourself to feel your feelings and then release them and for things that you're either not ready or don't know how to release yet. To like give space for that change it exists inside of you, without destroying you like put a bubble around it like a membrane and like allow it to have it space to exist without taking over."
383.0,Provider,yeah great.
10873.0,Patient,"i've given them a certain amount of space in my spirit I guess. for that. and There wasn't room any side of that space for any more pain, and so this new one just kind of went in and out because I am not going to make the space bigger, just as they added more stuff."
383.0,Provider,that's such a that's so awesome Kathleen what you just said. yeah.
10873.0,Patient,"And it makes me feel good about myself, too, because I know that i'm I know i'm giving them space and i'm holding space for them literally like I can feel it physically like right here, you know. And it's like. So, but I also deserve to be happy and don't deserve to have that pain take over. So i'm. Trying like I went for a walk today, and it was a meditation was that I had the weirdest like not vision like actual vision, but like emotionally maybe like in my mind. Like my son was walking towards me on the track on my way back down from the lookout spot. mm hmm with stuff like that all the time. It was like he was just saying I love you. But as it took steps. To get closer in my mind, he just disappeared. And it was like maybe i'm just not supposed to take steps to try to get closer right now. I don't know. But I think he loves me but. dark dark part of me was like Well he didn't die work someone would call me by now."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's such a beautiful image of. An message, in a sense that he sent you I sent you this you've got this feeling that he loves you, but when you stepped forward that's when he retreated."
10873.0,Patient,"One more time and I took. As I begin to walk again is when it went away I know that's probably because my bank had to focus on walking, but it still has a good metaphor like thing to just science it all up or you can spiritual law so i'll spiritual at all, it."
383.0,Provider,"I think it's a great, it is a good metaphor to for you to. work with and processing kind of what's unfolding right now, which is that there's your son is going through many things, and you know. That you've described, you know that the transition, but also pain and you know the suicidal thoughts and so he's going through a lot, and yet when you approach It just seems like it's not it's not welcome, and that is super painful for you. But how can you be in this situation be in this situation and still like you were saying hold space for your love, but not have the pain of not being welcome overwhelm you. yeah I think that those that's all you know you're working doing some really good work and the answers are coming to you, you know, on your own."
10873.0,Patient,"yeah feminine array and. I suppose you know as someone else's guided meditation but I took. I took action on it and and and found a place in my life that made sense so it's not like the guided meditation said, you know hold space for your son and your access, then for this I I did at least. figure out that. On my own. Sometimes I feel like it's cheating when someone else helps me. So weird."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think it's kind of like a judgment that you on your cell phone I don't know if it's coming from a place to feel like you don't deserve to receive help."
10873.0,Patient,"No, no. I just know that I feel like i'm cheating when I get help, so I when you said that I was making good choices and doing good things I feel like that make sure you know that I didn't do it all by myself. weird."
383.0,Provider,"Well, you seem like you're in such a better place today than you were on Friday."
10873.0,Patient,"weird little things came into my life um. You know I went shopping by myself, because Eric has to work and i'm. I don't like dry i'm like i'm having one of the worst flare ups and corp is that i've ever had period and. My foot is like turning out and or in and i'm rolling over my foot it's really painful and I earned. My shoulders so bad that i'm probably going to need surgery on my shoulder but surgery with crp s is so dangerous because, like literally. Needle pokes can cause a spread this Europe, yes, and so, if you can imagine, the question is like do I have to be awake if my nervous system does it really feel a if everything's there anesthesia. Like as long as I don't have the pain signals sent well i'd be okay, or the trauma to the flesh what's going to matter and and i've already been through one or two surgeries since I got tired one since I got diagnosed and I was terrified that I was going i've had a serious severe burn. That that had to be divided um every other day for 10 days it was awful. And since I had the RPS and I managed to I meditated a lot, I wrote a lot, I did so much so, not like I knew the more afraid I was that it would because would spread, the more likely. to spread so I had to keep my fear down, and it was right by my foot like go the originating source to I cannot tell you why I, except for i'm super strong because it did not spread since that's. not spread to my surgery I did have a little bit of complications because of it, but um. But i'm most for the most part, I managed to I had three incisions in my body and part of it taken out and my managed not to. Like create so much anxiety and fear, but you know, I was. It was almost like life or death, you know. You know if if he keeps spreading other parts that I will will go crazy. Right now. Are. Right now, are lucky to have it, he only in a few spots. Global. So."
383.0,Provider,uh huh. um. And this is the car PS.
10873.0,Patient,yeah it's super psychological. um but or it's a neurological which has to do with the mind I guess in some weird way um. But. I just I just. I know that I can. Totally stop it with meditation and everything. But i'm gonna have to have surgery.
383.0,Provider,Body work help like like deep tissue massage or acupuncture or. Like body work specific like.
10873.0,Patient,I thought. I went to physiologist to help me for a while they're not willing to touch my neck. I have a vertebrae that slips and. They don't even want to touch it and there's like a circle area where they won't even have to do anything no massage knew nothing i'm.
383.0,Provider,With your foot and do if you got. Like physical.
10873.0,Patient,"I can't have massage on excruciating, but I have before I fell in my personal maxis doing pretty good zero would use me. perform locks in the morning. Which is why I always had it on he's asked us every single morning. sita and."
383.0,Provider,hayden and just like a warm epson salt bath.
10873.0,Patient,"i'm doing that, right now, but I don't know why it doesn't have the same effect, I mean we me and my physical therapist worked for. At least three appointments in the hot tub and because she wanted my foot in the hot tub and she wanted me to exercise in the hot tub so that. Because at that time it was just dragging basically around like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't do anything to it and. I finally started to be able to do some tips like stand up on my tiptoes with it and stuff pick up cotton balls and everything, but it was still white. And we'd get out after 30 minutes, and she was like what the hell, and then the paraffin wax when they did it, it was like something popped in my foot and all this lead pouring down or horribly painful but awesome to see blood pouring into my foot. But here's what. I don't know what's different about it than other things other things, help. But nothing was helping nothing. Much shoot your whole foot and like a paraffin wax thing. mm hmm and I I take it out and do it, and I have to wait at least 30 seconds before I dip it in again because the car, yes, can cause it to suddenly start to heat up like super hot and burn if it's too white. And so I have to be careful with it. After it's been a while. But anyway, he's a brandy."
383.0,Provider,"Well, what do you feel like you want to use the rest of your appointment to talk about."
10873.0,Patient,"well. earn so i'm really, really proud of myself for a lot of scenes lately um I think I might be depressed a little bit or mixed state he's a field manic, but I also feel depressed. So I did."
383.0,Provider,"I just wanted to give you a little bit of if I might. You know, on Friday, you were you were really, really, really angry."
10873.0,Patient,"I haven't gotten angry like that i've been in I just about divorce my husband about an hour ago, I don't know what's wrong with me i'm angry I don't know. cause me and this part of shauntel and I were talking about she said, there are so many areas that he causing the problems you're having right now, and everyone else is dropping the ball on you and i'm not going to, and I was like oh my God. i'm because they are they're like I don't know what your problem is we'll figure it out i'm like okay well thanks. um you know they they told me, I am that applies to me, and they know i'm not doing well, but have they talked to me about hormonal therapy or anything at all, a moment multiplies know. You know I don't know what the hell to expect or know what to ask for or. You know, for help from them like you know, but this shouldn't be my job, they should be able to be noticing, you know from what i'm telling them and from what they knows happening i'm not I was an angry person for a long time I don't know if my circumstances are making me angry. or mad or."
383.0,Provider,So let's talk a little bit about do you want to talk a little bit about your your anchor. Man okay.
10873.0,Patient,it's not best not the only time it's happened.
383.0,Provider,"Okay um well like I was saying that on Friday. I observed a couple of things and when was that you're extremely extremely enraged. Yes, you were your."
10873.0,Patient,characters just like really fucking this right yeah enraged is probably.
383.0,Provider,"Well, you are bordering on on being extremely like to the point of rage, I mean you were very, very, very, very angry and. What was that."
10873.0,Patient,was a lot of screaming after the call.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, tell me what happened, like. You said there was always screaming after the call."
10873.0,Patient,it's kind of embarrassing when we just say that I throw a temper tantrum.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, with what brings up the embarrassment."
10873.0,Patient,"43 years. Later, throw a temper tantrum. like throwing you shouldn't stop you may feel nearly crying and mean like what the Fuck."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
10873.0,Patient,"I really work on on getting better EDU I just. These are things that I done my whole life and I. I I was taught that these were ways to express love. Being angry meant you loved them being enraged met you look up to them deeply you know. Their old habits, they can creep in. But I. worked hard to clean all that out of my behavior you know. didn't to not lose my shit and and like to be able to hold it together for a phone call and lose my shit afterwards or. Do not lose it at all, I think, maybe are held everything, so a little too much for too long, or something, because I feel like something pushing out of me. So."
383.0,Provider,This is something you've been working on. From what you're telling me so.
10873.0,Patient,"share with justin about eight is so patient about aiden but you know, deep down inside I don't know them so patient. i'm pretty goddamn pissed."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
10873.0,Patient,I want to be taller understanding open hearted and ready there's another part of me that just wants to Fuck in scream and punish them and tell them to go to hell. never come back into my life you don't deserve mean never have been lovely.
383.0,Provider,yeah. yeah there's these two parts of you um.
10873.0,Patient,"And I never heard anyone, so the other one that wins is always the suppression until I scream and yell and her result."
383.0,Provider,"hurt yourself yeah so you know I mean if you were going to do, like a creative. Project around this you know. and And you did let's say there was a big piece of butcher paper you know the the height the view you could put your you could do your own you know, like the outline when you do the outline of your hand."
10873.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,You could do a whole body outline and on the butcher paper and there's that one.
10873.0,Patient,shoppers in there.
383.0,Provider,And then there's the then and then another and then there's another one and that's the angry at the anger angry. Cat so you know and.
10873.0,Patient,"Oddly Max has been used some creativity to express what i'm feeling so well right now that. I could try to do something similar link, not the exact thing, but basically one page of his journal that he accidentally left behind with me. Had this crazy rage and it was called in horrible horrible angry writing and called rage and it was just this screaming and black and chaotic they unpleasant to look at you know. And then turn the next page and there's this like. Like a front doors permit conflicts like the classic with the catchy next to it and the keys hanging on it and the couch over here with the window in flower curtains and a welcome that. All that stuff like all this normal stuff everything's in its place everything's weren't super clean super organized and he titled that one oh. Heaven. And i'm. So, like in his mind and maybe the other ones called hell I don't know it would make more sense but. In his mind, I know that guy that I lived with was the guy with all that chaos and rage like that was the expression of who he was like and then there's this side of him that he called heaven that he craves this like. organization stability and all of this and that's me right now, like right work hard, did you get over this hate to be back here."
383.0,Provider,"All right, and you know it's just important to be where we are, you know, and because we don't want to be pretend because it's just going to. come out at some point so it's just important to be."
10873.0,Patient,"authentic happening to me to. rivaling. As i'm trying to stay stable, healthy person and this group of people as started thing out with and i'm losing my shit. God they're still here for me was crazy chicks. I should leave them a message after this call yeah they're doing. yeah. But. i'm not able to hold it together anymore and pretend to be. Normal. it's out that's crazy."
383.0,Provider,yeah. And you know it's kind of like I think that do you want to the. The piece of have you do still are seeking the piece of. relative freedom from the state of chaos and anger.
10873.0,Patient,"Exactly it's not not how I want to present myself it's just an eye it's just a yeah I want that feeling of peace inside of me that I I have. After life feelings that are being there for 45 days when I came back I I was 165 pounds because I got hold water wheat and other stuff from the Latina in be gained so much weight so fast, it was incredible it was terrible and. I remember. standing outside it was raining and I was thinking, I accept that this my body right now is in this state and i'm okay with being in this state right now I know it's not going to last. And i'm not going to judge myself because i'm always judging myself on how I look, you know how stupid of me not to moisturize more I was younger and. I know i've got I have the best shampoos conditioners, make up my clothes Jesus Christ, the mudflows I have a soul, I have a literal bedroom for my clothes that's not a joke. In my shoes oh anyway, I I am getting older, you know. I don't have the. bouncy little body that I had when I was younger, I am in great shape for my age and even people are actually in pretty good damn shit. But. I judge myself like angrily whenever I fail to achieve these perfection goals. Of behavior of the way I you know. prepare my body, the way I present myself all this stuff and so does my soul so angry and harshly. by everybody."
383.0,Provider,"So when you notice that you are judging yourself harshly or your that aggressive energy is coming in that anger and that that that tension. You want to to. say hello, you know, in a sense, to it and and what what is it what is it meeting from from you, you know. and Can can you be a friend to that part of you, and can you apiece. I don't know if you want to appease it but."
10873.0,Patient,"Oh Oh, I used to do martial arts when I get really angry right golden the dojo might kick the crap out of the bags and stuff and Spar with black belts and. Get all that energy out, you know, and I was it was I found it to be healthy, at the time, but I injured my shoulder I went to do some power yoga actually to burn off some anger and I auchi hey it's it's already. injured."
383.0,Provider,yeah maybe Maybe you can do some more walking you mentioned that you're doing well.
10873.0,Patient,"Today I just I was so angry with Eric leading go to the doctor's appointment that he was supposed to go to for a lot of reasons. That, I think, agree with him we've already talked about it, I almost forced him over it that's how angry, I was so there's a bit angry or than I should have been so. I pulled over on my way home because I felt so overwhelmed with anger and that's why I went on that walk right like stomped up the fucking hitless disappoint you know in my eggs in my yoga pants like. around this trail. And went pretty high I you know I i'm in my frickin a crazy amount of pain and I was just so angry, I did not care. And then, on the way down the fact that peaceful experience."
383.0,Provider,I think that maybe it might be a good. prescription for you to do to have regular walks.
10873.0,Patient,My dog is going to love you for that.
383.0,Provider,"Regular walks that are you just go out and do you know you've got to go out maybe you've got a couple of roots, maybe get in the car and you go some place."
10873.0,Patient,To place to take them tonight sunset i'm going.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, but as you're walking you want to be breathing deeply and you want to be. You know, acknowledging the anger that comes up and also acknowledging. That you. You know it doesn't have to be at the same time, but maybe it's at a later time when you feel a little bit come down that you are seeking. A peaceful peaceful path you're seeking some kind of connection with peace at some point, you know may not you don't may not feel it now, but that is."
10873.0,Patient,"Something you're on it. Because I do this, what happened when I was out there stomping around I had headphones on I was listening to German techno and that gives you any idea. Beautiful beautiful lyrics and beautiful music, but not Hong Kong or chilling or relaxing in any way, and you know I got to this point where it started to irritate me while I was looking at all the beautiful nature and that's when I knew the anger was dissipating. You know. When when that music was no longer a helping the release, but now it's agitate me oh cool I. shut down a level yay. yeah and they. stopped at one point, and I just like in like felt the sun shining on me and like was deep breathing and I wanted to i'm trying to quit smoking and and no one was out there, so I walked around pretending to smoke a cigarette like this and. You know, and I was like you know that is almost more satisfying than smoking if I actually let myself do a whole full pretend drag because I get clean air, instead of smoke. And then nice deep breath and the same feeling."
383.0,Provider,But when so crazy.
10873.0,Patient,Now it's so be allied. Which movie Maybe I should just do it anyway.
383.0,Provider,"Well, you have to put your hand to mouth, you can just take a deep breath."
10873.0,Patient,Now you got to have the hand and mouth thing lollipops I gotta have something.
383.0,Provider,I see.
10873.0,Patient,I I. i'm one of those oral hand to mouth things.
383.0,Provider,I think this work with your anger is. as important.
10873.0,Patient,woulda thought I had so much anger still. you're on me.
383.0,Provider,well.
10873.0,Patient,"To me so angry. Mass, why not."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I don't think that anger is is a you know it's part of the palette of emotions and some people feel it a lot and. and And struggle with it, and so it to me it does it's not surprising, I mean i've experienced feelings that deep feelings of anger and I also have other family members to struggle with it and it's something that is."
10873.0,Patient,"I know you're not supposed to share lots of personal stuff by yourself, but. that's why I like your support when I became a person. aren't any that are compromised shirts anyway. But this is good to honestly um, but do you do have you ever in your adult life."
383.0,Provider,"like throwing a temper well. I know. to her, she barks at the same day it's like five o'clock and she'll start there's someone that's coming home, I think, or something she sees but you were saying that. I don't have I ever thrown something."
10873.0,Patient,Throwing a temper tantrum.
383.0,Provider,"Well, I."
10873.0,Patient,Hope you're feeling. screaming yell or.
383.0,Provider,"You know, when I was in my 20s my mid 20s I I did something that surprised and shocked me that I did this, and I was, I was in a relationship with someone that it was it was not a good relationship we were always fighting. You know, it was like I mean I liked him I left him, but we, for some reason, we were just like oil and water, and we were just fighter, he would just. And I was in my I had a Volkswagen bug at the time was by car, but he was driving it and we were parked. And I had I had these shoes on they weren't the heels just about this big they weren't big pointing heels, or anything but they did have a little bit of heel on it and I had my feet up and I pushed my heel into the front windshield and it cracked."
10873.0,Patient,Oh wow.
383.0,Provider,"Actually broke my front windshield and it wasn't like i've pushed it to kick it, but I pushed it out of anger and actually broke cracked my own windshield."
10873.0,Patient,"wow that is shocking me hear from you jake angry. He is your so. You come from a place of of calmness Wade are here like very peaceful and calm and going into therapy is definitely for you, you know. In the past, I would like I don't want anyone that calm down drive me crazy um but you know it's it's a. Something that I look I look for achieving in myself, one day, so no and back then, I thought that that that kind of peace wasn't possible to be real and that everyone who was acting like that was fake and. I didn't believe anybody that was, like you, I thought you were all liars and then there's no such thing as being okay like that and and I just didn't believe it was real and i'm. Now I know that it is and it's even achievable for myself and I never did before, but I keep losing it I keep gaining and losing losing I want to be someone who, if I could go back in time never lost it. or whatever, but."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so. That that part of you that that looks back and seat sees those times when you lost it and you were like. I wish I didn't have done that, and and you know I mean I explained that situation if, when I was in my.
