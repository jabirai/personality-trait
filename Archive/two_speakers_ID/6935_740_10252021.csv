There wasn't enough people enrolled to the Dean was going to cancel it. So I might have to do that other one this semester. But it just means i'll have to do it next semester, which isn't that big of a deal but it's another one that I would have not had to do. Well, I don't really need two more more pressure anyways right now. I think all right, without it so. it's not that bad it's actually probably a good thing overall perfect keep doing it."
740.0,Provider,"Again, like a phone call or."
6935.0,Patient,something's going on but yeah just schooling trying to work as much as I can works been kind of slowing down my normal accounts in like side work I haven't really been able to pick up as much as i'd. Like to but i'm super broke right now and I don't like it at all.

I was having a bunch of them and then now I have so many unemployment ran out around here, so I think that's why a lot of it slowed down a lot of people seem to be working for had unemployment bunch of money to throw around to do little house projects and stuff. Now they don't, so I think that's basically why it's slowed down so much, I think. guess anyways."
740.0,Provider,"The last time I talked to you, I think you had injured of sprained your ankle."
6935.0,Patient,"ankle be no it's it's bad still actually what I did is I stepped on my.

The bottom one and popped it off, and it just gals both my legs from the knee down with boiling water, so I just got these super bad burns that. are like an inch deep and they're like just bunch of different shapes and and just all over and it's just been miserable for about a month now."

Really trippy stuff heels. keep them covered with this, I got this nonstick surgical dressing things. I put those on their tape those on after I take everything off clean it all soaking in Epsom salt and hot water I got this big bucket. of water and epson salt and then that loosens the band aids up any they were stuck so, then I take all that off throw it away. And then scrub them all like, but the water dowson move flat light wave them and mean to get all the stuff of them and then let it soak for a while and then I shower in wash your mouth with soap and water scrub them up real good soap and water best again. And then get out I spray this. disinfected numbing. stuff with like cocaine I spray that on a mall and then a dry them all up real good and then I put a surgical dressing over it, and then I wrap it with that weird guys stuff sticks to itself, but nothing else. boo boo grappling with that and good to go there was not a lot of pain, because I think it kills all the nerves. Though there's not a lot of pain involved in the it's really bad like tense just itch to the bone it. kind of is is really annoying but. don't. take good care of them."

740.0,Provider,"yeah. Any. Any trigger, then you know my bit."
6935.0,Patient,"not really I mean this whether it's kind of been doing it because it's like rainy and gloomy overcast here. One of my things and. get me thinking about it here and there, but nothing more substantial than that. yeah the River thought. Of it like it'll pop in my brain hearing they're like oh hey you know you could do this do that. But that's very. Good but I had to deal with a lot of bullshit. So much more. money. poured a fucking screaming heroin habit so cheap. I can't do enough so. Three four grams a day. At my height."
740.0,Provider,Oh grams a day.
6935.0,Patient,"No, I was selling and just hustling like just all kinds of different hustle millions of different little scams and. selling this and selling that and I was selling it to. have this Hassan and selling it so yeah I did it i've done that 30 years for 20 something years i've been doing it so i've got substantial background have plenty of ways to get money it's like right now I could I could get some money somehow but it's like. Some of it's illegal not all but. Most of it. And being broke kind of makes me think man, I could go do this or good."
740.0,Provider,"right out nice you about that. How has your. Has your financial issue kind of you know trigger their minds, a lot bigger than a quick money real fancy me luck with it."
6935.0,Patient,yeah it's definitely crossed my mind.

740.0,Provider,Doing.
6935.0,Patient,Her thing kind of self talk I guess.
740.0,Provider,"yeah and basically if the color is the cup of tea about. It i'll play the tape all the way through so basically what it is might you might be saying well if I do. It and i'll make it. sound like that, and so that's basically what 30 years, so I guess, my question to you is like six work it's kind of slow, you know fight, you have a you're kind of in a financial hardship. What are what are outside of doing something he legal what what are your other legal options by what other options up the paper to kind of get them find us."
6935.0,Patient,"Maybe look for more work advertise more places because I haven't really put my advertise any advertising up because when I did that, before I got just completely overwhelmed and. was trying to do more than I could even keep up with, and that was dangerous to so I took my head off a bunch of things and now it's slowing down, I could throw my head back on there, and probably get something some sort of bite for some sort of job. I might do that is to get something going on but. Because like spare time. I also I could. really go just. It snowballs like really bad."
740.0,Provider,won't.
6935.0,Patient,"Get too much. Real quick to like you're just like my roommate just did it and he just got a call to drive to Oregon has to be there tomorrow at eight o'clock to work its own job for 22 bucks an hour for two days and they're going to pay him per diem for a hotel room and stuff. And he just came home from some little side job he was doing and had no idea and now he's going to Oregon trying to get some gas money right now to go up there. So. Post matic could be like that there's a nice thing I know could be digging a ditch somewhere, but the weather so shitty right now. actually went and dug a ditch this morning it wasn't raining the first time in four days. And now it's starting to rain again. That that puts a big damper on to because I could have been doing some things there's a few jobs, I could have done, but not in the weather like this. Just be like a nightmare. trying to get good ditches merge."
740.0,Provider,With the overcame being one of your major triggers. Have you been handling man.
6935.0,Patient,"I just been sitting at home watching a bunch of movies. that's kind of like my reset kind of thing is I just do nothing, and just watch movies. And that's like I enjoy that just nothing do nothing, and no nothing, I have to do no responsibilities. that's like my reset period. No. Questions No. talking to the workers are good people to work for me. Answering their questions. No stress so it's Nice."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. The album do you ever get like the the revenue boring different at home on those days, or are you."
6935.0,Patient,Know yeah I completely get it like.
740.0,Provider,The.
6935.0,Patient,Blood like it feels like just as my release as her something it's just like my time to just do nothing. really like it actually I don't get bored at all like. Maybe I would eventually but. I don't get a lot of time to do it so. Change chance to get bored of it. Yes.
740.0,Provider,and have a relationship with nothing.
6935.0,Patient,she's pain in the ass. kind of back and forth. My ex wife is comes and goes to.
740.0,Provider,A girlfriend and.
6935.0,Patient,"She has a lot of problems. More problems and she's word against it. But I get see my daughter is a lot more. my daughter I don't get to see one of them, I only get to see the oldest one. I don't get. My youngest because she's with her with my wife ex wife mom and she's got her conveyance. Like she don't want to see me because I might go back to prison but it's like that was it first you know, meaning it's like it's been over a year now and i'm discharged for all. Ever ever done so it's like now like why i'm. Like give me something to work. towards some like tell me to do something like if you do this and do that, then we can start talking. or something he's not given me nothing like nothing to work for like so is this just indefinite forever like she won't I can't even talk to her to ask her like I have I don't get no response, most of the time, like she's only responded a couple times. Just like I know what's going on with hers or grandma planted seed and got her going on this not talking to me thing because I might leave again. And broke her heart and she don't want to see that happen again so she's convinced her that not to talk to me well, then everybody made it to this big issue like. This is stupid, why would you not talk to her like you and your dad need to make her build a relationship of some sort like she 13 almost and like i'm missing all these years I can't ever get back for no fucking reason. Because i'm good because I might go back to prison like that's not reasonable and now it's just turning this big thing so Now I know her enough to where she's like. Just I don't want to deal with it so i'm just gonna write it out, because I don't know how to stop it and fix it now, and she probably thinks i'm angry about it. And she don't know how to to break the ice basically and get us talking so basically I just need to see her I just need to run into or somewhere, and I think i'd be fine if I just had like five minutes, with her. Like I know her. door. And I know how she thinks that she just likes me, and I know that she just don't deal with it. So it's easier to just say no, I don't want to deal with it right now I don't want to talk to them. And everybody's pressure from all going like you should be talking to your dad and my other daughter tells her like look he's doing all this for me, I mean we've had all kinds of time together. And i'm not even her real dad like we found out when she was five that somebody else was her dad. This other dude but he's basically not in her life at all, he tried to hop in there, a little bit and then jumped out and basically just a banner during talk to her now. And i'm just always been there when i've been out of prison i've always been there, the most consistent out of anybody. And she's like dude your dad is there for me like constantly and she's like my dad ain't and you have a chance to have this and she's like you're blowing it by not taking advantage of this because I wish my dad was here as much as your dad is for me. So she's like telling her that and then she gets pissed off at her and. don't tell me what to do and fit and. So she came and talked to her about it earlier because she's always trying to like. To be there, like as mean I mean to negotiate or whatever, as for me to get her to start talking to me, but she won't do it. Because of Graham have planted the seed of this idea. And then she's claimed some counselor at her school told her that to the no you shouldn't talk to him until he proves that he can stay out or i'm proving that now, so now why like. You didn't get a response. So I guess eventually i'm just gonna have to go to court or something and. Get visitation. But I mean if she don't want that she tells him that I don't know how that'll go. If that's what it comes to but I don't know if she will like if they actually asked her without a grandma she might want to. because she did tell him around my birthday, she said i'm going to start talking to you dad but i'm not going to come to your birthday i'm going to take it slow well that was in May. yeah I heard nothing syncing. I don't know what to do, I write messages. or grandma's home forward, the only way I know to get Ahold of her and I don't get no response from either of them. So I don't know if she's even given him to her because brandi my ex wife and my daughter destiny they're saying that she don't even think she's getting most of them. Getting so get the things she said they know the face she's got some alone. Again, all of them. But I still try to writer, every day, every day or every couple days at least. Talk to her, I just write messages like i'm talking to her and. not get no responses so. know what else to do."
740.0,Provider,"Well, I mean even always seek out your options. Definitely definitely legally. To kind of determine what are your options, you know to see your daughter. And just to kind of see like you say you never know if she wants a relationship with you or not, because you know, no one knows, allowing you to speak to her directly. Oh, and then, of course, you know you also show proof. You also show proof, you know they you been writing those letters and that you've been messaging higher trying to get in contact with our and it's just you know visual space and find that you that you have being persistent and wanting to talk to her, and you can make with her so. You may have to be legal action."
6935.0,Patient,Probably.
740.0,Provider,"yeah they also have and i'm sure they probably have in California, they have like free legal aid services where you can actually call legal aid and tell them your situation, and they can refer you to they can let you know what to do, name."
6935.0,Patient,And they do have. Their reports in the face.
740.0,Provider,"So you can always utilize that as well to kind of lead, you in the direction that you should go to China have some kind of reunification, whichever whichever."
6935.0,Patient,"yeah I use it for my divorce, but I was trying to divorce my ex wife, because she wanted to do it. signed the papers and she take papers out every time she turned him in or not signed step so they'd have to send them back to her and it went on for like four years with a. New girl that I added to time. And she wouldn't let it happen, so I was legal aid and found outweighs loopholes and finally. got it down or posted an ad in the newspaper and she didn't respond to this you can't see it, and then I knew she wasn't living at the address of record that was on it when it was filed. So they would send it there and I knew when to get forwarded to her, because I know she couldn't afford or mail and. do anything and I knew she wasn't at that address no horse, so I got it gun violence. or good help they helped me do all that. i'm sure they can lead me in the right direction for whatever I need to do next to get. That I really don't want to have to do it that way, because I don't. want either grandma really not trying to piss her off because I don't want court stuff but it's like I get the Court involved in at least i'll get a seer but I don't want to force her to either, if she really no audio, then I don't want to have to you. Can if you do damned if you don't or."
740.0,Provider,"No more. reach out, you can do what you can do. And even though it may. Have a little friction, but at the same time, it just but I mean you're you're a father wants to be her daughter so. I mean you know you have you do what you feel is wave and we're also trying to leave make an effort or an attempt. You know, to to reconnect with her, I think that's something that you see in some English she will probably on the stage they may even reach out to her own you know if you see the will you know my bed shana reconnected me me Shannon communicate with them, so you know that I have my Turner."
6935.0,Patient,pretty much everything going on.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. well. in regards to. The landscaping might be so your other option is to try to find other. job opportunities and I will say this if you're not going to advertise it just just see if you can reach out to somebody didn't leave so just kind of hire somebody or. Something like that, because I know that you're doing your own business, but if you're not advertising me like it needs to be advertised."
6935.0,Patient,"Oh, I can I don't want to advertise. overwhelmed like too much, I know how to do it i've done it before and just overtook me so."
740.0,Provider,Be anybody they you. know it did it that they can do it for you.
6935.0,Patient,"Oh, I can do it, I just I get too much from it, so I took all my stuff down because I was getting too much I can't keep up and start over."
740.0,Provider,"So many here. So basically you need it yeah you put yourself back get back out there for that you because you know you take it down because it's too overwhelming because you're getting too many orders now you know now you're in a financial hardship to where now, you need those orders. yeah so next time you get there, maybe I wouldn't say take it down, I would just say chatter chatter find a way to organize it and. You know the writing down, so I tend to keep their relationship with those customers, so that you can keep money in your pocket."
6935.0,Patient,"shuffle mother moritz read it for a while, but it. Just kept coming kept coming eventually I just shut it down into this too much."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
6935.0,Patient,"i'll throw something back up on one of them, just to. get more side stuff going."
