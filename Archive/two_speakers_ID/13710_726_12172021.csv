And these people had duplicated every single thing about and I thought I was talking to real company. And I thought I was leasing my weeks to them so they could have a golf tournament down there and I went ahead and I exercise my options to get weeks, and then they told me because of my profit was so high, and pay the Mexican Government paid to Mexico. And then they should have gone to the rest of call off the golf term because of colon and they'll buy the whole package from me perhaps been transfer fee. And so, if you take the total amount of money that I wired. it's $78,000 and it's an out and out for you call that number now nobody has number. And we did they show all the pictures. And you've got the letter to the Mexican Government and you got two letters resort vacation everything looked identical it was offering. Perfect done, really, really well done. And I thought, if I went to this deal here, then I could retire. Well, I could retire all right. i'm $70,000 less.
