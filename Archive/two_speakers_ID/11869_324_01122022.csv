Experience and you know I want to go a one and done because I took French in schools, I didn't want to go to France. But the."
11869.0,Patient,"And, to be honest. With coven right now the whole experience to it's not even just like getting on the plane it's like everything that happens, before you get on the plane is so annoying right now with covert it's like. yeah so."
324.0,Provider,Tell me something TIM I did they require you to keep a mask on.
11869.0,Patient,yeah that's yeah.

And literally i'm quite she didn't know she was. She calls it, the last minute, and she says my son is positive for coach that we. did last."
11869.0,Patient,Night oh my God.
324.0,Provider,"She says i'm not coming over point, please don't. So I was able to hear that off because she really she would have come across your test at the night before, to make sure that she was Okay, and in a positive the next day or. So it's kind of like everywhere, so now I just."
11869.0,Patient,"Well, that timing is crazy but it's a blessing in a way, because sometimes it takes like. Two or three days for people that are sick to even be detected on the test so."
324.0,Provider,yeah so her nine year old tested positive on Christmas Day.
11869.0,Patient,"Oh, my God."
324.0,Provider,"or 12 year old tested positive two days later, and then shipped s department, the day after that, so I was like wow so we really like dive blew it there, but um."

11869.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,He described it as someone really. Stepping over here to be like her i've also. come out. yeah so. yeah so i'm just gonna continue to. Do they keep recommending this to do.
11869.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. yeah i'm hearing a lot of people recently say well you know, like oh my crohn's raging like i'm a bit i'm bound to get it might as well, just like you know get it and get it over with. But the thing is is like it's really not like that, because you might have a chance of developing long coven which some people don't get and that's all bad. Some people lose their smell and taste for like a week, but some people lose it for six months, and some people have not gotten it back yet and could have it never come back forever."
324.0,Provider,So I don't know if a person has been a year. centers still not.
11869.0,Patient,there.
324.0,Provider,"Is no perfect person. Still after your can't smell or taste anything. yeah I can't even imagine. That I experienced it. For maybe a week. When I had, and that was December 2020. yeah um."
11869.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,that's what I never but everything came back so. I can't even imagine my whole year of not being able to. really being around you or taste anything so. yeah it can linger and you don't know the long term effects of it.
11869.0,Patient,Exactly that's right.
324.0,Provider,"You know, like say six months or a year from that so so I have the first time, and I will pay the other two don't know how some of you. The second time around, or the third time around, so I would rather just not fun, you know. yeah I can avoid so."
11869.0,Patient,"yeah. Now that's good that's good I think it's a good to stay that way I just got an unfortunate call from my dad this morning he is I mean he's good but his he's got on my step moms relatives from Mexico visiting. They they've been here for about. Four days I haven't seen him yet, but I was like about to this week, but it turns out that they found out last night that the nephew that car has kovats of the data also has coven."

Three full days before my departure or something like that. Three even four full days before my departure, but that was like that was like I think I think the time I was supposed to be felt like the Month after. So, so that went well yeah that was super helpful in France to actually my grandparents noticed a change in me too, so they they. yeah they especially my my grandma my grandpa's like a little all simers now so he's kind of stuff but my grandma definitely mentioned it several times and it allowed me to kind of like I mean, since we were just literally. living with my grandparents like is pretty relaxed there was not a lot to do so in a way it was good for me, because they had it allowed me to have my moments like put my head down and like. You know, do some work figure out what my like next work moves are going to be and and so very glad that I had that out there. And yeah i've been making some progress on the on the work France, I like launched my YouTube channel. Which is like a slide.

And i'm going to focus on. A lot of drone. videos that i've been doing i've, just like the different places I go to for fun I bring my drone with me and then I get I get some what I think is cool footage. and"

11869.0,Patient,"You know I. know I can't complain, I had a great Christmas, we are all healthy. starting the New Year well here it's a nice weather in San Francisco. and there's a decent chance that i'm going to be skiing next week so i'm pretty excited about that. and I have to be careful with my back my back is like still a little bit injured but but um but yeah just trying to keep my head down this week, focusing on on. On more work leads and. Submitting more applications. tweaking some cover letters. figuring out what jobs and what other jobs, I want to apply to and that are worth it. yeah just just kind of same old same old just trying to work on that.

He he's he's on ad or he's on on adderall prescription as well. And he was asking me if I was sleeping well and I told him I was, I was like yeah like really no he says that sometimes he's been having issues like sleeping. Recently, but anyway, I don't even know why i'm saying this because there's really no point to the story there's really but anyways he he he's not sleeping as well and that recently happened but luckily i'm still sleeping well. So so like no issues so far."
324.0,Provider,"um you might want to ask him how late, is he cooking."
11869.0,Patient,"yeah. um yeah I did ask him, that any target not not very late, so I think he said he said Max like an hour or two later than he supposed to but like not not much later, so I don't know I mean he could maybe take it even earlier than he supposed to and see if that helps."
