And I haven't taken any NAPs during the day, so they can't be that. Those two days that I couldn't sleep at night I also walk so it wasn't that I wasn't tired. I just. was very restless.

So that my son's lungs could form a little bit faster, so that when he if he did come early because they kind of I was it was like maybe a week before. I actually had him, so I had them October 20 seconds, so it was like October 11 around there and I had been in there and I was already dilating. So they're like hey most likely, he is going to come pretty soon so we'll just give you the booster to kind of be ahead of it and luckily it did help and he didn't have to stay at all."

13203.0,Patient,yeah me too.
252.0,Provider,"Little tiny BBC. Young. I don't know what it is, but I love babies. My nephew just had a baby and he was four pounds at birth. While he was early right but. He was in the icu or the nick you for about a week and then he got to go home and he. died. He."
13203.0,Patient,Just.
252.0,Provider,anyways how have you been. been able to manage not being able to fall asleep or saying up to those late hours.
13203.0,Patient,"i'm pretty well I just I feel more like sluggish tired, I feel like my nasza really kicks in when I haven't slept good, so I throw up more i'm like nauseous more often my head hurts, but for the most part, I can still get stuff done so. I also did want to talk about because I had a like a really like vivid disturbing dream, the other day, so much so that it like caused me to have like a physical like reaction in my sleep. In my dream I was crying like sobbing like hysterical and my boyfriend woke me up and he said that I was crying in my sleep. Like that intensely and I kind of know why it was such a like reaction. I would just don't know why, like all of a sudden so i'm in my dream. I was dreaming that we were in like in our home in our apartment but for some reason, like my whole family was living with us. So my boyfriend and I were like in our room and then in the other room, which is my son's room right now was, like all my brothers and all my nephew sleeping in that one room and then my mom and my dad in another room and. So. We were about to go to sleep and then in the dream my son woke up so he my boyfriend walked over to the other room to go get him, while that was happening my dad walked into my room laid down in my bed, and I told him to leave he wouldn't leave. And he was making me really uncomfortable so I started like yelling at him telling him why I didn't want him in here and then so then my boyfriend came back in. And then my brothers came in was like oh what's going on and I told them and then they were like telling me that all the like things that I was telling him that they were alive that, why was I lying that, why was I like making it such a big deal and. The point in my dream, where I started crying was because my mom came to me, and she was telling me that I was a liar that I was making up stories and. And so, then that's when I ended up getting woken up by my boyfriend because I was, I was crying in my sleep, and I know that that dream is correlated to something that happened, maybe, like, I want to say it has a year and a half now. With my dad that I don't really talk about. So. Before when my son was younger, I still didn't know how to drive, so I would visit my mom every every Monday, and I would usually walk from from my place to her place which is like a 30 minute walk. and during that time, my dad was not working Mondays so he would come pick me up and then I would go over there. and I remember that one specific that specific day it was like a day i'm pretty sure it was during the summer, because I was wearing shorts he picked me up and he started like. telling me like really weird themes like compliments, but they were making me feel really uncomfortable like Oh, you have really like nice legs and things of that sort, he asked me to put his hand on my thigh and I told him no and he still did. And then he was like trying to hold my hand and like saying like really inappropriate things to me. So as soon as we got to my mom's House I just I got off I took my son off, I went inside the House like crying and I asked my mom to let me borrow some pants like to put them on so she instantly knew that something was wrong, I told her. Obviously, she was upset and like she. Confronted him about it, and he all he had to say was that's not what happened she's lying. And um. yeah so ever since that happened I I tried to not be around. My dad like I don't. You know I try to avoid being in the same room as him just me and him. But yeah so I I, I know that that's why I had that dream, but it had already been a while side, and it was kind of out of nowhere that I just came back up."
252.0,Provider,"that's kind of like what. trauma. yeah yes, do you that's what it does, it just comes at the weirdest times now. Is that the only time that you know of that you remember."
13203.0,Patient,"um I have like a really vague memory of another situation when I was younger with my dad but I don't I don't know if it actually happened. because every time I try to think about it, it kind of feels like I dreamt it like it was a dream. But I remember the specifics of it, so I don't know and at that time I had never I didn't say anything if it did happen, I never said anything I kept it to myself, so now it's been so so long that I kind of like it happen or did I just dream it."
252.0,Provider,"How old, are you."
13203.0,Patient,I want to say I was like 10 or 11 I was like a fourth grade.
252.0,Provider,You know that our mind will protect us.
13203.0,Patient,hmm.
252.0,Provider,"You know if something happens, and it is too traumatic for us it'll block it a little bit. And it'll kind of hold it in a safe place until we're ready to process. And maybe you know the dream is the actual situation oh. and your fear. Of the rejection of the whole family."
13203.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"And that's really to me what it sounds like you know I don't have any doubt, I mean you, we just don't have memories. of somebody doing that to us unless we've experienced it. yeah 10 years old it's not like you're sitting there watching porn. yeah right. Where did it come from. your mind had to have gotten it from somewhere. hmm you know and the detachment from it is what it feels like a dream."
13203.0,Patient,"yeah because even even now, with what happened recently. I was sitting there in front of him and he looked me straight into my eyes and he said, I did not do that, and for maybe the first couple months I was like. I kind of questioned myself, I was like it is did I actually like misinterpret the situation is that not what happened, no, but I was like no like it happened, he said, those things to me, and that was not okay. And I mean. Everybody like my my brothers and my mom and everything and they all know. Except my younger sister like she knows that something happens she just doesn't know the details of it. And they all do believe me, so I didn't face I like question from anybody, you know they believe me right away, and they were all really upset and we all kind of detached from him because of it. But you know I also understand that, like my mom she's not she was raised to where you're going to stick with the person that you married, no matter what yeah so you know when it recently happened. You know, we would all be like you know why don't you just like leave him like you know my sister's there she's like in her 1513 years you know we're worried that you know something might happen to her. And my mom takes her proportions, she doesn't like let her be really home alone when it's just them to or things like that, but she's not gonna like leave him, you know. yeah oh. That was like a little stressful because I know that she's gonna stick by, even though I know she doesn't agree with what happened it's still kind of that sense of like well i'm just gonna pretend like it didn't happen situation."
252.0,Provider,"Like then time anything about it because I married this man for live things you know. where he comes from her culture says you stick by them. yeah so she probably feels. You know a little trapped herself. And then, how to deal with it."
13203.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"The great part about it, though, is that she supported you. um you know she didn't tell you that you were lying she didn't any of that stuff. yeah Emily believed you that is important for you. You know and. she's taking precautions with your sister."
13203.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know so that's important to. You know, do you think if anything happened with your sister that. She would your sister would say something."
13203.0,Patient,"um, I hope, so I think she you know I have talked to her and just I told you know if anything with you feel anything weird if you feel like. The slightest bit uncomfortable like let somebody know like it doesn't have to be me doesn't have to be my mom just you know our older brothers, to say something to somebody and she's yeah I know. But you know you never know when you're in the situation you're kind of just like don't know what to do."
252.0,Provider,"at all. So, remember that, again, you know we have to process trauma. And that is from you know it's a childhood experience and that's happened twice by somebody that is supposed to protect you. And so you know your body's holding in your mind is holding right. And it'll let you process a little know promote your dreams, you know along. With the fear of what could have happened. So just remember that. that's part of your past. Is your mind trying to get rid of it, trying to process it out, you know. And when you wake up, you know know where you're at and know you're safe, no, you know you don't have to ever worry about that again. You know you have to tell yourself to get yourself calm down. it's Okay, you know um another trick. There is something that's called you know the child within. And when we are children and we experienced traumatic events. You know at that age that little child is left wounded inside right and it can cause all types of insecurities will. abandonment abuse all types of different things, it can correlate from. This might sound funny but. You go back inside your mind. And you love that little 10 year old. And you tell her that she say. You tell her that you leave her. And that you're going to protect her. And by doing that allows you the adult. To get some semblance of peace. Have you ever heard about that."
13203.0,Patient,"No, I have actually but that that sounds like very good."
252.0,Provider,"yeah you just and you can do it when you're like in the shower you can do it when you're taking a bath you can do it when you're getting ready to go to sleep because it's all here right. And you go back to that day to that time after it's over and you grab a hold of yourself at that age and you hug her and you love her and you tell her that she is safe. protector, to the best of your ability yeah."
13203.0,Patient,"Because I I do feel like. Those experiences did affect me a lot just growing up in general, because when I was in high school, I was like around maybe like. 1516 years old, it was my freshman year and. I had a boyfriend. My first like official boyfriend that I was like allowed to have yeah. So, and there I was with that person for two years and those two years the whole relationship, it was a really abusive he would. manipulate me he would make me feel like really insecure about myself and it got to the point, the reason we ended up, I guess, breaking up was because he manipulated me into ditching school to spend the day with him because I hadn't met his mom the whole time we were together. And so, he was like you know pressuring me like hey you know we haven't met my mom like it's been two years and we have a matter and i've met all your family, and this is not. So I was like Okay, and then, once I ditched and I was at his house everybody Left and I was just there. with him and then he started like telling me like to do you know sexual things with him, and you know be right, when I got there, he was like telling me like where he had all his weapons and like that he had this and that, so I was kind of like Okay, why are you telling me that and. And so, he what ended up happening was that he ended up like kind of forcing himself on me um which at the time I didn't see it as that because I was like he's my boyfriend and. You know I said no, but then I didn't say no afterwards, you know, like, I felt like I didn't really like I get fight him off in a way. So then. During like after that happened I started getting calls my parents like hey there they're calling us that you're not school Where are you. And so, in the moment I was still trying to protect him because he was my boyfriend so I was like i'm with my friends on like on Main Street. And they're like oh Where are you Where are you we're going to go pick you up and so he supposedly said that after we had met his mom and everything like before you know. I would get home at the regular time that school was over that he would take me to my house like he would drive me to my house and everything, but then after when you know, I was getting those phone calls and for my dad and telling me she was like oh just just walk just go leap walking. And I was like i've never like been out on my own like walking places like I can manage, but you know, so I walked from his house to Main Street. Where I got picked up my parents were not buying the whole I was with friends. That i've made story stayed the same, I was with friends and we just came to Main Street, and they took me back to school. I got asked by the principal what happened, I kept my story, the same until I got home and my brother was like I know you're lying to me tell me the truth and he was like grilling me about it, so I ended up telling him, he was mad, but I felt like he was the only one that really. In that, at that time, he was the only one that cared enough to be like okay well. it's the way that you're saying it like the way that you're saying is not the way that you're like body language is explaining it. So, then they took me to like the I think it's called valley crisis Center and all that stuff to do all the procedures of when you know you get raped and all that stuff. They took me to planned parenthood to get like the like the after pill, and all that and my dad at the time, he was like I don't want anything to do with that. And, and my mom I mean she was really upset she didn't know how to deal with it, she was kind of like in shock also so it was my older brother that actually. took me to the police station, I made the report and he took me to the planned parenthood they took me all the way to fresno to do some other procedures and. And all that but. yeah that was kind of another situation, where I was."
252.0,Provider,your brother to 100% right. yeah hundred percent.
13203.0,Patient,"I know he was I know he was super super mad at me, but he was the only one that kind of was like Okay, well, we have to do something about it yeah."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and. No one time as all should have overtaken. period. You know. So know that. You know, it sounds to me like that kid had a totally premeditated and pre planned."
13203.0,Patient,"You know, because before before that happened. He had already kind of been hinting like asking questions about this night, and I was like Oh well, I don't I don't want to do that and. You know, he would ask me for pictures and I was like I don't feel comfortable doing that, but then he's like well if you don't send them to me i'm going to tell people you did anyway. And in my teenage brain I was like well. And I just have to send it to him, so that he won't say anything. So he did have pictures of me and i'm in I feel like in his mind he felt like he didn't do anything wrong. yeah so that day that all that happened that was the last day I ever seen heard of him everything I I my brother he took all my social media accounts, he. I had nothing I had no way of communication so that's how like We broke up. So he's still tried getting in contact with me like he would tell people hey tell her need to talk to her, and you know I school I would have like. five people coming up to me a day hey he needs to talk to you hey he says, I had this at that and i'll just be like I don't I don't know who, that is. and and I lost my train of thought. Oh, but he's still trying to keep in contact with me and and he would then use all those things that he knew about me or things that did happen, and would like flip them and try to make himself the victim. yeah Oh, she just you know she did this, and now she's not talking to me. You know so then, like the rest of that school year it was miserable for me, because I would have people telling you like hey I heard this I heard that is that true did you do that, to him. And I would one time I just I left class because we were like in the middle of a test and the girl next to me, she was like hey. I heard that he has these pictures and those pictures and they you were doing this, this and that with him and I just got up and left because I couldn't I couldn't handle it."
252.0,Provider,that's gaslighting number one. But in the same sense that's emotional you know torture.
13203.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,Is what that is you know and it's a i'm glad you got away from him. You know. He would have gotten worse.
13203.0,Patient,"Yes, and in my mind I feel like. Because of. Because of how my parents with Tommy like you know if you have a boyfriend like it has to be like serious, so I told myself if I have a boyfriend. I have to stay with this person like you can't just be like oh i'm with them for a couple months and now i'm not with them, and now I want to date somebody else, like, for me it was once I started dating That was the person that I was going to be with. me forever and I feel like that's also the mentality, they kind of got me into that situation, because I would start noticing things or I you know. Really early on, he would ask me for money to buy drugs and thankfully, I never had money to give them either way, but I would always tell him, though, and. You know, so it started like really like progressively At first it was just like she would ask me for money than would like comment on what I would wear like, why do you wear that. Why do you do your makeup and so and then he would start like guiding me different ways and like oh i'm your boyfriend I can do that."
252.0,Provider,he's.
13203.0,Patient,"grabbing you different way yeah like at. School like he would you like trying to like always be like hugging me. And you know sitting on his lap and things like that you know one time he, like left me a really big hickey that I had to like hide. Be in you know it was just I don't know where like we were just hugging and then all of a sudden, I fill them all up on my neck like what are you doing he's like oh it's fine like okay."
252.0,Provider,"But in this mark. yeah you know you're his territory. You know. And that's part of the reason why he felt so justified in what happened. And why he didn't feel like you did anything wrong. yeah no was because of that. And because we you know when you were taught right, it was your parenting style that you were taught with. You don't go from person to person you stick with the one. Right, and that is exactly a piece of it. But the great part about it, too, is that that experience. I think probably opened your eyes for the last experience."
13203.0,Patient,Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"A little bit more, and you were able to go tell and that's because of your brother. yeah doing what he did he did it he did something really, really awesome for you, you know what I mean. Because most a lot of families, you know will want to just put it on the carpet and you know don't want anybody to know, but that just makes things worse inside emotionally that just you know you stay with this thought that I did something wrong. You know that's my fault that happened, the reality of it is, is that you told them no. Right. yeah one time that's all it should have taken but. You know, he was he had I feel like it was premeditated. You knew what time his family was leaving you knew that you guys are going to be alone, he knew all these things."
13203.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"And so, he premeditated that whole setup. yeah and then he didn't take no for an answer when you, you know, the first time that you said it. yeah and you get in this this mindset when you're in that situation where it's like you freeze in it. he's not going to stop anyone is right."
13203.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,So let's let's get through it okay right. And then that's where that those feelings come that. you're at fault.
13203.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,"it's just not true and that's what you tell yourself, you know going and talking to your brother was the best thing you ever could have done an intake any down and give these getting these things handled, regardless of the outcome. You wasn't a secret. Right it got it got moved and it got reported and so so so many women and boys hold it in for the rest of their life in every relationship, from that point forward is is just wrecked. yeah you know. So you did yourself a favor I tell you brother."
13203.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm glad that I did, because I feel like if I wouldn't have like you said, I would have still been stuck it would have gone way worse yeah I. mean because I was with him for two years in a was exactly the same those whole two years and the thing was that was even worse that will. Maybe for like half a relationship we didn't see each other mom so it was all over the phone and he would still make me feel that same way, because he was. In a foster home. He then. He had gotten in trouble here and more sad, so they took them to I think modesto or fresno and he was over there for a whole year and then, when that happened he had. He had run away. So that was another reason why I didn't want to say that I was with him because I knew that if I said that I was with him, he wasn't supposed to be back here and reset. yeah you know, he was already you know, on the run from his foster home that he was at. Because he wasn't he's not supposed to be with his mom. You know, but then also like he the reasons that he told me why he ran away he's like I want to be, but my mom she's doing really good now like, so that we could all be together and this man like I really want you to meet her. um so yeah he wasn't a good person like at all, but I always have. I believe that. The things that you do are not necessarily a reflection of who you are so I always give people the benefit of the doubt and people did warn me when I started talking to him, like hey he's not a. he's not a nice guy like he's not he's always getting into trouble, but I was like whoa I don't know him I don't I don't know that you know that might be what people see you know, but once you get to know someone you, you know you see a different side of them, but no, they were right."
252.0,Provider,"They were right. He came from a troubled past. Whether it be you know, Lord only knows in his home. yeah where he came from, and why use imposter here, you know it doesn't necessarily mean that. You know, he did anything wrong, it could have been his parents, it could have been his mom it could you know you just don't know just don't know. yeah I feel sorry I feel sorry for kids in foster care, you know. And i'll tell you i'm a foster care i'm a California foster kid."
13203.0,Patient,Who.
252.0,Provider,"I was raised in California foster system myself until I was 10 years old 10 years later and that's like a fight all on your own you know um and I know back in my day, which was 4040 years ago, you know 45 years ago. Things were nice yeah you know definitely. But. That is still no reason. When a woman says no one time. That should cease and desist everything in that moment. Though if ands or buts. So, remember that. hey. hey yes okay you don't have responsibility in what happened there. Okay."
13203.0,Patient,"So I know sign up for a really long time and even maybe like months after that I was, I was still like you know I up until recently I I can't like I couldn't tell myself like it wasn't my fault like. It happened to me like I had nothing like I didn't cause it, you know, except for us, I was like well if I wouldn't have if I wouldn't have. Like ditched if I would have just you know, taking the bus to school and if I would have done this and if I would have done that, and I know that my younger brother blames himself will not miss it now, but he blamed himself a lot for what happened, also because. We were a great apart, so we would go to the bus stop together and that day. I told them, I was like i'm not going to take the bus today. And he was like why, and I was like i'm gonna get a ride to school, so you know he went to the bus and I went a little further down the street, and he was just like okay. And you know that's not really typical for for him either you'd always be like no, you know my mom says that we have stayed together, but that they, for some reason he was just like okay. and afterwards, he was like I shouldn't let you go I should have held your hand and drive you to the bus stop now like, I know, but you didn't know. You didn't know what was going to happen, I didn't tell you, who I was going with I told you i'm going to take i'm going to get a ride to school right and yeah he was he for the longest time he was very upset with himself and he said. If I would have just had some no held on to you."
252.0,Provider,yeah but. Okay. You had no possibility and then.
13203.0,Patient,yeah you know.
252.0,Provider,"And, knowing that. The thing that that I don't know if your experience if you've experienced this or you thought about it well, if I wouldn't put myself in that situation if I would have gone with them before I would have done that so it's my fault that it happened. you've got to get out of that thinking. throw that thinking out the window because that's absolutely not true, you should be able to go any place that you want to go without the threat of somebody touching you when you don't want to be touched, and when you say no one time, that is all it should take this one time. doesn't matter if he's your boyfriend doesn't matter if you're in his parents house none of that matters. season assistance, no means no. And that's what you remember. Definitely, I have experienced in the stuff I have experienced in the process and the way of the thinking and the truth. The truth is no means no. I learned, I was on a really fast my other person's already in there, but really fast, I want to tell you I was on a jury of a rape case and. There was like there was six guys and six women and the girl has almost the same scenario, the girl had went to the guy's house and. He had offered her alcohol, she was a minor. He had offered her alcohol she drank a beer with them and then he started groping her and she told them no she you know she don't want to do anything, then and I he didn't stop and he didn't stop and he didn't stop. She told him no multiple times, he still didn't stop So what did she do but go into that freeze mode that we go into. And, and it happened, and so and thankfully she went and told. She took it he actually went to trial and the jurors are What surprised me the most because you know they're thinking well look what she was wearing. Why would she go there all of those things it's that it's it's a mentality that just drives me nuts. yeah and. I sat there, and one of them was this one lady there and I started my church she's to teach my two year old daughter in preschool and she said, well, I have a nice that's just like that, and if she went in there, she deserved what she got. And I turned around and I looked at her, and I said, excuse me woman of God. You were sitting here judging and saying that, and you teach my daughter, not after today. deserve to be any any. Teaching any children, if that is the opinion that you really have and you might want to check yourself and your relationship with your God. And I was so upset I couldn't believe that it came from this old lady. There was proof that the guy in in video. In taped conversations with him, he admitted that that he should have stopped he admitted it Baba Baba and one of the guys did not want to have to make a decision. On the case on the jury and so he went and told the jury coordinator that he had looked it up the night before, and it was complete miss trial. And that girl was so upset so upset because now she had to turn around and do it all over again and tell her side of the story to a whole nother 12 set of people we go through, so much so much scrutiny so much. Just to be heard and believed mm hmm you know. So just know that no means no one time. Remember that Okay, yes, this, by the way, the second jury you'll see. He was he he was guilty, you know."
13203.0,Patient,"I remember when I went to go make my report, you know they since they practically it's funny because they knew who he was. And all they said was how did you get caught up with him and I was like well, I met him at school. And they're like cool you know I told him what happened and everything I showed a messages of prior you know of him already kind of insinuating and me telling him that I would didn't want to do that. And things like that, and then they're like well since you guys are both miners it would is I think they said that it would be statutory rape and that if they charged him with something that they would have to charge me with something."
252.0,Provider,Why.
13203.0,Patient,"I have no idea I didn't really understand in in that moment, I was just kind of like still so caught up and what had happened that. You know my brother was just like what what why you know, but then they're like i'm like you can't speak for her like they had they wanted me to ask the questions that I didn't know how to ask. And so we just kind of left it at that."
252.0,Provider,"You know, if you would have if they would have connected you to the women's resource Center. would have been a whole nother scenario. yeah I could tell you that, because women's women's re advocates for women's rights. Is what it is and it's for women. Who experienced, domestic violence and who have. gone through what you've gone through and they have lawyers backing them up, they have people that help you. walk through the system they go to everything with you, including to go talk to the COPs and make the report. Whatever it takes in order to get through it and it being handled the right way it's supposed to be handled, but I still can't believe what it was you're supposed to be charged with."
13203.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know they're like well if he's gonna get in trouble you're going to get in trouble, too, because. First of all, you guys are both supposed to be in school. He was a run away from his foster home and I I was I ditched and that because we were the same age that it wasn't really rate is practically what they told me."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God i'll tell you what the women's resource Center what I had a field day with that. period because no means no yeah that is right. So you know what I mean it sounds to me like the person that you talk to you just didn't want to deal with it."
13203.0,Patient,"yeah because then they also they're like well, you could just all you can do is get a restraining order. he's like, but in order to get a restraining order you need to get your parents to sign for it, or something like that, and I was, I will cut my brother doing like no, it has to be your like legal guardian. And my dad wanted nothing to do with it, so that didn't happen and his mom actually would have would call me and harass me through over the phone like so much so that we had to disconnect our House phone. because she would call me every day pretending to be my friends, she would say like hey you know i'm i'm this person juliet's friend. And then you know my brother was like hey your friends on the phone I was like none of my friends have my house phone number none of them and they're like well then, who is this, you know, and they will put on speaker and I was like that's his mom. And I never talked to her, I don't know what she was calling me for. But I remember the last time that she did call. You know my brother was like so over that he was a you know I know who you are. And we're tired of it, and he went off on her, and he was and she started like you know threatening us and threatening me and saying that she was going to call the like deportation on us, and this is nine yeah. That, but that was the last time that we had heard of her at all."
252.0,Provider,"yeah that she would have been arrested for that. For sure you know. Just know that not only were you, you know violated by him, but you are also violated by the system. And that's really true. So you, the only thing that you did is the tool."
