And funny enough those. Someone else on Twitter in the tech Community that is like a mirror image of him, like all these all these different people coming forward saying how terrible that particular guy spent over the years to it's just crazy. But um a few weeks ago. I want to say. end of August. The company. That I worked with through him that was using him, you know, using his technicians. reached out to him and ask if it's okay to continue work with me and he said yeah. So, then they reached out to me and said what i'd be interested interested I said yeah because i'm like they're only technician in the area and i've been doing good work and all the clients me too so. I just had after delays and stuff of the clients not sure which days do what I just had my first. day of clients on Tuesday San Francisco and hayward so it was it felt really good to actually like be out and be doing something again, you know. wow again it's it's just it's just consulting work is not consistent, but it is money, and it is something. i'm still working on trying to get a full time job, especially with the unemployment that ended on September 4 for everybody. You know, definitely affected me so. that's something on that side of."
416.0,Provider,It could this turn into a full time job for you.
9051.0,Patient,"Not through them, but I am still trying to get a. Other work and and other. A friend is trying to get me in full time where she works in a to be a remote position and. So yeah really hoping that that happens."

416.0,Provider,"Is it like is it something that's within your wheelhouse like are you well positioned for it, or is it."
9051.0,Patient,"A it's a slight stretch, but she said don't worry about that you know, for what I do know it's a good starting point. And it's more on the quality of character and the person that they're after and she's like your definite fit for what they're after so it kind of she kind of knocked down my anxiety, you know and concerns. worries over that so just waiting to hear back."
416.0,Provider,I mean that sounds like an amazing day.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no. i'm still I still haven't got the. The mystery unlocked, so to speak, real quick how's my audio on your side."

9051.0,Patient,"Okay, I got like my fan on when i'm not sure if that's hitting the microphone. Little desk fran. So um yeah so I haven't unlocked the mystery of. What am I trying to say here. i'm. Finding a great way to study. i'm. So that's a."
416.0,Provider,study we tell me more What do you mean study study for.
9051.0,Patient,"Focusing on. Focusing on. Like. The new like job related like trying to learn and new subjects I have everything I have my books, I have my subscription a websites that you know will teach you a subject from A to Z. And I have access to all that i've been paying for that, but like the month, you know the ADHD my mind still wonders. Even when I take out all the distractions and stuff so i'm still at 300 milligrams of the wellbutrin. I think. On the next one, Mary is going to take me to 450 to see if that helps but, if not i'm hoping she's a you know, of course, will let me go on to the next possible. medication that you know clicks well with my brain chemistry and all that. um you know the adderall had a slight good effect but also like. Oh, maybe, maybe we have not talked about that in our last session so the adderall adderall had a good like. boost, if you will. i'm mentally i'm not sure about focus, but the side effect, I experienced was this intense feeling anxiety of like worried like. The constant thought for each day it took it was like something bad's going to happen, I don't know what it is, I don't know what shape is going to happen in but I need to be prepared kind of thing like that that feeling of."
416.0,Provider,Like like hyper vigilance.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah like don't relax. Something to possibly happen. I don't know if it's going to be issue my computer I don't know alien alien to gonna tag but something's going to happen. yeah just be prepared like that's that's kind of like. I can translate emotions and all that into actual like word. Is kind of like yeah So when I told her that Chad, she said, stop taking it and then. yeah so that was to."
416.0,Provider,yeah that's a powerful stimulant and stimulants will do that.
9051.0,Patient,"um. But yeah. Do you have a follow up appointment with Mary to talk about some of this stuff. I mean know we discussed it all in chat she couldn't have, I think one thing that stopped her from going to the 450 was the fact she mentioned on Monday that since you and I haven't had a session she can. yeah resume you know the prescription route, until then, so I was like oh wow like I didn't even the one I keep forgetting the schedule with Julian to I didn't know that was going to impede that so yeah that. That connected with compliance, right after they set me up for today and in two weeks from today, sound."
416.0,Provider,"Good yeah okay. that's great yeah I mean when you're on a lot of medication, obviously the. You know the medication is necessary and I get all of that, but it's also there's behavioral changes involved in all of this, too, right and we want to just make sure that we're monitoring any. Any mental health impacts that this must have that this might have on you positive or negative right, so that we can kind of help you smooth the way through all this. yeah Tom."
9051.0,Patient,"Speaking of which. My sleep test was supposed to occur on August 23 the day of the sleep test I got a call from asleep panic and they said oh. We have to reschedule you because the technician Paul did sick so like okay. And then, it was like a whole week of like back and forth yeah they called me at some random time and I didn't answer they left a message I called him back hey you know. Trying to reschedule trying to reschedule and so that has not happened at all, so I need to go back to my doctor and see if I can go to another sleep clinic or that sleep clinic and get their stuff together and actually getting me in. Because I would like to start getting good sleep and i'm not going to get that until I have a sleep test and then hopefully after sleep test actually get approved for the machine, this time."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah. that's frustrating yeah but sleep test and see pap machine aside, I have. been doing better with sleep, you know getting tired around 11pm 12am. going to sleep, I would say 75% of the time. minus getting up for bathroom breaks i'm make it, you know until you know seven hour eight hours you know into the sleep session start my day. The other 25%. has been the I go to sleep, but only sleep for three hours and then i'm kind of like awake for a couple hours in the back to sleep. So i've mostly been successful on that front."
416.0,Provider,House how are you are you. Are you noticing the difference during the day.
9051.0,Patient,of sleep.
416.0,Provider,When you are having the better sleep.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah I would say so i'm like you said you know habits and routine affects a lot, you know, like the day that I woke up Tuesday, two days ago. To be in San Francisco at 9am and you know, I was up at. 640 I was up at 640. And you know walk the dogs and showered in you know gathered up all my equipment and stuff. And you know, made it there on time and yeah so that was like a real. Efficient day. But. But definitely efficient out of necessity, you know because it's like Okay, I have purpose i'm needed here and then after you know, I was supposed to leave San Francisco lot sooner, but the. Remote technician kept me there a little longer to check some things so I was late getting out to hayward by like 22 minutes two o'clock or rather to 22. But that session went well as well, welcome through some companies warehouse to replace their wi fi system and just take a note of what i'm going to need to do. So there's a part two, to that visit. or company, but uh yeah it was a was just Nice. Like I said, having a think once on working full time and there's like a set schedule that's going to like push everything out so total alignment. yeah because it has to you know, be in alignment. And you know this, this whole quarantine and unemployment. spell that's been happening it's just. it's it's been a lot, you know I gotta tell different friends and different conversations that uh. What do you call it. That. This whole quarantine and you know be totally different on my mental health if you know at the start of it, I just had 120 grand in the bank and every day is about waking up and not being bored and exercising or something. You know no financial worries at all. What. yeah that that would have just been such a key. Key key player in the difference of my mental health and everything. Oh, my God everything."
416.0,Provider,yeah. I mean that's a big deal. yeah financial worry weighs heavy right in times like this.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah I was telling another friend a day ago like man i'm i'm kind of a just a tad bit envious of the other people who are at home and board, you know staying with their parents and they just. bored you know there's food in the fridge they don't have to worry about buying there's bills they don't have to worry about paying or just oh my God i'm at my parents and my mom or dad keeps asking me to blah blah blah like do you know how lucky, you are. But I don't want to go back to that you know it's not an option for me when my parents were like. You know my sister or something or living with my brother, if I had to. it's blessed and happy that i've made it this far and this actual apartment that i'm in for 11 years now, or 11 years in December. You know."
416.0,Provider,it's it's just the idea of being. supported and cared for when you're struggling.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah or just you know, like I said the money factor not having to worry about anything. it's like Oh, the fear of code at all the fear of you know. Some drunk driver, you know hitting you in your car or your bicycle is you know, like the stuff that can happen anybody in the course of a day in the world, you know. But again. Money doesn't solve everything but it absolutely solves everything that money can solve is what I say."
416.0,Provider,brilliant it's true.
9051.0,Patient,Thank you.
416.0,Provider,"yep very true. yeah well and it provides a question right. yeah it provides a buffer between us and certain types of hardship. certain types of worry mm hmm. yeah I mean that's real for sure. Well, so. I mean. As things kind of come together a little more and more for you of thinking about that is there, something that you would do any differently for like in cases of wherever that happen again. i'm."
9051.0,Patient,In in on what particular things like.
416.0,Provider,financially or or other ways like would you focus more on savings or investment.
9051.0,Patient,"or yeah yes Apps absolutely savings um. and yeah i've actually. gotten a little better at that, like. don't laugh i've seen to be able to really do it is to like take money out the Bank and like just put it into a you know container or whatever. and pretend, you know it doesn't exist, and then you know add on to and I got all the way up to 400 say, but then I had to use that because of. Delays with you know, the new work starting and also the unemployment ending. So yeah. that's something i'm going to resume doing. And just. yeah the whole. cliche overused rainy day fund. mm hmm yeah."
416.0,Provider,"that's right yep. I think that um you know, having that sort of level of security is very good for our mental health if it's at all possible."
9051.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness, yes. yeah yes. And yeah i've been traditionally bad at that it's it's it's crazy it's like On one hand. I consider myself, you know financially literate I know what to do, um you know I know the the the basics and ideas scenario where i'm actually making good money and rent as less than 25% you know i'm a chump being taken out. So you know. Six grand coming in a month 1500 goes to rent and the remaining 4500 you know, half of that gets saved and then there's still a bunch of money left over for you know groceries random impulse buys on Amazon. You know and and like that's great so. A friend of mine actually said to me some years ago. The problem is you're not that with money you're just not making enough money and that kind of you know, hidden in a certain way, like i've never thought of that like you're right like i'm not. Spending bad i'm just not making enough, you know. To be on my own in the Bay area, etc. You know and be comfortable and be able to do all the things smart person is supposed to and we'll Do you know what their money every month."
416.0,Provider,So this if you were to get this job or one like it would that cover you.
9051.0,Patient,"Oh Julie Julie, yes. Oh, oh yes. I can say yes for the next 40 seconds like it's. It would be a good friend. Yes, because the the the blessing is because i've been here 11 years. And I don't have evil landlords. My rent you know started out at 1200 a month, and right now it's like 1575."
416.0,Provider,that's low for Bay area yeah.
9051.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,loving years and that's is that your portion or is that the whole thing.
9051.0,Patient,So total.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh say your roommate paste part of that too."
9051.0,Patient,"yeah but one of them um him and his wife, are going to be moving out end of the year and the other one may move out. He pays you know the least but also is like living in the living room, which is fine for him fine for us. So yeah that that worry and concern of. It being all back on me just like it was you know, three years ago, before they moved in. yeah it's it's it's a super low amount of rent to pay as long as your income is decent you know. or or average you know even. You know, like when I talked to different people you're working yet. i'm like no not yet still looking Oh, why don't you just go apply at. such and such or a little tight here and i'm like. I need to make a certain minimum you know, like I don't want you know them to announce oh i'm moving out in a month to giving you the heads up and i'm like Okay, how do I bring in that income like having a certain minimum says, I can you know. pay all of the rent you know."
416.0,Provider,rank right yeah.
9051.0,Patient,"And the the new tech job Oh, my goodness rent is paid savings, you know, and I can start knocking down debt as well, and still have money left over, you know, like it's just a great outcome, you know so i'm really hoping it happens."
416.0,Provider,So we're just gonna put all of our energy into that or something similar right. yeah really.
9051.0,Patient,"And also i'm not stop there, not. Thinking about that too, like yeah i'm stressed out but I need to also apply to other places, just in case this falls through I still have other lines in the water, you know."
416.0,Provider,"Well, and even if it didn't fall through even if you've got them there's a whole strategy around sort of like leveraging the different offers that you get."
9051.0,Patient,yeah very true to.
416.0,Provider,"drive up your income yeah. So yeah never a bad idea to apply and see what you see what you got. So that sounds like it's kind of a big part of your focus and you know what's lovely about that in addition to obviously the the financial benefits is. it's the proactive approach that we're taking right where you're just like i'm on this i'm gonna. i'm it's like taking control of a situation that's felt out of control, for a long time."
9051.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's definitely been on my mind this last week, like. Really. How do I put it. Seeing the benefits and all of the the the ripple effect benefits of like just having i'm. Just having you know stability and financial you know control, you know again i'm. Sorry, email just popped up I just got paid for the job that I did two years ago."
416.0,Provider,Two years ago.
