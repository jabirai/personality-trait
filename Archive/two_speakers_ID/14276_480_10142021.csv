ID,Role,Message
14276.0,Patient,"Hello. Oh, my video that hasn't started yet sorry but it's not very much video i'm i'm feeling very nauseous right now. and bring down."
480.0,Provider,"Well here's something I was gonna ask you is because I know you have other therapists do you want to do, individual therapy with me through bright heart because you don't have to since you have other therapists."
14276.0,Patient,I was told I had to.
480.0,Provider,"know you totally don't have to, because what we do in this situation is actually it's not. recommended to have a bunch of different therapists it's like an ethical thing because you never know what they're working on and you don't want to be saying things that are opposing what they're doing so, all I have to do."
14276.0,Patient,Is told I if I if I. didn't have you as a therapist or anybody as a therapist I would be removed from the program that's what I was told. you'd have to you'd have to talk. To so.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I have this is what i'm telling you so that's not accurate information, all we have to do is i'm still going to be listed as your therapist through bright heart, but what we put for individual therapy frequency is managed by outside provider, so all I."
14276.0,Patient,it's it's just I need my I i'm I needed my abuse prone to be a monthly instead of weekly and they said they'd only do that if I talk to you. I think.
480.0,Provider,"So um. yeah no that's not going to affect your meds at all, who told you that was that the doctor."
14276.0,Patient,People that was that was that was very hurt hills.
480.0,Provider,Like the intake people. huh okay yeah.
14276.0,Patient,"They wouldn't change it, but I did get a 30 day thing but. i'm I just can't keep doing weeklies because of my memory loss I can't remember to refill it every week."
480.0,Provider,"yeah no I totally understand that so um yeah we can totally make this work with you, not having to do therapy with me that doesn't affect your prescription at all anyway."
14276.0,Patient,The reason why I wanted one on one is because I can barely get any like MED MED talk with the weekly. therapy people.
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14276.0,Patient,I can't talk medicine barely at all with them.
480.0,Provider,"So that would be more of the doctor, though, because i'm not a doctor, so I don't know much about matt. So."
14276.0,Patient,I don't think I even have a doctor for bright heart health.
480.0,Provider,Is Sharon is the doctor she is well.
14276.0,Patient,"yeah she is just she's booked out I can't I can't give to her, so I need you, instead, at least for now, because she she didn't she didn't. She didn't like get leave a space for me she's booked out for like weeks at least. So I don't have any other way to. Like. Look we're talking about meds until until she. Like fixes her schedule."
480.0,Provider,And you've asked her about getting individual appointments.
14276.0,Patient,"Yes, but she said she's booked out and she can't change that."
480.0,Provider,huh okay um.
14276.0,Patient,"So i'm supposed to have appointments and i'm supposed to like be updated on my meds it's just really hard to do right now, without having one on one therapist."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14276.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,"that's kind of the my dilemma is, I have no control over MED situations, I don't know much about Minutes because I didn't go to nursing school i'm not a doctor i'm so it's not really going to accomplish anything to talk to me about medication so. that's I mean I can try to see if I can talk to somebody about. Maybe like."
14276.0,Patient,I would have to change my my. My weekly the grid group and I don't want to change my group.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
14276.0,Patient,So i'm basically flip or not.
480.0,Provider,So what's going on with meds currently like are you stable on your meds do you have them did you pick them up.
14276.0,Patient,"I did pick them up and i'm pretty sure I have enough, I think I have a 30 day i'm not entirely sure it's just. I don't know. My brains all frazzled because, like, I only just got out of a really traumatic situation so. I don't. I mean. Having any more therapy is fine with me, I could really use more support it's just. have one group therapist and one trauma therapist so I don't have a regular therapist."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so with your trauma therapists do you do like am Dr what do."
14276.0,Patient,"You do India. Basically, that. I don't know if you know this, but I will we have dissociative identity disorder."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, I do know that."
14276.0,Patient,And I. And there isn't anyone like. geared towards that in bright heart health but that's fine as long as it's like accepted.
480.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah I actually so I did study quite a bit about D ID in Grad school, I mean I definitely am not a specialist by any means, but I do, I am very familiar with it, and I have worked with some clients that have it."
14276.0,Patient,yeah it's just it's it's a little bit hard to believe when there's like the fictional characters and then like real life people interjected into the system.
480.0,Provider,real life people into projected into the system. Like you.
14276.0,Patient,"guys you're it's not actual real life people being. it's not an exact copy. enter decks pretty much are never an exact copy, they can be really close to source, but but. it's. pretty much almost impossible, if not impossible, to have an exact replica of the of the source interjected into the system. I mean i'm not going to completely shut that down, but still. it's like you know youtubers are like celebrities or whatever musicians. Okay okay any."
480.0,Provider,"You know how many identities, you have, do you know, like all of their roles and."
14276.0,Patient,"Oh, almost 90 and there's like a couple stragglers that don't have a plural kit yet. Okay, solid wonder about. there's about 89 solid ones."
480.0,Provider,And they're caught are they all fronting together do they call me like switch.
14276.0,Patient,"Now i'm basically. alone up here with Lou and like i'm not i'm not entirely sure I think I see Jeff over there, but i'm totally sure if there's anybody else around him super tired and, like in the inner rolling just in the tent so I don't really i'm kind of peeking out the 10th seeing if. he's here with like. There there isn't me well, I don't know. Our kind of system is a little bit rare it's called a dream noise system. Okay it's a weird daydreaming hyper creativity thing I can like see myself here here myself in here there's like phantom sense it's really it's neat but also really weird at the same time."
480.0,Provider,When did it start.
14276.0,Patient,"Oh well, I think the split happened at about 10 years old, maybe."
480.0,Provider,"And and have you had all of these since then, or have they been. Slowly building up."
14276.0,Patient,Well it's it's we it was like April like late maze when we figured out that we're plural.
480.0,Provider,fairly new diagnosis.
14276.0,Patient,yeah and. Jasper jokes of there's like a revolving door of all there's it's kind of funny just like going in through the gateway and some some just go back into their old pair cars and which are like little tiny side systems outside the gateway. And then there's some weird super imposition that happened some a good amount of the time where it's like in between. system and then Paris awesome. it's kind of weird and and. it's it's weird I know it's just this weird hybrid creativity thing I don't even really know entirely about you'd have to ask Alex and he's not he's kind of sleepy or now he's not like willing to i'm jack also I don't know if you're okay with creepy pasta altars.
480.0,Provider,With why.
14276.0,Patient,"i'm creepy pasta altars you know, like they're kind of little tiny bite says horror stories or whatever and. stuff like the haunted majority mass. cartridge Jeff killer I was jack that kind of stuff. Okay, those those ones don't do anything that externally, you know or internally really it's just those we have a couple of those you're okay with those right."
480.0,Provider,yeah so tell me a little bit about jack you said jack is the one that's here now.
14276.0,Patient,"yeah that was kind of weird that you referred to i'm right here, let. me, have you don't have to talk like i'm not just i'm literally right here let's means fronting and. that's the thing I was just talking about. i'm the i'm the more. And I guess i'm the cooler interject eilis jack that's like the weird novel where there's like cult stuff and chernow bug and whatever. Not just. The the number of your written on one who had the worst doctrine."
480.0,Provider,The guy the.
14276.0,Patient,"Guy from the original PD pasta, had the worst doctor ever he's like sorry bro he is your kidneys missing I don't know what to do, it's. Too late now like dude dude real. Like dude does he even know about. Any say same thing same problem with jeff's. source, nobody fucking remembers to call the goddamn police. Not that any of that would stop my source, but you know. Nobody remembers that the. Jeff source the. version i'm pretty sure had a policeman, but he was in on whatever the Fuck Randy was doing them bastard but thankfully none of those people are and anymore."

Like yeah we have we have this, we have a like more a feminine Jeff that doesn't go by Jeff the killer and then we have a spookier Jeff that's what we call him he's spookier Jeff who is like just the killer. And then we have like just the other ones like Jeffrey woods he's just he's is a dude who used to be just the killer but it isn't anymore, and then we have like we only have one loop, which is kind of weird but. Lu is the younger brother have Jeffrey woods Lou woods, he has like his own little pee pee pasa homicidal Lou or whatever and. we're paulie so I guess. And also, this is fucking weird but. I probably shouldn't do i'd love to talk about that Emily. it's weird but like it's it's not like bad or anything right. I mean you two are actually biological brothers so it's fine right. Oh he's upset that I even said."

Here all miller's, no, no, no, no, no, no, no it's Jeff free woods and Lou woods in here it's not Miller it's woods. or no name is Miller yeah. that's fine collectively, we are Alex Miller. that's totally fine, but like. it's it's the it's the woods family."

14276.0,Patient,Both of them. yeah.
480.0,Provider,You said Alex has a lot of like the Info that you guys don't have on certain things so where'd it come from.

480.0,Provider,Okay.
14276.0,Patient,"daming made Jasper and ran away because, like. He needed some money at least kind of charismatic but it made it made just for extremely depressed me still extremely depressed today, so you mean Alex to like be be the chameleon to people to like get friends to like chameleon a personality he's very good at that.

God have bad luck and this thing about me and my vessel is the vines kind of melt melded a little bit, so I don't talk like. What people would assume I would talk like I. know. yeah i'm just some some dude kind of. And when I say that's all it's because. The guy who originally own this body is basically gone now because well the whole cult sacrifice thing happened, and then I showed up and."

Now, your representatives that's what you consider it it's like a representative of."

Mother so."

14276.0,Patient,Because of who she was a.
480.0,Provider,Good Christian lady and then mom.
14276.0,Patient,"Because. But because I believe she was a extreme narcissist. yeah there was like verbal abuse, she is she wouldn't call us sexual things, but everything else you would tell us. Like um. I remember selfish. incompetent lazy. I was your primary caretaker at the time. With with our dad at the at that time yeah but are dead barely did anything she just you just let her run fucking hog wild on us. He still regrets it, but like."
480.0,Provider,This so you have a relationship with your dad currently.
14276.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, well he's the only parent that actually accepts us kind of he kind of it it's just he still supports us, but he doesn't really understand the whole thing about being trans having the ID all this other stuff you know. Since we're collectively again non binary demi boy trans man there's a lot of us in here like that. Louis SIS i'm i'm one of the gate me boy trans men he and I are blue, and I also have a relationship. or call. So what."
480.0,Provider,Lou assess though right.
14276.0,Patient,"yeah well i'm gay i'm gay he's assist man, but he's also."
480.0,Provider,Being all this mean we can't be gay.
14276.0,Patient,"This this means they're not trends are non binary. Okay understand what this fun this. he's still pretty good, I know, so I know so."
480.0,Provider,You think you would now.
14276.0,Patient,yeah he's making me blush.
480.0,Provider,Tell me a little bit about i'm. Like do you have siblings that you're still in. touch with.
14276.0,Patient,"External siblings. Who you to be in contact with our grant grid grandfather and grandmother, but they both have pretty bad dimension, probably don't even remember us, and if they do, they remember us as a woman, which is a bad thing."
480.0,Provider,Right.
14276.0,Patient,yeah. Member exam. And you're learning.
480.0,Provider,Now so was it like teens 20s.
14276.0,Patient,"Oh, we transition that somewhere around like. Maybe late 29 early 30."
480.0,Provider,Okay.
14276.0,Patient,came out as.
480.0,Provider,Part of the mom abandoning you guys.
14276.0,Patient,"know we we are have been less November. 29 was before the reason why she have been live, this is because she hates the name Alex."
480.0,Provider,that's the entire reason.
14276.0,Patient,"pretty much yeah. Oh, she needs to. She said she wouldn't get therapy for her problems, but like. If she knew we had the ID if she knew we have the ID she would probably put us in a mental institution or something."
480.0,Provider,I don't fucking she doesn't know.
14276.0,Patient,"She doesn't know because she doesn't need to know, because she event so fucker soccer honestly. Like good riddance man, she is she she said we lied about being sexually assaulted buyer step, then I was a molestation not a full on like our word but it's still bad touch, so why. window relationship with her ever since it was like Sep. tember September of like. September of like. And then we came out. Somewhere in 2019. And my dad keeps saying that I should we shouldn't get top surgery because we got molested and less like a bad thing to say it's like what the Fuck man. that's no not the only reason why we don't like our breath okay."
480.0,Provider,Right well and that's why I was going to ask is that he thinks that's the reason you want top surgery is just to prevent for future sexual assaults.
14276.0,Patient,"You don't go outside. You don't have like contact with any kind of family like that or go outside that often for that to even know yeah. yeah like he doesn't understand that when we. started like getting really big in the chest. We we are 36 double D, we did not used to be that way like even like late teens early 20s we were like in a cup or something and then we took seroquel and then are they literally like blue circle has the. side effect of like breast growth and that may. lead to press what."
480.0,Provider,I didn't even know that that was a side effect of seroquel.
14276.0,Patient,"yeah, it is a side effect of circle that's why there's like guys who get upset because they get breast growth that's like why we have breast Sarah Bowman. And it also didn't help our condition very much."
480.0,Provider,"Right, because you said you got depressed."
14276.0,Patient,"With the Sir no not not depressed it's it was like a misdiagnosis of her. paranoid schizophrenia where it's just like. it's our ptsd and also maybe a little bit of autism i'm not entirely sure we don't have the ability to you know slip that right now but Jeff is like 99.9% sure we have some kind of autism like we were kind of the Stern, back then, the little bit."
480.0,Provider,"Because, and I asked us or didn't."
14276.0,Patient,"Have like. Multiple other like perfect storm factors little bit disturbed. discern like it's a weird perfect storm of like. Being a little bit fucked in the head. I mean we're still kind of like that, but not not in a worrying way you know. It was kind of worrying a little bit."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14276.0,Patient,And I think the the latitude of may have like. changed our brain chemistry back because the whole reason why that's just happened is because we took a medication that gave us like um. Like extremely terrifying nightmares you can't really call them night terrors I don't think because you actually have to not even remember the night terrors I think.
480.0,Provider,And you remembered all these.
14276.0,Patient,"nightmares yeah we remember them they're. very vividly they're. Just terrifying and also it we started getting sleep paralysis to. After the medication. Do you know not medication anymore right we stopped okay. Okay, that was before the circle and. it's just I think our brain chemistry was really fucked up back then and it's not locked up anymore, we don't even need to take live anymore, because the the. The parent has schizophrenia, we do have paranoia but, like our therapist said that it was a misdiagnosis of like a combination of the ID and like really bad ptsd like we have that ship really bad like. The ptsd yeah i'm having di D means you have pretty much. A lot of the time, the split is caused by ptsd. yeah we are and we are energetic friendly so we don't believe that you own you have to have. have to have ptsd to even be a plural, or have. Being plurals a little bit different from having D ID having D ID is a plurality yes it's just we believe of with a we believe in plurality that isn't associated with the ID or STD. Okay, which is like, basically, you have to have trauma and have to be like diagnosed we don't believe that but, like we are diagnosed and we do have the ID so. we're not. we're not very hard line about that yeah."
480.0,Provider,The diagnosis you got in May. That was the correct diagnosis is this still the same trauma therapists you're working with that diagnosis you.
14276.0,Patient,"Yes, um we had a previous trauma therapists who like completely ignored and one of our authors. And um that's a bad thing, because, like."
480.0,Provider,"What happened, what I want to get sick."
14276.0,Patient,She wanted to talk to Damien Damien wasn't like either ready yet or wasn't available and like we were trying to get through jeff's trauma he has a lot of exo trauma I don't know if you know what so trauma means.
480.0,Provider,Now tell me.
14276.0,Patient,it's basically trauma that came from their source it's not it's not like it's not like. trauma that was got gun from like being in the external world in the external body it's from the source.
480.0,Provider,"That they're from the source, from where he. was created."
14276.0,Patient,yeah where where what his like source media was which is gentle.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then he is. What. kind of trauma do we know how we process it."
14276.0,Patient,"yeah it's just it's a it's a shitload of. It is a shitload of luck and I think he wants to say what it is because, like it's a lot it's a lot I don't think we'd be able to cover. All that it's just a mishmash of the original source and the 2015 remain with like a shitload of Fuck before and after also i'm sorry for cursing but that's the old we. miss a lot otherwise a lot. it's a whole lot um."
480.0,Provider,So you seem like a very outgoing fun funny.
14276.0,Patient,"This. is much as an island jack could be yeah I guess. I mean, I think I must have Jasper i'm not entirely sure."
480.0,Provider,"And Jasper, was what was the source for Jasper."
14276.0,Patient,"Jasper is like an original source basically like. para cause some kind of thing, where he doesn't have like an external source. Neither does Alex, I think, but I think Damian has like some kind of basis and silent hill or something and then I don't know about just for he's he's probably like We grew up watching westerns and I think that might be it."
480.0,Provider,Is he cowboy.
14276.0,Patient,"cowboy yes, yes it is adrian's cowboy yep you know and then Alex is like more cyber punk ghost in the Shell he."
480.0,Provider,got it.
14276.0,Patient,"yeah ghost in the shell. No, no, not paranoia if that's that's a different that's a different thing. i'm. Like maybe a little bit of neon genesis and jelly on or something a. little bit of that the whole angels thing yeah. News he isn't he's. he's an angel I guess. Yes."
480.0,Provider,Oh okay.
14276.0,Patient,"I mean, as much as an altar can be an angel because the is not like he can't like influence stuff like that he can only do stuff like internally. Okay he's the hyper creative one he's making the pirate costumes and stuff and. pair cousins is like will dreamscape dream dream life things little places."
480.0,Provider,Internal playgrounds almost right.
14276.0,Patient,yeah I mean he's the one who basically made the 10th that i'm laying in right now.
480.0,Provider,Oh cool.
14276.0,Patient,And Alex is basically think of it as like a D amp D perspective he's the one who does the maps and then the then Jasper does like the characters and stuff.
480.0,Provider,"allegheny. Alex makes the map. Then, because in D amp D, you make the map and you create. The challenges right to."
14276.0,Patient,I yes.
480.0,Provider,So then i'm thinking like usually the person that creates the map has like end game goal for the map is that something Alex does to like is he very logical and. Product.
14276.0,Patient,"uh well I. Some other stuff I could have no other stuff he makes doesn't really make any logical sense. More like the emotion mind create. Creative one. there's this one pair of cars and then looking at it's like What is all this it's it's like a weird. funky labyrinth of like planks of. Like roof wood or something what. let's like Dolly is place. I guess. Okay, I don't even know how this this yeah I don't even know how this would like feasibly work in the external world it's kind of like that one the end the ending part of labyrinth the David Bowie one the labyrinth. That weird. Little place that he was at where you could go like sideways and upside down and stuff. or whatever. it's not exactly like that, but the layout is really funky. Interest like there there's there's like regular places like this, this place right here. Oh right."
480.0,Provider,Are you in it are you looking at it.
14276.0,Patient,"I guess there's like second there's first person and there's third person, I guess, and I guess I have like a little bit of like outside perspective of the mind's eye or whatever. And then kind of weird I don't understand it completely but okay it's this weird hyper creativity stuff because, being a dream way it's not just daydreaming it's like you have a little gateway yeah there's a gateway i'm like. I kind of just teleported here in front of it um but yeah there's a gateway it's kinda like a what's called a stargate it's like a stargate. stargate. Coupled with like, maybe the the little rick and morty like wormhole thing that that happens."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14276.0,Patient,"You go through it and there's a bunch of like little places, you can go to like I could probably like dip my toe and like little Tokyo gould pair costume but. that's a little bit too well for me."
480.0,Provider,While you're jack.

480.0,Provider,names are so hard my middle son is really into anime and it's all really. Difficult names to pronounce.
14276.0,Patient,yeah I mean i'm jack. jack. A not just jack but like I don't usually talk about the eilis part. I like that they it's the other source that i'm more into explains why like I my list and my eyes kind of drip black stuff. turns out.

14276.0,Patient,I yeah but it's not the hot anymore.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, it used to be hot."
14276.0,Patient,it's a different kind of thing now and so some weird Chernobyl do or something.

14276.0,Patient,"it's like black new it gets over everywhere, sometimes I have to like."
480.0,Provider,You have to be careful not to get the goo everywhere.
14276.0,Patient,"yeah I have to clean my hoodies and. Oh, my goodness little bit too much tryna lagoon."
480.0,Provider,"hmm. So let me ask you, what do you normally spend your days doing like walk me through a normal day in your world."
14276.0,Patient,Well it's we stay home pretty much all day.
480.0,Provider,mm hmm. You feel safe in your home.
14276.0,Patient,"Well, really, we don't really feel feel feel safe anywhere but that's the ptsd."
480.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14276.0,Patient,"it's and we also are pretty sure we have borderline personality disorder which is like the avoidant type. yeah we barely got side, we tend to over correct if somebody brings up that we're doing something wrong. yeah it's not that we tend to over it correct it's like 95% of the time we do it. You do yeah like. At least 98% of the time we have to pull back. and be like hey what the Fuck are we. too far it's either we have to pull back or we don't even realize it until it's too late. yeah and it's like oh shit maybe I shouldn't have done that."
480.0,Provider,Which is a trauma response.
14276.0,Patient,yeah I mean usually borderline personality disorder is because you were raised in a bad environment. yeah like. That like taught you that personality disorder. You didn't really have another point of reference. is like our mom's a narcissist. The the extent of there was a nurse's sister Dan didn't really help. He was in a very good person either back. Then we were just surrounded by a lot of very good people.
480.0,Provider,A lot of healthy behaviors.
14276.0,Patient,"Probably yeah and then i'm pretty sure that's why but as. i'm saying that we're. very sure, but we can't we're not like been completely self diagnose. We don't we don't really completely believe in self diagnosis. Okay um well unless like we there's beyond a shadow of a doubt. Which like. The autism, and the the BP the avoidant part we're we're pretty sure we're very close to self diagnosing. Because nobody else seems to really believe us and it's like. We went through the list of everything else, they could have been and it doesn't fit what the as well as this like like going through a whole list of other things it could have been."
480.0,Provider,"With I mean honestly I. I don't think you're off with the BP D. me but also that's not a formal diagnosis, but I can definitely see some of the behaviors traits. yeah that makes sense, a lot of sense and where do you feel like the autism comes from do you feel like you have trouble with empathy making eye contact social cues stuff like that."
14276.0,Patient,"You know, we can be too empathetic but like. See we mask so much that people don't think we have autism. yeah it's like an extreme form of masking because we were told, not even to be ourselves so we mess so hard that we lost our identity. That might be like masking so much that nobody else believes we have autism but us. Because we messed so well. And so completely pretty much that nobody else knows yeah, but we have autism i'm pretty sure that we do like 90% sure, but the masking is constant if we like let it down. We will get into trouble because that's that's how bad, we are at social cues immediately if we like relax the masking a little bit the social cues just go out the fucking door we don't unders we don't."
480.0,Provider,live our external people.
14276.0,Patient,"Yes, we we will Fuck up our social cues and get into trouble. like an interpersonal relationship stuff. Like breaking rules and like discord or whatever on accident, because. We didn't we didn't like have our heart our fear I. See when. things happen from here, we mess through fear because they're afraid of breaking the. Rules and then it gets a could affirmed negatively affirm when we relax. Right i'm asking because we don't know how to manage the tos we just know how to suppress that's it. That is basically it okay and and it's really hard to be understood, like that."
480.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and I feel like that's probably the common theme here. For all of you is lack of validation understanding feeling not heard a lot of times."
14276.0,Patient,yeah even in system validation doesn't work like 98% of the time.
480.0,Provider,hmm.
14276.0,Patient,"it's like in system internally internal validation is not enough. doesn't even really work it's like but it's like but all of the things that we, we were told as fact is factors children like cuz."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14276.0,Patient,So we need to seek external validation. right because we can't really internally validate ourselves in like a self esteem self worth way. yeah like for identity that's that's fine we're valid on that run pretty much.
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm. But, but not my. intuition emotion experience all of that."
14276.0,Patient,No it's. Self worth part. So self worth and self esteem part.
480.0,Provider,"Like we don't just believing that you're a valuable lovable human being, basically as hard."
14276.0,Patient,And that we deserve to exist. Basically. Playing yeah that's that's held it so badly affected nearby let's pull that the the older chip.
480.0,Provider,Do you have frequent suicidal ideation.
14276.0,Patient,"Not frequent but just for a started thinking about hanging himself again. And not just hanging himself, but like when it gets really bad he thinks about like externally doing it, which has been it, which has happened a couple times but we've been able to calm him down it's just it's really worrying ladies even starting to think about that again. yeah it's just if. If we get a certain amount of stressed out."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so stress is a big warning sign for his suicidal ideation."
14276.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know what it is about like the hanging thing, maybe it's like Western gallows stuff. Oh no. Oh no what it is about that, but like. But."
480.0,Provider,You have.
14276.0,Patient,To like what.
480.0,Provider,Do you have access in your House to things that he could hang you with.
14276.0,Patient,"A I mean sheets would probably be enough, which is worrying to even say. yeah but like Alex won't let him."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, and how confident, are we in the fact that Alex won't let him."
14276.0,Patient,"um. Like. nervousness new guy that kind of showed up listen to the solid, but basically the guy the guy gets powers from like dreams and we're dreamily system so he's basically like our God or something kind of maybe. Is he's got that much power, whatever and he can even stop staring down at this point. and probably is even more powerful than Alex but I don't think he can even ask my manager match Jasper, in his power. yeah he's almost as powerful as Jeff for but not quite."
480.0,Provider,easily as far sounds like the most worrisome. i'll turn no right.
14276.0,Patient,"No i'm this, the thing about Jasper, is he may be the most up sorry he may be the most powerful in the system, but Alex has the be all end all override."
480.0,Provider,OK OK OK. That.
14276.0,Patient,He can he can override stuff that Jasper. wants to do.
480.0,Provider,got it.
14276.0,Patient,will only let's just redo like maintenance stuff and. In like he can't really stop the pair costumes but he's a veal and all for external stuff.
480.0,Provider,Like.
14276.0,Patient,"We have to go through his uh let's see what I call it what you call it interface because, like he's a dear technology kind of guy yeah he's a technology he's like this weird bio droid thing. And like an angel in a weird bio droid. A cyborg body. Body thing yeah. Whatever i'm."
480.0,Provider,Know make sure you have on your zoom screen of Alex is. That like how you own.
14276.0,Patient,"No that's not. that's just some random ball joint adult. Okay, this is something that it's aesthetically pleasing. Okay. Some people, some people have some really some really uncanny valley feelings for the ball going to delve. But we actually saw a couple in real life one said, like, I think it was soccer con or kamala Khan. And like we started, we were about to Fuck you have we solve into our games, because it was so they were so pretty. fucking expensive, though, but there's still printing it. Like we want to collect to that, but we don't have the money for. It so when you have the money and that's where it will go. um well um the the like a. Senior association or whatever is asking Biden for another $1,400 check and we get the same kind of social security that seniors get."
480.0,Provider,Oh OK.
14276.0,Patient,"We would be getting we're probably going to buy a new gaming computer with that, because our old one is like from 2015 which is bad."
480.0,Provider,For gaming they've got to be updated.
14276.0,Patient,"For sure yeah it is we haven't been able to you know get a new one, because one our our mom and stepdad didn't feel like we needed a replacement. And two we don't have them the we don't have the money to replace yeah yeah."
480.0,Provider,So.
14276.0,Patient,"be solid, but like somebody wants somebody wants to switch but he's also kind of not sure because he's effective there's there's like. there's three types of like altars there's fictive which is like me Lou Jeff effective, which is like youtubers and stuff or whatever, and then heritage which is like inner world para calls and stuff which is like their original like like REX. i'm pretty sure that there isn't another like nine foot tall half diagnose boy who. Is addicted to cigarettes and caffeine."
480.0,Provider,And also talk racks.
14276.0,Patient,boy in these. yeah he's he's addicted to caffeine.
480.0,Provider,yeah caffeine is good man.
14276.0,Patient,"We get it. We don't smoke cigarettes externally, but internally. We did does. And i'm pretty sure that courts. has enough throat problems and doesn't need more. hurry. Problems because, basically, is external source is fucking vocal cords are like melting from the the G RD that he has. Oh yeah this hold on."
480.0,Provider,A slew of stuff going on.
14276.0,Patient,yeah we have. A minor form of it but it's. it's related to the hiatal hernia also hi. i'm i'm the one who to. Who jack was talking about i'm the corpse has been alter. Nice to meet you hi um I i'm one of the very shy and emotionally vulnerable ones I don't come out much anymore nowadays because of a few traumatic experiences that I don't want to discuss right now.
480.0,Provider,We don't have to discuss that i'm just glad you wanted to say hi.
14276.0,Patient,yeah it's a. g RD basically. Is when the contents of the stomach go up to the back of the throat. yeah i've heard about that it's like the acid right. yeah it's the stomach contents going up to the back through we it's like having an itchy kind of. Bernie throat and also being really thirsty at the same time.

480.0,Provider,"don't apologize at all oh. This is, this was a very informative session for me and. I hope that we can continue. to work together, and I can get to know more."
14276.0,Patient,"Of the altars. it's it's just we. We feel like the therapy, the one on one therapy that we get isn't enough because we don't have enough time to like. We really need some talk therapy. Because the the trauma therapy basically revolves around the trauma, but like actually talking about stuff and like not being completely. Like latched on to. The D ID and the trauma and stuff. is more freeing so and then shirts would bill it right, because your regular talk therapist there's a difference between having a regular therapist. insomnia. You know, to group therapies, we have one on Thursday five and like Monday like three."
