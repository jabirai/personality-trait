527.0,Provider,How often are you smoking marijuana.
13365.0,Patient,Maybe like twice a week.

13365.0,Patient,"Well thing I feel like it's been helping me like when i'm really, really down. And like let's say like that time I smoke and I started cleaning my room, you know I don't know I just like thinking many. don't know how America works, but it makes me happy in the moment. yeah so I don't know if it's bad that. Was will not depending on I because I don't do it, like every day, or whatever you know, but like I don't know if it's rare that i'm seeing it to you know, once a time like motivate myself. Or you know that it's actually helping."
527.0,Provider,"Well it's it's definitely a mood altering substance so it's going to alter your mood and if you're already having mood problems, then you know, there you are, and you're on medications you know you're putting yourself at risk for those not to work as well as they can. or need to if you're if you're using substances, along with the medication so then we makes it more challenging to to determine, you know, are the medications working because. You know. So. You know about what I hear is, I want to feel better, and so you know, using using thing other things, obviously mood altering substances are going to you know sounds like make you feel better in the moment."
13365.0,Patient,"yeah yeah like sometimes when i'm like crying like crying crazy or stuff like that I just are like feel like so anxious I just go smoke and it may feel better. But totally and it's like I do want to stop but like if I interfere like I was gonna stop smoking, but like start doing like tea or food, you know with it."
527.0,Provider,But.
13365.0,Patient,If it's going to be like a problem with my medications done. Nearly new your new.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. It might be worth trying, you know just trying to see what taking your medications consistently does. and definitely let your doctor know to."
13365.0,Patient,Therefore.
527.0,Provider,"If you're using if you're using marijuana in addition to your medications so that they so that they know you know if and then you know they can better assess that so. Okay. yeah but the same time, what can we do to work on improving your mood because that's certainly something that we can work on developing some tools and coping mechanisms for you to mercia."
13365.0,Patient,Like what.
527.0,Provider,"Well, what do you feel like you struggle with the most do you feel like the depression is is more than the anxiety or. Both about the same both."

527.0,Provider,"Oh sorry um what what skills, you have right now that help with your depression, anxiety, I know that you've been doing some journaling."
13365.0,Patient,"I. don't know what's because I used to do a lot of stuff but. I just stopped doing them I don't feel like I have that energy like I when. I started reading I have like three books Miranda them or. Something but I never end it and then I can I restart it and then around it and I restarted. So that's, what do you usually go out for like a hike with my dog. Nine would like clint or read a book. I don't know I used to do stuff you know, but I."
527.0,Provider,"OK. So let's start with well, one of the things too is getting your nutrition more balanced because that's going to help with. Your mood to stabilize mood symptoms but it's also going to help with your just functioning of your body and and getting more energy and your brain will be functioning better your organs will function better, if you're getting enough nutrition and staying hydrated. So we really need to focus on that."
13365.0,Patient,"Like that's the thing with depression week you know what to do, where you just don't like."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah everything, everything is a challenge it's hard."
13365.0,Patient,"And literally. wish my mom had me in her arm fitting me, you know, like to eat your food."

Oh mm hmm eat your breakfast with me. that's an option. that's an option so so let's talk a little bit about how to get meals in throughout the day so breakfast lunch and dinner and then. A snack. Maybe three times a day. What could you do for breakfast. What some options."
13365.0,Patient,"Like, why not okay i'm telling you and I know like I used to be on a diet, so I used to go to a gym everything, maybe I can restart like that plan, but I had been. Like it's always been there for years, like years and years since I remember like high school thing. you're going to be this is for lunch, this is for breakfast, this is the. lift the snack. you're going to. him and like do your homework and you know, like I used to have a it only lasts like a month two months that's it's barely again and then again we're going to do this, this this this this when we do it, and then one month two months on them again no."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, because diets don't work for SIA we're not doing diets."
13365.0,Patient,"Oh no like I don't mean like my hey it's like just like. My general lives, you know, like."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
13365.0,Patient,"Like I be like getting up early getting my shit together. Whatever. right to do everything that I have to do. i'd be eating like lunch. breakfast lunch dinner. Okay, and like going when I don't go to a gym I would go out with my. friend, but, as I told you like and that's what I told Valerie the same thing with Valerie like we were like yeah like you're going to do this do this and I started eating again I started going to the gym I started going with Luna and spending more time with people you know. again."
527.0,Provider,"know what happened, what got in the way. We don't stop. what's what's been the longest time frame that you've been able to be consistent with taking care of yourself."
13365.0,Patient,Maybe like two months i'm telling you it's always like a month or two months that's.
527.0,Provider,Why do you stop.
13365.0,Patient,You should really just feel sad and like. This is something that I always do like isolate myself like I tend to like delete social media I don't talk to anybody. it's like something is always happening yeah it's the patrol out or not he said the.
527.0,Provider,Your cycle.
13365.0,Patient,yeah the cycle.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Okay. So. We need to stop that cycle earlier. So that it doesn't get all the way around to you not doing anything again. mm hmm.
13365.0,Patient,that's why I haven't even tried. zone like for what just you know that's another month that's it.
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so do you want to change that for yourself, is that something you want to focus on."
13365.0,Patient,Like yes.
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay all right it's gonna be hard work, are you willing to do it."
13365.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,Are you are you worth it for yourself.
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,"So I wonder if, maybe just starting with. Like maybe drawing what your cycle looks like. Like how it starts and then how it, how it slowly declines."
13365.0,Patient,Like literally drying it.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so we can see a picture of what it looks like. or write it out, whatever you want to do if you want, if you want to draw it in in like a circle or a cycle, or, if you want to just make the how how the steps happen like. You know I you know I start out with i'm going to take care of myself, you know I get up early I eat my breakfast I go to the gym. You know I go to work, you know I you know, whatever all the steps are and then and then as as they slowly decline, to the point of ice from I I take i'm taking care of myself too i'm not taking care of myself. Like How does that progress for you. Does that make sense panacea."
13365.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,"Because what we can do is when we see that that pattern, then we can then we can look at what are some things we need to put in place to stop that cycle some coping skills in place to stop that cycle, so that it doesn't keep going down. Okay. So that we can work on just being more consistent. Depression been this week any suicidal thoughts self harm homicidal thoughts behaviors urges."
