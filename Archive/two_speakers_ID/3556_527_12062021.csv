3556.0,Patient,"pretty good with that stuff now I have worked through quite a lot, I still have a lot i'm working through all my own that. At first I had a really, really, really hard time it, it took me years before I even grieved my brother, because I was 14 my brother, was killed, you know. yeah and then my. grandfather died, the next year i'm on ankle got busted I got pregnant and then, when I was 16 and I got married and had my baby, so it was just like life Bam Bam Bam Bam. yeah but what my king, did you know that I have a husband and beating on me and everything, so I didn't really get to grieve or anything. Especially because I had a lot of guilt sage to keep a diary and my brother had gone on to me on time and, just like you know slap my bike and not hard and we're just having sibling rivalry and. i'd wrote in my diary that i'd pushed you dead and two weeks later, he was killed so that was a hard one. And that's why I refuse, never to keep a diary. yeah."

527.0,Provider,"yeah. What do you feel like would be some focus for us gracie because I know you've you know you're working on just internal stuff yourself but is there particular areas you want to. continue working on, or that we need to. focus on for.

527.0,Provider,I was gonna say what what's what are you looking at like.
3556.0,Patient,"yeah because, like you know I can't go into jail my bosses go out to countries so. That would be like going down and that I would be so pissed off at myself, I would not forgive myself."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. and wonder if there's I mean is there other options do you. Think, do you. Besides jail time. I guess your attorney would know."
3556.0,Patient,"um well yeah I don't think they're gonna let me do weekends, or anything like that, but I don't even know if they're letting people into the jail really right now, either, and they might just do a book and release it so. So I don't know if it was. A longer amount of time, then I could go and talk about doing weekends and everything but. They is, you have to pay for that stuff too, at the same time, so it's like why rocket more money build and I already have going on. yeah like I already have. 20 grand. Maybe more. In debt just for fines and all that shit. yeah just been in the last few years of when I got in Iraq that's how it started. And then child support do. i'm just trying to get. just get myself just hanging out financially more stable yeah i'd be so much easier, but that's the hard part right now. Just make an income."
527.0,Provider,"I mean, is there anything else in the Community, I know it's super small gracie like is there any like. I don't know gas stations waitressing you know."
3556.0,Patient,"yeah there is but there's not that much here list out, we only have a few gas stations and nobody tire and right now. yeah i've looked at and."

3556.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Which i've applied for like nine different positions I will work. But if they call me before I bosses. country next month, then I don't know what i'm going to do, because it's really going to be hard to say no to a job that's making that kind of money in this town. You know, compared to they're going to go out of town for a month or whatever and i'll get some money for it, but then what about the hours after that and everything. Right that's my concern."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm wondering, you know if that I guess if that comes up you know, probably sitting down and talking with them and saying hey i've got an opportunity and I really you know can't. can't."
3556.0,Patient,yeah I.
527.0,Provider,"feel I feel like I can't turn it down, but I wanted to be fair to you guys and you know, is there."
3556.0,Patient,A way that.
527.0,Provider,"We could we, and I wonder if there's a way they could still make it work, you know and do both of them, you know, but I don't know."
3556.0,Patient,"Probably not. yeah cuz I mean unless they got something else to come in, like they said."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3556.0,Patient,So I don't know I don't know.
527.0,Provider,"I guess i'm just waiting to but pans out yeah yeah. I wonder how quick, they could get a. Quick walmart would get back with you, or if there's anybody to follow up with. Or can put a good word in for you."
3556.0,Patient,I have tried. I have tried. Calling in. I can never get a hold of him. yeah. yeah because I have i've applied for these before thanksgiving.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3556.0,Patient,"So I keep checking. Because they say go back to the APP and check and all that. So I keep doing that and I keep saying if there's any more openings. Or if I need to re enter my application, because you know after 30 days it expires after you do it. yeah. just sit and wait. My life. crazy."
527.0,Provider,I know I know I wish things could settle down a little bit for you. how's things with your kids.
3556.0,Patient,"My oldest daughter. And I found out she's not just mad about me not go into the weddings. she's also mad about the fact that I had relapsed. When I first got here, I was playing my trailer. boyfriend me and his mom i've gotten close over the years, and she seeing me the other day, and she was like you know I tried explaining. to your sister and everything that like you can't hate your mom not talk to her, because she relapsed like that the part of you know that's just what happens with us. And because she she's an addict to."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3556.0,Patient,"And so, this is one I need to support you, the most everything I go yeah but coordinates already stealing you know she went through a lot grown up with me her dad and my youngest daughter didn't get to see as much. Sure, so. yeah."
527.0,Provider,What would you say to what we say to your daughter.
3556.0,Patient,"yeah she's very since. That I love her do time. Best and it's not like I purposely didn't want to go out and read Apps and stuff like that, like. there's really nothing I can say to make that better."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
3556.0,Patient,well.
527.0,Provider,"Do you feel like she I mean I know she's seen seen a lot of it, but does she does she understand the addiction process and what addiction is and have that."
3556.0,Patient,"A little bit. And because she was looking into becoming a drug counselor. And had did psychology classes and all that over. At the College here in town so she knows a little bit about it, and then you know was me and her dad going through rehab and. stuff like that maybe in telling her and everything explaining to her talking to her being open about everything yeah but no, I mean nobody can really understand it out it unless they've been an addict. know. yeah. So she gets it, but she doesn't."
527.0,Provider,Get sure sure.
3556.0,Patient,Right there's got to be patient with her. I just kicked action or I love her.
527.0,Provider,"which she yeah yeah well and I think you know part of that too is separating out yourself from the addiction to gracie like i'm sure she's probably, which is still hard, I mean it's still coming from your daughter, you know still hearing. You know. That she's upset with relapse but just looking at you know the feeling, she has toward the addiction to like."
3556.0,Patient,Oh yeah and I think that's more of issues more angry. than anything it's not so much at me but yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah it's it's hard not to take that personal when it's someone. Someone that you love and care about yeah.
3556.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,it's just the.
3556.0,Patient,"They expect more of me than they do their dad to because he's still a really bad alcoholic and just those really, really stupid shit and always has. And i've always been there, and you know. took the lead and cleaned up and all that. So I think they expect more from me then. What I did."
527.0,Provider,"Sure well they've seen they've seen some actions from you, at least, and so they know that you can make changes and do things differently."
3556.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3556.0,Patient,don't take time. To get back i'm sure.
527.0,Provider,"I hope yeah I mean I you know I think I think initially when I first met you there you and her were kind of on the outs and then you kind of made some amends, and you know and then your brother's wedding and everything just kind of. triggered things again but."
3556.0,Patient,yeah. Excellent again because she understands. Not just that but stephanie has. lived with me out here at my mom's before in the last few years and Courtney hasn't. So stephanie really knows how it is out here. we're Courtney doesn't realize it.

3556.0,Patient,"yeah I try this time i'm really trying. To just sit in my trailer in my head, because I do that and i'll catch myself and it's like adult because then I do I get really, really depressed I don't want to leave and I don't want to do anything except for sleep or something and.

527.0,Provider,yeah being.
3556.0,Patient,A try to do something once I start catching myself.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I know that takes a lot of effort to do that, because it is just real easy just to like you say throw the blankets over your head and just stay in bed and avoid and not deal with things but. You know it's just going to prolong having to look at things for yourself and. You know, sometimes it is. helpful just to get out and have connections with people or life in the world and. and see okay now now you know, try to get some clarity on what the next steps need to."
3556.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. And I know.
527.0,Provider,And I know not staying close to your mom is helpful to so anytime you can get away from that environment.
3556.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. that's one thing i'm very, very, very grateful for is having a male. Have a trailer but at least I have my own little trailer don't have to be in there in the House 24 seven because if that was the case I would be homeless in a tent. there's no way I would ever live in my mom's house."
527.0,Provider,yeah I don't know. I don't know what you could survive in there and gracie you know he just.
3556.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, no, no, no, I wouldn't be able to get away or anything and she was a major major hoarder also like her house needs to be condemned. And she always complains and stuff she wants people to help her clean her house and all that, but then me and my sister we've tried this multiple times coming in and cleaning and she Alonso. hey. i'm, not even the meat packing her and that she paints and makes into like little ornaments and stuff so she freaks out yeah. But then she freaks out nobody helps her either, but it's like. we've all gave up. thing. So it's like. we're going around in a circle now again. And there is a buy more my brother even had to load up his truck. me. Of the yard. It is not be that way like we should actually be half as normal mom cooked planed and all that drugs people smoked pot and drink, and that was a. You know, we spend family time together we go camping for weeks and. There was a flood for all listen mom was a druggie where people come and go, and all the time Party and all the time, you know.

527.0,Provider,I mean it's a valid question and i'm for sure. gracie yeah.
3556.0,Patient,"I mean you know when people do stupid stuff usually it themselves and sometimes they take it out on other people. And I don't know.

527.0,Provider,"Where do you think you found your strength gracie. To to you know, separate from that, I mean. you're still I mean you still are. You know connected but what's. what's been your strength to be able to like. move away and maybe leave that send those boundaries for yourself, I know they're challenging still.
