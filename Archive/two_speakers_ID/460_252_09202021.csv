So we sent her home, I was just exhausted. I bet falling asleep. And I haven't been taking money NAPs in the daytime just because I know i'm not supposed to. just not good for me, because then I won't sleep that my even more. Right, so I fell asleep, and I was like oh. But there was nothing I can do about it. It was like 1230, I think, and I say. Okay, I think I still need most until oh wait till next week. yeah i'm all the important stuff so."
252.0,Provider,yeah I mean grandbaby man that takes precedence over everything.
460.0,Patient,"yeah and that's what it was you know they were pretty tired today, you know, so I was trying to help them with the kids this morning and then. My other daughter something night because. My sleeping habits can be bad at night, and then, if I fall asleep really hard, I sometimes don't hear anything so just as a second backup, just in case or if I fall. Because I you know both i've had seven surgeries on my knees, so their shots so you know, I have a tendency to fall, sometimes or trip. So my gosh spend the night with my other two grandkids so I have four grandkids here yesterday. Almost all day."
252.0,Provider,Oh that's a little.
460.0,Patient,"yeah we're still a lot, even with my daughter be here because she's kinda mobile easier laksa days decide, I am. Where I want to know where they are what they're doing is they're getting an even though everything is protected in the House there's just going to take that one thing is on the ground. yeah I can't see them in our House. It kinda are living room family room and kitchen kind of like in a circle, with a wall in between it. Oh lot of time, who like to run around and I don't want to run around the House usually but I was trying to turn out so i'm like run. run run. So if I live in the same House which Wednesday morning born in and caitlin, and so I used to be out with the girls all the time before bed, you know about an hour before bed, I would just make them run and then we have quiet time and reading time. And they would sleep really good through the night. Because, if not, they would be up all night. At least one of my daughters would be Caroline was when I was talking about Caroline. She will she has ADHD. And it was bad they the test results they came back with like at the time it gets willing or the psychologists, they say boys boys haven't they haven't pretty bad usually she was like. Worse than most boys on their scales at the school and the school district, and even a psychologist of thing thing or psychiatrists I can't remember anyways. So yeah so I was like and she doesn't she doesn't have it now, but her attention span is really bad. And stuff unless it's on her phone i'm just like Hello Hello. I am to snap my fingers that are."
252.0,Provider,You put the phone down.
460.0,Patient,"yeah and that's what makes it hard, is that you know when i'm when i'm with my grandkids, especially the boys. You know i'm really paying attention to what's going on, because I feel i'm responsible for them. If it wasn't here if something goes wrong and caitlin's here that's a different story i'm here I don't care who's here with me if something happens to one of them i'm going to be devastated. You know. Careful."
252.0,Provider,Understandable definitely.
460.0,Patient,I put a lot of pressure on myself to I think two ago.
252.0,Provider,yeah I think you do too.
460.0,Patient,I can't help it.
252.0,Provider,That would coincide with having to fix everything for everybody else.
460.0,Patient,True.
252.0,Provider,So is she dilating or.
460.0,Patient,"dash she's. she's on Friday, she was added to and then yesterday one doctor says she was a five and. She has strep be. So she doesn't know why she has it or how she got it or whatever, but. She had it with both pregnancies and she thought this one was negative to the cynic me come and go, I guess, but this one came back positive also. So they want to start they want to start the antibiotics, on her because the doctor that that you've got a five, well then. As time was going on, they had her on the antibiotics and she was having contractions contractions of the contractions. And then they started to slow down so after the antibiotics are gone, they said okay you're going to get up to two hours we're going to monitor you and you're going to walk around. though they let her walk around with stuff for about an hour and so when she's moving the contractions are really strong when she's not moving the contraction is kind of slow down. Make Sam yeah and so. She. Another doctor came and checked her and says she was before, but that's just different doctors different hands and everything else and stuff so. I kind of set a really bad she was devastated because she's just she's over being pregnant. is how she kind of puts it into it and 2018 she got pregnant and had a miscarriage she's been pregnant since 2018 basically she's have a few minutes here and there, off. of not being pregnant, but she had the baby or she had a miscarriage and then she got pregnant with Samuel and Samuel and then was off for a few months, and then get pregnant with grayson and then was putting the whole you know 40 weeks and then off a few months, and then. got pregnant again with sonya. she's like i'm done being pregnant and she wants to have to go get six and."
252.0,Provider,Then. One day.
460.0,Patient,He doesn't want to and she's like I don't care i've had all these babies you're doing this.
252.0,Provider,As funny enough.
460.0,Patient,"yeah so you know because it doesn't. It doesn't she's had her all natural. So does it make sense for hurting have. A tooth time and having to go in and have have that done if she goes, if I had C section I just haven't found my tooth and it would be fine. Right I don't want any more children all right, I have two boys and a girl, I am happy."
252.0,Provider,Because you know people.
460.0,Patient,"don't mean to me more. And the weird thing is, is that. True went through fertility issues for a while. And Sri had taken her to see a fertility specialist and they said to her a cat was really low and she had some other stuff that was wrong with her too. And so, he said, you know. run the blood tests that we did, and he says, but from what I can tell you know you're gonna have some issues come to find out, she was probably a few days pregnant when she was there, and he didn't see it. Oh, because it was too early. And so, she didn't have any follicle. are the ones that she had was very little like very few. And so, he told her he says, you know if you want to do this, then we'll put you on the. coumadin again, but a higher strength. Or will show a different one because she had been on to them for like six months, and then they told her you probably want to go see a specialist. and So, of course, she was devastated, just like. Everybody always said she was going to be the best mom out of the whole out of everybody, and she has been. But she she said it was just been so much and then, when we do that, it was so expensive. yeah and then she was getting sick and she couldn't understand why. And so, she realized that she had Mr period. And so, she decided to take the pregnancy test them but i'm not sure."
252.0,Provider,What.
460.0,Patient,"yeah the thing they went in and they cleaned out her tubes and everything which is what helped her get pregnant. yeah they went inside and they did a flushing over to do everything, and so we think that's what really ended up having a really hard. Because it was. Easy yeah yeah so. She Stephen looks at her and she is pregnant now so."
252.0,Provider,SUP that.
460.0,Patient,Exactly.
252.0,Provider,So it's gonna be like any day.
460.0,Patient,"Any day. Even if she doesn't go. If she doesn't go by herself, she will have a baby October 4 go and do Sir."
252.0,Provider,"acceptable for some tells me that. Every October 1 yes oh my God listen 10 days, sometimes me she's going to go before them."
460.0,Patient,"I think, so too she's trying to stay very active as much as she can. Keep it keeping herself very busy. or she's my she's laying down now those who went to target really quick and. Normally, she. You know she walks around she has no issues and she kept hold on the racks. grabbing my son was ham. And everything was just like oh my gosh and so she got to the cash register she goes you guys. deal with this i'm going outside. And so, she went out to the car and she was still having contractions. Oh wow yeah but. They have a test you when you get there too. yeah and. She said it was the worst Cobra test you ever had and they told her then there, whoever do it before it's doing it wrong, and when I had the first time, done my research and I had it done before surgery it felt like they went way up here, I know. Where they went, but that's what it felt like and she said that's exactly what it felt like he was like in my eyeball down my throat in my head. I was just say I felt it everywhere, I was just like she do she left and wonders told her well they didn't do it that way to do it right. So she was hurting from that and her eyes are watering she said, but. She have to do it again if she goes into Labor because you got to get done every time you go in."
252.0,Provider,"Every time you go in. Oh, my gosh."
460.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah, so I am praying she goes full force any day now. yeah because they really they thought she was having a baby tomorrow or yeah yesterday. They thought she was gonna have a baby for sure."
252.0,Provider,Maybe sense of. Maybe I want I don't want to come out yet.
460.0,Patient,"yeah exactly what she said she like she feels like right now she's pulling on her umbilical cord because she keeps like feeling like her belly buttons burning like she's pulling on it, I go she doesn't want to be on there either she doesn't want to be in there either. So no yeah so it's doing good. and I lost five pounds in a week. yay so i'm really excited about that I have. been determined to lose weight and not taking care of like I should have just eating at a certain time, you know, giving protein in the new fiber and just doing stuff and then I need to get in. The sometimes i'll just grab something and just eat it, I mean i'll just eat a bag grapes in forget to eat the rest of the day, so my eight nine o'clock i'm starving. And so i'm snacking at night so i'm like I can't do that."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
460.0,Patient,"I stopped doing that, I think that just help just by itself, so you know when you don't sleep, you know and you're hungry, it makes it hard, if I can fall asleep hungry it'd be easier. But because i'm hungry and not tired, so now i've just decided, even though Mary told me not to ride the bike at my I ride the bike at night, sometimes just to try and tire me out and it's been helping."
252.0,Provider,Good.

You know, and she said she was gonna do something with my medicine, but she never did, and I was on and talk to you about today, but like I said I really wasn't suited for it so."
