10357.0,Patient,Now.
107.0,Provider,"You live alone, or do you okay. Okay, what do you do, what do you find yourself doing with your kind of obsessive thoughts about food and weight and or body image, are you writing things down or you just kind of ruminating on it."
10357.0,Patient,um I started keeping track and. With a food diary I use my fitness Pal to like track colors and stuff and then I record everything in. Recovery record.
107.0,Provider,Is do you share any of that information with your therapist.
10357.0,Patient,I was I haven't been as well come with her about the disorder.
107.0,Provider,"So, why would, what do you think they're responding to in order for you to kind of find yourself here getting another level of care assessment."
10357.0,Patient,She doesn't know that i'm getting another level okay.
107.0,Provider,"So okay you decided to do it on your own. yeah oh Okay, so what brings you here what what is, what is your concern."
10357.0,Patient,"she's helping with ptsd. she's not an eating disorder specialist I thought I didn't get to add this component. Okay, a dietitian everything."
107.0,Provider,"Okay that's fair, how do you feel like that is going in terms of the trauma do you feel like she's helping you."
10357.0,Patient,"um. Yes, and no I think has substantial to that you can disorder kind of gets in the way of a lot of stuff."
107.0,Provider,"yeah like. Things tend to kind of get pushed together, so your anxiety score in March of last year was 21 it's actually down to 19 so that's a little bit of improvement. And then your depression score last year was a 27 and it's down to a 24 so again a little improvement there. So something's helping a little bit each point does actually exponentially kind of make a difference, so hopefully That gives you some sense of relief are you taking any kind of medication to help you, with your mood."
10357.0,Patient,"No, I just do psychotherapy."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so previously, we have that you were taking be sperone 10 milligrams you're not doing that anymore."
10357.0,Patient,Now. let's talk about. summer.
107.0,Provider,"No problem Okay, and so, who would you identify as your support system at this time."
10357.0,Patient,i'm mainly my therapist I have a sister I talked to. regularly but we don't want to talk about my mythology or anything.
107.0,Provider,Okay okay is your sister live locally or do you just talk on the phone.
10357.0,Patient,We just talking about. she'll kind of Allah.
107.0,Provider,"And then, are you working these days or how do you spend your time during the day."
10357.0,Patient,"i'm on disability I don't work. Okay, most days I just. stay in bed all day long. And then. I have like hulu on the background or on playing a video game."
107.0,Provider,How long if you've been on disability.
10357.0,Patient,Think a year and a half ish.
107.0,Provider,"So if you could wave your magic wand, what would you like your life to look like if it if you would like it to look any differently than it is now."
10357.0,Patient,Like to be working and volunteering. and have a social life and. Maybe a romantic partner okay.
107.0,Provider,"What kind of job and volunteer work, would you be doing."
10357.0,Patient,I used to volunteer for a crisis text line.
107.0,Provider,mm hmm wow okay.
10357.0,Patient,And then I worked at 1000 Internet a drug rehab. Okay.
107.0,Provider,"Thank you, oh go ahead."
10357.0,Patient,"Sorry, I was, I was gonna say a year and a half ago that's our work."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, did you enjoy that work or was that tough."
10357.0,Patient,It was tough but I enjoyed it. Okay.
107.0,Provider,"So if you were to go back to work, would you go back into an environment like that, do you think."
10357.0,Patient,i'd like to yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay okay. And then you mentioned. A social life, what kind of things, would you be doing in your social life."
10357.0,Patient,i'd like to have friends like a glove the lift and. travel.
107.0,Provider,Do you like to travel.
10357.0,Patient,"I do, I just haven't in a while."
107.0,Provider,"No, I don't think very many people have had the opportunity, unfortunately, what kind of things were kind of places, do you like to go to or things do you like to do when you go on your trips."
10357.0,Patient,"I used to love to eat and try, like every restaurant and like I love like gunning out like, so I would normally eat at home Oh yes, my favorite. i'm undecided saying."
107.0,Provider,So when did your kind of opinion and or behavior towards food change.
10357.0,Patient,I think it changed when I lost my job at the rehab.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so you ended up losing your position at the rehab not walking away from it."
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, did they have to scale down or did something happen."
10357.0,Patient,I wanted to go to working part time and they silicon support my.
107.0,Provider,"schedule, I see okay that's too bad. Okay. So it sounds like that really antagonize the depression cycle for you."
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,When you use to work and go out and do things to to have friends that you did stuff with.
10357.0,Patient,um yeah usually had one or two close friends.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and where are those people now."
10357.0,Patient,they're back in about a half lives in California. For a couple years.
107.0,Provider,yeah okay so after you move from Nevada were you able to make any friends in California.
10357.0,Patient,not really live with my boyfriend and I just know his friends.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and are you still with your boyfriend doesn't sound like it. No so when did you guys break up. Okay. So, since then it's been kind of a struggle to connect to people. Okay, and when you volunteered and done other projects. What kinds of were you ever able to make some connections and meet people that way."
10357.0,Patient,"Of course is tax on has their own social media social networking site for volunteers and I used to chat with people online, but I didn't really get close to anyone."
107.0,Provider,"So your cat doesn't bother me it's totally up to you, if you want to keep. Normally I have eventually animals to trying to get into my business so it's it's par for the course. let's see so. How what what could kind of help, what do you imagine kind of allowing you to build back your social circle, what kind of things, do you think you could get connected to to help you build that up."
10357.0,Patient,"i'm not really sure I joined like a dating site just to make friends. and travel people, but I just talking to connect with people."
107.0,Provider,"yeah, especially when it's kind of remote like that it's and so many have been remote for so long, it feels weird to do things in person, sometimes."
10357.0,Patient,yeah academy people locally have someone who looks like who thousand miles away but homeschooling ballistic.
107.0,Provider,"So are there some other ways, you can connect and maybe not on dating sites, but some other ways meetup groups or something like that."
10357.0,Patient,"Now i'm in a supposed to start a support group for ADHD and a couple of weeks. Okay it's going to be through them, though."
107.0,Provider,Is that something your current therapist got you can come to.
10357.0,Patient,My primary care provider to.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good great well some connections better than no connection. So, given that you're. kind of stuck in this situation, a little bit and you kind of. have had a hard time getting out of your behaviors and out of your. routine that doesn't seem to be really kind of helping you, it would make sense to me for you to do something. kind of radically different in order to help you get better nourished and really help take better care of you. So i'm wondering if you would be open to something like a residential care now, understandably, you have your cat do you have any other animals that you're taking care of."
10357.0,Patient,Now I have my cat and i'm starting classes next week.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, what kind of classes are you starting."
10357.0,Patient,"i'm taking a few college courses. Okay, can you call it."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, are you doing that just for fun, are you looking to complete a degree or."
10357.0,Patient,i'm looking to them completed my degree was taken a few basic ones. let's give her a lot my day.
107.0,Provider,Okay So what about the idea of. Maybe even participating in a partial program where you go somewhere just for like half a day.
10357.0,Patient,i'd be open to it if there was something in my area I was looking more into my virtual outpatient virtual up.
107.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And certainly virtual ips are an option we actually have one but i'm concerned about you know kind of where you're at, so I think it would be a good idea for us to get your most recent medical visit just to understand kind of where you're at in terms of labs and your and your. Your weight different things if it makes medical sense for you to do and I O p. But i'm also wondering, given how isolated you've been and how much. how hard it is for you to develop a social structure, if you would be at all open to doing anything in person, where you could do meet other people and kind of work on your social skills and challenge you getting out of the House a little bit."
10357.0,Patient,yeah i'd be open to it if it were me for me to spend my cut somewhere.
107.0,Provider,"Well, if it's yeah if it's something that maybe like to your point if it's local do you know if there's anything local to I mean this would be something you don't know where you know there's nothing local."
10357.0,Patient,I know there's nothing local. Erica will close this. major cities five hours away.
107.0,Provider,"yep yeah. well. Okay, so if you had to if you were willing to go to a program for a little while Could you imagine having somebody take care of your CAP for a little while unfortunately most programs don't allow animals pets."
10357.0,Patient,"No i've done a. Evaluation with reasons being the sort of Center. Okay, and. They mentioned trying a Facebook group. For volunteers who will take pets, as it comes down to that that'd be like a last resort."
107.0,Provider,Okay. So what would need to happen in order for you to view that as necessary.
10357.0,Patient,"I feel we're medically necessary like, if I were really underway second."
107.0,Provider,So you would need to hear that sounds like from your doctor.
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and when you most recently had your conversation with your doctor, what is your doctor say at that time."
10357.0,Patient,she's spoken my labs are fine.
107.0,Provider,And in terms of your weight.
10357.0,Patient,She said I was underway in saying that concerned about it.
107.0,Provider,She didn't identify it as critically underweight. or strongly concerning underway.
10357.0,Patient,Right now.
107.0,Provider,So my concern with you doing a virtual program is that without having a lot of additional support it's going to be on you to challenge yourself to stick to a meal plan and eat. More and not use all the different laxatives diuretics the over the counter stuff you're gonna have to throw it all away.
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,Do you see yourself being able to do that.
10357.0,Patient,"And I see myself being willing to try, if I can't and I would probably prefer the Program."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. well. So that could be an option, my concern then would be. How would you then see that as an indication that you need to be in person, somewhere, because it's too big, of a challenge for you to do it on your own. And i'm not trying to be critical, this is a very difficult. behavior change and or emotional change this week, these behaviors and this activity has served a very strong and important purpose for you, for a really long time so to change it, as is going to be scary and overwhelming. And that's why it's nice to have more physical support because it is a very big deal to make these changes and to try and do it all on your own is really hard."
10357.0,Patient,And yourself.
107.0,Provider,"So it's, not to say that you aren't capable, but at some point, people do get to a place where we just we get so kind of stuck in our thought process and stuck in our behaviors that we just can't, even though we want to we just can't change."
10357.0,Patient,And that's where I am right now.
107.0,Provider,"mm hmm so that's why I would be concerned with you trying to do an outpatient program because you know you're already stuck and can't change. So I mean whether it was us or another program and we are meeting with you and talking to you. If you are just kind of like yeah yeah i'm not really going to follow through with anything you just said then it's a lot of time and energy that you're putting that you're not really. interested in doing anything, whereas maybe you really do need to do something in person, where they help you with the structure and they literally walk you through it."
10357.0,Patient,yeah I just don't see the difference like I go to a residential program for a few weeks and I come back home and be by myself and it would start over again.
107.0,Provider,"Well you're right, it could, if you were literally just biding your time at the residential program until you could get home and go back to behaviors. you're right that that can happen, and it certainly does happen so in order for you to do any kind of treatment, you have to be really willing to change. Which is extremely scary because, even if you are physically in really bad shape and mentally in really bad shape again this behavior and these actions have served a very strong and important purpose in your life and it's hard to over rule that. So you can kind of go through some motions, but you have to be willing to see that if you don't make these changes, it will kill you."
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And when you're not really physically physically feeling super terrible and your labs are still Okay, I think your cats just decided and stay in your lap. Then it's really hard to understand why it's important. The challenge becomes the worst you get physically, the longer it takes to recover. and mentally when your body is under such an assault for such a period of time, your ability to process things is not the same as it used to be. So things make sense to you and you kind of worked out the logic. That is not really logically sound anymore, but it makes sense to you, so no one else can argue it. So i'm not here to be the bearer of bad news and being you know sad I recognize this is tough. it's not an easy decision to make to decide that you really I mean the fact that you scheduled this follow up and that you're here is a big deal there's a part of you that wants to try and consider this."
10357.0,Patient,"Some. Of the hardest part is. Going into residential treatment like. i'm 30 years old, I don't want to sleep on a little twin bed with. Other mentally ill patients and little house."
107.0,Provider,"yeah you know what you're getting into. I don't blame you. At the same time. If that's the environment that allows you to really have a different experience, then the goal in those in any of those environments is. To give your body, a chance to get nourished enough where you can actually see and appreciate on a physical and emotional level why it's so important to change. yeah so I, I agree with you, rarely is that the you know, is it the. opportunity that you get to live anywhere, Nice and those kinds of dynamics, I mean you know they're clean and they'll take good care of you, but they're not fancy by any stretch the imagination and."
10357.0,Patient,"You have don't want my freedom taken away like i'd like being able to come and go, as I please. yeah yeah. i'm."
107.0,Provider,ready I. Totally get it my concern with your current schedule and your current freedom is that you're not making good choices.
10357.0,Patient,"No, no."
107.0,Provider,"So yes, you should be able to have your freedom and be able to do what you want to your point you're 30 years old, you should be capable of being able to do whatever you want come and go, and everyone absolutely I agree with you on that principle. The problem is, is that you created a pattern of behavior. Based on a lot of deeper stuff that is very unhealthy. And it's escalated since you talk to us about a year ago. Now you're purging every night. And you're taking this over the counter stuff that's antagonizing your body and you're taking it in pretty extreme fashion. And so, not only have you escalated since March of last year, but you've actually escalated even just in the last week with that. So keep up this behavior for very long and you are going to need to be hospitalized like not just residential now now we're looking at a hospitalization with the feeding tube and if you try and take the two about those strap your hands down to the gurney. Which is terrible. But when you're in such physical poor shape you're not able to make good decisions at that point. So i'm not trying to be extremists and create this crazy picture, but I want you to have a sense of what potentially could happen."
10357.0,Patient,You know I don't think i'm doing what my therapist suspect this I haven't told my therapist about. Okay what's going on. yeah it's.
107.0,Provider,"Probably cares about you and worries about what's going to happen so she wants to. paint maybe a similar picture, so that you can understand this is scary. The biggest challenge with this work is that it's your decision, and I love free will and i'm all about making good choices, making choices were responsible good than. But they're your choices which is great, but it's also very hard to watch people we care about make bad choices. And they're only bad because they're hurting you not because you're a bad person. So now you've consistently made choices that are hurting your body and hurting your mind and hurting your ability to heal and that's only going to create care and concern for you. In the few people that you've allowed yourself to be in your life at this point. And if you keep isolating yourself from them. Your cat can't dial 911. I mean some cats may be super smart, but even then, and if, at that point that's happening, how far bad, you know how far gone, are we. I like your life goals, I think what you're trying to do go back to work, have after school volunteer have a life partner do all these things and think that's all fantastic. But none of that's possible if you're not physically or emotionally able to. participate. So you're kind of in a crummy spot right now. So my recommendation is going to be residential but I hear that you don't really like that idea, so I respect that you don't like that idea but i'm concerned that, if you do anything other than that. you're not really going to have enough of the shift to be able to really experience change to do something different, and have a different kind of life. And if I were close by and take care of your cat for you. But I am not the only person on the planet who takes care of animals and and loves animals, and you know, there are some really amazing people out there who can provide those kind of services and they'll take very good care of your cat. But if I were you i'd be very concerned about that, and I would use that as a great reason for why can't go anywhere. But you can is lovely and i'm sure your cat will be fine in the right hands. And they exist. And it would be temporary. In order for you to get well so that you can live a long and happy life. doing all the things you talked about."
10357.0,Patient,and
107.0,Provider,"So I don't know if you're up for this, but I would like to suggest you create maybe a vision Board of things that you would like to do so if they've talked about things that inspire you. Would you be interested in doing something like that. Okay, and the reason why I would like, for you to do that is because, ultimately, this is your decision. And I would like, for you to be inspired by the ideas and things that you want to do in life, and maybe that will help you. reconcile my recommendations and or your therapist concerned and or your doctors concerns so that you can make decisions that will work towards you attaining those visions. they're not unrealistic they're great ideas they're great goals but you're not in a healthy space to be able to do that, right now. and school is going to be really hard, because your brains probably not operating at full capacity."
10357.0,Patient,"And we already know, like last semester I dropped from four plus two one and I barely made it to that one."
107.0,Provider,You know. And that's not because you're a bad person or there's something wrong with you it's because things are at a point now where you need to take care of this before you can go and do other things. thoughts questions concerns anything else you think I need to know about or be aware of.
10357.0,Patient,um no it's been much. Now just replace my cup.
107.0,Provider,"I think if you could do that and find somewhere where you feel like your cat would be okay and be safe, then I think everything else will be much more manageable. You know what do you think."
10357.0,Patient,yeah that's the main.
107.0,Provider,How old is your cat.
10357.0,Patient,she's for.

107.0,Provider,Oh she's assigned me she just has long hair or longer hair than i'm used to say.
10357.0,Patient,Just fluffy yeah.
107.0,Provider,"I hope she's super cute I have a seal point Siamese that. His tail is pro needed so it's got a little curl at the end of it we got him at the shelter and it also unfortunately for him, had a break so he's got a little tail and then it pivots left and then it has a little curl so he can only wag it. And when he looks at you, he is straight up cross side is your cat never have a cross eyed moment."
10357.0,Patient,She is.
107.0,Provider,"Double our. Your cat was like she has a lovely reading I think my cat is a little bit. Not so much, but that's Okay, we love them anyway."
10357.0,Patient,And he also has extremely long whiskers like foo Manchu whiskers is your account. yeah there's a pretty long.
107.0,Provider,"Oh yeah okay oh yeah. Well, your cats very lovely and four so she's got a nice long life ahead of her so if she had to stay with some lovely people for a little while it wouldn't be the worst thing, and it would be nice to have a healthy mom back."
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,I don't blame me for being nervous about that.
10357.0,Patient,Thank you.
107.0,Provider,Any other questions concerns thoughts for me.
10357.0,Patient,"No, thank you. Well, this goes to the county right."
107.0,Provider,"yeah so it's going to go to wherever your last one went to typically it goes to beacon or partnership or some sort of a health healthcare, dynamic and then they will advocate to the county for you to get proper care. Okay."
10357.0,Patient,But it's ultimately for the county what they're willing to pay for.
107.0,Provider,"I believe so, but the the contract that I understand we have is that that it goes to an advocacy group that really pushes the county to make you know, try and really help you get into the level of care that we're encouraging."
10357.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,Okay.
10357.0,Patient,"If i'm not able to do like if I can't find anyone to take care of her and. What an. outpatient be okay, because the backhoe."
107.0,Provider,I i'm going to place it as a backup but i'm just apprehensive about you not having enough support to make that successful. And again it's not because there's anything wrong with you it's just that it would require more support and you don't unfortunately don't have a lot of support around you to really help you kind of be accountable.
10357.0,Patient,So.
107.0,Provider,"You would have to work really hard to do that, but in an outpatient program you could continue to see your therapist and maybe we just have to be really accountable with your therapist."
10357.0,Patient,I do i've texted her. Okay i'm like I text her when i'm having her just event and she lets them know like Andy vicki you do like a like code train. Good stuff so.
107.0,Provider,yeah it's not impossible it's just a lot to ask of you.
10357.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So i'd rather you not put that a lot energy there i'd rather really focus on trying to make residential work and then you know, let. Because then after that it would. to your point you stepped down to an outpatient program so you're not done when you're done with residentially so have the opportunity to do more work in an outpatient Program. That point of residential is to get you in a enough physically and emotionally better space. To so that you can then continue the work, and not just go home and go back to old behaviors."
10357.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,Okay. Any other questions or concerns for me.
10357.0,Patient,Thank you.
107.0,Provider,Okay well was very nice to meet you I wish you the best it was lovely to meet your cat yeah I hope you can find a space for your cat so you can get well.
10357.0,Patient,"Alright, thanks."
107.0,Provider,Kenny take care.
10357.0,Patient,bye bye.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so this was a level of care update so lowest level of care, assessment and she signed it April 23 2021, and so we will title this and update from that level of care assessment, I don't believe you can take some of the certainly to populate the assessment, the DSM. Mental status exam psychic impression mental functioning shoot meds are updated she's not taking any meds right now, you can do the psych. symptoms family symptoms psych history, except the update to get seven mph to nine get seven is when I say 19 and the pH D minus 24 ace will still be an island. medical history. kind of make note of what she said, with their blood pressure, I would like to request the most recent medical visit as a part of this, so I should send that email right now. I am going to recommend residential care for her with the understanding that somebody helped her find a good place to have somebody take care of her cat while she's in care that's going to be critical to her following through on this. and see. So I updated the eating disorder behaviors, so I think you'll have that will need to get high it'll still be five, eight and a half and we'll need to get her most current weight. From the primary care highest weight is 156. And I definitely would like to highlight kind of her goals for life, because I think that's also going to be important to identify why she needs a higher level of care, because all the things that she wants to do she's not going to be able to do in her current state. And please make note of the fact that she supposed to start an add group and an ADHD group and that she wants to start school up again in a week and stop mentally in a good space do that. she's deny any recent reviews, so I think you can use the same drug use from before. Okay, I think we've got everything, thank you very much."
