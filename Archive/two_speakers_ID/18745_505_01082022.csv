But I have to fill and i'm like."
505.0,Provider,"All right, let's just get you feeling better Okay, can you just sit down for a minute. Just we just were asked all right."
18745.0,Patient,that's something that I tried to do more on to I don't do that.
505.0,Provider,"Sit down know you got three kids of course here so i've got a bunch of questions for you here Ashley and i've got to get the medical intake part I reviewed your and just be honest, there was nothing. I could say that would. make me not like it Q, or you know not care for you. Nothing nothing Okay, I am here to help. And today is the day. You start getting better. Yes, okay so let's go I reviewed your pharmacy record and I see tramadol right. Yes, so tramadol three times a day is what's prescribed like 90 correct. Yes, how long would 90 tramadol last year."
18745.0,Patient,between three and four days.
505.0,Provider,"And then, after that would you just get it on the street."
18745.0,Patient,"yeah. i'm not. As not every day I caught it, but when I could. When I when I can I thought i'm saying good because i'm going to get help but. But if not I also take something else."
505.0,Provider,yeah That was my question to him $1 is not very strong.
18745.0,Patient,know why I love to take so many.
505.0,Provider,"Okay, exactly and. there's plenty of other things that will get the job done faster and better. heroin friend no percocet I see like what do you use. When you can't hide tramadol."
18745.0,Patient,"gabba penton I used to do by getting. rid of that. um I would take up to five or six or more day if I had them, you know just because of money wise i'm sure if I would add more but um if I didn't have it, I got so sick I couldn't even get out of bed, I even had. Babies at the time, you know, like newborn, not even a year old you know even at newborn. you're not gonna lie, I was taking like it in. When I was pregnant. So a lot, though. I only take a half a pill out of time, but I did take it i'm not gonna lie."
505.0,Provider,"yeah but ash now the ear. The tramadol piece is a little odd most people don't bother with tramadol what is pain, what do you use North coast to us right getting do use. percocet like."
18745.0,Patient,"All that, but when I can get it it's just mostly tramadol and got a patent is once I take let's put it that way okay. i'm sparks and when I can when I can't find other things."

505.0,Provider,"Sure, so that's."
18745.0,Patient,"Fine, and by."
505.0,Provider,"Okay that's my question tramadol is a very, very weak opioid. Do you find suboxone is helpful to you."
18745.0,Patient,"Yes, I think more towards for the Gavin penton part, though. Okay um. Because I take a lot of those and I told you, I said after talking to you last night it's scared me a lot because i've not had a seizure yet, but now i'm really scared about having one. Because. I didn't think what I was taking was too much, I mean I knew it was too much, but not as that much like I I knew I was taking way too much Dr. If I don't have i'm so sick like i'm having had chills that night.

505.0,Provider,"Bad okay got you how much tramadol a day, are you taking."
18745.0,Patient,"um when I have it up. I think about it for a second, because if I get 90 less than between up to sometimes 30 if I have them 20 to 30 day."
