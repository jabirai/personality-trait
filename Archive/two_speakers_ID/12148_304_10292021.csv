12148.0,Patient,"I don't know I kind of want a chance there at that age so like even last year, I mean we we did our shopping pretty light like. Only a week before even if for that before actual Christmas getting the kids as they left, but they are looking for on what they're at that age where they want to find them so. I don't even know where we put on if we did that all year the kids would end up being home, and then we end up having to buy more presence at the."

They usually do it the weekend after. So last year, she had on one Christmas and Christmas Eve, and then we had on we got them on the 26 and we have them for two weeks so that's how it."

304.0,Provider,"Okay, good she was, at the same time."
12148.0,Patient,"Okay, now I was, I was. I was there for probably count, like the foster care and everything I was probably there for three to four years were actually retain but my. My parents kids started getting older sibling like 40 so they were getting out or they were getting married and moving out and everything they didn't want me to be by myself, so that was why your doctor. yeah."
304.0,Provider,"yeah me that he was like the age difference right like when you were little they were already yeah the House and Oh, my goodness, there was."
12148.0,Patient,I think there was two of them there. Whenever I first got there. But yeah that was it was just. And then it wasn't long after they moved out stuff so.
304.0,Provider,"Well, so you're pretty close to your parents."
12148.0,Patient,yeah somewhat. yeah.
304.0,Provider,yeah is it just kind of tricky now that you're you're on your own or.
12148.0,Patient,"yeah it's just like I don't know if it's just different here like growing up here, but like in the Bible belt pants are super strict and. Even after you turn this on and I just don't want to continue to off. Anything it's just I don't know it's like that, every year, every year, well, I think, where they were out or two they were just really strict growing up, so one of the chance, I moved out."
304.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, I think you told me that, before you moved out pretty much."
12148.0,Patient,As soon as I could.
304.0,Provider,And did they take issue like with you and your fiance like living together.
12148.0,Patient,"They don't like the fact that Kevin has kids and that's like that's a big ordeal that's kind of put away even bigger in between our relationship, I guess what I just don't accept it, but they weren't."
304.0,Provider,"which I mean like so you know what I mean and if. You think they would kind of understand, especially since they were foster parents. And it's like you're like a bonus mom you're just like another mom to them that they get like. Another mom you know, like you would."
12148.0,Patient,Think.
304.0,Provider,"it'd be sort of just because they were involved in like a foster care and adoptive parents that they will. see that, like you're doing the same thing you know."
12148.0,Patient,"I guess it's just where i'm still young, I guess, but even like ashley's she's only a year ahead of me, but she has together of our own. it's just like they think like at Christmas and stuff up on Christmas presents and stuff but. They don't go out of their way, I guess, to get to know one month later, their grandkids like how see the difference if that might say."
304.0,Provider,that's hard yeah yeah that's hard on you and cody and. Do you think you guys have plans for your wedding coming up.
12148.0,Patient,"We don't know not really we. Really talked about it, I don't. know if. Like. I still in the custody situation and everything gets a lot like we just have a lot going on to worry about."
304.0,Provider,"yeah it's kind of on the back burner and. yeah yeah well I hope this year, maybe, maybe your parents will just make it like a big holiday for everybody and just include everybody."
12148.0,Patient,it's always a big holiday. moment you're crazy about Christmas that's how she does it on a completely separate dates so everyone can get they're like eight o'clock in the morning and nobody believes until 12 it's insane.
304.0,Provider,"And then I mean with yes, especially if, like your siblings they have their spouses and their kids."
12148.0,Patient,"yeah that's allowed. yeah there's there's seven of us, and then there's 13 grandkids and everyone's in the same House."
304.0,Provider,"that's a lot, especially the chaos and finance."
12148.0,Patient,I don't know.
304.0,Provider,"I always I don't know I always envisioned myself like having more kids and I always thought that would be like really fun. To have just like a really big family, but when I get together with my parents and siblings and their kids and spouses i'm like I can't handle this. Ways i'm like I just want to go home and like cope with last year, like we did thanksgiving just the four of us Christmas we told our families like you could come see our back porch like. We do that just. So i'm excited this year it's going to be big but I don't know it sounds fun, but then it's probably nice to go home and have the quiet. yeah."

Last year at Christmas, I didn't go to thanksgiving because, for I was working on the toby unit touched on our business, I always remember Bobby. yeah but for thanksgiving last year we didn't go up there, but we can't go for Christmas Christmas is just it's a big ordeal for my wall."
