But when I called them and they told me that they didn't have the refills on like I was like freaking out, so I was already supposed to been you know, or you took my second dose and then I take my hat for grossly. But they told me I didn't have no refill self freaking out so because you know i've been through this before where it took hours to get through pharmacy rx but surprisingly everything's changed so."
165.0,Provider,Well that's it yeah.
2734.0,Patient,"They had no refills or anything for me and I was like Okay, but you know I knew that I didn't have a. group, well, I mean, I still checked in even though you know I completely forgot to that was Labor day but I checked into my surveys and everything and then uh but uh. So I, and then I started calling emanates only I didn't have any rituals or anything on files like What do you mean I was like I should definitely. So after talking to him, I mean I got a home care navigator and then I realized what happened is I seen Isaiah on Thursday. And he did me, you know my my to refills which should have got me through Monday, which you know would have would have been right, but since you know I don't think he realized that we had the Labor you know. right since, on Thursday, he was probably thinking, because you know I had missed my Monday group so when I seen him Thursday he probably thought I was on Thursday groups, so he heard me to prescription refill for till next Thursday, you know to refills and. So I think you forgot all Mondays."
165.0,Provider,So when is the last time that you picked it up from the pharmacy was that about four days ago.
2734.0,Patient,It was Monday.

165.0,Provider,"Okay um so the only thing that I would say is that it looks like we kind of have your. Like the expectations for you are kind of wonky in your chart meaning they're just not they're not set yet so you're kind of getting a little bit of leeway, but it looks like so it looks like your drug screen is really up to date, they don't have. And all that I saw that all of your service came in on the Sixth, I just want to make sure that you attend your individual therapy sessions, because those are important, and those are going to keep you from."
2734.0,Patient,"Setting everything so here's. Is a So when I joined, I was with natalie and cheryl OK, so now it was when doctrine sure my counsel let's euro she heard her. How you want to call her appointments or three months out and i'm supposed to have to you know to a month. So when I play this out. You know, when I when I set my appointments I set them up, and that was back in see June, July August seat, so it was back in so it's back in May, because you know. I had to go through June, no, no individual and July and then August was when I actually finally got the cedar okay so three months, but then you know, so I no longer have her in my group, because I have, I see, and I have a what's your name. Katrina I want to take. it's I don't think it's extremely busy because. it's a new one. Okay, who is it new a counselor the counselor because Katrina was kinsey kenzie. I think it's kenzie i'm pretty sure is like candy or some."

2734.0,Patient,"So I see cassie and Isaiah on Mondays you know and here so i've been seeing Isaiah and cassie the whole time because you know natalie she she no longer to Dr and then Sarah I didn't have my my meetings were all the way till three months out. So i'm used to Isaiah and gassy so I was asking cassie I was like you know I don't understand you know I got. Because I definitely want to you know, because those want to launder you everything every every little thing I can get from bright heart is important to me because it helps me. So I asked if she could look into maybe get. You know, since she's my new she's the person I see every day I want her to be my counselor. You know. What I understand them all, because anyway, you know I should wait three months to be able to get appointments so she said yes, she was gonna look into it. So when I finally did seen sure, and I was telling shareholder I wanted cassie she said no, she said, you have me I don't think I don't even see you on a daily basis, I see what all. You know, when she has been three months, she seen me and she said I look completely different I was like yes been three months since you've seen me. So in I told her i'm going to cast the you know Kathy said that she was looking into it, you and I even asked. To have cassie cassie because that way I can make my appointments that i'm familiar with somebody's face because that's the thing you know you want to be with with somebody who you're familiar with you know face to face on the."
165.0,Provider,data. You have a rapport.
2734.0,Patient,"And yeah because I really didn't have no report cheryl I know. Because my. First of all, was on the 21st one I actually have my phone on my actually my second my second time I had a one on one was on the 24th of August 24. So you know I asked her if I could switch over and she was like no word work through all that you know. But my thing was you know I don't even see you, so I don't even you know I don't even really I want somebody who hears me on a bi weekly basis you know, on my groups someone who knows what i'm going. Through and what i'm talking about, but she actually like I couldn't switch over so it kind of upset me it's Okay, though, you know I don't fit. But uh, and so I got my placement setup but see here, my dear my placements are set up. As soon as I got done talking to our seven appointments and i'm still not seeing her this month on that senior till next month because that's the only opening she's got. You know, two so some this month I ain't got no one on ones again so you know I would really like to switch to cast the cast he wants wants me. Definitely said that you know she definitely would like you know some because I want that one on one, you know that somebody who's been seeing me weekly so yeah that's The only problem i'm having is. The the group now that i'm with is in been live for three four months now, has been casting Isaiah in here I haven't even seen sure."
165.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Oh it's Okay, so I mean, as far as that goes um as far as that goes, the. I would just say to go to the care navigation team, or even the compliance team and get an appointment set up with cassie or even if you do email with cassie ever do you have like her, email address I don't know how that works."
2734.0,Patient,"She was on leave this this went when I went to this new group, she was on leave, so I didn't get a chance to talk to her, because I was going to tell her what cheryl said I could switch because I I, I know that I can you know if. I know that you know personally i'm going to do better with somebody who sees me on the record, so I don't understand."
165.0,Provider,How she can.
2734.0,Patient,Good so. He can see.
165.0,Provider,"Okay, I just I had seen a no show appointment on there from the individual therapy."
2734.0,Patient,"um yeah my dog came up so we tested positive coven. And she doesn't live here, but you know, but she had been here so at that time, the whole family had to go get tested and we had a you know a lot of. Positive testings I was negative thing God, but you know, so I had a I had. All these running around seeing doctors taking notes think, because then then i'll same time my daughter just got in school. And you know they want to know why she wasn't a schoolboy united to show them, you know prove that she so that's what happened there is a it wasn't I wanted to miss I even told everybody, you know I almost. Because you know, I was like super stressed out, you know my daughter just no one had coven before and then all sudden she tested positive and then everybody else started testing positive and. me not being possible was a good thing, but I have a lot of running around and taking care of to do because she had just you know enrolled in the school. But now she couldn't even go to her appointments you know because she had coven I had to go take in paperwork in and do this new that, and so it was frustrating and plus you know. She she didn't stay in hospital, that was the other thing the doctor advisors to stay, but she refused, you know, and she you know so she has that right so and. So I had to take care of so i'm. able to make that appointment and I had you know when I when I went in I told him exactly what happened and they said it was fine it, you know that they would set up my next two appointments and that's what we did. But that was the only reason I had missed it was just a coven had hit, and it was just you know it, you hear about all time you think it's not gonna happen to you and didn't happen to you so."
