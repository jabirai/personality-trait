I was taken, I felt as though I was taken because I just looked around I was on instagram, and so I I looked around and I started seeing signals are the signs or hashtags or something and it all said happy birthday and because of that. Something told me, I had to dig deeper, and so I looked at the terms of service and I answered the questions and they were all. There they were all asking the same thing they were saying yes, no yes, yes, no yes, why. Tell me. And I didn't want to say anything so. I got off and but I didn't get off I kept looking and that led me to a guy named Irving Santiago Irving Santiago is someone who I knew before in middle school. We went to palms homes middle school and culver city. And Irving thiago was someone in middle school, he was kind he he he seemed kind he was around he. He was smart. that's why he was at that school. And that's why I was at that school because I also was labeled gifted in elementary school. And at that school they taught us the tas normal things, how to write how how we're supposed to i'm. Okay, to learn about the, this is the first time, by the way, the first time she was called yeah put on hold on hold on hold at Miller okay I don't know where it was. that's the first time I was put on hold. For what up yeah so I went to this man's house Irving. And he wanted to take something from me, you wanted to get pictures of me. And I thought I was there to make art so that's why I went because. I wanted to make art. And I kind of arm myself. To be there, I decided okay i'm not going to shave one leg. But i'll wear this skirt around my waist and. And only that one will show. And my tongue. I don't want to clean it. Because i'm not trying to look pretty for this man I didn't want to look pretty for that man. I just wanted to make art and so.

And online and got the information for free."
298.0,Provider,"Danielle can I interrupt you. yeah Okay, so your insurance would like you to meet with a providers such as myself, after you have a hospitalization. And just to make sure that I can answer any questions you might have, as I am, and then get you a check to make sure you have a plan for your mental health after leaving there, so my question to you. As do you have a psychiatrist you have a."
15044.0,Patient,"Now I don't currently have one role I think it's key Gardner yeah. The other case ID but I don't have that much info on it, and neither does Daniel you know I have i've been talking to psychiatrists when the tops of thumb there was a woman there with them who. talked to me and asked if I was okay ask if I was doing fine if i've been taking care of myself if if i've been eating. laxey if i've been. Taking box or you know just taking care of myself and I answered, yes, because that's what I was yeah."
298.0,Provider,"So that's a little different than what i'm talking about you need someone who can make regular appointments with you. yeah do you, like me to give you a referral I don't think that you would be a good candidate for our Internet company, because you have some really serious mental health things that need to be. monitored very well. My question to you is, can I give you referrals within your. insurance. You quit all."
15044.0,Patient,"Yes, oh."
298.0,Provider,"OK, I can do that for you are you feeling suicidal right now. Okay, and. When was the last time you had any suicidal thoughts."

In order to do something that I would drown I would drown. that's how I felt but that's not what anything is about a song what I meant to say that's that's just how I felt. I needed. Try and I needed to keep crying and keep trying and keep crying over and over and over."
298.0,Provider,Okay. um. What is your living situation right now.
15044.0,Patient,"Currently i'm living with my partner.

I also. Because i've experienced that my entire life her illness i've. been under that. Veil. I have, I would have to with under her her braid her braiding. Every. Every time after something traumatic happens to me, I would just want to go home relax be alone with my thoughts or my are or shows or my partner. But she wanted me to feel like she felt she wanted to. make me feel alone, she wanted. She wanted to keep asking me questions and questions and questions and questions until I couldn't think about anything else, except for doing more, something bad or. Something dirty that that my skin is that because it's like. I must be white. Because I have light skin and I have green eyes and she has darker skin and. Because my family's Mexican American. And she always wanted to wear blue contacts, because she saw I mean, I would like to think she saw something in other people, she saw the influence people but that's not what she saw she saw ugliness in herself. I believe, and I also know, and she was beautiful in the past i've seen pictures of her I like her, brown eyes. And, but. But. I also know that she wasn't she heard people she hurt her a lot of people, she hurt my sister. my sister Nicole. She would hit her, she would attack her, she hurt a lot of people, she would. Get. She would get kittens she would put them in the back of the trunk she would throw them outside on the freeway. And I wanted to care for everything I wanted to care for my mother, I wanted to care for everyone, I wanted people to feel good.

And since then she hasn't had her meds and yesterday, Daniel called me saying, she was at le le see usc the hospital and by us he's hospital um. They picked her up from there, and then I found out that her mom had called the COPs on her again so she holding her in her house. yeah my house that miles of the furniture I think she goes all while you press the button, but no I I went out, I went to big lots and I said Okay, when she asked me this me which which tables should she get with for her house which which bed would be nice which. Questions like that no questions, I guess, and so I picked those items I brought them into my home I also went to work I started work at walmart and. I I earned a living for myself and then that was stolen from me recently when I finally started being honest when I told everyone exactly how I felt and. At that point, explain how you lost the money, she stole my money, we had a joint savings account. I made that savings.
