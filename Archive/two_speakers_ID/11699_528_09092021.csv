528.0,Provider,hi Anastasia.
11699.0,Patient,It this week.
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11699.0,Patient,that's taking a little bit of time to adjust.
528.0,Provider,"Okay. Oh, I didn't realize, you were getting that."
11699.0,Patient,yeah I got it to sing. well.
528.0,Provider,And how do you find it helpful.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I can. handle it like everything is just so loud. Oh okay. So I had to like turn it down and like take breaks and stuff so. The Nice. thing for the hearing, I guess, because sometimes. I felt well at least I felt in the last day or so that seems to. trigger the vertigo a little bit."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11699.0,Patient,I really feel like it has to do with the vibration. And the sound. yeah I don't know I don't really know how to explain it all that well.
528.0,Provider,yeah so maybe the because it's louder or something or there's more vibrations in there.
11699.0,Patient,i'm praying it's a little louder. I don't know it's weird because I will feel the vertigo more like when i'm like yelling from upstairs downstairs like at my kids there's something and i'll feel that kind of like you know. Mary around sensation in my head a little. bit yeah I mean i'm usually always. I almost every day have that feeling.
528.0,Provider,"Does that affect you like, does it affect your day I mean, I know, sometimes you can't get out, but like."
11699.0,Patient,"Oh yeah the bad times that really affects me, but the day to day times like. I can yeah it can affect my day because. I, for instance, yesterday I think I got like seven hours of sleep. sleep at like 530 ish. Something like that and repost the session and I suddenly come around there. and I think that my body kind of needed it and awake so I haven't been sleeping all that well. You know i've been getting like four or five hours of sleep. yeah something like that, so you know I think I just needed it and then. But today, so today but. interesting. Okay, like all that sleep, but I woke up with this slight headache. But I was still pretty much okay. As the day went by. it's like that the like, I felt like Okay, but then it seemed like the vertigo kept kind of. Coming up on and off. and Sometimes it makes me feel kind of nauseous. hmm and then I think sometimes it gives me like a slight headache. And then. I don't know, I think it also makes me tired, too, because even sleeping like all that time, like, I feel like exhausted. Emotionally exhausting conversations my mom this morning, so that could be it too."
528.0,Provider,yeah wow.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah so that that could be it too, so I tried to take like a little bit of that, but I can. And it wasn't because I was tired is just slipped my mind shut shut down enough. Which is kind of even more frustrating, because that was like that, yesterday I even try to take a nap yesterday um you know just to maybe get some energy going after. But it seemed like. I don't know if you been in that place where you're like you, you feel like you could be maybe asleep but you're like awake."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11699.0,Patient,"Like it didn't feel like I slept at all like. I know, like. I had some moments where like I don't wanna I don't want say like I passed out, but maybe I was asleep, but like but those that didn't feel like I was like on and off coming back from sleep I don't know if that makes any sense at all."
528.0,Provider,"Like yeah like sleep, maybe like that you."
11699.0,Patient,"know I didn't. I didn't even feel like that, because i've you know i've been in and out asleep before. It was almost like if I kept coming back from like passing out like I didn't know what happened. It was weird yeah I don't know it just didn't feel like I slept it also straightening yesterday, too, so. yeah."
528.0,Provider,wow well I can't believe you slept 17 hours that's like. Oh she's thinking about I mean that's almost that's almost the whole day.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I woke up at a little, last night I put my phone on a charger and I turn my music on because I can't sleep without anything it bothers me, it could have to deal with my air, but I just I think i've always been that way even my ears fine. Because I slept with music on as a team, because I needed to. So I don't think it's just that your thing I think it's more than that, but. Anyway, so. I will come and all that, like to and I went to the I use the restroom and then I went right back to sleep, there was no staying up."
528.0,Provider,wow.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah right back to sleep and I woke up at like 630 which was fine because I have to get up with my daughter anyway so yeah that was like around like. Yes, i'm teen."
528.0,Provider,wow.
11699.0,Patient,yeah. So I didn't I didn't. I didn't get to eat dinner.
528.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I was gonna ask you, but. yeah y'all seems like. That was Okay, so that was yesterday."
11699.0,Patient,I did see the.
528.0,Provider,"One day event right. Okay, so you had a snack at three and then no dinner, and then you had the. Like the donut holes at 630 this that was this morning. yeah Okay, and then, did you sense."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I should have had it in there, but maybe I didn't save it, but I had. A big bagel with cream cheese and some. Some cereal forget what what the cereal is. it's like it's like checks mix but it's not. it's a thinner one. I always forget the name. yeah if. I have that Sarah I. Hope they're out the name and i'll finish out but yeah I think that's probably why I didn't finish blog is because I forgot the name and I don't know, maybe I got distracted and I think go back and look so."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so did you eat the cereal and the bagel like that was one together like."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah so that was like that I considered that my breakfast so that yeah That was all together, I did that. They still should have it open on my own. Like five minutes ago with that doesn't happen. It was almost right when I got home says, probably about 830 or nine."
528.0,Provider,"OK, and then, did you eat anything after that."
11699.0,Patient,"No, I haven't done anything."
528.0,Provider,"Okay. So how is you, besides like yesterday cuz how how is your eating Ben have you been."
11699.0,Patient,"it's been up and down, I think. And I think it has to do more with my body image because that's kind of where my brain has been focus more recently. So that's been a little bit of a struggle and I did end up having. Like I guess giving into a urge. I know that's the right word for that, but I did I did. bingeing per purge. I think it was Tuesday evening. yeah I tried to use my tools and figure out why. And I think I kind of knew why but. I can let in it wasn't enough to make me not a what."
528.0,Provider,"What did you come up with, as far as why."
11699.0,Patient,"Again, just focusing too much on. My outward and when I look like and just fill in like and. I feel like i've gained weight like i've been like uncomfortable in my body, but I think that also has to do with the fact that i've been bloated since i've got the endoscopy."
528.0,Provider,So okay.
11699.0,Patient,"And I haven't had like much relief from that sense, so I think that maybe that was another trigger. So i'm just kind of waiting for my body to calm down again. I don't know. Good and then to my my daughter's birthday is coming up my daughter 16 sweet 16. I know there will be like pictures and. Then the other stuff that comes up with that. And again, I try not to. feed into that too much, so the body in this class and. talk with. holiness helped. my mind, a little bit back to where then."
528.0,Provider,"So um yeah what What did you i'm just curious what was helpful like. From the group or, you know as far as body image was there anything that you took away from that."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah like. You know just feeling like you know i'm not just the body and. You know that's not what is going to. really be what people talk about you know, like, if I were to die or something like that that's not going to be it, I mean that's kind of what people focus on while you're alive. Not not of your God, so you know remember me by that stuff so, and you know, like. I don't know. it's kind of funny because I actually did get into. I guess you can say an argument with my mom today. And I love my mom and she tries to be as supportive, as she can be. But in so in her mind, though she feels like I haven't been doing anything to like really take care of myself. Like she doesn't think from her perspective that the treatment is doing anything or helping me. Because in her in her mind like. I think like I would have like makeup on every day and curling my hair and things like that that's what she says and stuff. Okay, so I mean I at least I stood up for myself and I didn't kind of given her that. You know, I was talking to her. Okay, even though, like in my mind, I was kind of doubting myself. But I didn't let her see that."
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11699.0,Patient,"So I just said, I was like you know. I feel like I have been taking care of myself it's not like i'm not like showering or not washing my hair or you know brushing my teeth and finally eating properly. So. That, I think my mom pushes a lot of like the insecurity, she has on me as well. You know cuz like she's like all those are the things that you know you should do, for your husband and stuff like that getting them on. And you know do your hair and I was like why. Like. You know, just like this, he doesn't really care something like that. You know why. Why should I I mean I told her, I was like because she thinks that I think that it's wrong she kept telling me that, over and over again, and I was like mom you're not listening to me. which I have a problem with that, as well, she doesn't she doesn't listen to me like I could say something and then I would have to tell her again. And then I have to tell her again because she would say that I was saying that and I was like mom told you like three times now that I didn't say that it was wrong I just said that. I didn't want to do it like go get my toes done or something like that. And I told her, I was like I you know, maybe that's something I might get into later, but I don't want it to be something that I think about now because that makes me think that I have to do that. Right she she told me that she thought that that was like. Something that I like to do before something that I thought was fun and I was like it wasn't fun and I didn't like to do it. I thought I had to do it."
528.0,Provider,You pretty yeah.
11699.0,Patient,I thought I had to wear makeup every day and not be seeing without makeup because somehow I wasn't asked pretty with it on or without it on. So I think it's hard for her to sit with the fact that she didn't really know me as a person. She knew what I she knew what I showed. So it's it's very hard for her to sit with that. And I told her sorry. yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,yeah and. You know so like you used to do that kind of thing like you used to kind of do things that maybe please her it sounds like are things that she.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah like my perception of like what I thought guys would like. You know, like. Because that's what I learned from her that that was important. mm hmm that you know if I didn't have makeup on or I wasn't dressed nice all the time or. You know my hair didn't look Nice or something like that that somehow I was left."
528.0,Provider,Right.
11699.0,Patient,"Somehow you know they wouldn't like me as much anymore, and they would do whatever they were going to do, because of that. yeah sheet or something or lever whatever. So."
528.0,Provider,It sounds like you now you have a different way to like you don't do those things anymore.
11699.0,Patient,"No, I don't I mean part of me still has that because it's been so ingrained in me since I was little."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11699.0,Patient,"Like part of me still thinks that and they still have insecurities with that, but I stopped. I think, for the most part, I stopped being hard on myself when i'm not like constantly wearing makeup person."
528.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know as you're talking about this i'm kind of wondering how maybe your body image might relate to this, you know kind of like idea of being beautiful or you know, like this way of. You know, showing the world that you're looking a certain way, you know, like i'm kind of thinking about that."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I know for sure that it's affecting. My body and ninja. yeah because. Again I think my mom pushed a lot of her insecurities off on me, but she also learned it from her mom."
528.0,Provider,Right.
11699.0,Patient,"And she recognized that now, and she understands that now she's like I wasn't as harsh with you as my mom was with me, but I do recognize that that's kind of what I did. And it's so ingrained in her, she didn't see anything wrong with it. For the most part. Like keep trying to ask girls like well why you're not really giving me a good reason you know why I have to get my toes done or you know why have to like curl my hair put makeup on. she's like well that's part of taking care of yourself, and that was like why. I was like if i'm eating better, and you know if i'm cleaning myself up and. Getting changed, and you know. Fixing my hair, the way it is supposed to be naturally like. And for the most part, I don't like curling my hair anymore and straightening it because I, like my curls and. You know I don't want to damage my hair anymore. So. And I kind of told her that too."
528.0,Provider,"So. So yeah how how, how do you think like that relates to again like when you when you talk about like i'm struggling with your body image like I wonder. Like how you see that being related."
11699.0,Patient,"um I definitely want to see it really did I. Because I grew up with the fact that if. You know it didn't look like I was you know, taking care of myself like putting makeup on and. Being thin and doing my hair a certain way and. I didn't dress a certain way that somehow. My guy you went down."
528.0,Provider,"So so you're like. So that's how she's seeing that or like that's. I mean, do you feel like your value went down like it sounds like I guess because i'm hearing on one hand. Like you're okay with not doing the makeup and the hair and the nails and all that kind of stuff that you were taught to do like at this point in your life you're just kind of like. Over that it sounds like and now, but I guess you're still kind of holding on to maybe."
11699.0,Patient,"or something like that and yeah. i've been radio yeah it's. Because I thought, a lot about about this. I know she. played a part. You know, with that with her own insecurities but I know my dad also played a part in that, and the fact that him being away and him constantly cheating on my mom like almost reaffirmed that idea. um does that make sense."
528.0,Provider,yeah so like. It made you try like want to try harder to like do those things that doesn't happen to you.
11699.0,Patient,"So, but then that's another part of like perfectionism."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11699.0,Patient,But I think it was more along the lines of idea of like other people's perceptions and. Trying to live up to their. perfection or whatever it is. yeah their ideas and not being not feeling like it's not it was never it was never enough.
528.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. um. So I mean, since it sounds like this, you know sort of your body image got triggered this week and you haven't really talked much about much about that since we've been meeting. And so I don't know if it's like just got high end or if you were if it's just something we haven't spoken about like is that our usual is that a typical trigger for you."
11699.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah. yeah i'm not sure why. I didn't bring it up that maybe that's another part that I was trying to keep.
528.0,Provider,To myself okay.
11699.0,Patient,"But I was generally trying. Not to like I didn't I don't want to hide this stuff anymore, because I know that if I do i'll never really recovered from it. And I know like i'm supposed to put that and the recovery record, but I felt like I have an easier time telling you in person, then. Putting it in there. So that makes sense."
528.0,Provider,yeah does.
11699.0,Patient,"I mean, maybe eventually i'll get better at it, but. yeah."
528.0,Provider,"I mean, I think, as long i'm okay with that, as long as you can be honest and like forthcoming about you know. Sharing that you know if or you know, maybe you just want to put like. I don't know just the whole acknowledgement of it all the whole thing just feel scary to write or I wonder if you were to just."
11699.0,Patient,it's like a.
528.0,Provider,year or something like that.
11699.0,Patient,"I like it cuz I could write it down and like you know my diaries or you know how I write things down to take a log of things I. usually do that. And you know, like I said tell you about it. But I think, maybe it's hard still for me to talk about it or do anything about it, like especially. just happen or. yeah I think just, especially if it just happened. Like I can try to analyze it in my head for the most part, but like. I think sometimes writing it down and. You know just all that stuff."
528.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean I think it's. um. I don't know, I guess, I wonder, like do you think it would be helpful to write what you're even if you don't share it with me, for example, or anybody like just. Writing down what was in your head around like I I like the idea of you like reflecting and like thinking about what caused this, how was I feeling, you know. I feel like that could be a valuable. practice to do is just to help you to get more information or help you to understand yourself more."
11699.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"But I don't know if, like just having it in your head just kind of is is is as helpful, or maybe it could you could do that, but then also right it kind of write some of this stuff down."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I think I wrote it down the following day, like in the morning at some. I didn't write it down like right after that I did on morning. yeah and it did, and the little bit of time thinking about it, but I think it was pretty much could have been an overwhelming thing, but I think it's more than that, I think it's been more than to just the whole body image thing. Because you know i've been you know bloated for like the past week, and I just didn't feel right and. I wasn't getting a whole lot of sleep. So I didn't have a whole lot of energy, the next day. And then there is, you know things that I want to accomplish throughout the day and I feel like I can't do it because you know I don't have the energy to do it. And I think that bothers me too, and that means like i'm not moving around as much, and that means that i'll present any time that they eat them probably gaining weight. Okay, I think that's my thought process."
528.0,Provider,So you're kind of tying. Like not moving with i'm going to gain weight.
11699.0,Patient,"Right yeah we should probably be very hard to break out of. is like any movement now it or actually even before has always been tied with me either gaining weight or losing weight. I don't think about it as much like when it's other things like housework and and you know walking around the store something like that, but it does still pop into my head like oh good I was walking around for such and such time. And so, that means either a marketing game later i'm going to kind of see this thing. That I found."
528.0,Provider,"That to be true, like in other. Do you lay yourself, or something you know to kind of."
11699.0,Patient,"Adult adult but it's just the experience that I had i've had throughout the years. Okay, with weighing myself and like counting calories and and certain amount of activity, like a trap like you know, especially like with tracking my steps, or something like that I know like you know if I get. 10,000 steps, and you know that's you're probably. In the spectrum of losing weight and gaining weight or keeping it or maintain it. versus like, if I have it, you know, like the last week or so i've been more tired, so I haven't been moving around as much so i'm like Okay, so I know like you know because i'm eating regularly still that i'm probably gaining weight versus maintaining and losing weight. So that's that's where that thought process comes in, and obviously. I haven't weighed myself I do get tempted there for. I think last week. or so yeah I think it was last week I did get tempted to. to weigh myself, but I didn't."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
11699.0,Patient,i'm glad I do.
528.0,Provider,Yes.
11699.0,Patient,Thank you.
528.0,Provider,well.
11699.0,Patient,The probably would not have been a thing.
528.0,Provider,yeah no absolutely um so I mean you were feeling like you said retired and. Were you feeling overwhelmed like this past week or I thought I heard you mentioned that or that was maybe today.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah like emotionally right now I mean it could be a lot of things because. You know, getting the sharing aiden. is like I said is nice. But it also can be very stimulating for the brain. Because that you know even said, like you know even before, and right now with the hearing aid my brain is trying to retrain itself to know that you know it is hearing more now. versus before they was trying to do all kinds of things, it was trying to make up for the sound I was appearing on this slide it was trying to take the words that I was hearing from this side and interpret them."
528.0,Provider,I.
11699.0,Patient,"You know because I can understand that correctly, on this side and my girls telling you two different things at the same time, so. yeah so it's a it's a lot for my brain, a process which, again I didn't I didn't really think about before, but I mean a obviously makes sense, so some of it, I think, comes from that some of it, I think, also comes from you know regular day to day life and stress and you know my. job situation has kind of been up in the air. And then you know and also me wondering, you know when is a good time to go back and be able to handle and deal with that type of stress. And, especially if. I don't have the program to help me. And then, on top of that. My husband's kind of like transitioning from where he was at before too so for for him he's a personal trainer but he basically she. works for himself and he almost is almost like it's I guess it's kind of considered like contract worked inside of a private studio. That somebody else owns and. And so, he was with. The person that owns like the facility, and you know where he took his clients like that he used with him for a while, you know. Either helping him train other clients and just you know he's been there for a while, but now he is he was looking for more something just mainly just on his own. And right now he's it's kind of the same but different, because he has more freedom, where he's at like he'll be paying rent and things and he's able to use the address for his business and. which were he couldn't really do that over there, and he kind of had to like fly under the radar for like you know, he was a lot of habits business there, but he was gonna watch like almost promote it, there does that make sense. So. He can do that, where he's at now and he's also closer to home now but he's also farther for the clients so he's losing a few around it so far it's only been to so that's Nice. So anyways he's just an asshole translate transition, and you know, been kind of busy thinking about that, and you know, obviously i'm thinking about that. Also, trying not to worry about money things like you know bills and all that other stuff. And then also trying to give like grace where that goes to because he has been so busy with that you know everything going on with me see it's kind of like I want to say, like i'm on the back burner because it's really not doing that, but it's you know it's also he's been very."
528.0,Provider,preoccupied.
11699.0,Patient,Right yeah so.
528.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11699.0,Patient,I don't know yeah.
528.0,Provider,"or just you know I think it's is because i'm something that you may want to notice is when you're kind of. Having more negative feelings and maybe you've already noticed those like um, and I say you as a like General like i've seen this happen, where like. it's easy to blame your body, you know or to have like more body image. Stress you know when like things in your life feel out of control kind of um. yeah it's easy to just like want to focus on the body right um yeah because it's more of a like thing you might you know might be able to control or you know, like. Right or blame the body so. yeah I don't know if that was the case here, you know but."
11699.0,Patient,yeah could be.
528.0,Provider,"could be something to just kind of notice or like you know the opposite might be true, as far as like when you're feeling happier, and like all kinds of things are going well in life, how like you might not have as many body image. concerns."
11699.0,Patient,"I can't say for sure for sure, yet, because just because, like some other stuff has been. An issue for a while, because that may have been dreaming of work and stuff. But yeah it's a possibility."
528.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean, I do think it's good idea to keep paying attention like."
11699.0,Patient,What.
528.0,Provider,"server what we feeling and I don't know I mean my talk about this in the body image group i'm like with I don't know who runs that isn't Andrea or our Catherine. yeah yeah. um but. yeah I mean I was looking at like your shoes, and I mean it looks like you actually. That day cuz you said it was Tuesday night. i'm Like you, I mean. Always breakfast later I don't know the wrong time you put it at like 8:30pm i'm assuming that you wrote breakfast so maybe that should have been earlier."
11699.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Unless the time there was my kids when they didn't have school, so I know I woke up later, but I know I didn't wake up that late so yeah. It was probably am instead of pm."
528.0,Provider,"yeah I figured that was probably just a error but, like, I mean it looks like you know well, you had you had the cream of wheat and then for lunch, you had a like a pot roast with a fruit bar and then you had like a snack, you have the chicken pot pie."
11699.0,Patient,mm hmm.
528.0,Provider,And then you have well I don't know I think your timing is off when did you.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I think I. I think I mixed this. That could have been yesterday I don't know, one of the days I am mixed up the snacks snack and the one for the snack and a dinner one of those two. Okay um I just put instead of just changing them I just kind of let them the same side you know."
528.0,Provider,"yeah it looks like it was Tuesday, because well, you have the chicken pop by for afternoon snack and then you put for evening snack yeah that must have been it because I don't think you have donut hole in her right that's what a dinner for and then. yeah he's not your meatloaf corn green beans."
11699.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"And then, when did you use your behaviors was it like later on or."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah it was like I knew. I was. kind of in that space already, but for the most part, I was like no i'm okay so i'm good and then, as I was getting closer to bedtime I still had those thoughts, but I was like no i'm not gonna do anything because usually by that point i'm already planning it. Okay um but I did go down shares which kind of already knew that it was going to be a mistake, but for the most part, I was like no i'm still Okay, so you know so when. and I think that what triggered it the most was that I was eating. A small package, like those animal cookies bills crusted 181 pack, but I wanted more. And so I was like Okay, well, I can have I can have two. And then, then I don't think that will trigger anything. But yeah I did so after that I think I ate. Three of them and and then I then after that I was like I was already like giving up, I was like Okay, well then i'm just going to eat whatever. So. I think I had like a little bit of the text mix. mix which I don't even think he ate that much of it, and then I had. The name, like a bagel. And I think I just like. drink. lemonade was eating all that. Oh, and then I have like I think like two bags of like those small snack chips. And I think that's it. But then I. I purged almost right after. Maybe. I don't know, I think, at the same time, I was trying to kind of let myself that with it, but then I can so. yeah."
528.0,Provider,"Well, I mean well so. Any point did you like Do you remember, did you check in with your body like do like even just to get the first. thing that you eat that a little crackers like were you hungry, do you think or like was it kind of where this was the plan to like binge like I have nothing to do with being hungry."
11699.0,Patient,"Like I don't think I was hungry hungry. I think that cuz I mean again, I mean I ate I ate dinner didn't feel like I was hungry, but it's been hard to tell the difference. Because of the. bloating but I constantly feel like I don't I don't really feel hungry."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11699.0,Patient,"I feel, for the most part, satisfied. or even full sometimes."
528.0,Provider,When you're done eating.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah. Your dinner. For like yeah for like a long time. And I could also to, I think, have to do with a mouse moving around as much. i'm so i'm staying for maybe a little bit longer but. I think the times, where i've actually noticed me being homely is like now, I really see since been a long time since i've eaten. But like before."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11699.0,Patient,I don't know. I don't feel anything.
528.0,Provider,"Well you're yeah I mean, I think. How many times a day, do you think you get hungry, but how you're feeling now I guess."
11699.0,Patient,"I think that's only happened like one are there times, where I went like a pretty long time without eating. For the most part, not intentional, I mean, I can see how it could be partly intentional, because I like i'm still kind of Okay, with it, but like you know I am intentionally trying to make sure I eat at certain times, even if i'm not hungry. You know, like I don't I don't try to go longer than those that two three hour mark that eating something."
528.0,Provider,"which by the way, I want to point out, you are doing a very good job of that I did notice that from your log that you you've been eating. You know. I mean it's not consistent like it's."
11699.0,Patient,"You know, but it's yeah."
528.0,Provider,"I can tell that you you're putting effort into trying to eat more often like three sometimes four hours, but you know around three hours."
11699.0,Patient,yeah yeah and generally try and do that. Today I. wasn't as great obviously i'm. actually meant to eat before I got on but. um. yeah it just I don't really I don't feel usually all that hungry. Unless you know again like i'm over pray for $5.
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11699.0,Patient,So um but I try to eat and when is that yeah. yeah that's usually the time that I what times they really notice.
528.0,Provider,"I mean i'd still like to see you. eat oh cuz even your dinner on Tuesday. You had like half of the meatloaf and two. bites oh no two bites or left, I say um. And then you had I don't know corn and green beans and mashed potatoes Baden say how much, so I don't know."
11699.0,Patient,"Where the the corner navy new beans were mixed together, so it was like one of those big spoons the kind of scope out was like one of those and then same with the mashed potatoes one big one big. Over that from one of those."
528.0,Provider,"um but i'm just kind of wondering because pretty much. The. I tell you, you put it in more that day, or we like I should say you probably needed more that day um so because you know you had. Well, you had the pot pie, you had the frozen like roast with a fruit bar. And the cream of wheat like that was all like that, for those for the whole day um. So while again, while some of it might be, because I feel like you know still your it doesn't sound like your hunger even your fullness cues are. You know, regular at this point i'm. I feel like you know as we and sometimes that and that hunger can just kind of be subdued because because you're not nourishing yourself enough, and you know so like. Even if, like at the moment that even if you felt full at dinner, and like you thought like later that evening you thought oh i'm not really hungry. Or you didn't notice any significant signs of hunger. It doesn't mean that like. yeah exactly exactly so um I mean, I think, maybe just insert in terms of your food plan like. I don't know what do you feel like you could do like you know, to try to."
11699.0,Patient,Maybe maybe a little help if I just start taking pictures of. What i'm eating and explain how much of it as.
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11699.0,Patient,"Maybe that will help because, for me, I felt like I eat enough. Okay, but that's probably again the eating disorder. yeah me but yeah like I felt like I had like a big dinner good sized dinner that I didn't need to eat anymore after that."
528.0,Provider,"So, and I want to say that I would say your dinner actually did sound. Like that was one of those a pretty balanced meal, you had protein, you have like starch, you have vegetables, like, I feel like that was actually. So I feel like the dinner was. You know, acceptable, you know was. Balanced, but I think it's more the earlier it's like earlier in the day that maybe it would be helpful to add more stuff to that um you had a few actually good dinners like it looks like you have some crab. One night. Or did you have crab are you. Strong passion. yeah."
11699.0,Patient,So it was from crab shack up getting the crab part.
528.0,Provider,"I try yeah um. yeah. yeah so like yeah so I feel like that dinner, is a good example of like actually what. What I want to see more of you know, like actually, but I think for that particular day you probably kind of eat. not really enough earlier in the day, the dinner was good, but then it was earlier in the day that I think. You kind of. deficit if that makes sense. So, and I mean it looks like again you're doing really good with the timing, but like if we look at um."
11699.0,Patient,it's probably not enough.
528.0,Provider,"yeah I still think its overall it's probably it's still not enough i'm like. Ah, and. And I think the protein thing is another thing that you know we've talked about before that I still feel like and that might make a difference in terms of your satisfaction, like if you add in some protein. You know that might fill you up and and you know um. So those are two things."
11699.0,Patient,work out.
528.0,Provider,yeah what are your thoughts on that.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I can I can definitely see that. yeah. poking still. battle for me again i'm not sure exactly why. But, again, I think that some of it has to do with that whole perfection thing."
528.0,Provider,"Like i'm just looking at today and yesterday he had the donut holes i'm like just as an example, like could you maybe have a glass of milk with that. You know that would give you protein it gives you some other kind of nutrition um but that you know. That could make it a little bit yeah more balanced. yeah you know. um and you're okay with Mel great."
11699.0,Patient,"um yeah. I mean, I like milk I don't usually drink a whole lot of it. And I don't know if that has to do with maybe me thinking that adds to the flow."
528.0,Provider,um.
11699.0,Patient,"Because I think, for the most part yeah I. don't usually mind, no."
528.0,Provider,So you're not lactose intolerant.
11699.0,Patient,"I don't think so I. have never gotten tested for it but i'm not like. For sure for sure cuz I don't remember that well if it was all the time that I got bloated or if it. may have been a combination of a. combination of certain things that I got floated. yeah maybe that's why I thought that it came from the milk a lot or the cheese a lot. But I don't know I mean cuz yeah I just don't know could have been a combination of certain things even. Because we went and saw a movie at the movie theater and I had nachos and. Usually after that my stomach does not do well, but I don't know if it's just because. It was that probably wasn't the best meal or snack that eight. You know, and my stomach wasn't sells very well with that. I don't know yeah."
528.0,Provider,yeah it was a cheesy man.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah or if it was like yeah i'll cheese, so I don't know I guess that's just another thing that I love to try to keep remembering jack."
528.0,Provider,"When you have the serial to the editors today, did you have milk and the cereal. Like regular cow's milk."
11699.0,Patient,"I didn't drink all of it. But I am I obviously had some more I was eating. yeah um and my stomach feels Okay, but again i'm constantly feeling like i'm bloated so I don't know."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11699.0,Patient,I don't know.
528.0,Provider,"yeah So how can you try to. You know they're. More earlier in the day. And again, I think, part of it is that your days look different you know, sometimes I feel like. Let me look. I mean there are days like on Saturday, you had two rolls a cup of noodles with spaghetti sauce and a hamburger. Our hamburger meat oh sounds like ground."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah it was like yeah it wasn't exactly spaghetti so I was like Okay, I need to like pieces apart so like it is still note eight. yeah it was like those like. squirrely noodles you know that you get in a pack. One small ones, but there's like curl."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
11699.0,Patient,"But, so we have that and then you know it's basically like spaghetti sauce with the. hamburger meat vic then."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
11699.0,Patient,And then you know it all back together like spaghetti but obviously it wasn't the string noodles night.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so like I just saying that as an example, like that was a breakfast. Which is so funny because this is the second I had I had somebody yesterday, who told me that they woke up and craved spaghetti for breakfast to like. This is so funny like."
11699.0,Patient,"Well, I. I didn't consider it up breakfast because I think it was probably like 10."
528.0,Provider,o'clock at 930.
11699.0,Patient,But yeah I didn't really see it as breakfast but yeah I can see where yeah.
528.0,Provider,"um but you had like that's a you know that's a good sized meal. Right yeah that i'm saying that because, like there are some days, where you do eat more for breakfast and then there are other days are in the morning and like earlier and then there's some days that you don't so. I mean, I think it would be helpful just you know helpful to be try to work on consistency to like with all this. Because honestly like and you may know this because you're a mom and you have kids and you know you know have like kids like routine and like like. They know what to expect a lot of kids I feel like better when there's like they kind of know they have a routine well, I think the body is like that, too, like when your body like. When you do things regularly and feed it kind of regularly i'm not saying the same thing, every day, but like maybe starting to eat around the same time, each day and then start to give like start to like have more consistency with what you eat. The body actually responds really well to that, in general, like. Like it's. Very like calming for the body, because it's like when things are chaotic like it doesn't you know kind of just trying to keep up with. The fact that okay i'm only getting this amount of food, but yesterday I got like more food, you know it's it kind of. And like now we're going hours without food, and like you know now like it's been like sometimes it's two hours sometimes it's four hours you know, like it's hard for the body to like work with like such inconsistency that makes sense. um so I feel like that might also be a good thing to like work on, I mean again it doesn't have to be the minute, but like with like, maybe generally within an hour um it also can help you to like in terms of not just your body, but like when. When you kind of know your routine like it can help it's like one part of the LIFE your life that can be like a steady part of your life so um I don't know if that makes sense, like. So um. yeah so what what what's what's the takeaway from today, or what what kind of plan, do you want to have for this week."
11699.0,Patient,um yeah I think i'm gonna start trying to take pictures of what a meeting. or my my help give you a better idea of what i'm actually eating. Okay um. And yeah try to work on consistency and getting that protein and.
528.0,Provider,"yeah okay yeah I mean, especially the meals like breakfast lunch dinner, I would say that's a good place to get some protein in like you know, or at least start so like for breakfast you know, like today, you had the donuts with a bagel and cream cheese and like. The cereal with milk so it's a lot of carbohydrates."
11699.0,Patient,yeah right.
528.0,Provider,"And there's not a lot of protein a little bit of fat, you know but. yeah i'd say that the main nutrient that's missing is like some protein there. yeah so kind of thinking about that too, you know it's just like, how can I incorporate some protein like I said it could be milk could be yogurt could be well cheese, this is all assuming that you're not lactose intolerant."
11699.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"You know, then you know I mean I saw you had like Turkey, you have the like hamburger me, you know you have. um but all counts, you know of course um. But yeah."
11699.0,Patient,"I mean, are you doing good today. um, what do you think I should do about my meal. I shouldn't wait right say turn it."
528.0,Provider,"In it, right now, you hungry now. yeah yeah I would eat. um I mean."
11699.0,Patient,"I can send a picture, though, on I think my mom brought me food if I mentor texts right."
528.0,Provider,Maybe you have I don't know um.
11699.0,Patient,"I can be I can eat the chocolate with you guys, though."
528.0,Provider,"yeah definitely definitely do that um. But the only the only thing is now that i'm thinking is I mean it's this is hard, because I want you to eat when you're hungry, but I also want to be respectful for that group members, because I don't want them to think that you're getting like special you know."
11699.0,Patient,Right yeah.
528.0,Provider,treatment that you're not allowed to you don't have to eat with everybody kind of thing so there's that um so I don't know if you can maybe just bring a portion like maybe some of it and then maybe save it or. I don't know or maybe eat. bring a small snack even if it's just like you bring a piece of fruit or something like that or just something small.
11699.0,Patient,I can.
528.0,Provider,"Like eat your main meal now, but then bring like a snack with you. yeah I think that would be better actually. All right, so um yes and definitely bring the chocolate. But I will see you in a you know short while, and then. we'll meet again at this time next week and good job for being on time for the appointment."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I had a. I had a reminder on my calendar, so there really isn't a free at this time, so."
528.0,Provider,"That worked. yeah all right Okay, well, I will see you soon. Okay, all right."
11699.0,Patient,Okay.
