252.0,Provider,How are you.
3037.0,Patient,i'm pretty good.
252.0,Provider,Everything going.
3037.0,Patient,"everything's going fine you think i'm gonna go for a walk on the beach maybe. found out, I have to go back and so when I get that. Tuesday airy they keep thinking I should be going every week and I told him again and again that it's well i've been going to married for over a year, so this has been going on about that long. And last time I some area I told her that that was happening because told me only Mary can make that change. Even though I tell them that's how it is Mary has to do it, so when I saw her last time I talked to her about it, she said she would but and I haven't heard anything since then until now."
252.0,Provider,About like.
3037.0,Patient,"You know I checked, I see Mary on Tuesday nights when I need medication refills. yeah well that they are thinking i'm supposed to go every Tuesday night. Instead of just when I need medication refills. So. I don't I don't know what I have to do to get it fixed, but I will get on there and try again."
252.0,Provider,"yeah i'm looking and see the thing is, is that. you're seeing you know you're in group with Dr robiola and then you see Mary. And so. You know there's not a section for medical or for rola and then Dr. kastner. yeah so it's one that's why they keep screwing it. So current medical appointment frequency weekly individual twice a week group therapy. So there's nothing in here to it. To show the frequency of seeing Mary."
3037.0,Patient,yeah doesn't say that I have to see Mary.
252.0,Provider,know it just. There yeah.
3037.0,Patient,"they're taking it that way and. So show me a non compliance, because I actually last week, they sent me a text saying the same thing, but I was busy, so I just texted him right back and said no, I don't have to see Mary and kind of ignored it, but now they're they weren't going to let me see you today."
252.0,Provider,Why.
3037.0,Patient,"Because, because I, they said, I have an appointment with Mary tonight and I can't have both on the same day."
252.0,Provider,you're a group with Mary right.
3037.0,Patient,"yeah yes, I and I don't have another group with Mary for probably another two and a half weeks when my medication runs out."
252.0,Provider,i'm trying to see you too. See here.
3037.0,Patient,I guess I could send marissa an email. About that maybe that would be enough.
252.0,Provider,well. that's okay.
3037.0,Patient,"it's just weird it just for a while they don't say anything like that, and then all of a sudden that comes up that i'm missing groups on Tuesdays so."
252.0,Provider,Donna what's your last name.
3037.0,Patient,Jorgensen J O ch I am SDN. And I assume that's not going to come up quickly takes a long time for my for my chart to come back.
252.0,Provider,"You go to mary's group, like once every month or month and a half or."
3037.0,Patient,"It well usually it's one up once a month. couple times, it was longer because they were writing my prescription wrong and. It wasn't until I could get an appointment with Mary and talk to her about it to get it straightened up, but it will, it will be every 30 days i've got one of my medications is has to be refilled every 30 days so. Whatever tuesday's around that."
252.0,Provider,"space to what for. him city. Alright, so. A problem like we just discovered. Because there's one you know for. Your group your medical but night, not your psychiatric so you know of course it's going to look like you're missing it when you're not. yeah because there's not a space if you're seeing two different doctors with."
3037.0,Patient,Different doctors yeah yeah. But yeah I I I get that I didn't have a problem with that I just need to figure out how to how to fix it so.
252.0,Provider,"i'm gonna throw a comment to or email to john campy who is actually the one that does this program and let them know you know that the care intensity, there needs to be another another area for frequency, for your. Right to. know all right."
3037.0,Patient,Other yeah.
252.0,Provider,Company because there's it's just not there. So yeah get about what.
3037.0,Patient,"problem, then, but so. Anyway, everything's pretty good i'm the. Right heart has stepped it up quite a bit and getting into see people party or do your analysis or or for whatever is a lot quicker. i've heard i've heard some of the women still complain about that, but usually it's just a couple of minutes for me so yeah that's much better than two hours."
252.0,Provider,holy cow.
3037.0,Patient,That was the day that I totally lost it was when they when you said at the end of it that I had to go to compliance when we got done and i'm just like no not again.
252.0,Provider,For two hours.
3037.0,Patient,I sat there waiting to get into compliance for two hours. It was like two hours and 10 minutes from when I logged in to when we got done. So long time.
252.0,Provider,Maybe they got enough. negative feedback on that or satisfaction surveys that the bigger the better.
3037.0,Patient,"I think they probably did, because I think everybody in our group was up in arms about it all the times they get called the compliance for silly reasons. And they said they don't have that looks like my lab work isn't back, yet it shows it as open, so I don't know about that either that was a big problem, not not on right hurts part I don't think I think it was the hospital up here but. It took me I went six times to give blood and wasn't able to do it oh six times. Why well for one the hospital here was just overrun with COPD patients, and so they cut back their hours for for walking in laboratory where. They cut it down to like three hours a day, and it was it had been from nine to I think eight been in an eight at night, so they cut that way back so I went one time, I was, I went in at 602 and they were only open until six. On either until it okay well we'll do that, and then we finally got to that part and then there's they can't find the order for the labs so I have to get back in touch with everybody it just it took a long time, it was a lot of work. Come to find out. Brian heart was sending sending the lab orders to the administration fats. And all know our black. Fine, I think they've been doing that all along, but now that they're like busy and overrun it didn't work out so well so anyway, I got it down, I hope I don't have to do it again. What else oh my week has been pretty well it's been really good. Schools started again and so all my granddaughter's are in sports again, so I spent the weekend, trying to be everywhere, I could be and. And that's last one my oldest granddaughter well my oldest two granddaughters do volleyball and the rest are doing soccer right now."
252.0,Provider,wow.
3037.0,Patient,yeah they're playing volleyball because it's indoors they have to have masculine so I need to see it become parents complaining. i'm glad. Right yeah the little ones they let them go with that mouse but they're playing soccer outside so. What are you gonna do.
252.0,Provider,wow.
3037.0,Patient,i'm just glad to see everybody getting back to it because last summer and fall nobody knew my grandkids weren't doing any outside activities not at all and that's hard on kids that really is hard is.
252.0,Provider,It really.
3037.0,Patient,"yeah you know they're just learning to be social now all of a sudden, you have to just shut that off you can't be social anymore and it's hard."
252.0,Provider,it's like what are we supposed to do.
3037.0,Patient,And the parents are really what am I supposed to do.
252.0,Provider,"yeah It really is it's a lot, you know there's a lot of parents that really struggled with. The school aspect of a sudden, you know the kids going to school and you know the parents were going to work and then next thing you know complete opposite."
3037.0,Patient,"You know, complete up to now overnight. yeah."
252.0,Provider,Like and the work that the kids do nowadays.
3037.0,Patient,"I could yeah. I know. That. it's amazing young minds can learn so much that's when they learn the most the easiest instead of you know, teaching them the things that they do in kindergarten first grade, they should be able to step it up some."
252.0,Provider,"yeah, you would think."
3037.0,Patient,"yeah well there's not there's always some kids that can't, and that makes it an issue."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, can you go into your quest and download your results."
3037.0,Patient,"I do not have a question account, I actually don't know anything about it. There was no I don't like it, we had my husband on something like that, where he could get to his medical records anytime you wanted to us it's like quest COM, I can find."
252.0,Provider,"My quest my quest COM. yeah and then you'll just fill out your information, and you know, usually takes a day or two, but all of your results that you've ever had taken at like quest. will show up in your chart. And you can take them out of there and then submit them to bright heart like you had one in July, for at quest for your lithium level. yeah. I didn't know."
3037.0,Patient,"What questions during that I hadn't done at sutter coast, but they have to go some to some lab so yeah. So in when did you say that that."
252.0,Provider,That was back in February or July. So yeah. So if you have.
3037.0,Patient,Some then if it's quested it should be some for the last ones I got then. That would have been. In August sometime.
252.0,Provider,I didn't see is you know a lot of pending waiting result.
3037.0,Patient,"i'll see what happens yeah look at that, though."
252.0,Provider,yeah that's what I that's what I did you know I mean it's just one.
3037.0,Patient,thing yeah I.
252.0,Provider,"mean I asked, I don't have to ask everybody where's."
3037.0,Patient,"You know where's, the results are where's the lab orders or whatever yeah that'd be nice."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, and that's one way to stay on I always go through quest because I know I have access to them when they come."
3037.0,Patient,Once they can.
252.0,Provider,they're right there they put them right in my chart so. Right anytime I want to see him or I won't be able to see the doctor for a month to get the results i'll go in and look at it myself.
3037.0,Patient,"We did something like that with my husband, but it wasn't called quest i'm not sure what it was called but. It was another program, obviously, but it was really important for him to have access to that information as quickly as possible, because things things came up quite often so."
252.0,Provider,"make sense. A lot of places, you know we'll have a client portal that you can go in and check your results when they come back. For yourself."
3037.0,Patient,I know who could tell me where where to go is set or coast. pick up the phone and call them and ask them yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Totally um and it makes it easier for you, because you always have a copy to you know where they're at."
3037.0,Patient,"yeah you know yeah for her I didn't even think of anything like that so yeah. that's very helpful, thank you."

252.0,Provider,"yeah exactly it's your body and if there's some going on with it, and the way the medical system is right now."
3037.0,Patient,yeah yeah I can take six months to figure out there's something wrong with you. You know.
252.0,Provider,"i'm a researcher so i'll go in and look at my test and take. That information if usually they have a little explanation on the side too that's something else I like. Because it'll tell you what that means right, then you take that information and you plop it into Google and then you get all the information about whatever it is, is going on with you."
3037.0,Patient,As you can.
252.0,Provider,And it's.
3037.0,Patient,"It is amazing really what can what can be done now, I mean 10 1015 years ago we lived in a completely different world than we live in now. yeah it happened."

252.0,Provider,can't breathe.
3037.0,Patient,"compassion for them. yeah and they overeat for the same reason, you need drank I did drugs. And I know that that's why I gained weight during that time because wait can be a comfort food."

3037.0,Patient,"But i'm almost ashamed of myself, though I gained 20 pounds my daughter, the last time I saw her. She was just a normal looking girl not real thin not definitely not heavy and she's been spending her off time in the gym and she looks every bit as good as Tina i'm like how long did it take you to do that a. couple months, so it takes me more than a couple months but i'm impressed."
252.0,Provider,what's your workout let me see it.
3037.0,Patient,What do you do in.
252.0,Provider,The gym.
3037.0,Patient,"Online as she goes to the gym I may not want to do her work out exactly I don't want I don't really want big muscles but. But I need to work on my my core and you know we're do that part of it. Which which these weights, but."
252.0,Provider,"Well, anyway."
3037.0,Patient,"i'm doing really good. i'm not feeling I have a little bit of depression or like kind of a lag behind, but I know it's not it's not really life affecting so. i'm just keep working on that. And they're very changed my lithium level or she used lithium to help me out of that depression, I was shocked I mean shocked at what happened when we increase that lithium because. It was a couple of weeks, and I was starting to feel a lot less depressed and then I had a week or two you know feeling pretty good pretty normal and then I noticed that I was getting manic I was I talking too much to myself there's not even anybody in here, you know. Just my brain was going way too fast, so I I quit taking the extra lift and I didn't want to get into that. And i've talked to Mary about it, she knows I did that, but I don't think I want, if I get depressed I think I don't think I want to try to cure it with lithium anymore."
252.0,Provider,I implement some natural things.
3037.0,Patient,"yeah well I do use ideas, the met natural things i've got a vitamin. regime that I think. yeah. And I think it's pretty good."
252.0,Provider,Good and getting.
3037.0,Patient,"A little vitamin plus plus an extra things like 70 commented or told me that be 12 helps with energy and I, so I started kicking that. can't remember what else but a few things and I bought some melatonin for at night because. i've been having a hard time going to sleep. So, and that helps that definitely does."
252.0,Provider,"i'm. Sorry, sun right so."
3037.0,Patient,yeah we don't have any we haven't had any sun this week it's. Really foggy which is kind of nasty because it's cold makes it really cold and damp lane and but the sun's trying to come out here so maybe i'll come out enough for me to go to the beach well it's still sunny.

252.0,Provider,"All right, well, I am going to put a email into john and asked if something can be done about that, when you're seeing two doctors. and see if we can get that situation resolved."
3037.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that's the only situation that happened and. it's funny because they don't say anything about it for a while and then all of a sudden, they pick it up again that i'm not going to Tuesday group so."
