527.0,Provider,"So what do you, what do you feel like you need to do at this point for your for yourself man uh."
11952.0,Patient,"Was I was thinking, maybe like. For like really thinking about where I have to go like away from here, because I was about two three days ago I was um my friend and I, my. My best friend yourself who's part of the religion, she was like oh happy McCoy in a meeting you know cuz she's not 100% spiritual like me like i'm not like i've kind of. strayed away from like the religion, because I know it doesn't really help me and I have so much so many like issues with it. Okay, you know she was asking me and I was like honestly not really and I hadn't ended up like. kind of explained her cuz. I was just telling her like oh stuff about the House and our moms how she is and she was like. You know you couldn't you like religious trauma maybe that's a good thing you have certain by everything. really heard me out but. It was like honestly I think i'm free I don't think you're going to progress or heal in a place that hurt you so much like I don't think you're going to make any progress in the same House. I think i'm like it, she was like you know I wish I could I wish I could get your House, I wish I could do this, but you know she was offering the help like I can help look for places and like apply for like a lot of things, because I could qualify but like it kind of. brought me back so I was like that's like it's not me just thinking oh my mom's a bad person or like maybe i'm not feeling or in the House it's Oh, my goodness nope don't touch that oh. My goodness my catch my phone. Is. But yeah it was like a big. um. i'm sorry they're fighting okay."
527.0,Provider,yeah that's okay.
11952.0,Patient,"yeah, but it was just like a not a wake up call, but it was interesting to hear from somebody that I care about the also are aware."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11952.0,Patient,What. You know of that.
527.0,Provider,She was she was able to maybe see both sides for yourself like. Look at the park oh it's a tail. I thought it was the pocket of and down to the. phone and then I was like oh that's. that's funny. yeah yeah.
11952.0,Patient,"it's hard I don't know like I feel like. I don't know it's just Africa with all these things, and everything so expensive just my own things with like. Like little things that do bothered me from day to day like I feel um I don't know what it is, and I think it could be part of the religion but like. For little things like. hanging out with my friends, specifically, my friend Andrew. I asked my mom and she's just constantly it, she is like no cooperation she's just like who's that oh no just flat out it's like How do you expect me that I don't know I think it's so dumb. She just refused to try and then I don't like asked you know, for us, a brief back, but i'm recently constantly asking her and it just gives. me this like. It like I he goes from zero to 100 with me with asked you shouldn't be just asking a simple question um. But um."
527.0,Provider,So are these are these friends that are part of your religion still are outside of the religion.
11952.0,Patient,"Religion and okay. I can easily as well, I don't even don't even tell my mom going to hang out with yourself, because she was like Okay, she does not care, but for some reason, I have this whole like. It feels like a blog I don't know I feel like I can't ask a good business physically cannot ask her because it gives me too much insight to ask her. Okay, it could just be because i'm embarrassed maybe or I just I don't know like I just don't know, knowing that business, but you need to ask her. But stuff like that, like it bothers me so much I can't do anything or let's say. there's like a random adult like we know just how small, it could be anyone and I tell them all want to hang out with somebody and they're like yeah you should I automatically feel like I have permission to go, like the fear ends up like leaving. Because even though i'm a mom it's I kind of know and I asked her. passion it's what it's fine stuff like that it was anything that was done with everything."
527.0,Provider,"So where where's your Where are you at with your religion, right now, then minot and where's mom out with it."
11952.0,Patient,"i'm. i've kind of made a decision to maybe not do right now I don't want to do it because. I feel like when I have like possibilities might have been gone for months I don't feel like there's a huge stress on me, because if I did this, but my palms are still there, but there's more stress there's more guilt there's more. Okay there's more worrying more things to work on."
527.0,Provider,It so not feeling like you're you're getting the support you need from from your religion okay.
11952.0,Patient,"All right now yeah I just need support told me about the House to stay here and work with your mom do it's like um it's sometimes it's not even me it's her, she doesn't want to cooperate. So I don't want to deal with that, like I don't want it to be enforced on me because it's not normal to them to leave your family."
527.0,Provider,And they go.
11952.0,Patient,into your family or to be or see your mama someone who is not a good person it's like.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11952.0,Patient,In with my mom was she still goes she stopped pressuring me she just kind of realistic me I don't do it. So okay let's be which i'm glad because she's not she used to be very strict about external inciting she just gave up.
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay so she's realizing that you may have to make some decisions for yourself where where you're at with that. Okay, so we're so it's just all one of your friends."
11952.0,Patient,In the religion.
527.0,Provider,"In their religion okay. But she's kind of waffling with it too she's trying to decide, or do you."
11952.0,Patient,"Know actually she's very much. There already. But she was like. Obviously, she respects man she's not gonna she does not force it upon choose like she even visa you know if you were to get help she was like look I don't I understand like how you're feeling and it was not fair. But like if it was me I try and get if not it's it's it happens it oh she's like when I was a teacher she's about 22 notes like when I was a team anyone do anything I to she how she. kind of made it her own like the tucson was um she tried for self not be someone said she liked it she enjoyed it and she stayed on it. But she. She she she's not going to be like Okay, I get it, but also, you should keep trying it's just you should try when you're in a good place to do it and you think you're going to be okay."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so I know we talked the last time and, as far as maybe going to live with a friend that friends family that offered you a room like where are things that with that."
11952.0,Patient,"I fired up a couple times, but I haven't made any solid plans for just codes. I haven't, unfortunately, so it yet. well. I mean the option is there."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so what so in the meantime you're at home So how are we going to make things. work at home, like what do we need to focus on."
11952.0,Patient,I just just.
527.0,Provider,"Trying to you know, trying to take care of yourself."
11952.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just. Because it's really hard to be by myself and do things I want to do in the living room such an open space for the Wigan and does walk in. And the whole situation, two days ago was Monday yeah Monday. And we told them like again we told them and by Monday and they were calling out somewhere, so I had stopped them and be like look it's already been a few days, like you, that we're going to paint tomorrow you guys need to figure out like. They give us some excuse for mom like told them and do it Okay, so they ended up moving. Some stuff yesterday moved a few cans of food and that's it and today i'm assuming they're going to move some stuff. But again they're kind of they're very slow about it, like I don't know if it's just them wine to be mature maybe they just don't want hold but that's been bothering me because it's like we could have had this done very, very long time ago. Sure um but."
527.0,Provider,So did your mom give them a time frame of when they need to have everything done.
11952.0,Patient,"Well we're supposed to be Monday and we told them that they just did nothing so hopefully by this week there, they are 100% of the House, but I mean it doesn't look like and that's what makes it very easy for it easy you just tell them that by this day, need to be moved out."
527.0,Provider,"it's as simple as that, and we can help you we've offered many times."
11952.0,Patient,"ourselves on what's taking so long. yeah so I mean to for taking care of myself, I guess, just trying not to. Answer i'm times, where i'm feeling a bit better able to maintain do not speak to her at all. Okay 100 registered after I don't look for her I just I just do what I need to I go to class and your homework. Go to work, you know um."
527.0,Provider,"Are you are you spending more time at the library, you know, we had talked about that just to have. an outlet for your self."
11952.0,Patient,yeah it's it's been nice I like going there I go to the last one so it's oh it's close by it's the College I go to an adult like the campuses open so.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11952.0,Patient,I also do want to start i'm kind of just. doing the like hobbies and stuff like really. Focusing because. Another like my schedule from work has been kind of like change stuff now I have much more time and a half types of class time for appointments i'm fine i'm good with everything now.
527.0,Provider,so good.
11952.0,Patient,"I don't like to wait on things like I don't want to win on my room until I started doing it, but I really can't do anything I want to hear so i'm just kind of making the plans and, hopefully, no. overthinking it to the point where i've ruined the plans like I don't even want to do them anymore, and I do want to hang out my friends on Friday. Okay, but I mean there's a whole struggle with. My mom and, for some reason, that alone has been bothering me, so much so i'm going to try to. I mean. it's little just hanging out with a friend I don't know what what's so scary about that."
527.0,Provider,"Is is the friend, not in the religion is that the shoe know. That okay."
11952.0,Patient,"It does, I mean every time I want to ask my mom to go hang out with people who are in the religion, she like freak out or like just I don't know she was freaking crazy. I don't know what they just let me be especially cuz I mean team. I don't have to ask, but I mean they can't just leave the House like up."
527.0,Provider,"But what if what if you said um and I guess I went to kind of have a better understanding to as far as with your religion not like, are you limited to only hanging out with people in in your religion or can you hang out with people outside of your religion."
11952.0,Patient,"Well, we can technically hang out but it's not encouraged at all like they're like. i'm like when you go to school, they are just school classmates are not friends there don't make friends. Was don't hang on because don't don't to make the point of best friends, but I mean again I don't know why that's stopping you could not really like in the religion i'm not but it's just that the mentality of it."
527.0,Provider,"Well yeah I was gonna say you've. you've been in it for for so long that you know the values and the belief system is there for you so yeah I mean and I guess the other, the other part of that too, and I, as you are yeah you are 18 so. And not that you have to. Excuse me like you know be be oppositional with moms rules and things like that, but what would it be like for you to say hey i'm going to go hang out Friday, you know with with some friends. At such and such place and i'll be back you know in two hours or you know, whatever like if you gave her like where you're going to be and and a you know, a time that you'll be back I don't know, do you have a curfew or things you know."
11952.0,Patient,Have a curfew by me when it comes to getting elderly people has got to be like. Probably like so.
527.0,Provider,yeah like do you feel like maybe approaching it in that way of you saying hey mom just wanted to let you know i'm going to be gone for a few hours i'm going to be here with some friends and i'll be back home by you know 10 o'clock whatever.
11952.0,Patient,"yeah i'll try to approach it like that, because I mean. it's just like. The what if, like the idea, the idea of asked like. Oh hold on. Trying to. Trying to questioning or be like because the idea of her being like with WHO why I don't know why gives me so much anxiety and I feel like i'm sorry."
527.0,Provider,"So so okay so let's let's go through that scenario then with. let's let's walk through that minute for you so. So just being upfront with mom i'm going to be with you know this person this person this person we're going to go for pizza at. You know, such and such place and hang out for a little bit and talk. And i'll be home by a certain you know, whatever time it is what if you know just going through those specifics like and and taking away that maybe that opportunity for her to to ask those questions that cause more anxiety for yourself what if you just put them out there at the beginning."
11952.0,Patient,"I don't think i've ever done that, before, but it does some little bit user like i'm kind of. Just telling you what I am not essentially asking you i'm just being like this is what's going to happen."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah like I just wanted to let you know mom here's where i'm going to be, and this is who i'm going to be with this is what we're doing. And i'll be home at this. This time, you know that's a respectable time for you and for mom to so that you're you know being. Just being honest with her of what you're doing you know there's no nothing to hide you're not having to lie about things, because that just makes it, you know you know you don't want to lose trust with mom either and not be able to you know do things that you want to do, but. yeah so so what other questions come up when she. Did we cover everything like how to."
11952.0,Patient,I don't really ask her much. But it's usually those two.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's practice it So what do you what would you say to mom. Friday Friday afternoon before you go out. huh i'm i'm mom and you're coming to let me know what you're doing."
11952.0,Patient,"Thank you so um hey so um I was asked to hang out with some friends in ours. But now, when I can ask him so it's going to sell my friends asked me to hang out today later at 2pm we're just going to go to their house probably eat something that come back around by nine just wanna let you know cuz, just in case me me do anything beforehand. Before I leave."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah yeah and if something comes up you know you've got your phone she can call you yeah or if we if we change places if we decide to go somewhere else i'll you know send you a text message or or leave you a message whatever's or however you communicate with mom. what's that feel like to maybe approach it that way for you.
11952.0,Patient,"I think a little bit better I think a lot of things are you still there, but it's not like oh God what am I gonna have to answer cuz i've already told her, she wants no i'm thinking snow."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And and you're being responsible, you know you're letting her know where you're going to be and what you're doing that way, if there is an emergency that comes up she knows how to how to get Ahold of you or where or where you're at so. mm hmm."
11952.0,Patient,yeah i'll try to approach it hopefully yeah i'll try to ask her oh totally.
527.0,Provider,"Do you have many friends that that you've connected with outside of the religion, no."
11952.0,Patient,"um so yeah but not not really right now I just kind of have worn. It but yeah. Now you are vital to talk to them anymore. And I kind of realized like I don't I don't hate them but I mean nothing not people, I want to hang out with unfortunately they're good people and I get what people like them, but. Right now i'm just kind of looking for someone who wants to talk to me, and you know go to college and figure out which one. should have that's it."
527.0,Provider,"yeah So what are some hobbies and interests, you want to get into what have you been thinking about."
11952.0,Patient,"What go to I want to do pay me again I want to do volleyball again. Employee was really nice, I want to create like weird type of art, I guess. I recently got i'm a guitar, but it was from so my just so he's brother he's in about like. Getting kind of big. But past like five years he's been like getting to know bands and stuff and there's a band that I used to really like I used to love them, I want to see them four times I got to meet them twice. And it's a band called fiddler and I was really into them like a couple years ago obviously it's kind of died down but because i'm listening music and about two years. Okay lead singer sat carper had a spider web to guitar like that was like his go to the top everything he he wrote the first album with that guitar he would go to only festivals with that guitar you only play with with that time. And Tito ortiz cells brother they had the same these record in the same place where fiddler was so at times you've run into them. And the. Point where their basis lost their base dream tour, and it was around the mind place to us at the studios. And tika ended up finding it so they got to meet them and, like oh my God, thank you, but also saqqara breath that time didn't want the guitar anymore, because it got all over. And he was telling Chico about antica was like what if I buy it off duty it's okay to count, much like $40 so it gives us 40 they tied in SAS for a couple years now. And just so now we're kind of we wanted to learn guitar just to I mean we never wanted to because of everyone around us, who played it were like oh they're probably really bad at. All we're doing it for them, but. yeah we both want to play it and we were Chico works at guitar Center so we can get it for some obstacles like that slot. And we were looking at guitars and I was like Oh, I want this one, she wants this one, and to came home and was just kinda like letting me look at the guitars and then long story short, I don't know what happened, but they gave it to me. So oh. that's really nice, I want to start playing that or at least like trying to not going to quit because I mean guitar it's really hard and everyone, I know, and I left it within two weeks, I really want to try and play so that's something i'm really excited about. So art embroidery volleyball and guitar."
527.0,Provider,yeah do they have any. activities on campus Mina like any like inner mural sports that you can like join a team or.
11952.0,Patient,"I think I could look at, I have to talk to a coach about it i'm thinking of my join volleyball want to join next semester, because. I played in a long time, I want to practice, you know, during this time, and hopefully get ready to because I don't want to join the team it'd be really messy join a team so. I think i've talked to the coach, though, and I think it's going to be on campus I heard by next semester 75% of classes will be on semester ground, like every campus grab my blogs, will be in person. Okay, so."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah yeah you might check and see if I know its course I when I was in college was years ago now, but but they had intramural sports that. They were they were organized but they weren't like a like a team. Like a university team."
11952.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"You know that, like traveled to other universities and played against the it was just it was just people on campus that that got together and made teams and then and then those teams would play like because my roommate. Did soccer. So they would they would go over to the gym and. And they'd have soccer games and it was men and women that were on teams together so. So yeah that might be something to check into I don't know if there was any I can't remember if there was any cost to that or if it was you know very minimal cost if anything i'm guessing. Because they just they just played in the gym. But, and then they had basketball, you know basketball teams girls and men's basketball teams and so yeah so that means maybe something to check into like intramural sports."
11952.0,Patient,yeah I think that stuff I bought into it for sure.
527.0,Provider,"And yeah yeah and that you know and that might allow you to get connected with other people too, and just you know explore different interests, and you know just get connected with. You know, with other you know potential students that maybe you have similar interests with. And at the same time, if you're doing an activity, you know that's certainly giving you some movement. To help to help with anxiety to help with your depression, you know, to give you some out positive outlets for yourself to to take care of this, you know mental health needs as well."
11952.0,Patient,"yeah that stuff from there, I don't. i'm in an appointment right now. therapy oh. yeah I definitely want to look into like I do need exercise that's something I I know we still have more than one so hope a lot like just going out and walking so. So, look into that because I mean i'm doing something I like and i'm getting exercise i'm usually, when I do something I like when I play volleyball I don't. I don't realize like I can be like sweaty like almost on your breath but i've, not even a word about it because I really like it so."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely yeah. And it's finding those outlets, you know if homeless if home is stressful then you've got some additional outlets to to help yourself, you know distance you know not not avoiding but being able to do some things that are helping you manage your stress level at home to."
11952.0,Patient,Not stuck in the House all day.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well and when you're stuck you know stuck in your House and that's all you have to do is just kind of stay in your head and think about things, and then and then that just kind of spirals out of control, sometimes."
11952.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"The other the other part of that too is the other part, that i'm thinking about to him and is just kind of what what just saw mentioned to you. in regards to just religion and and you know kind of kind of figuring out, you know Is this something I want to be a part of or not a part of and. You know I think it's it's allowing yourself, I know it's probably feels awkward and uncomfortable but maybe allowing yourself to explore that for yourself, you know what are, what are the. benefits, you know what are the things that I gained from this and, when what are the things that that i'm questioning or not, you know not really sure about. And I don't know if there's anybody particular that that you're connected with in the religion that would be able to kind of talk with you, through those struggles. Because i'm sure you're not the only one that's been in this position as far as trying to figure out is this is this what I want to do or be a part of. And I and and, in general, you know I think a lot of people struggle with their religious beliefs and growing up, you know, whatever religion that they've been in and in start. Being able to look at okay i'm not sure if I totally agree with that, or you know kind of question question that, so I think you're not you're not alone in that with with regards to religion issues either."
11952.0,Patient,"Care I don't think there are a bunch of people that felt like that, like that's a good thing, they have to do it, but. there's just like a lot of books and magazines and stuff that that like literature as a print out for people like that you know, obviously it's very normal feeling to everything, this is. Do I don't like how this is working, but and like also there's a lot of people, you could talk to if you're questioning their they do help you."
527.0,Provider,But.
11952.0,Patient,"At the end it's just kind of like this is probably the best past path for you and it's like all for God, and you know. you'll use way just keep on trying take it slow and it's like I don't want to do that I don't want to retry I just I want to get away from it for a bit and maybe when i'm in a better place where it doesn't hurt me or things like that don't pester me, maybe it can reconsider going. into it, because I have a problem once it's just how it was brought up to me."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, so it sounds like you've already kind of made that decision for yourself then okay okay. How is how his mom going to be with that does she do you feel like that's something you in her can work through."
11952.0,Patient,"No, I think I already know her I think she already knows how I feel about it but um there's like two or three ways, you could approach, leaving the religion number one is telling them straight up like the elders I hate. For this, this and that reason I don't want to, but they're gonna have to announce it to everyone and then everyone kind of kind of has to shun you and well that's one thing, but a lot of people that do a lot of the route that people do take is you just kind of slowly fade away."
527.0,Provider,Like.
11952.0,Patient,They don't have gone to meetings you don't do service and only talk to somebody just kind of fade out.
527.0,Provider,"So that's that's the approach you're planning to take. I have, I have been taking a guess."
11952.0,Patient,"yeah just. aim for everyone, I guess i'll deal with a lot of things."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. yeah I mean that certainly is a an approach that would allow you to just process on your own to and not not I mean you're already struggling with just that internal piece of it and to have others, you know, trying to challenge that with you. yeah, I think, certainly, you know the best decision to make with with yourself on that to to take care of yourself emotionally. So how are you feeling about some of these choices and changes that you're making and things that you're you know, putting putting into place that are that are helpful."
11952.0,Patient,"I think if I just. Because approach them and you're just a very peaceful or almost like nonchalant matter I think i'll be able to. kind of glide through if I just kind of leave it at that and just focus on other things, hopefully, be better i'm not confronting i'm not yelling out to anybody i'm not being like. This room to me, and this bothers me visa screen competition i'm just leaving it and just kind of figuring out like trying to appeal myself because of like the stress that had happened."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. And it sounds like you've got some people that support your choices to. That you can reach out to if you need to as well.
