And I still have a lot of trouble sleeping and I was entered this process to get help with you know sleep medication if I needed or other medication that I don't know of that maybe the alcohol was. a substitute for that now, I need you know I don't know. So yeah like I was at a very weird place we had the fires up here, we had to evacuated."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14815.0,Patient,"But I mean so yeah I was. just getting off of alcohol so yeah it was, but since then and i've stopped drinking and everything it's seems to be going okay."

759.0,Provider,"It seems to get easier OK, so the sub goal could be, I want to keep making progress, I want to be clean from our stay sober from alcohol Okay, I want to. Stay sober. A home. come home, and you know, like one of the things you know with relapse prevention, we can talk about relapse prevention, how you prevent yourself from relaxing someone that thing is to maybe stay away from high risk situations, you know, like i'm."
14815.0,Patient,Having.
759.0,Provider,"You don't really have right now. Okay, your home by."
14815.0,Patient,"Go to work and I come home I don't I don't do friends, I don't do social media I. I don't participate with all the weird shit."
759.0,Provider,Excuse my language yeah no you're fine. Oh. I see what leads to the drinking it's a motion or behavior.
14815.0,Patient,"What happened was I started see i'm 36 I only started drinking, maybe, when I was 33. I never drink up to that point and it was just. casual for um you know, the first year, whatever just my wife cow, you know drink then or whatever, and then all of a sudden my boss passed away on me. He was like you know my best friend i've worked for him for 11 years."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14815.0,Patient,He just he passed away and I didn't realize that time that I use the alcohol as a coping mechanism to to numb myself from dealing with you know that situation.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14815.0,Patient,"And then you know because he passed away, I found myself on employed now having to go fend for myself, you know what I mean because i'm a construction worker so. If the boss, the company dies I no longer have a job. But i've moved on from that, I accepted it, and now in the process of getting my own contractor's license to start my own company so. But the alcohol, I think, was just a coping mechanism, a way to. not deal with it, you know not way to not. To just be numb."
759.0,Provider,"yeah just to be non so it's kind of a coping yeah sometimes you know we use like the wrong coping mechanisms for ourselves to ones that. Being you know detrimental to our health, and you know, in terms of because you know, like alcohol definitely numb you to your feelings. And you know that's a date of kind of like quality, the alcohol has but in hindsight, you have to deal with your feelings right he had to. work through them your emotion saying you gotta suck your emotions, as they come up, so I definitely understand where you know the drinking kind of like helped in that situation helped, but not really helped. Right like and that situation, you know, like in terms of you know, wine to not feel your feelings. Right now yeah and not go through like the grieving process."
14815.0,Patient,Exactly.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
14815.0,Patient,"And I just you know. Getting to a point. In you know, the end of August, when I realized that exactly what you said it was a coping mechanism, it was time to put my big boy pants on. Face what. My feelings and my demons and stuff and get the hell over it, and keep doing it moving you know what I mean. So that's where i'm at now is just keep looking forward and doing it that way, so."
759.0,Provider,"Well, you know, like have you learned a new coping skills and you know what do you do to cope now."
14815.0,Patient,"I. don't really need to cope with anything i'm at peace with it, so when you."
759.0,Provider,say something else arises.
14815.0,Patient,"Right, I told you last time I tried to do some breathing exercises."
759.0,Provider,me being.
14815.0,Patient,"my mind when I mind starts to go. I like to get my dog, and you know go out for a walk with her whatever. But yeah that's becoming fewer and far between, for me, you know where that is happening to me it seems so."
759.0,Provider,"So maybe the sub treatment on your treatment plan our practice one coping skill man and when. Situations situation so when when needed to for relapse prevention or something like that. Can you do deep breathing exercises maybe you know, like you, how you ever i'm sure you heard of meditation and you're. able to you know, like do your deep breathing exercises key put that into practice, maybe two three times a week I would do a meditation. You know, like with deep breathing can be two minute five minute i'm just gonna sit down listen to some you know meditation music close my eyes and just practice during my deep breathing exercises."
14815.0,Patient,Give that a try.
759.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you did that two hour period, maybe two to three times a week. For relapse prevention okay."
14815.0,Patient,sounds good.
759.0,Provider,"This you know, like only say dies, because you know we want you to keep on maintaining but, but what are we doing to maintain you know, to keep our progress, you know. What are we doing to make sure that we don't fall back into maybe all habits and maybe practicing one coping skill, at a time my help with that you know, like you, we prevent the idea of a coping skill to to be a little bit preventive instead of reactive. Right now, if we're doing something you know daily our months or twice a week, it could be exercise it can be deep breathing it could be anything. we're doing that to prevent ourselves, you know from going back to doing what we're doing before we have something that can help us cope do with our for life throws at us, whatever challenge happens, you know, like how wanting that that helps us cope with it does that make sense."
14815.0,Patient,makes perfect sense.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Good so really deep breathing for now, you can try it out with meditation music, are you can do do it on your own whatever you feel like it's natural to."
14815.0,Patient,feel give it a whirl.
759.0,Provider,"yeah I can't hurt. And you know, being a commie stage just allow yourself just to check out for a minute or two you know, like and just like relax. Your body and and you know, like in 19 deep we've been also helps regulate your nervous system, you know, like kind of bringing that peace and calm and serenity, you know back into your life and maintaining some balance there."
