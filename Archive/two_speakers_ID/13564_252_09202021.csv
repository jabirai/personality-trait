252.0,Provider,doing good really good.
13564.0,Patient,that's great.
252.0,Provider,How has the last couple weeks been.
13564.0,Patient,"um then. dippin okay overall. So after that session I went to go see. In the mood for love and then I actually ran into that person I was talking to at that screening. Yes, uncanny like we both did we're almost didn't even go to that screening, but then we talked for like the rest of the night afterwards. And just kind of like. brought forth like what we both learned to therapy, as well as just like you know. Coming to some kind of understanding, but yeah it was a square timing with that."
252.0,Provider,Or was a perfect timing.
13564.0,Patient,Thanks for.
252.0,Provider,"You know, because every time I mean. i'm definitely sometimes you know it's just something little that. we're really. misunderstanding or misunderstood stood you know it can be our our communication style, it can be our insecurities you know it could be from past relationships we just don't know you know but being open to being able to explore it. You know, going in a conversation, not on the defensive or not ready to respond or react, but really just listening, you know helps a lot."
13564.0,Patient,yeah. It was very. Like a progressive and enlightening conversation like with them so. glad about that.
252.0,Provider,Good i'm glad that sounds like so everything has been going good then.
13564.0,Patient,"um yeah everything's been going well uh. Like you know getting more jobs recommended to me so that's good like I have a job, this Wednesday job last week. And yeah it's more kind of like just like random occurrences kind of happening versus just a. I think I do give too much space to people are found it seems like as if I attract a lot of people that just generally. have a lot of their. purse level of personal problems and kind of like a see me is like some ground and grounded forced or something like that. cuz I had a coworker recently, who will like years ago had spoken and we're seeing a while. If all each other on social media, but they messaged me. And I were talking and then we face chatted and they like told me that, like they had. Some, like crush they had some crush on me, but then also show dissatisfaction their their current like relationship for whatever years and it's just like. kind of because they have their own things going on and they I guess they think their partner doesn't really understand that. yeah it's like it was like back like pretty much like. like that. Like happening like twice over the past week somehow it's just weird timing I don't know why."
252.0,Provider,yeah that is weird timing.
13564.0,Patient,yeah I get it.
252.0,Provider,So what was your response.
13564.0,Patient,Oh. I just met when they told me. it's like I tell you secret have huge crush on anything against them and then I just kind of laughed and I just said classic. Like is yeah it is what it is so nice yeah I just thought it was like now I don't think the last thing that I need.
252.0,Provider,"is for. You you know you almost want to say you know what when you figure out what you're gonna do in your current situation. And if you guys choose to part ways, maybe we'll talk, but until then. i'm not going to be you're on the side fleeing you know."
13564.0,Patient,yeah so.
252.0,Provider,you're better than that.
13564.0,Patient,yeah I don't.
252.0,Provider,"Know you're better than that but but it's very it's very ego uplifting to know that people you know people that you had no idea. crush on you. And it's pretty cool to find that out it, it is really uplifting to be in that place right."
13564.0,Patient,"yeah it felt Nice because that time I also I also like them, but I never. initiate anything say always have a hard time in general, just starting. or approaching people outside of just the shyness in general, so it was kind of Nice hearing. yeah yeah but um other than that, like just practicing mindfulness and. just doing i've been like okay with doing nothing and that's been really good. yeah like. that's been very, very mentally helpful for me yeah it's been helping me a lot and. Not being so hard on myself in general. yeah definitely still bouts of like feeling. You know, I was like the uneasiness so we just like of stillness but it's you know subsides i'm started I got a new bike started biking again so that's been very helpful. yeah."
252.0,Provider,So let me go back for one second to your situations with these people reaching out to.
13564.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I, I think that that what I just did is. proposed what I would do if I were you in that situation, what was your response and your action behind it."
13564.0,Patient,To them.
252.0,Provider,there's no wrong answers what's good for you.
13564.0,Patient,"response yeah I just laughed and I said classic and then they said oh don't say that and I told him like what it is what it is like what we want me to say, and then we just like how to me, I like a nice just just like. Nice talk about just various topics, you know that I didn't pertain to any of that and or you knows just kind of that was cool talking to them again so."
252.0,Provider,"Good good good good I sometimes I find myself doing that and they don't realize that that's what I did until just now, it hit me i'm like oh wait. What did he say, and I was imposing what I would say, if I was in your position, not everybody would do that you know, some people are okay, with the non commit you know the non commitment part. And that's Okay, too."
13564.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just. Thanks yeah like I I really. have very strong feelings for that other person that I ran into in the mood for love and that's like I really want. To focus Tina to like split or deal with drama in that way and. squares funny timing, that same that same week."
252.0,Provider,"Now I almost feel like like a test, this is a test like, why did it come right now. You know, made a decision, and this is what direction i'm going, you know."
13564.0,Patient,"yeah but for a while, like the past week, I would have been on like three days for people just to not have the pursuit of anything, just like talking meeting i'm kind of like already jaded from that because."
252.0,Provider,Like asked yeah.
13564.0,Patient,"Because they just like I just don't want to exert that anymore, and I feel like i'm just searching for something that's not. that's kind of them like, even if the blue, there is one occasion were like mean that person, where, can I just putting like one of the dates for just holding each other, and then it was as if I was searching for the arms of the other person I knew, like us, and healthy like I can't I can't. just rely on yeah and just realizing stuff like that, like just. On I feel like. i'm like moving but not really that times thinking and that way like thinking of a. The actual like attention behind the action and i'm doing. um you know, and this time it's like now i'm just like more were like yeah i'm just like. No obviously still searching searching for that one person through other people."
252.0,Provider,"yeah it doesn't happen and making sure that what it is that you're really searching for you. aren't supposed to supply it to yourself. there's that to go, you know oftentimes that's what we do, we search for things that we need to give ourselves and other people, and when it doesn't. work out the way that we hoped it was we wonder why you know you got to search for somebody in the right direction and the right reason you give yourself everything that you deserve you know, for you. know what I mean."
13564.0,Patient,yeah definitely. But it's not a sin to have been like just just like very. spacey I feel or field not feel like slightly dissociated associative. um I don't know whether it's lack asleep or. Not consistently or something like this yeah it's been feeling that way for a while.
252.0,Provider,What are your what are you sleeping in I.
13564.0,Patient,sleep on my sleeping on.
252.0,Provider,yeah what what's your sleep schedule.
13564.0,Patient,"I generally go to bed like around. 12 1230. And then. i'll probably wake up once or twice in the night and then i'll just wake up at seven and then just for 630 and just lay in bed for like an hour and a half and then finally get up. And then i'll like meditate for 20 minutes and I go bike riding for 30 minutes to an hour and that's that's like the start of my day, but I feel the bike ride meditation definitely give me more energy."
252.0,Provider,"And you know. It could be. You know, depression popping is weary head out which it does sometimes you know these are going along good and all of a sudden it's like Why do I feel so tired and I don't want to move, you know. or could be, you know something that you're going through maybe you've got a little bug or something that's just kind of your body's fighting off, I mean there could be several reasons, you know, for it. But just making sure that your self care is stellar you know, is on track and you're doing what you're supposed to do you're eating, you know. Eating good meals, a day and not skipping and you're drinking plenty of water and you're really paying attention to how much rest you're getting you know. And how many times you wake up, but do you have nightmares you know all of those things play a factor in the quality, you know of sleep that we get. So do you have nightmares."
13564.0,Patient,"As of late now, but they sometimes they just feel like. Like I remember my dreams really vividly how they look, but the feel of it sometimes this kind of went in like mundane but there's not really going on but there's still like that underlying. sense of. Not dread in a bad way, but just like kind of like some type of oppressive atmosphere. um. yeah. So."
252.0,Provider,"Is it a repetitive dream, as at one that you have a lot, or is it like different scenarios, with the same. Oh, how do I explain it with the same feeling that goes with it."
13564.0,Patient,into their different dreams. But same. Like they all share little like kind of carriers same kind of view. So.
252.0,Provider,I wonder. Have you told Mary we told you doctor about it.
13564.0,Patient,Now.
252.0,Provider,"So the next time that you see her, I want you to tell her about it, you know tell her the way that you've been feeling a little dissociated it's important that she knows that stuff because it could be something, are you on an antidepressant."
13564.0,Patient,"No, I refrained from."
252.0,Provider,"Taking Oh, and a depressant. Are you getting enough sunlight."
13564.0,Patient,yeah like i'm i'm walking every day and that's how that's how it's very helpful in general and then my room has a lot of light oh yeah so i've been doing that a lot every day.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so just know that maybe these are the parts of depression that all of the healthy things that you're doing aren't touching it. You know what I mean. yeah i'm and i'm just giving yourself the the understanding about that that maybe that's exactly what it is and maybe you just need to be you know extra you know kind of yourself today, maybe take an extra 30 minutes you know walk in the sun staying in the moment. You know, identifying things that you're happy about thinking things that you're happy about right. yeah and trying to stay out of it out of the negative thought process may help, but you know clinical depression and there's that piece of it that you know. it's the firing up here. And Sunday, sometimes we just can't do it with all the healthy things that we're doing you know."
13564.0,Patient,"notice on top of that sensation of also. having a hard time like understanding with somebody says like conversationally. It was just yes, I don't know it's kind of like I it's as if, like I can't like i'm not hearing well, but then I know that's not really the problems more in the way that i'm adjusting information for some reason. it's like not it's not like a new phenomenon like i've had that before in the past um."
252.0,Provider,Is it kind of go.
13564.0,Patient,"yeah it comes and goes the time, but like now it's kind of like more. More common yeah or they're."
252.0,Provider,Just thinking what other you know.
13564.0,Patient,"X, I have also have. ADHD and I don't know whether it's that."
252.0,Provider,"Oh yeah hd which is you know, can be a mental struggle, it really can. You know. I can tell you that that most smartest people I know have ADHD. And they struggle with. With sorry even explain it they struggle with behavior they struggle with anger they struggle with emotions they struggle with. uncomprehending it's almost like there's this like filter there that says what What did you say right. yeah so it's about giving yourself permission to take that few extra minutes really evaluate what you're being told. You know it'll get through there just sometimes takes a few minutes. What about creativity."
13564.0,Patient,"Oh, that sounds like more abstract things like creatives creative outlets or. doesn't if i'm being creative or just done yeah uh I had lately haven't been taken film photos um. it's funny I didn't know like i've been. sitting on these three roles still haven't developed and that's like me telling myself like once I develop them then i'll chew again but i've been looking into find my own like scanner so I can like you know just develop it all myself. yeah yeah so I haven't been taking photos, even though I go around and like look at things I would take photos up and it's good. it's kind of you know kind of sucks what. So I haven't been doing that music i've been like kind of doing a few minutes a day at the very least, save that haven't been writing. i've just been like. ruminating in my head thinking about creative stuff."
252.0,Provider,"Thinking about it, but not doing it. So what do you think you're you need to do in order to get motivated to get back into doing these things that you love."
13564.0,Patient,and
252.0,Provider,rejoin.
13564.0,Patient,"I think like. Establishing more like like routine for writing again, and then the walks have essentially like been a step towards that. For sure, because you know when I go and walk so how many cameras all the time. it's now it's just Santa like buying buying the rules. Like just thinking about the costs of developing later and everything."
252.0,Provider,"What I can tell you is that if you buy a roll right, and even if you don't develop develop it for a while. it's Okay, but at least you've taken that first step initiating step, you know, and when you have the finances to develop, you can develop them and you probably be amazed at the things that you took a picture of. You know. really not giving up that first part. No. Definitely, is what I would suggest, because it brings you joy it makes you have to be you know you can't give those things up there too important."
13564.0,Patient,yeah. No yeah they do it feels. It does feel a little empty without taking pictures.
252.0,Provider,"So that's what I would suggest and i'm not a photographer or anything but I can tell you that I had roles I didn't develop for years and then, when I finally did go and get them all developed, I was like. A total different scenario, but it was like oh my God look i've got these pictures I didn't even know that I had."
13564.0,Patient,"yeah. guess yeah part of others like pictures, I know that I that I took off and just really excited but yeah the holding myself back from sending out to develop."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
13564.0,Patient,yeah I should get back on.
252.0,Provider,"yeah I know it can be, it can be expensive, you know I get it sometimes you ain't got no extra money to you know develop, but let me tell you tell you can. Do it."
13564.0,Patient,"i'm mentioned, like the ADHD and emotions and anger. um yeah it's something like i've dealt with a good chunk of my life is just a. emotional outbursts or just i'm just saying like you know just. Really deep anger that way, and the small things just. would just kind of send me off, or you know, like that would make me more angry just thinking about the one thing and it keeps looping like an ECHO yeah um. and it's been something i've tried and trying more because there's times, where I catch myself feeling like that and. Then, whether we justified for feeling angry, or whether I should feel angry. And whether there's like times in the of the application of anger, or you know you know what I mean."
252.0,Provider,"yeah that is a piece emotion regulation is a piece of. impulsivity you know have ADHD definitely and. you've just got I mean you got to work hard at being able to change that ruminating thought process first off, you know understanding that you have a right to feel those emotions, but not allowing them to control you, you know, especially anger and I can tell you that. impulsivity is a big piece of ADHD and so it's easy to feel that core anger right and just without even thinking about it, right here there it is and before you know it it's done. that's not abnormal but. Really catching it before it gets to that point it's about when you're feeling it welling up because anger is driven by fear or pain or hurt. So when you feel it coming that was first little inklings that you know you're getting getting angry. You gotta bow away from the situation or that thought process and say i'm going to deal with you later and allow yourself to calm down and really take a look underneath that anger and say what am I afraid of. What hurt me. And really address what's pushing that anger. yeah you know but you've got to catch it right at the very beginning, you know if you wait till it's building up and it's already like right here it's too late it's coming right. yeah and then you know you wish it wouldn't have happened so it's really about stopping it when you first start feeling that inkling of it and that it's coming. Being able to step back and say you know I need a few minutes if you're talking to somebody I need a few minutes okay I just I need a few minutes to myself. And walking away breathing taking deep breaths saying calm down i'm not gonna i'm not going to do this with anger today we're going to listen with both my ears not going to judge first, because what happens with ADHD is that we create we can hear half of somebody's. Explanation of something and with the half of what they're explaining we can build a whole scenario in our head and run with it. And that will drive that anger, you know big time big time to pull ourselves back and realize, I have to listen, I have to listen, I have to listen, have to listen to it all, then you walk away, then you take deep breaths. Right calm you something. You know."
13564.0,Patient,"it's definitely experienced that a lot like somebody would say something and there's one thing that's spoken that's a sentence they claim to and keeps replaying. respond to that one thing or, then the whole yeah."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and that can really cause a lot of conflict in in our relations, you know and so trying to avoid that trying to really tell your mind, let go of that and listen to the listen to what they're saying as a whole. don't pick up pick it apart, listen to it as a whole. What are they telling me, and of course you're going to have questions i'm I am a lion always going to have a lot of questions about what they they're telling you. Especially if you're holding on to one piece of what they're telling you. hey, but when you listen to a medicine at as a whole, of what they're trying to tell you, as a whole you'll still have questions, but they won't be so. accusatory. Here at i'm what i'm saying."
13564.0,Patient,yeah. Not using not responding or using pointed language or anything yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Right, because then, what happens essence their defenses off your defenses are up you're hanging on to that one thing. You know they're feeling like they're not heard because they're really not you've just taken your mind does what it does and it took a piece of it and that's what it's creating the whole scenario off of so it's really about identifying that that's what's going on. and stopping it at the very beginning."
13564.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know, sometimes it's easier to instead of hearing sometimes it's easier to read right."
13564.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Leaving it on a voicemail the whole the whole scenario, so you can't you know stop them you can't concentrate on one thing out of the whole story, but yet you have to listen to it in its entirety. That makes sense."
13564.0,Patient,"yeah that makes sense. One other thing is. Like sometime in the past, like, I would request some like, for instance, like years ago there's this choir that I had and. They when they came over they did sometimes eat the food that was he, like my roommates food and I tell my kids if it's not mine and then I. Do not respond like okay I won't do that again, and then they do that three four more times by accident and then it isn't until like the last that fourth or fifth time whatever like that I finally explode or just kind of go off, you know it's like it's almost as if, like. A times it felt like I have to. be angry, or like express that in our show that it's kind of extreme. Just in order to make a point."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you don't have to, but what you can do is the first time that you say something you can say listen before you get in that fridge I really, really need you to ask me before you eat something half of those the half of that stuff and there's my roommates. So please, I don't mind if he my stuff, but please ask me before you do."
13564.0,Patient,"Even better, where."
252.0,Provider,"it's assertive right you're being assertive and you're setting a boundary down. yeah you know, in its entirety. Right some of that isn't mine, so please don't eat it. Right. don't want. don't want trouble with my roommate. You know what I mean and that really makes a big difference it's a how we present stuff if we present Stephen and in a really a nonchalant way at first, then that's how people take it those boundaries are wavy wobbly right. yeah, but if we tell them directly. Right, this is it, this is how it is. Up above them, you know they're going to hear you a lot louder in the very beginning. And you can also say, and you know if you if you eat it you buy it you buy it you replace it. So my food for you to eat. You know. nothing wrong with that either."
13564.0,Patient,yeah. I guess it's just like reframing language yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,"It is being solid in your boundaries. You know and saying it the very first time in its entirety, not just a little bit not just giving hints but. This is how it is. You know."
13564.0,Patient,"yeah it's really. Quite just thinking back to all those times that I actually like that just in general. Like yeah I guess it was two. I guess I just expected like reciprocation or like how somebody would tell me something and then i'd be like okay i'll be mindful like from the first time, you know."
252.0,Provider,"yeah you would be mindful. But having that expectation on other people. Set you up for failure, every time. This that's you and you would only hope that somebody would be that respectful. right but they're not and sometimes they don't hear and sometimes their interpretation of what you said isn't what you meant. So it's about direct COM directness you know and setting that boundary you know saying listen if you eat my roommate stuff you know I respect him and I don't want him to get upset, then I will expect you to pay for it to bring it tonight as it is it's not mine to give. You know. So you're not being angry you're being assertive and you're setting that part boundary that's not movable. see what i'm saying."
13564.0,Patient,yeah that's very helpful like it's like i've been trying so hard and being tactical and yeah it was. it's needed definitely just use more assertive language.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. That the hard part is finding the the line between aggression and assertive. Because, sometimes we think that we're you know one more aggressive that we're being assertive in reality we're being aggressive so it's really about saying you know hey i'm glad you're here I enjoy your company, but I just need to set this boundary with you. This stuff is not mine to give so please don't need it you're welcome to my stuff asked me and i'll tell you what's mine and what's his. Okay, I mean you say it with assertiveness. You always throw niceties in their respect in there right. Always. make people here. That make sense."
13564.0,Patient,yeah it makes that makes a lot of sense.
252.0,Provider,it's communicating but communicating in a manner that gets us her. said balance.
13564.0,Patient,Did you read the was it like that assessment thing.
252.0,Provider,or your personality assessment.
13564.0,Patient,yeah I did the last week.
252.0,Provider,Have you gotten a copy of it.
13564.0,Patient,"No, I haven't received the copy."
252.0,Provider,"Well it's a lot of questions. Okay, this isn't the one I thought it was. See. This. Usually, they send me a copy of the. personality testing when you get it done. I don't think they've finished it yet. finished yet. cuz I get it and it looks a whole different. yeah if they haven't done your personality testing it. crazy amazing. You will, though, and it it's really pretty amazing, because it really tells you, you know what you work best in. What kind of finger, you are what your personality, you know style is, and it really teaches us a lot about who we are, you know. In all ways. Not batteries are good ways and. it's kind of amazing when you look at them because they're accurate, you know to me it's like well I do do that right, and I think that that questionnaire that you filled out might be. A piece of it, but when I get it it's all compiled together."
13564.0,Patient,"Okay, I see."
252.0,Provider,"When I get it i'll let you know okay. Okay pretty amazing so this week you're going to work on. assertiveness and setting boundaries, with people. Identifying when your anger is first rising. Giving yourself permission to walk away from whatever starting to irritate you. and saying why am I getting irritated asking yourself those questions Why am I getting irritated what am I afraid of what did I get hurt by and identifying those. Right. Give yourself permission to evaluate yourself in those manners okay. keep doing what you're doing. You know you're doing an amazing job you know getting exercise, and you know stay on track with your eating and drinking plenty of water all of those things are vital right. But try, if you feel that that just connect that foggy feeling try to go sit out in the sun for a little bit try to do other things that can help clear you up a little bit and see if that helps hey. You try that."
13564.0,Patient,yeah i'll try i'll try doing. Okay.
252.0,Provider,"when's our next appointment, do you know."
13564.0,Patient,um. I don't know I think it's just Monday again now.
252.0,Provider,wants to verify that make sure we have it okay. So should we need a worse and worse each other every two weeks right.
13564.0,Patient,Now every once a week.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, every Monday."
13564.0,Patient,Every Monday.
252.0,Provider,2pm.
13564.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I will be cheering you on they're not there, but you're going to be there right now. Okay right. And we let me know how you do you know, and if you've figured out what really drives the anger when it starts coming up."
13564.0,Patient,cinematically it's always been feeling like i'm not being heard. The thing.
252.0,Provider,"So. In to verify that check the facts on it okay. um give yourself this week to verify that that's what it is that's the triggering event that causes it a so that would be. That would be hurt some fear. So, remember that you know what we have control over ourselves you don't have control how somebody interprets what we're saying, or how they respond to us that's out of our control. Well, we have what we have is as. The end of the day, that's what we've got yeah."
13564.0,Patient,yeah I need to. remind myself of that.
252.0,Provider,"I need to walk right because. that's just who we are, as people you know, we want to be heard, we want to fill importantly, we want to know that the other person, you know is listening to what we have to say."
13564.0,Patient,"I guess yeah it's always I still fall in like you know, having that expectation feeling, you know. Those, like whatever like a hole for others like I expect reciprocation yes yeah I think that's."
252.0,Provider,We do that. When we do that what's the meaning of insanity.
13564.0,Patient,Just repeating the same thing and expecting different results.
252.0,Provider,"So when you come to that, and you find yourself holding somebody else to an expectation that they're never going to meet. Remember what's the meaning of insanity. I gotta change that. Once you have no expectations on other people it's pretty free. You know."
13564.0,Patient,yeah. Pretty yeah i've always been pretty obvious to the brothers kind of just doing things seemingly one tonally or you know just within. Spread themselves in a sense. yeah.
