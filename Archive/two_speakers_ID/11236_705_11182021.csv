705.0,Provider,This will be two o'clock with JESSICA last name bicyclists. How are you.
11236.0,Patient,"i'm okay I locked myself out of my car so. I was in a rush, I was trying to get to work. For a meeting with the title REP and I was trying to get lunch first and the line took too long, so I hustled over here, and then I tried to get upstairs and I left my key inside but it's Okay, I have AAA. Okay, I just called them they're great, and they should be sending somebody in like an hour."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
11236.0,Patient,It might get here sooner I don't know.
705.0,Provider,Is this going to mess up anything that you have with your meeting.
11236.0,Patient,"No, I I realized I didn't have my keys after the meeting was over, so I got here for the meeting, but then I were rushed upstairs and I left my keys in the car. And so i'm like a mad at myself, because I keep telling myself i'm going to stop being late to stuff and. I don't know why I always just like try to inch it to the last second you know and and squeeze more than I can in that time. I think my OCD has a lot to do with it, you know it's it's really hard to get out of the House without thinking like Oh well, I could do this next thing, and this next thing, and this next thing. and And then I was thinking, maybe it's like a little social anxiety, too, because even though i'm coming to work like if i'm going to sit there for 30 minutes before my meeting what am I going to do for 30 minutes I don't know like it's I mean I could work, you know but. I don't know i've never been like an on time person and I hate that about myself, I think it like creates a lot more of the anxiety that I don't need you know."
705.0,Provider,"quite well, is there a way that you could, if not going inside. is something that's you're like interested in, could you do something, even in the parking lot to just re Center yourself before you start your day."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah talking to you talking to you, while I wait for AAA to get here."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
11236.0,Patient,felt recent three Center me.
705.0,Provider,"And then also to us. and other times like you were saying that sometimes you're late so i'm wondering if you put it, where you arrive early, but you have something to look forward to like meditation or just something that you can do for yourself. Where it's not your idea."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah um because, even if I get here early I stay in the car, you know. there's and then i'll wait till like two minutes before. The meeting and then i'll be walking in as the meeting starting that I don't I think it's kind of crappy but subconsciously I do it. You know I don't know why I just then i'm like Oh, I could do my makeup with this extra time and I could you know. Maybe it's like trying to avoid just like chatting with people you know, instead of like going into a meeting having the purpose and getting it done, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I think takes time to practice but that definitely if that's on your radar Jessie then that might be, you know something that he could could look at and be like you know what i'm going to just each time tolerate a little bit more time to go in and talk with people. To see how it goes."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I guess I always felt like showing up early to stuff i'm like taking time away from me, or something does that make sense."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it does, and I think too that some of it with with having high anxiety also plays a part where this has become your routine and you know it's pretty."
11236.0,Patient,easy to jump in. And do work stuff because you're.
705.0,Provider,focused you're already right there but it's that idol that chit chat is getting you know something to get used to.
11236.0,Patient,"yeah that's what it is like I don't I guess like unless there's like I mean if we're on the clock if i'm at work, then I know what i'm supposed to be doing and what we're supposed to be talking about. But if there's just time where it's like socializing I mean i'm afraid, I might say something dumb or something you know something that maybe I over shared because i'm feeling awkward I don't know. i've never really thought about that, before, but I think that's why I don't like being early to stuff because I don't want to like. give people the opportunity to know me too much on a personal level, I like to keep the division of like Oh, this is. My professional self and they don't need to know anything about like my vices and how I party and. Do you know what I mean I guess. Maybe I guess maybe because I was hiding a lot of the stuff I was doing I didn't want to be around people to get to know what I did with my free time and when you have free time at work being there early you're left to just talk, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and discovering which conversations then because yeah you're probably right Jesse you don't want to tell them like hi i'm Jesse how are you hey, by the way, can I tell you about some of the issues i'm going on but."
11236.0,Patient,"it'll just come out, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Could there be, though. Some some topics that you're comfortable with and your business setting. Because part of this is probably in the future you'll have clients you're talking to and maybe you're showing them around and things like that to a new house and making that idle chitchat and is, what are you comfortable then talking about."
11236.0,Patient,um my son.
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
11236.0,Patient,"I could talk about my son. Right now, I feel like my Divorce is like overshadowing all of my personal time so I don't need like I don't really want to even be around people that don't want. To talk about that you know. or for people to know about that. Even at work."
705.0,Provider,"quite a bit your son sounds like then it's a safe topic, and maybe just day to day like you know hey the weather wow it's a little bit cooler here, what do you think or Where are you from it's always like back to you sometimes it's nice to."
11236.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah so i'm like questioning them not giving them time to question me. yeah that's true.
705.0,Provider,How are you when you go to an A a meeting do arrive on time early.
11236.0,Patient,"I arrive right on time, if not just a few minutes late."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
11236.0,Patient,"The same thing you know, even if I get there early i'll sit in the car until like two minutes before the meeting starts. I said I want to like if I especially if I don't know anybody there if I mean I don't really know anybody here period I. All my family's in La all my friends are in La but i'm in ventura county now so like I don't really know a lot of people here. So anywhere I go i'm not really meeting up with anybody it's like with new people strangers, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah and a lot of this too it's just when you were younger it's usually the younger you start using substances and to develop the skills of just kind of chit chatting casually getting into a conversation can be more difficult as an adult you're just.
11236.0,Patient,"Absolutely i've always been like late or. Just time you know, but I hate that I really do hate it."
705.0,Provider,"You know Jesse I think what it is just starting to try different things, just like with with coping you know it's it's time management what is going to be your system, then, and this isn't working, what do you want to change up about it, then because you're getting there on time."
11236.0,Patient,"Right, but I i'd like to feel at ease when an appointment starts, you know so like I know for that I would have to get. To a place at least 15 minutes before i'm supposed to be there. Okay, and."
705.0,Provider,walking on one.
11236.0,Patient,And sorry.
705.0,Provider,"And then, instead of walking in two minutes before."
11236.0,Patient,"Well then. Like if I if if I would think of an ideal situation, I would probably get like, if I had to come so every Tuesdays and Wednesdays, we have training and in our morning meetings and that starts right at nine or right at 930 well. Traffic is unpredictable sometimes, so I would like to be able to know that I would get somewhere 15 minutes before anything. But I would like 15 minutes to myself to kind of either meditate or listen to like some affirmations or. get into like a good headspace you know so ideally maybe like getting somewhere 30 minutes before so that i'm already parked I know i'm not going to be late because i'm stuck in traffic and I don't know what. I mean I speed through traffic when i'm late, you know, and I make myself late it's like ridiculous so i'm just like high anxiety, the whole time getting to a place. um but if i'm there and having stuff to do could be like reduce that. Right yeah So if I could get somewhere 30 minutes in advance park do like an affirmations or a five minute you know meditation. mm hmm then get to my office set up plug in my computer and then be ready to go 15 minutes before the meeting I i'd be so proud of myself."
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah and even working your way that even if you arrived five minutes early that's a win and it's just like easing into it and seeing how you are with conversation. Or, just like a simple, you know hey how's it how's it going and sometimes people will share so much that you're like okay."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah yeah Okay, maybe I can make that a goal like that you can hold me accountable to. How often I can you know get somewhere early instead of trying to beat the clock every time it's every time you know."
705.0,Provider,"It sends it producing because if you're running at that fight or flight at all times you're trying to drive, I can only imagine what this. feels like."
11236.0,Patient,Right that's why that hurts so much all the time.
705.0,Provider,and sending in an overdrive.
11236.0,Patient,"yeah like this in the steering wheel like looking around I hate it. yeah oh my gosh I would love telling you this because I don't think i've ever said this out loud, but my mom used to make fun of me and call me the professional. Professional procrastinator and I hated her for it because it was kind of true but, like. I also knew I didn't like that about myself, you know just like rushing to get somewhere, but. I can change that maybe i'll. Start like thinking about. Being somewhere 30 minutes always before i'm supposed to be there. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"It makes sense to Jesse of why this is so much on your mind and presents extra like negative self talk, because your mom's voice is behind it, saying about you know that procrastination and putting. yeah."
11236.0,Patient,"Failure you know, like I could I could look so sharp if only I got here 10 minutes before you know I still like, and you know i've done that so long, like even with my first job and even with like my classes and in college. That I always felt like I had to overcompensate for being that late person, you know, like, I had to. be better at my job or be more personable so people weren't mad at me all the time for being late, you know, like over compensating for feeling like a little bit of a failure because I couldn't get here on time again, and my dog, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah notice to and those times that you're rush and you're having to like you're in your car and then all sudden you're like oh no when you start walking really fast. you're already building up you know your heart rate you're already causing the anxiety to go faster and then that's going to play a part two, into the the social anxiety is it's going to feel even more like you're aware of it, whereas if you took maybe a little bit more time. took a moment to re Center. walk a normal pace in there, you could already be ahead of the game by slowing your heart rate down slowing your blood down."
11236.0,Patient,"Right I kind of used to envy a coworker of mine who would always walk in 15 minutes early but she'd already have a cup of coffee and she was like. Just kind of strolling and you know, then she'd come like from desk to desk because she had nothing else to do and i'd be like man it'd be great if I could just walk into work like that, one day, and not be like all frazzled do you know. yeah, but I feel frazzled a lot."
705.0,Provider,"yeah, and that is that is part of that, for as well, has become your routine and now to break it up is if there's times that you still do that then it's like okay i'm working at i'm doing best I can i'll try again when the opportunity is there. And then you know because i'm not hearing you're missing meetings you may not be getting there when you would like to or you're getting there but you're not going in when you like to. So it's like you already have you know, last time, like we were talking about that foundation you already have the Foundation it's now fine tuning that. Did you think they are to when we were talking about designing your foundation of what your House may look like."
11236.0,Patient,"um. Well, I have been thinking a lot about what. What my life is going to be looking like shortly because. The Attorney is coming up dropped it up another declaration, if you remember, I. was having a hard time putting a declaration together or this declaration this email together to the attorneys about why I felt like my son should be with me and the things I felt like his dad isn't handling and taking care of well I address all of that, and it was hard for me to do. But the Attorney told me that they were going to use that for ammunition in case it was needed, while they weren't. Port well after I sent that in the paralegal called me back and said, you know after everything that you wrote. we're actually going to go through and push for sole custody and so legal costs so physical custody and so legal custody or reunification plan for your husband and your son. Family and parenting classes that he's an adult so I guess it was a lot more severe than I anticipated it being taken by the Attorney because I talked about you know. Like his diagnose mental and he says that he doesn't take medications for that he's still actively drinking that you know he's got a sex addiction and all that stuff and so um. You know I really didn't want to hurt them I don't want to hurt them I don't want this to get I don't want to add fuel to the fire and make it worse, you know he doesn't want to do 7525 and that's what I was asking for he wants to do 5050, but I just can't feel comfortable with a baby."
705.0,Provider,He. Did you tell the truth.
11236.0,Patient,"I did, and I still didn't even go that far into the truth, you know because I was trying to keep it. from getting really ugly you know but. I guess what I said was enough for them to like push for harsher. terms with the custody and so they dropped it up a whole new declaration and i've been avoiding it, you know, like I it's been three days, she called me today and she said. You know the Attorney already reviewed the declaration we just need you to sign it, like stop lollygagging like just get it done and I told her, I have a meeting at work. But when i'm done with that you know Allah i'll send all that stuff over and I just don't want to look at it like I don't. Because once I see a sign it then now it's on you know, like now it's like this is going to get really severe I mean he's not going to be happy with me going for sole custody, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
11236.0,Patient,"I was still living together and like at least right now we're cordial but like if that. I don't know I, I know I have to do it i'm just trying to like mentally prepare myself to just open up the file read it right, what I want changed or what I you know, or if I agree with it just sign it. But i'm getting i'm getting pushback from the paralegal you know because I told her, I told her this when I talked to her after she said she drafted up a whole new DECO declaration, she said, listen JESSICA right now the. concern is your son safety and, as a matter of fact, the safety of your stepdaughter too, and I said listen I don't want to interfere whatsoever with my step daughter like that's a whole nother. level i'm just trying to worry about my son and then she was saying, well, but she could be around your son, you know his his your stepdaughter could be around your son and what if something happens and it wasn't a dress and. So I think she wants like she's like you know i'm very aggressive, but we do this because we're you pay us to take care of you, and right now we're trying to take care of you and your son and. So i've been weighing that you know it hurts me to think that i'm gonna do something that's going to separate my son from his father, you know. Because there are things that he does that are. That makes him a good dad he's very attentive and he's more affectionate than I think most dads would be but he's he's been driving me crazy with his with his untreated. uh what's the word with his untreated. Issues you know, and I wonder like if that's how he makes me feel I mean sometimes his paranoia kicks in and he accuses me of doing things I haven't done. It just totally screws up my whole day like what if it gets to a point where he's doing that to my son, then you know and he's like really messing with his mental state because he's not addressing these things so i'm. I know this probably sounds like a repeat of last time but it's just I thought it was something I was writing in confidence for them to have just in case, but now it's going to be something that's going to be put on record. That he's going to read to, and I know this is just going to take it up a notch you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah how did it feel right it.
11236.0,Patient,"It felt like I got my sight out of the story, if I like I got my setup of the story and i've realized that the way he's been lying to me to his family and to like people that. That are aware of our situation. It almost feels like this is the only way I can vindicate myself, you know, this is the only way that I could. tell my side of the story for people to understand what i've been putting up with, I mean his sister his brother, his family will never know what it's like to be married to him because. They don't even know that he's got the sex addiction, you know, but that is such a major part of our issues, because he can't control themselves. And he's he's proposed these really inappropriate things in our marriage and the norms are so skewed you know. And, and even like things that I find so grave so good such a betrayal he thinks he's he has said to me, before like grow up you know, like grow up like. it's just sex or you know, whatever I mean whatever his comment is at that moment but it's like it makes me realize how far off are norms are because I don't want to lose that. I don't want to be that desensitized about sharing my body, you know I don't want to be desensitized about like. My partner having sex with someone else like just because it's just sex it's not emotional no man you're sharing yourself with someone else that you're trying to please another person, but you're with me like that's that's hurtful you know, and I don't want to get used to that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you, you have have voice that dress you to that you know know like some people, they may be okay, but you've always know, and so you know, to me it goes back to. You decided to tell the truth and that's what she did and it's it's like before your dui maybe you were not ready to face about the alcohol, you know the alcohol use, and it was problematic after you got your dui. Did you then start to do something about it."
11236.0,Patient,um. After I got my dui probably drank even more because I just was so depressed but it led me to find treatment back in 2015 and that's kind of when I started to really address that I had a drinking problem.
705.0,Provider,"So At first it accelerated but then, in time, you receive treatment which the same for him he's having now external consequences for his behavior where he will then have an opportunity to either change it or not. And so, some of the things that you told the truth about are going to be out there and that the consequences of that could be that he doesn't get is not as much time to spend unsupervised with the sun. Or the consequence of that is, you know that you do have sole custody and that maybe he does make a decision in time. That he can change that that he can go, because what i'm hearing the letters, asking him is to seek treatment. To make improvements where he's safe to be around your little one."
11236.0,Patient,yeah they're even suggesting like supervised visitation where he's going to need to have someone there well he's gonna hate me for that you know that that's gonna make things really uncomfortable in the House.
705.0,Provider,"Right, but you know just you had brought up before that that was part of the reason why you're staying in the House is because you had concerns about him being alone with your son. And then you're right on the other hand, as i'm hearing that yes, it is going to be uncomfortable to live under the same roof, and is that the best place that you can be for right now."
11236.0,Patient,"I mean. I could go to my mom's but I don't want to because my sister stays there, and she drinks almost every day and it's not a good place for me to be with my son."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11236.0,Patient,"And I mean I work in thousand oaks so like moving that far away wouldn't make any sense. I mean, I could probably get a hotel, but that would be really expensive, I mean once I get the money from the divorce I plan to buy something you know to buy a property and or or a condo or something and then I can really get a place for myself."
705.0,Provider,"Right, but right now what what would be your options, if your mom's isn't a good option, because your sister and that's right because, especially now, it will it will probably Jesse because. Now, the focus is on him so part of that that anger could be to look at you, and so, with the drinking, especially. is for you to continue to get the support that you need. So, if your if your mom's not a good option is there any where else that you and your son could be for a little while until you can gain some money. To get your own place."
11236.0,Patient,I don't know. Maybe I could find like a month to month place to rent I don't know. I really I really don't have anybody up here.
705.0,Provider,How about your a network.
11236.0,Patient,um maybe I could ask around and see if they know of places that would you know. how's my son and I.
705.0,Provider,mean nobody has a room or a mom in law suite or something.
11236.0,Patient,"Right yeah that's true. yeah, I guess, I would have to look into like moving and stuff."
705.0,Provider,"And I know that sounds like a lot, I can see your face it's like oh that's that's something i'm also hearing the other side that you have valid concerns that if you stay there, at the same household and you have the new declaration come out and you told the truth. Is that going to be too much for you to handle face to face every day."
11236.0,Patient,i'm. alone.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
11236.0,Patient,"I wouldn't end up prepared to tell him like you know. i'm sorry you're upset but. I I tried to. approach you with a 7525 arrangement and you don't want to, and so I didn't have any other option but to tell them what i'm concerned about, and this is what it is."
705.0,Provider,"he's laid hands on before. When he was under the influence he laid hands on you, before I think you said he tried to choke you."
11236.0,Patient,"He one time he I think he blacked out or I don't know if people act out, but he was really drunk. And it was."
705.0,Provider,"done that, before Jesse. Is that they could potentially not saying it well. But potentially he could go there again with this information."
11236.0,Patient,"um I feel like. My drinking played into that too. You know, because at the time. I was also struggling with drinking, I mean not as not to the extent that that he was I definitely have started to try to stop before he's even admitted to having a problem um but I was also very antagonistic very angry with my fighting you know. I would push his buttons. I think, after that happened, though. I just realized it wasn't worth fighting with him to that extreme anymore, you know, and especially going through the divorce and like having had that anxiety attack. files so don't feel like I can afford to let myself get that upset anymore, so I truly believe that. Even if he was that upset or drunk or whatever I wouldn't let it get to that point at this at this level anymore. Because I wouldn't engage you know, last time I engaged. He I mean he had been drinking the whole day for for our kids birthday party and I started drinking after everyone left you know, like at eight o'clock nine o'clock that night in this fight happened like two hours into that so. I wasn't in my right state of mind, you know to to handle that conversation in a way that would de escalate the situation I also added to it."
705.0,Provider,"Can you win if if something did start to happen, I mean you could always call 911 but to have a safety plan of what's you know, sometimes people in domestic violence they they do keep like a suitcase handy with all you know. Money or something stashed away we're in the event that they needed to they could get away."
11236.0,Patient,"I think i'll be prepared like that in case you know things get too heated if it does, if I feel like he's really upset and things are really heated then i'll just take my kid and stay at a hotel for a couple of days um. i'm not i'm not afraid of him, you know, I think that was a moment where. Emotions were so heightened and he was in the middle of his nervous breakdown because of like being in the depths of the custody battle with his daughter. And he had been drinking all day at least now when he drinks he doesn't drink at home, you know he's gone out to drink and then I smell it when he comes home and. I don't know I know this all sounds crazy, but I just I don't know how to navigate through this you know I just I really wish I didn't have to deal with any of this, I really wish I could just focus on my job and being a good mom and like. On my recovery and just getting better you know I really wish I didn't have to deal with this stupid divorce."
705.0,Provider,yeah and it's extra hard to Jesse because you're having to live there and in the same household. Where they can't feel comfortable and create a safe space for you.
11236.0,Patient,"But I know it's temporary you know, I know, once this whole thing gets sorted out with. And that's one of the forms that they sent me was like their. Request for order or something like that for spousal support and child support to start trying to get me some money. So I know I gotta do it i've just been pushing it off, you know for a couple of days, trying to think it out, because I don't want to hurt the guy I still would like for this to be peaceful as much as possible."
705.0,Provider,Right and you're not saying.
11236.0,Patient,"I think my kids should stay with me, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Right and be safe and so you're not saying that he won't ever get to see a son again you're just saying, please get the help that you need and deserve. And then, of course, that relationship with him and his son can continue to grow."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah. I know I just got to be a big girl and. And face it, because nobody's gonna do it for me if I don't. You know. So as soon as we're done talking i'm gonna go back to the office and go through that paperwork and sign it or send my edits or whatever and. just get it done."
705.0,Provider,"And one of the biggest things that you had to do Jesse was write it and and now is taking a you know you've had some days to think about it, and now writing what what edits that that you feel like. you're comfortable with."
11236.0,Patient,yeah I don't want to feel pressured. To put something on record that. Maybe I disclose to freely thinking that it was just for my attorney to know you know.
705.0,Provider,"And you have a right to to take something, and if that's not necessarily you know, sometimes you can use a word and then. A person may put their perception and put a different word like if I say i'm irritated i'm irritated but if someone changes it to furious there's a difference between a person being irritated versus furious."
11236.0,Patient,Right oh.
705.0,Provider,"A AAA there. Yes, okay."
11236.0,Patient,Okay world. Sorry.
705.0,Provider,Do you only go Jesse are you gonna be able to. I don't mind holding either.
11236.0,Patient,"yeah. I would have to bother anybody. Is that something we need like a regular consumer could just pick up somewhere. whoa. we're fishing the keys out. He said to a metal place. Thank you. Thank you so much. You just made my. Little rubber. Oh, my God. Thank you, thank you so do I have to find for anything or for good Thank you so much that was so easy Thank you."
705.0,Provider,So quick. I cannot believe you are so quick.
11236.0,Patient,"I know Tripoli, I mean I will forever be a AAA Member."
705.0,Provider,I know it's so convenient now do you have their mobile APP.
11236.0,Patient,"I don't think so, I called off of the customer service number."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, if you get a chance, or it was nice I did the mobile APP and you can track everything and you don't even have to talk to anyone."
11236.0,Patient,well.
705.0,Provider,You gotta done.
11236.0,Patient,"Yes, and I do have to miss therapy."
705.0,Provider,See you are multitasking and even in you know days that have been so trying you're still moving forward and making stuff happen.
11236.0,Patient,"yeah that's true. Thank you for that reminder. yeah so that's where i'm at with. With what's been kind of turmoil turmoil in my heart as far as like the foundation for the home that I want you know I mentioned to you, peace, you know peace. In the home um i've been thinking about like what what this could look like for a home for me and my son, you know I started thinking about condos and townhomes and like what kind of environment, I wanted to be like in there and I want there to definitely be. Like. The foundation of peace spirituality love and balance like that's what I want my I want it to feel like a sanctuary you know when I come home for me and for him or. not like this person trying to do 10 things at the same time, where where. You can be there and just be there, you know and be ourselves, and I want them to feel peace around them, you know, and I want to feel the same thing too when I want to feel security. and stability and I don't have that right now, because everything is so up in the air, but um you know I don't know if I ever mentioned this to you, but like my husband is the first man i've ever lived with he's the first man I ever trusted enough to. depend on for income, you know i've always worked and i've always paid my own rent. And even like. This boyfriend I was in three years so it's talking about either I I cannot bring myself to move on with me because I just knew it wasn't right, you know and. My browser myself, and I think, maybe because, like, I come from a divorced family my parents divorced, when I was 12 and then they both each got married and divorced again. So, like, I went through like three full divorces with these with my pants and I, and I told myself like i'm never gonna i'm never gonna go through that myself, you know and. I just want to I just don't want to hate each other and, like my mom and my dad hated each other, you know I really just. want to avoid that at all costs, because he was hurt hurt all about it, you know they talk to each other, first each other for decades, but we are prob about each other i'm saying about each other every weekend, when we were traded off, you know. When it just builds this like that negative feeling. It sucks you know, and I don't want to do that, to my son. So I think i'm like hyper attentive to what might produce that because I don't want to go through that again with my own situation you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you hope to see that that didn't happen and that wasn't your intent and you've really done everything that you could. To try to save the marriage. And at this point it hasn't led you to you know where you and him could work it out at this stage. Right, I say. Sometimes people like get to worse and then get remarried you know you know."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah but I know me and I feel like I don't think I would go back, I mean as much as it hurts right now. Once I get through this I really have doubts about ever getting married again, to be honest."
705.0,Provider,"I was going to ask to with what we're speaking about this, how about i'm just going to jump to that the APP then did you rethink the APP."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't been on it like I was before I checked it once or twice and. I almost kind of met up with this guy but he, like was kind of pushing to meet up at his house or my house and then I just didn't want to explain my situation, so I stopped. And then i'm like maybe i'm not ready to do this, I still live with my husband or my soon to be ex husband, you know."
705.0,Provider,And self some proper time.
11236.0,Patient,"yeah. I think I was trying to be open about it because he was giving me the green light to date other men and i'm like well, let me take advantage of this but. I don't really care for that right now i'm even at a place where I just don't really care for the physical intimacy at this point, you know. Even if it was just something physical with somebody I feel to hurt right now I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense because you're going through your own process and what would that be like again to allow yourself to be physical with someone else. And is that, where you are right now like, can you handle one more thing on your plate that may have some consequences, once you you go there."
11236.0,Patient,I met the brim with you know. What i've got to deal with right now.
705.0,Provider,"i'm filling it up with things then Jesse that maybe it's not right now, having someone there and having that physical you know contact with someone but make the connections more in a way of. With a are doing, I think, before you said you went out and you hung out with them after a meeting and that that was fun."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I went to meeting before I came to the Office for this meeting today and it was a nice moms meeting. With daycare so it was like at this little preschool and. Some of the moms had their babies with them and it felt really safe, you know it felt like it kind of reminded me of when I was in high school, I went to an all girls Catholic high school and there wasn't a lot of cattiness there wasn't a lot of you know. Really, I mean your typical stuff but I felt like we were surrounded by a lot of influential women who were taking care of us, you know coaches and teachers and nuns and. um there was a feeling of safety, like you could be open and emotional here you don't have to worry about what people think you know or guys making fun of you or whatever or trying to look cool because there's a guy in class or you know it felt like a slumber party all the time and. i'm starting to get that feeling again like with these women with these women a lot of these women are successful, you know they're successful women, they have. Some of them are housewives, they have multiple children or they have you know careers are really long lasting marriage is just that they drink and they decided not to you know and. They come, you know they they come to a place where. Where we all agree to be sober and we all agreed to like not trying to influence anyone. Except for what's going to help them feel better in sobriety and that's the whole purpose and to me it's like it's like church almost you know. Because it's just this like kind of sacred moment that we're all sharing to like put out our our pains and our grievances and learn from one another and support one another and. You don't get that with strangers anywhere else so immediately, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's sacred and it is to you know, putting yourself. Giving yourself permission to connect in that way. And remembering to that it's everybody is just as important as the next person sitting next to you because I think we've talked about this before, is a lot of time it's the newcomer where the old timers like hey you keep me sober i'm keeping you sober and we just keep."
11236.0,Patient,"Saying that that circle is felt when you're there. yeah so i'm making that part of my routine every day um it feels like a good social hour, you know. To just get off what I have on my chest, and a lot of these women have been through divorces too, so it feels. comforting to you know, even if they're just like I know exactly what you're going through or I know exactly how that feels you know, and I know that they know what i'm talking about you know even that is it helps like some weight being lifted."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and hearing someone talk about it in a different way too because they've had more time. You know, to heal they've had more time, you know, to think about different things and it's like nice to see that, too, because you can go hey I won't always feel this way, this is the early stages of it, this is what i'm feeling but there's also you know, going to be an end to it."
11236.0,Patient,No be Liam.
705.0,Provider,A whole new chapter.
11236.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and you know what's amazing is. I told you about the group that i'm in on Wednesdays so for the realtors Tuesday is training day and Wednesdays is accountability day and that's when like. If there was homework you bring in your homework, if you have a presentation you present your presentation it's like where you show what you've been doing with your business, and I think I told you like I got selected for like a smaller group within that group. of people that they're really putting investing into well so for our meeting yesterday. My trainer had one of the top producers in the company this woman named Donna to come and talk to us and just pretty much tell us like her story and then have us give us an opportunity to ask her questions and Donna started her story, by saying that. She started in 1987 while she was going through a divorce and she had a three year old son with her and it like just you know slap me in the face right then and there and I, my ears were just like hanging on to every word and she said, you know. I keep laughing to myself, because she said um you know in 1987 I was going through divorce like I didn't have anybody out here my husband and I had just moved out here and I didn't have family or anyone, you know anyone. And she said, but um you know we're getting a divorce and she goes, you know he cheated on me like what an idiot but whatever I don't care she says we're friends now. But he's so stupid for doing that because last year i'm raked in like 30 to $35 million I don't know somewhere in between there and, like my jaw dropped right because this woman. You know and she's like I was a single mom and I, you know I I work like I had to do it because I had to do it because there was nobody else that was going to support she's like. Do you know even with my husband and she's like and he was an attorney she said I ended up years later, buying him a house, because he couldn't afford to buy his own house, but I bought him a House just that my son could be down the street from me. she's like and he was. he's an attorney can you believe that anyway, you know and i'm just like. How powerful you know this woman coming out of this rough situation. Is a multi millionaire I mean raking in 30 to $35 million a year. Her son's grown up now, but she was at a point where she like could buy a home for her ex husband, just so that her son could be close and not think about it, you know, and I mean would that woman have become that woman if she was still married to that man."
705.0,Provider,and gone through the struggles.
11236.0,Patient,"right because she said she worked like she had to work because she was she had to work she said she she was the only one, putting. food on the table and now it's just her and her son and she was a single mom she says, the thing that she you know not that she has a lot of regrets, but that she would have changed. If she could do it again with spend more family time because she was just hustling so hard that kid just ended up in daycare. And it's her one and only son that she didn't feel like she really raised and so he sometimes he's like resentful towards her about it, but then she's like do you like your House, do you like your car you."
705.0,Provider,know you went to and all.
11236.0,Patient,"I wanted to have a that you grew up in you know. Like so at the same time she's like I don't think I would have changed anything I would have still had to do what I had to do but she's like but I I I worked with a hunger, because I had to provide. And, and she said, and before that I was a waitress you know she said, I was a waitress in a mom and you know, even when I was a waitress I was the best way trust they had because i've always been competitive but i'm thinking like you know. She wouldn't have thought about going into real estate if she hadn't gotten divorced, she would have been probably happy being a waitress and struggling the rest of her life right to now be 30 years later this multi million dollar real estate agent, who could retire if she wanted to. Just a completely different lifestyle and then you know it says a lot that she ended up having to buy a house for her husband, because even though he was an attorney it didn't seem like he flourished anymore, you know. And I think I hit that wall with Milton to my husband, where I told you like, he pretty much said he just was happy being stagnant and I know that's not. Who I am or I could be happy being you know you might be happy like making six figures and that's fine and that's not that's a lot of money. You know, but I want to have total financial freedom, I want to, I want to make so much money that I can. use it to bless others like I really want to do something major in my parents home country and and start up an institution there it's been like a dream of mine for years and. it's like my driving force, because I feel like that's the legacy, I want to leave behind you know and i'm in a position where I could make a lot of money and I don't have to be like an evil greedy person, you know."
705.0,Provider,"And all that could could happen, it could become reality and so you're putting yourself Taking all these big steps like i'm sure it gets wearing to go to all these different. meetings and to do all your homework and all that but it's Nice that you keep time and time again having these people come into your life that are sharing with you that hey look I get it, I did it too here's my story and then you're able to take from that."
11236.0,Patient,"Right, I mean it just left me inspired because I said. If this woman could make you know now in 2020 $35 million a year, I mean, and she was talking about how she was actually kind of lazy about it, you know it's just because she had a great personality and people loved her energy, so they just kept referring. Her to others, but she was like, but most of the time I just sit on the couch and I save my energy for that one hour that i'm going to be in front of the client, you know and. i'm like wow. I couldn't be more opposite as far as hard working, but you know if she could do it like that, at that pace, I mean what could I accomplish you know and. I really want to see that I really want to see that and and I feel like maybe. i'm starting to accept where my life is coming like I didn't want to be a divorce person, but. Here we are, and maybe that's what I need to catapult myself to the next level, you know is. splitting up and. Getting my own place and finding my peace of mind and."
705.0,Provider,"i'm building your own House like you said you already know, the foundation, and these things weren't that important maybe before. Because you had this whole other like chapter of your life, where now you're like wait a minute I see that there is or. I hear a lot of more like independence and then something you know even more humanitarian wise where you want to help others and be more global about it. And that all those can come true, because this other chapter, you were happy at the time, but it kept you in a certain like here's here's where you can maybe make some of your you know efforts known but."
11236.0,Patient,Right right right right. yeah so i'm growing then.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, exactly, and you know, last time what you were talking about to the surrendering you've been able to surrender Jesse. Jesse which I think is great like surrendering to the process and I think that's awesome and then you're here people out and all that you're still the one in the driver's seat, though without any without you none of that other stuff can happen. And sometimes when people say well i'm surrendering to the process i'm going to do nothing but it's everybody else. Well, now you're the one driving it wouldn't have happened without you."
11236.0,Patient,I guess that's true too i'm making this stuff happened in my life.
705.0,Provider,"You made the decision to be more open to the process, which is why you are open, while you were doing all these things, and so you can still surrender to the process and be in charge and be in control."
11236.0,Patient,"You just blew my mind Valerie because that is so real and I never thought about it like that, Sir, because you think surrendering to the process like you're in a wave and the wave is just kind of taking you, you know in life is happening at you. Yes, but you're saying it's not like that in surrendering i'm taking control."
705.0,Provider,"yeah to me you're surrendering you're the one driving and you're saying look i'm making the decision. To surrender to the process and that doesn't mean like you know you're talking before kind of whoever says, whatever i'm just going to do it because i've tried it my way it's like i'm taking that and listening, but i'm still in control of it. So well i'm the one yeah and it's empowering because even what surrendering it's still you behind it."
11236.0,Patient,"Right i'm making the choice to surrender to to quiet my ego to be led. Yes, yeah. wow. Thank you."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's so what smart recovery hasn't it mixed in with a and it's a different way to kind of combine the two, but again it's up to you to assess which concept. So to me it's the two colliding where it's like."
11236.0,Patient,"Right right well because I mean the way I see it, is. i'm not trying to. Try this. For me. This process i'm controlling. A completely different environment."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you're doing the action step of surrendering even that within itself is all back to you. Right now you're going through a lot Jesse and i'm glad that I can be here and be the sounding board and again you're open and your your openness and your willingness, is what brings this all about. yeah. Absolutely and i'm so glad that you got your keys back and you made that all work for you. You got it all right we're good to see you Jesse take care, and I will see you next Thursday at two o'clock. Okay. Oh, let me check then Jesse i'm so sorry i'm late let's see. We jump to the second. yeah is that going to be okay cuz you're right I don't think we'll be meeting on thanksgiving hope, hopefully, you know you'll be chowing down on something I know i'll be showing down, maybe go for a hike."
11236.0,Patient,"To see my family for thanksgiving, even though I think that's gonna make some people really upset. or telling me. That, I should just put my sobriety in front of everything and people can be triggered especially around comedy so."
705.0,Provider,"You you, you can take time now it's like thanksgiving okay you missed one it's like I did I wanted to take care of myself and again you're the driver."
11236.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'll just have to be firm, because my sister is coming in from out of town and she saw her if I want because. They want to see the baby and. My other sister who stay with my mom she drinks and every day so like I really don't want to see her you know, and I don't want to make it like ooh i'm not coming I don't want to see her, but I know i'm going to hear it, because maybe."
705.0,Provider,"hey you know video works it's like hey you know and tell me i'll do it you'll do it the thanksgiving video and make that happen, but you're just going to chill and you've been doing a lot of work and stuff and. And I think I see that some of your healthier relatives will understand that, right now, you just need a break. You will figure it out. Absolutely so December, we want to see one another, until this well i'll See you in group what am I talking about."
11236.0,Patient,"actually called me two days ago we had like an hour conversation on the phone. So i'm going to try to make it back and realize people noticed when I was gone, but she was like i'm calm and i'm still happy."
