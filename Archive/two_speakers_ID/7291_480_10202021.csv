480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7291.0,Patient,"They were still days missing, I can feel it, you know I can you know any mean i'm fine now, obviously, because the days that were missed by that by the mail. You know any mean.

7291.0,Patient,"It would take you know the weekends had to be by this by this time, while it still has to be by that, but the month's worth is only one time so it's only one day, it has to meet before for for the plane to work. And sometimes it wouldn't do that holy shit wow what a what a running around but um. yeah I know that the new thing that she tried me on. I tried it for the first few days i've already forgotten the name that it's here somewhere I can't remember it was something new, with the P, I think. Probably, I think, so I tried it for a couple of days. On my God to two or three times and. bring this one. yeah just wasn't for me just made me feel weird."
480.0,Provider,Saying.
7291.0,Patient,"Maybe it was like food or something I don't know it just made me feel weird again I don't know. they're all the same, like all them things might be a different name but it's the same category. I don't know."
480.0,Provider,"Well, I wonder why you get nausea with so many of them because that's not a common side effect. that's really strange."
7291.0,Patient,"boy that's what I was thinking, but I don't know I just think. I don't know I just think it gets me so wound up in a different way that. it's making me do that I haven't figured it out i've. tried it a couple of days, maybe i'll give another couple of days and see if something different, you know, but I doubt it but i'll try it, you know i'm getting like I said i'd try, you know anything until they can figure out, you know, the solution. I don't know I got to make another personal appointment for this month, because you got to make one every month for the requirements so."
480.0,Provider,"Well, I can tell you mean."
7291.0,Patient,"The doctor yes. But I know. Jesus I just don't think there's any real. I don't know. You know, changing groups I can't I can't do for the times because right now the seasons still. I was gonna text you messaged you about that, but we had appointment coming today, so I was like well i'll ask you now, you know talk about it with you now."

You know, in our interactions with people during the week and, just like. Like stuff like that i'm trying to like refresh my memory by just stuff like that pretty much that made you know, made it a harsh week."
480.0,Provider,"So interact, did you run into like anybody significant."
7291.0,Patient,"yeah a couple of people from the can the can story, but. You know how that turned out, and how much you know I definitely don't dwell on this stuff it's always in the back of my mind solely."
480.0,Provider,and
7291.0,Patient,"You know, when I tell you i'm having a tremendous day and I don't be like well I ran over a little kid with my truck or something by accident, you know if I don't tell you straight up tell you that that's what i'm probably referring to."
480.0,Provider,yeah just seeing the awkwardness.
7291.0,Patient,That and just you know. Just you know. Everything you know just.
480.0,Provider,harder on the island in the winter.
7291.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely. yeah definitely um. it's you know you only get like get out to haul once a week and you know you're just going insane there's a lot of money. going out and just you know wish things were a lot better. keep trying, but you know things don't really happen overnight, I know that you know I know all that stuff but like it's still like to well sometimes you know."
480.0,Provider,"Never my mind, you know, on like. You should be farther along I need like what are we talking about specifically."
7291.0,Patient,"Like like yeah like trying to get ahead more. yeah i'm just you know not. You know I don't know try to find my friends that are not pieces of crap like you just this is just stuff like that song they. Can notch 10 for me, you know. People I don't know people would rather data pebble than try to date me I shit you not like. don't try to pick on people, but some people are like just not what this person should be day and that's the same. Say and they just dating room just because there's no one else laugh, just like i'm not dumb yes, I might you know be like think a little too much on something, but I don't do that I think about it hard i'm like no i'm right like if this denied out in this. way this way like you know I just I don't know too much thinking my brain can't just like settle down."
480.0,Provider,Did you have an experience. With like asking someone on a date and they rejected you.
7291.0,Patient,Know nope nope I haven't really found anybody to really ask.
480.0,Provider,that's unfortunate do.
7291.0,Patient,"We yeah. yo see everyone knows me, you know he goes he used to do this, all my parents my uncles and my grandmother's don't really think much of it, Mr g's he doesn't have 50 million hundred million dollars oh geez you know. it's like they'd rather data thousand pat thousand pound fat guy. Like I, you should see it like if you could see be like yeah you're right. Like i'm not just thinking something crazy and then like i'm just crazy, you know."
480.0,Provider,there's actual evidence.
7291.0,Patient,"right for sure. But scourging you know it's good for them, you know they're happy they're happy, but I just think it's ludicrous sometimes but yeah I don't know you know just. Oh, another incident oh like see when people like have an accident out here are like. Like they need to get surgery or like shit it's going down because we only have like a medical Center and they can treat a little worm it doesn't you know there's no surgery rooms, or whatever solely as a car accident or anything like that or an overdose have to go to the mainland. And that's what. that's what happened last night with a resident out here one resident um and I had like gone to the bathroom and. Then I was going to go to bed, and I get this message on my phone hey is your boat is your how's your boat and I was like Oh, we should be good at 2am Oh, can I have a ride over my girlfriend and overdose blah blah blah. I know I know I doing none of that not part of any of that no things."
480.0,Provider,Like for you good boundaries.
7291.0,Patient,"Like it just I feel like I feel bad for him, you know you something happens regardless, I mean I know this sounds like oh gee she shouldn't feel that way blah blah blah but. I know if everybody if we're not writing best friends. You know I still like you know I know that, personally, you know it's too bad for them, but I just can't be a part of it, like if someone or if your girlfriend overdosed. Then, your high you might have stuff on you, I don't want to be a part of that we know are not going to give you a ride i'm sorry, though, like, I hope you find over I know i'm not like a shitty person, you know. yeah so."
480.0,Provider,"But also like you said you have to know your limits, and you have to know that it's perfectly fine to say no to people and have boundaries and. That doesn't mean you're not a good person I mean it was 2am someone was asking to use your boat, those are things that even if take the other people out of this scenario, and you knowing things about them that's enough of a reason to say no."
7291.0,Patient,"you're right, you know I try I don't judge people you know for sure, but. Those boundaries it's might seem like I am but i'm done i'm not you know I i'm not just to get new people if they want to do bad stuff then do bad stuff you know that's how it was for me. I know I was doing it, you know people tell me all is bad, you know I mean something you can do you know just you know. No it's just. Interestingly."
480.0,Provider,sounds like it sounds like. A box of high stress.
7291.0,Patient,"Yes, that's for sure, but gotten a few projects done for the winner. Oh, putting stuff away and had a few things in the garage I need to come in here into the House and just been busy you know. i'm here i'm in the House alone, you know, no, no friends, no, you know no girlfriend did none of that like. Just it's hard to go out and like there ain't nobody like oh here changed my number i've hated and sucked every freaking girl, I can think of that what he or not every single one but. just about every single one. And i'm own read or what do you want to sleep well. No, no, they don't want to talk saying and saying like that. is just."
480.0,Provider,So frustrating.
7291.0,Patient,"very, very frustrating, you know, like I said don't try to dwell on it, if they're happy with somebody else, or they might have the same goal and go. hang out with that moron go hang out with this morning on and that's that's good for them, you know i'm not being judged on being judgmental you know they can hang out with whoever the hell, they want, they have to hate me that's the thing it just sucks like I can't find any body."
480.0,Provider,that's what. are made for connection and loneliness sucks. yeah I have people around.
7291.0,Patient,"And it's just very it's a very small island very, very. Hard so I mean you know this."
480.0,Provider,girl over from the mainland.
7291.0,Patient,"I hope I don't know anybody over there. yeah. Oh i've almost like cut the courage to like ask somebody for their number, but I height they didn't work there anymore, and when I got funny build up the courage, I was like oh i'm gonna ask him this time they didn't work there anymore. yeah he does. I don't know I think it's punishment for my bad deeds because, like my at my last girlfriend. was around I was like still kind of doing a little bit of drugs solely I think it's just punishment, I think it's hard punishment and i'm building its building me up for the one that's going to come by and hopefully the one that's going to come by will be the last one. yeah right yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Oh what's. Nice is that, like a dream, you want to get married have a family eventually."
7291.0,Patient,"Yes, because I like this is like the perfect time I don't really drink much anymore of like perfect time you know I kind of feel bad for my ex even though she was like a headcase and play drama games. I wasn't no perfect angel myself. But she just didn't get it like she sat down and talked to me and I just was like let me get it out of my system, I guarantee if you're just was very here, let me get out of my system i'll be done with drugs within a month or less. More around that time. I know that sounds bad sounds you know, whatever or you're in that because literally if she left, I was like another like couple weeks bang done with that. was on looking for programs like it was like the darndest thing but. Because like half the time she was like pushing me so much like trying to get me not to do and pushing me so much like I couldn't stop so late, when she left oh geez you know. I was working all the time and really care, you know cared then finally just like got to the point where I hadn't done it and so long, I just got this weird sickness from it solely can never do it again I got so weirded out by it."
480.0,Provider,You got a weird sickness from the drugs are stopping the drugs.
7291.0,Patient,"The last time just doing them like from not doing them I just got this like weird like weirded out sickness. Interesting that's just so sick and display grossed me out to Bob and beyond, like oh my yeah not fun to talk about for sure cuz i'm like starting to think about this oh my God okay something out."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I want to ask how long were you with the girl."
7291.0,Patient,On two or three years.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, do you guys are now."
7291.0,Patient,"No, no, and don't think day about her for sure, but it just ruined me for a while she played some games, but. yeah you know I could go on all day about that that's another day to definitely talk about, but you know I don't go out too much over this stuff it just. You know, might have a picture up on my wall in the back of my head somewhere, but. I know. I get everything straightened around I might you know actually. Be you know all right. Here you know might not have a tremendous week, but until then. You know standby and until. till I get to where you know i'm aware, I need to be i'm almost there."
480.0,Provider,yeah I.
7291.0,Patient,mean the keyboard in. I don't know.
480.0,Provider,can't really switch we may never.
7291.0,Patient,"know all the same, you know same ever was you know, like I I get a get a few minutes, but sometimes my just my mind can't stop going, you know, especially if stuff doesn't work that kind of adds to it."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
7291.0,Patient,"You know how I am I don't like to be like oh. You know, like screaming yo and that people I just i'm just being patient, and I feel like to patient is given them their own I brought wrong idea but. You know, on the six o'clock group and you got to change this groups to be able to and I don't know where that is in the you know where that's headed to. Because I can't I can't switch groups yeah no definitely not right now will be for another two or three months. But."
480.0,Provider,"So our next appointment. is on the third Isaias coming back the first here's what i'm thinking I don't even know if it's going to be possible, so don't get excited yet. But when he comes back to work next month, I was thinking, I can email all of the care providers so like chantelle manny because that's your group right."
7291.0,Patient,Those do I am me.
480.0,Provider,"and see if you did your monthly appointments with Isaiah if he'd be willing to write that script for you. Month like instead of meeting with chantel once a month because chantelle will see you in group. And so, if you did your medical appointments with Isaiah and see this is why I don't even know if this is possible, I have to run it by bright heart and see if they're willing to do."
7291.0,Patient,That yeah.
480.0,Provider,"That was my initial thinking is, if you could do a once a month follow up with Isaiah instead of chantel then he could write the xanax prescription."
7291.0,Patient,"And and just you know that and the tech just stays where it is nothing, no more, nothing less. yeah just. Then i'd be fine doing that and."
480.0,Provider,"The only thing is, I don't have to ask, like the medical director, because the medical director is on this big kick now where so there's a bunch of research that saying that tech and xanax together is bad bad bad."
7291.0,Patient,"So only. Only as you like do too much of anything I Jesus people over here. years and they were fine fine as a whistle I mean anything if it goes with anything if you take too much of it is common cause and effect that that's just that's just ludicrous but. You know, like I said, you know we don't want to that's why you don't want to come out saying stuff like that you want to just you know slow, as can because. But I just I don't know then i'd be stuck in the mud, because I known nothing else is just I mean i'm not saying that i'm just feel like there i've tried a million zillion. And I haven't gone anywhere. So I just feel like i'd be stuck in the mud At that rate, but I do extra appointments I literally like. That one mistake, where I ordered my tech, you know when they were weekly order don't wrong and made that mistake that was literally only time I literally was order mistake it wasn't a do mistake it was an order mistake literally like I would. You know, knowing the people that's half asleep half that you know i'm."
480.0,Provider,"know and. Looking at your chart It shows that you've been compliant you've been engaged like there's no issues going on as far as like. Being able to prescribe that to you specifically what i'm saying is, I have to just clear it with everyone, because this is cards and because we're. Like kind of at the mercy of the medical director, if he makes a policy that you can't prescribe both of those together anymore, and then we just have to go with it. right but that's i'm definitely going to ask, though, so make sure our next appointment, you ask me about that because I don't want. i'd rather meet with you send the email then. Because Isaiah is coming back the first, which is a Monday so he's going to have like a bazillion emails to catch up on I don't want him to miss it so i'd rather send it like Wednesday night or Thursday morning after he's been back at work, a few days."
7291.0,Patient,"You know what I mean meaning, then the next time we have a session."
480.0,Provider,"Right, so the next time we have a session is on the third so then. After our session that's when i'll email everybody, but i'm going to before before this session i'm going to clear it with. The supervisor and medical director and then, if that's possible then i'll email everyone after our next session and say they gave us the go ahead, would you guys be willing to do this."
7291.0,Patient,"Okay yeah i've almost like thought too bad like. couldn't go through another length website, for that is to make it easier, but. You know that's probably."
480.0,Provider,"Some people do, though. that's The thing is, some people do like if you can find a different prescriber just for xanax that doesn't mind that you're on some you tech that's, the issue is a lot of people won't prescribe xanax if they see you're on savita. Which is silly, but if you can find someone in maine just described xanax to you that would be the easiest route, I think."
7291.0,Patient,And then we'll just have to be like hey I got prescribed this by different doctors at all right.
480.0,Provider,"Because you want. We have a ton of people that do that, like so I most of my groups are North Carolina groups, the north Carolina doctor. Does not prescribe any sort of antidepressants anti anxiety, so all of our North Carolina people they have bright heart for some new tech and then anything else they're medicated for is an outside provider. You can totally do that you just have to let them know. you're on."
7291.0,Patient,"All right, well."
480.0,Provider,You want to try to find a job. That would not be I mean it's not frowned upon by any means.
7291.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean they'll look into that but for now we'll go with it because i'd rather do everything in. One circle and. i'd rather have their approval rate off and try to get stuck in them and being the MOD with with everyone. that's good that kept South Carolina like people aren't just stuck in the mud like there's maybe a way. For the good people you know all sudden the bad people don't need to know about that. Right. that's for sure that's for sure. there's like there's a couple of people that like I understand all these regulations rules, you know it makes sense for sure. But it's just like you know, after a while if they're just still the steam and they're still like all this is going on and this won't work, and this is, I earned my mouth, and this is doing this, then you just got to be like don't say anything do your groups, maybe do an extra one. yeah, for you know that, and here you know we don't do this because of this, you know that makes total sense and I just because it's such a good a good people you know."
480.0,Provider,"It really does and that's I mean that's across the board, you know what I mean like it sucks that I can easily get prescriptions for things that I could medically use because of addiction history, you know what I mean like. it's something that unfortunately even not addicts have to deal with that, but especially as addicts we it's just one of those lifelong things where it's like well i'm at the mercy of whoever's prescribing because it's their stigma against addiction, you know."
7291.0,Patient,"gotcha yeah no it's no I just I don't. want to get kicked off I don't want to. Like that was like I was like really me not like oh i'd go to drugs or anything, and I would ruin me like just like mentally i'm like ah, I don't know I couldn't go back to buying them off the street at that's expensive."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well you picked out. Definitely not. People out. So. All right, well, I do have another appointment, but I will see you in two weeks, and hopefully i'll have some good news."
7291.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah i'll. send you a message and just say, you know how i'm doing maybe are saying you know what's up or something maybe during the two weeks or whatever just. Maybe a bad day if I have a bad day or somebody have a."
480.0,Provider,"Bad day email me for sure. Because that's part of the thing is you don't ever have to be alone that's mine guaranteed to you, whatever bad stuff you're walking through you don't have to walk through it alone, you can always email me i'm here i'm your support system."
7291.0,Patient,awesome Thank you.
480.0,Provider,"yeah, of course."
7291.0,Patient,"yeah no that's be cool to actually get. I feel like i'm halfway there. I feel like i've climbed half the middle, but you know i'd like to make it to the top and catch a break for a second and. You know just keep working towards you know working. towards that point. So."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and you will that's The thing is, like it's already so think about your life, six months ago. Things are gonna be a lot different and a lot better yeah. So you're getting there it's just it's not fun when you're in the middle of it, you know what I mean like things are gradually getting better but it's it's still hard work so."
7291.0,Patient,"you're gonna you're gonna take it slowly too. Because if you go too fast and don't work in. It it goes backwards for me if I go too fast, but. Anyway, thank you for today and i'll See you in a couple of weeks."
480.0,Provider,sounds good enjoy your week.
7291.0,Patient,"All right, you too, thank you. bye bye."
