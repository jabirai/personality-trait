They weren't letting me juggle or anything, and I was just kind of like getting tired of it or whatever, so I actually had stopped my meds for a week, but then. I went back on them and then I got everything to work into the way I wanted it to be."

16216.0,Patient,No i'm sorry it's this. is completely ass backwards and everything is like ridiculous so.
741.0,Provider,"Well, I kind of figured that it was that the Inpatient program that you're in that was creating issue yeah for the situation so um. And you know because, like here in Texas you can't be in two programs at once. Right oh. i'm so I was like well, maybe that's what happened."
16216.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"All right, well i'm glad to see I mean like you were discharged I got a notification so like I shredded every."

16216.0,Patient,Only signed for 60 days.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
16216.0,Patient,"Because i'm not in house anymore i'm in West care. When I have left quest house is when I was able to talk to you, and then, when I got in the West Coast time for 60 days, because i'll be 90 days clean this week."
741.0,Provider,"awesome that's a good thing that's a good thing okay so you've only got a call a week or two more of where you're at is that what you're saying. yeah Okay, so are you starting to look for a sober living environment."
16216.0,Patient,"I am signed up for sober living. There trying to get me to do 90 days i'm not doing 90 days here, but I found a loophole where i'm able to do outpatient. But a situation that happened, where I had tasted my mom and I told her that I do outpatient while i'm waiting sober living and she kind of told me well, good luck with that she goes I can't live with you and. I family's been like left and right on each other and I had talked to my sister. And I had hoped, Europe was one of my friends and like they're like all in love or whatever, so he had moved in with her, but he has an apartment still and his leases stuff till March, so he actually need somebody there, so when I get out i'm going to go stay over there until March. Okay i'm kind of in the bind if I even need to go to sober living now because, like, I was trying to do it for the place to stay, but as soon as I get out i'm getting a job and then i'm going to start stacking up so it's. By no it's in the middle."
741.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and so what kind of things have you learned where you're at."
16216.0,Patient,i'm narcissistic.
741.0,Provider,Okay. What.
16216.0,Patient,hmm.
741.0,Provider,What addict isn't.
16216.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"We don't think about anybody, but ourselves, and we don't care, who we run over."
16216.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,Is that not a definition of a narcissist.
16216.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,So how he's on the now hi.
16216.0,Patient,"i've always been in denial, but um. yeah I counselor gives me these personal packets that I have to do and me going through them and trying to be true with myself that I realized that I actually am."
741.0,Provider,"I they. Actually, are in a lot of denial. yeah yeah okay."
16216.0,Patient,"And then, other than that, like i've just been working on my patients my anger because there's a lot of. A lot of weird weirdos you're in a meeting conniving situations going on, which I can't stand but. My first two weeks, I was like wanting to leave and leave them leave, but then I switched room when I got these two guys that I that I stay with their like really cool and they keep me humble and keep me on the right track."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16216.0,Patient,"They there's a lot of like extra little things here that are unnecessary for me, but I understand why there's other people, because they come off the streets or they're homeless, the stuff so like. You know, like, I have a job in the mornings, I do maintenance and landscaping and then my classes, a lot of it's been the anger management and like self awareness and stuff like that."
741.0,Provider,But that's.
16216.0,Patient,What it is and then i'm actually today there's a fatherhood program that's starting i'm trying to start that today.
741.0,Provider,"Okay okay. All right. Alright, so it sounds like it's been a beneficial experience for."
16216.0,Patient,You 6040.
741.0,Provider,"yeah it's probably more beneficial than what you want it, but. yeah you know that's okay that's okay."
16216.0,Patient,"Like once again like you come to these places meeting help but it's for like control, you know."
741.0,Provider,"Well, it feels that way. yeah and a lot of it feels like they're just trying to control you, but what happens is. we're so out of control, typically when we start to get clean that yeah it feels I mean we're used to doing what we want, when we want and we don't care, who else gets in the way. And that's. And that. In order to break us of that kind of behavior they have to set limits. And we are not we don't take kindly to limit. yeah I mean we we run through life busting down any limits that are set for us. I mean stop and think about it, how many times, did you bust through the limits that your mom's tried to set for you growing up. You know I think I don't know about you, but I was a wild child. My parents would. would make rules and set limits, and I say i'll show you and i'm. doing what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it, you know and. delay delayed gratification was not something that I was in in a custom to experiencing. So I mean. yeah we. And a lot of times our behavior. that we think is not toxic. It was really very, very toxic and very. very much an affront to somebody else. And you know I mean. I don't know about you, but I did some really mean stuff to some people that I was in a relationship with not necessarily that I was intentionally being mean but. Because I was being me and doing what I wanted to do."
16216.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I was very hurtful so. Now we don't even know how to we don't know how to relate to people we don't know how to I mean we think we do. We think we got it all together, but more often than not, we don't."
16216.0,Patient,"yeah I was trying to pretend like I do, but I realized that I don't."
741.0,Provider,"that's a facade that's that is number one. Is a protective measure, so that nobody else knows that you're scared. You know um."
16216.0,Patient,"I do, that a lot."
741.0,Provider,And and that's. it's hard to find people that you trust and not. to let that facade down to let that mask come off. Some of it has to do with the fact that we've been burned before. Somewhere in our past we've been burnt and we've been burnt bad. But. Part of it is purely and simply out of fear of not wanting people to know that. We have any weaknesses.
16216.0,Patient,"and actually in my packets. i've realized like i'm not one to give people second chances at all, either so i've actually been. Trying to work on taking that situation."
741.0,Provider,"yeah and resentment and grudges I real solid offenders for us. And they'll get us they'll get us wasted. If we carry a grudge. Or we refuse to let go of a resentment and forgive somebody they'll get messed it myself every time. I had a lot of resentment toward my mom and. Was. A struggle for me, but um I figured out that. I will time I relapse was because I was hanging on to a good job, I was hanging on to that resentment for my mom. And it was hurting me not her. So. And that's The other thing that that's the thing about resentments and holding grudges it's like drinking poison and expecting the other person to croak. It doesn't work that way i'm the only one to get to it. And so what kind of. skills have you employed to. to let go of that hurt that resentment that grudge."
16216.0,Patient,um i've been trying to let the little things go.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
16216.0,Patient,I tend to like it's fun to start like if you know what I mean if I see it.
741.0,Provider,yeah.
16216.0,Patient,i'm just like it so.
741.0,Provider,"you're you're you're you're taking you're taking score. As all the little stuff. Right right. yeah um. Okay, so how are you letting go of that little stuff. What are you doing."
16216.0,Patient,Here there's a lot of little things that are always happening that you just have to like not sweat you know.
741.0,Provider,Right. And a long run How important is it.
16216.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Do you assess that like.
16216.0,Patient,"an alarm right and also like i'm a very good even person so like, for instance. My room guy like Tony sneakers together day and like we knew was you know what I mean and that just i'm so mad you know I want to just tear it up and then I know that he. Has the same counselors me and my counselors trying to get him to go into business city to play basketball, and my sister works for fresno city and she's been friends with the sports director and I was going to make it to where he never even touched for having me. I don't know I had a little pop in my head that was like you shouldn't do that, like it's not it's whatever you know."
741.0,Provider,The by.
16216.0,Patient,"loss from let it go, then I should let it go to."
741.0,Provider,Right well and the other part of it is. who made you God.
16216.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,Who are you to judge.
16216.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,I mean seriously um you probably do some things that are just as offensive to other people. Maybe not you know I mean not stealing but you understand what i'm saying.
16216.0,Patient,Like wanting to break somebody down.
741.0,Provider,"Right and okay so. What if somebody was all of a sudden made God and decided to punish you that way. For your behavior. Right yeah I mean really a lot of times when I get into those kinds of situations and i'm hanging on to stuff. I really do have to go back to the golden rule, how would I want to be treated. If I made a mistake, do I want you to hang it over my head, from now until close comes back or do I want you to forgive me. And let me move past my mistake. And if that's something that I want, then. wouldn't the other person wants it also and deserve it just as much as I do."
16216.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. To an extent, yes."
741.0,Provider,I mean seriously. We all make mistakes we do stuff we know we should not do. We do things. On.
16216.0,Patient,"At the same time like this whole entire place knows who that one person isn't who's doing it all the time to everybody, and you know I feel like."
741.0,Provider,For somebody and then. As time for somebody in the on the staff to confront the person.
16216.0,Patient,yeah and it doesn't happen.
741.0,Provider,"Well then, maybe you need to ask them does this do it, they will ask the staff or you're waiting for us to confront the person."
16216.0,Patient,"Right that's what I kind of feel like, but then like."
741.0,Provider,"Well, if that's the case."
16216.0,Patient,Do that we're doing something wrong.
741.0,Provider,Now that's why I say you asked. The staff. Are y'all waiting for us to confront this person on their behavior. Because a lot of times and treatment. They allow. The Community to confront people's behavior because it's more impactful. If a counselor just.
16216.0,Patient,and see how we react.
741.0,Provider,As a counselor. confront your behavior. You go yeah yeah yeah yeah. But if you have multiple people. In your community that you are residing with confront you on your behavior on the same behavior. Are you more likely to take into consideration that multiple people are consenting you on that same thing than one counselor. doesn't have a greater impact on you. What. You went bye bye. You know I still frozen.
16216.0,Patient,"I have to tell you, if I get clicked off. On but, like the data out here is horrible to and like we have four wife buys and they don't give us the passwords either."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
16216.0,Patient,"Well, I like that, like they know I have this therapy they know I have these girls of my doctor and they still just."
741.0,Provider,"yeah well because because they they feel like their program is enough. And I mean I understand their point of view I don't agree with that, but. They feel like their program is enough, and you shouldn't need any any other Program."
16216.0,Patient,"Right, but then you know it's like okay."
741.0,Provider,But at the same time they're not giving you the meds right.
16216.0,Patient,right if I was to come in here without the meds they wouldn't let me have them they wouldn't get them for me.
741.0,Provider,Right so it's.
16216.0,Patient,it's all it's always it's always substandard.
741.0,Provider,"And it's well it. Yes, that the program that you're in physically as not medication assisted therapy. which is what we provide."
16216.0,Patient,"To be honest, i'm I want to do this fatherhood Program. And it has to go around my schedule so i've been taking consideration today if they don't let me do the fatherhood program i'm leaving today i'm going to leave because."
741.0,Provider,I have you made that decision.
16216.0,Patient,"Because my father, the father program is important to me and my kids are important, and this is supposed to fit around my schedule and nothing ever does i've been kicked off of my meds my groups, my therapies everything just because of what they want us them them them and. My whole thing for me was is i'm not here on parole i'm not here on probation I don't need the certificate to show somebody to be like hey you know i'm doing good like I did this for myself."
741.0,Provider,So right.
16216.0,Patient,"And the whole thing was you know 90 days and to have sobriety and like I. still working on it, but I have 90 days you know so. i'm right, I mean I hopefully I get it, I want to stay, I want to prove to myself that and but if they do that I just i'm over it."
741.0,Provider,"Okay well if that's something that happens, there is a backup plan Okay, I have. I do have a. Some information that we can work through on on. Basically it's applying the 12 steps to raising and disciplining and. encouraging growth in children it's how you handle your relationship Okay, but it's based on the 12 steps and. So I mean that's an option A lot of the information that that I have. is based on 12 step recovery. Just because. It works for most people it doesn't work for everybody. and So you know you and you have to you have to take some of it, you know and not some of you got to take what you can use and so on, about your business, what do you can't use that piece, you know."
16216.0,Patient,"Well i'm also able to do the program outside of here because it's going to be a six week program so i'm here for three weeks and then i'll be doing it three weeks outside of here so either way like i'm doing it, but."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
16216.0,Patient,I don't I don't want to let them stop me from doing.
741.0,Provider,Right exactly and I understand that i'm. So. I don't wanna I don't want to give you a bunch of stuff to do right now they're giving you plenty.
16216.0,Patient,"Oh man, I have like seven packets I work every day, I have three classes, a day and then there's a night, and then we have wrap ups and every schedule."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. Okay, in our system, you are listed as a suicide risk."
16216.0,Patient,yeah I know.
741.0,Provider,"Okay what's me is, I have to have a safety plan for you. And so what i'm gonna do here as i'm as long as you don't have to go away real fast. I want to go ahead and get the safety plan in. In place right."
16216.0,Patient,"And if I end up leaving which i'm most likely not but if I do you know that will make it more convenient for you and I, and for Dr regale and me."
741.0,Provider,You know what I mean because they're always oh yeah.
16216.0,Patient,"Our stuff so it's not it's not like i'm going anywhere, and the only reason why I haven't talked to you is because of this place."
741.0,Provider,Right I figured that I figured that the reason that you are discharged was because of your current facility. I mean I don't know how that happened. I don't know who said you were discharged that's I haven't even I decided not to go in and stir up crap. But. um I mean because all of a sudden. I don't know I it was just it was very strange and I wonder if somebody from your current program called and said discharged him because he's already in our program you know.
16216.0,Patient,"No, I think what happened was his own. I got frustrated and then I wasn't meeting the requirements to speak with Dr Rudolph. And then I was already tapering on my meds So then, at one point I just said bucket and I stopped taking them for a week and then Dr regale had emailed me and I told her that I had to tapering in that I don't want to be on them anymore and it's affecting both sides and. It was either I get trouble over there i'm in trouble here and I wasn't trying to get in trouble here, so I just let it go so she had I think discharged me and. And I got into it with my counselor and some people over here about the situation, and then they were getting mad because I was tapering and they wanted me to go back and it was creating frustration, so I just went back on the meds so I emailed her and then she recharges me or."
741.0,Provider,"Whatever that is yeah reengage yeah yeah okay yeah we'll see I mean let's just say now, we have reduced the amount of surveys, you have to do, but you still need to do a urine drug screen and technically she could get in trouble for not having your urine every month."
16216.0,Patient,"Right and I, and I had told Brian heart yesterday that I am being drug screen here, and then I will not be able to do a drug screen until after the 27th and they told me okay so."
741.0,Provider,Mad you know.
16216.0,Patient,On the 27th.
741.0,Provider,"you'll have. A new one okay. Okay, all right alright so i'm on this here safety plan what is, I need three warning signs. That a crisis may be developing warning signs being thoughts images mood situations behaviors etc."
16216.0,Patient,Isolation aggressiveness. I don't really know the third one. excuses.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so what are some three internal coping strategies things that you can do to take your mind off problems without having to contact another person like relaxation techniques."
16216.0,Patient,"work out listen to music. Those are the only two that i've been doing here, but the other ones would be like for me it'd be doing something productive by one of my things I like to do like either skate or fish or something like that."
741.0,Provider,Okay. yeah it's kind of hard for you to do those two.
16216.0,Patient,things right.

741.0,Provider,"Okay. And how would you make your environment safe, I mean two ways."
16216.0,Patient,"Environment safe. I mean, I would make my environment suitable for my kids."
741.0,Provider,Okay. And one other way that you would make your environment say.
16216.0,Patient,delete all the old bad numbers and friends that I have. which I have already done.
741.0,Provider,Okay. And the one thing that is most important to you and worth living for is what. So have your girlfriend relented. The guy you back together.
16216.0,Patient,"Well Okay, I guess you can say my ex i've been trying we've talked we finally talked last week. My phone wasn't on, and then I finally got it turned on and I had just recently talked to her, I mean she's upset with me, but we talked. And she's happy that i'm in here."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, but as it going to make any significant difference in your relationship like to be your ex or. Are you trying to work."
16216.0,Patient,"there's nothing I can really do until i'm out of here, and then I sure that i'm serious about what i've been doing."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. Okay, so you still have hope she's not said yes to anything. But you still have hope. That you can convince her."
16216.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I mean we're still friends and she's still close to me, no matter where even if we are not."
741.0,Provider,"Well, if she them mama your children. know no okay. You don't have any kids together. Okay, all right well. There I mean you know, there are times when you have. intimate relationship with someone and then find out that you're better off just friends the relationship works better that way. So that does happen from time to time. Alright, so. that's done. So now, though, stop sending me messages."
16216.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
741.0,Provider,"Oh no I think it's I you know, I understand that there are people who are seriously depressed and who are suicidal I have several. Right, I also have several that have been marked. Suicide risk. and they're not really. they're experiencing depression, as they come off of the drugs but they're not truly. Dealing with. Dealing with side effects from coming off drugs not truly depressed people that makes that."
16216.0,Patient,"Right yeah I also learn. there's a difference between mental health issues and mental health, science, you know and they say like. When you're offered drug you should wait two weeks to a month, and if you still have those signs and you have mental health issues, and if you don't then they were just mental health, science, because of the drug."
741.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. I mean let's face it, when we're out there, using and putting chemicals in our body we're playing chemists with our brain chemical. So when you take those chemicals away yes there's going to be some imbalances, yes there's gonna be some ups and downs some depression from the loss of your drug of choice, I mean i'm sorry, but our drugs of choice become our best friend. ran. And will you take that away there's a loss so there's a grieving process. I mean people don't really consider it that way, but it's a grieving process, and then on top of that, you have to readjust all the chemicals in your brain and it's a it's a balancing act and so yeah we add pretty crazy, the first six months to a year coming up with the mass."
16216.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"because everything is so out of whack. And, and yes, the 70 tax or the suboxone will assist and regulating some of those brain chemicals. But if it doesn't fix all of it. Because I mean you know it fixes the. The opiate receptors but it doesn't do anything for your serotonin. That whole that has to level back out itself. So. it's a process it's not something that you know we're one of those that like we want instant gratification. And it doesn't work that way."
16216.0,Patient,i'm definitely one of those.
741.0,Provider,"I am too i'm real bad about it and. I still struggle with it, not with respect to drugs but with other things in my life. and You know. Life on life's terms, is not something that we do well. Just isn't so. All right, well i'm. i'm glad you're back. Keep me posted so good to see you keep me posted on on where you're at."
16216.0,Patient,"You know, we run another Friday as well."
741.0,Provider,"yeah and what's Friday. Okay let's see, let me look. Yes, I have next Friday open. And I have the following Friday open."
16216.0,Patient,"Okay, we should just do that then."
741.0,Provider,That would be you want you want the 14th to the 21st or both.
16216.0,Patient,Both. Okay cuz I have lunch at 11 and then I have class at one so 12 bucks perfect.
741.0,Provider,"Alright, so I got those down on here and i'm on my calendar and i'll go in and fix them on your. In your record. and So hopefully you can. manage to withstand and stick and stay where you're at."
16216.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I want it, I want to prove to myself, but I want to do this program this fatherhood programs important to me and whether i'm here or not I can do it and. You know, realistically i've only been staying because, like the guys in my my room and stuff they're really good guys that keep me humble you know. I just you know i'm doing the process and everything's good you know."
741.0,Provider,Right.
16216.0,Patient,"I really only have 20 more days, but I really want to do this program besides like they also give me an incentive like if I finished the program like they give me like three $400 and I don't want to get out and be broke. yeah."
741.0,Provider,that one reason. yeah I have a sneaking suspicion that money as a trigger for you also.
16216.0,Patient,"know I know it was but lately it hasn't been like I haven't really been spending any money, like, I do have money here, but I don't really spend it I don't use it. i'm not gonna lie I do like making money, money makes the world. go round."
741.0,Provider,Yes.
16216.0,Patient,"Yes, I said and money, money, money doesn't make everything happy, but it does sure make it convenient."
741.0,Provider,"It does. But it just I don't know why, just like. kind of."
16216.0,Patient,seems like oh.
741.0,Provider,"yeah I don't blame you. I don't like being broke either yeah. So that happens, though sometimes."
16216.0,Patient,"But with that money. and My son is actually starting a jujitsu class and I want to pay for half of it and then right when I get out, I want to get a gym membership, and you know, I just want to be able to fight for the little things that I can do for that month of the time before I get a job. i'm just trying to like bankroll manage kind of thing."
741.0,Provider,yeah. And you want what you want. And I understand that. But what happens when it don't happen that way.
16216.0,Patient,yeah i'm gonna figure it out.
741.0,Provider,Just. just saying I mean like if you walk out the door today. That ain't happening right.
16216.0,Patient,"No i'm i'm able to do the program outside of here so like because it's it's going to be a six week program so my plan was I was going to do three weeks in here and three weeks out of there. But I wanted to do the program personally anyway, because I feel like it's going to help me with getting more time with my kids when I go to court."
741.0,Provider,Right and you're and you're right.
16216.0,Patient,"And I do this in general, you know what I mean I mean $300 relationship to me, you know I mean that's just $300."
741.0,Provider,right but.
16216.0,Patient,"It could help so. Yes, I mean if I was to leave today, I can I can still do that progress that's the whole point."
741.0,Provider,And that's that's your main point that's your main objective right.
16216.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"That works that works. All right, well. I will see you next Friday. And that will be interested to find out how everything went."
16216.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay, all right, thank you good to see you."
741.0,Provider,"good to see you too, take care bye. Okay, so he. is still very unstable and reactionary um. he's working who report to working on patience and anger and has learned that he's in a lot of denial and that he's a narcissist. So at this point I would imagine that helping him. With his anger and and patience and and trying to get him to think through what he does before he reacts. so that he can act instead of react is probably the best solution for us, and I will see him next Friday and discuss that with him. Since we kind of have to. rearrange what we were doing before. Just because he is in this program and they pretty much are directing what he works on right now so. Thank you."
