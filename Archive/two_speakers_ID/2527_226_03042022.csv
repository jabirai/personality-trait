2527.0,Patient,pretty good. can't complain too much.
226.0,Provider,Okay cool.
2527.0,Patient,"A little touch of the flu, but."
226.0,Provider,Is there any way that you can sit down and keep the camera stuff.
2527.0,Patient,yeah making me nauseous.
226.0,Provider,"And, did you check in with a virtual clinic."
2527.0,Patient,"No, I didn't think we had to do that anymore. straight into the meeting."
226.0,Provider,Now gotta do that hold on.
2527.0,Patient,"Okay hey I know that that's how it is for the groups, we just show up."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, I got you all right. Okay So how have you been it's been a. While. Tell me tell me fill me in."
2527.0,Patient,"there's not. not terribly too much. To fill in. I guess When did we speak last in December and November something. yeah everyone around thanksgiving right so. let's see between then and now well I I was, I went back down south. For Christmas. I stayed I stayed with my best friend and his family. And I stayed down there, I went I went down a couple of days before Christmas and stayed. through new years it came back on like January 5 so that was really nice. Take a couple of weeks off work and just hang out with my friends and family. yeah um, but it was very strange when I got down there. Well, actually the morning that I left sacramento my ankle was slightly swollen. And I was. Trying to think like. It you know I don't remember rolling it or you know, and I checked for like punctures or lacerations or anything there's nothing, it was very. and Then I got down south, and I was hanging out the next morning. I woke up, and it was like basically from. The base of my toes. Like midway up my Shin was so low and that you know I mostly were slip on bands shoes. It was so swollen that I couldn't get that foot into into my shoe. I had to. yeah just wear house slippers. And it stayed that way for So this was like a day or two before Christmas, that I was at this at this point and. It was the Monday evening after Christmas. I was hanging out with with my buddy that I was staying with, and we were playing playstation and I was like man like I just don't know what's up I don't I don't feel very good. i'm just going to lay down right here on the couch and I I passed out, you know I knocked out I took a little nap and. He woke me up and because dinner was ready and I had a couple of bites of dinner and then with sorry and then was just like Okay, I have to go to bed like I just don't feel very good and I spent the next I don't know 30 hours or so just just vomiting. diarrhea and. yeah it was it was miserable. And then, so that was Monday, so all day Tuesday I was ill and then Wednesday I woke up and was like 85% good and my ankle wasn't smiling anymore. I don't know if they were you know tied together or not, but it was as soon as I was over being how whatever sickness, I had my my leg was fine again. So I don't know what the hell that was about. I did look it up online just a you know I just typed in what would cause your ankle. To just randomly swell up. And it said. Like if, especially if it's painful to walk on which. Like it was it was painful to walk on. The first two days or so. Like, to the point where I really couldn't put weight on it like. But it said that it could be related to. Like a heart issue or kidney issue, and so I mean I was a little bit concerned about that and I didn't really look. terribly too much more into it. But in hindsight, like I i'm pretty sure that the meds. The meds that we take to affect the kidney quite a bit, and you know I do usually on on the weekends most nights i'll come home from work and maybe have a beer, but on the weekends, I will. And I know that you know mixing alcohol and the meds it's like a double whammy. So I don't I don't know it was a little bit concerning, but it seems to be fine now so."
226.0,Provider,How many milligrams of suboxone are you on.
2527.0,Patient,milligrams roughly.
226.0,Provider,Have you considered. tapering at some point.
2527.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that's that's in the plans, I mean when I started. When I started taking suboxone I was taking. And this was. What three years ago, I was taking. 16 to 24 milligrams."
226.0,Provider,yeah so you come down.
2527.0,Patient,"to live in. dumbing down, you know it's."
226.0,Provider,"it's a process. For sure yeah so let's talk about. let's do some short term and long term goals, so I think that. I think one of your long term goals, you know, is to taper start tapering. You know, talk to your prescriber. about it. Did you tell the prescriber who's who. was a doctor That gives you this suboxone."
2527.0,Patient,Dr grove.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, did you talk to talk to Greg about the swelling that you."
2527.0,Patient,"experience. No, I haven't seen her yeah i'll see her on Monday."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, I you know I mentioned that to her Okay, just so she knows. Just just so she's aware. let her know that you, you know you were sick, it could have been some kind of bug, but it was interesting that there was a correlation between. Your your ankle your everything swelling and the fact that you got sick. Okay, so let's make. tapering off the suboxone let's make that a long term goal so that's like within the next year, like because. You know the tapering like I said it's a process and you got to do it at your own pace you got to feel really comfortable and confident about it. And so, like what are some short term goals to want to work on the can you think of like three short term goals that you want to focus on that are recovery related."
2527.0,Patient,"sure to. Well, I would like to. I would like to get back into my my own place, I mean I don't know if that's. Because surely."
226.0,Provider,yeah it is so short term goal is going to be like three to six months long term goal is going to be six months to a year. So do. You think like getting into your own place would that be doable within like say the next six months.
2527.0,Patient,I hope so.
226.0,Provider,Okay we'll put it. into. Your own place and like what do you like what's a target date that you're gonna. Be in your own place.
2527.0,Patient,"um. I don't know, maybe it is a long term. Like day by you know, by the end of the year it's it's tough right now, because I have been looking and just the way that the. did so where the economy is right now it's just unreal like things are. more expensive. now than they were a year ago."
226.0,Provider,"Absolutely okay so that's just put that as a long term goal okay so let's say so that's like something that you can like your work on between now and a year from now, so that gives you some time okay So hopefully like the market will change a little bit, God willing. And okay so what's a short term goal that's fine you could think of."
2527.0,Patient,The next three months. shoot I don't know Sean.
226.0,Provider,"And Okay, what about Okay, so you say that you're drinking, would you want to make that a goal to me to cut back on your dream can."
2527.0,Patient,"She I mean I I. Between now and last year it's gone down exponentially. Basically, if I went to if I cut it down anymore i'd be like no thinking at all, and I understand that you know. there's concern with that being an addict but. You know drinking is never been like an issue for me. You know, like i've never. I don't know it's not explained like i've never had to like wake up and I need a drink or. Even when I come home from work and i'm dog tired if I just don't feel like having a beer like I just won't have. It you know. I would love to quit. Smoking but I don't know that that can be done in six months."
226.0,Provider,We could put that as a locked room ball quit smoking it's a good.
2527.0,Patient,"I mean. It. i've thought about you know I thought about. Possibly what is that stuff chantix or something like that think that's what it's called. i've thought about that it just the only thing. I stayed you know I stay with my dad and he's a fucking chain smoker it's unbelievable. It actually worries me quite a bit. And being around him when it's just constant non stop smoking like it just. It seems like. unrealistic to try right now. it's one of the things that that's also one of the reasons that. i'd like to do my own place, I mean the only thing that's stopping so far is that my dad is you know he's old and lonely. I you know it's it's not time for me to be taking care of him so. I need to just bite the bullet. and go."
226.0,Provider,"Alright, so let's say we need at least one short term goal so."
2527.0,Patient,I don't know why it's so difficult to think of. Something.
226.0,Provider,I mean like examples would be like saving X amount of money for. Learning a new hobby. or. attending a year and a meeting or.
2527.0,Patient,"I i'd like to. build my credit back. I mean that can. be slightly done in three to six months, I mean it can. You know."
226.0,Provider,"What are some ways okay that's cool that's Okay, what are some ways, you want what are some ways, you could build your credit like what are some things that you can commit to."
2527.0,Patient,"well. I could get a I couldn't get a credit card and use that you know for fuel and only fuel. And then you know, obviously make. slightly over minimum so that i'm not just paying interest. I talked to to one of my buddies the one that I stayed with when I went down south. And he had he did the same thing that I did when we were young and didn't really understand the credit situation and basically to destroy our credits. Which is one anyway, let me finish the story. He was trying to buy a house and he had you know he had the money to be able to put down, but its credit wasn't. wasn't good enough. And so, he had to. You know figure some some way to fix credit and he actually contacted one of those like. Credit help fixer companies or whatever. and I guess the the guy that or the person that he was talking to about about what to do and how to fix it boosts credit and whatnot told him that the best way to do it quickly is to. Go finance like a 1500 $2,000 piece of jewelry and make payments on it, for, for you know, three to six months roughly. And then. Like at that six month just pay it off completely and it'll boost your credit up. quite a bit and so he did that and it worked. yeah his his credit. You know, boosted up enough to where he was able to finally purchase the House. Which is you know something that I could easily do the thing is with me is that, after I. After I screwed my credit up. I decided. If I can't afford to buy something outright then. Well, I can't have it or sad but until I get it so. Like the last time that I actually attempted to to finance something. I was denied. Well, I wasn't denied, but the interest rate and the monthly payment that they were asking from me was double what it should have been. Because because there's a. Like 11 year gap in my credit history, so they see it as I have zero credit street. And you know that's something that I, I I still feel like if I can't afford to buy something out right then either have to continue saving or like I just can't get it. But unfortunately the world doesn't work that way and I have to have credit. So."
226.0,Provider,"that's interesting that they. say bye, why is that."
2527.0,Patient,"I honestly couldn't tell you. I think it's because i'm sure that it could be really anything you know I mean but jewelry just happens to be you know it's a it's a small amount of money, but it's also significant enough that you can finance it, but it's small enough that you can pay it off. Like quickly. You know what I mean."
226.0,Provider,"Well, I liked your idea about getting a credit card and just using it for. For gas for feel. it's better than nothing, you know, like. Maybe if you're comfortable that you're going to be able to you know not go overboard and you know get yourself in a jam. Then I that's an option that's a viable option."
2527.0,Patient,"Well i'm sure that if I if I got one, it would be easy to not use it, because i've been not using credit cards for so long. yeah i'd actually probably have a harder time remembering to use credit card not my debit card when getting field."
226.0,Provider,"So it's just a different mindset, so this is, you know you're using it to get you something you know if you're using actually to for your future you know if you look at it that way you know you look at it like okay. i'm going to build my credit because it's so important it's going to help me to be able to move out a dad's you know, like get into your own place. You know, maybe eventually buy something who knows you know you're just. you're just kind of slowly slowly, building on that. So okay that's a good one, what think, do you think you can do that, like when, would you be able to do that."
2527.0,Patient,To start to try to get a credit card and whatnot. yeah like it start researching and and applying today even.
226.0,Provider,Next.
2527.0,Patient,"Week, though I actually I. I probably I could probably go to i'm a member of a credit union that's who I bank with and on Friday of next week I could probably. go in there, and I mean I can go in there and see what kinda. You know what kind of programs or cards or. Whatever they offer."
226.0,Provider,"that's good. By next Friday. Right so that's gonna be the 11th of March right so make that a target date okay. there's obviously flexibility, but like you're trying to get that. Data in motion."
2527.0,Patient,"yeah I you know that's. that's pretty William be sorry. get a piece of paper to write that down. it's probably one of my my. biggest flaws, is my across the nation like I know that I need to do anything and i'll. On on Monday oh i'll be like okay come Friday I need to go and do this I need to go take care of that i'm to call this person you do that, and they don't end up doing it, or I wait till the very last moment, and you know it's just. Working on for sure."
226.0,Provider,"Right and that's why we do these short term and long term goals, you know that's why it just kind of helped you know it's a guideline it helps kind of stand track. And so there's obviously some flexibility, but we don't want you not you know not so. And you've got some really good long term goals to you know so. Just make sure that England you share, about. What Dr grubs about what happened with your."
2527.0,Patient,Blood yeah.
226.0,Provider,Okay anything else that you want to go over that. would be helpful to talk about.
2527.0,Patient,"You know, there was there was something. There was. A few weeks ago, something came up and I can't for the life of me remember what it was, and I remember. When it came up saying Okay, I want to talk to Sean about this. Now I just can't I can't remember what the hell, it was."
226.0,Provider,well. that's a good sign it means you work through.
2527.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
226.0,Provider,Not lingering so.
2527.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
2527.0,Patient,I wish I could remember what it was. me i'm sure it'll come to me. After after we're done talking.
226.0,Provider,"Exactly. The seriously just connect. Okay, well then let's go ahead and we'll just make another appointment for a couple three months or so how's that sound. So i'm sorry remind me what days and times work best for you."
2527.0,Patient,"Fridays are my days off, so it can it can be pretty much anytime Fridays. during the week, however. During the rest of the week, like after 530."
226.0,Provider,"OK let's do Friday. How about. How about Friday June 3. Can we do a noon, or one o'clock. let's try for noon."

You know, four days a week, so. we're going to 44 so that's why I get those Fridays off, but it's tough it's tough working the kind of work that I do 10 hours a day. But it's nice having a three day weekend that's for sure. And then, what last week was it yeah last was it last week that was Presidents day."
