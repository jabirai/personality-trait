13548.0,Patient,well.
298.0,Provider,hi natalie let me pull up your machine. and tell me your symptoms that you're experiencing right now When did they start anything you can about them.
13548.0,Patient,"20 minutes heart rate at height was 125 it's now I got it to 80 between 80 and. 85. tightness in my chest, I feel dizzy and. it's hard to focus right now."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, when did this start at 20 minutes like."
13548.0,Patient,2030 minutes. So 30 minutes ago started I didn't realize that my pulse was at what 25 about 20 minutes ago and I finally got it to the 80s.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and has this ever happened to you before."
13548.0,Patient,"Rarely, it has to be like a really stressful situation for to get that back."
298.0,Provider,Is there any reason that you're in a stressful situation right now.
13548.0,Patient,I work in customer service and then just got a really bad bad call the person who's literally badgering me and just screaming at me. Non stop until he hung up got my pulse really high. that's when everything else was going on.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're needing you're needing some good oxygen nation right now on your that that lack of focus your heart rate can get so fast that it doesn't have time to get a good oxygenation to your brain when it's going that fast that's why we need to keep it calm. What have you tried in the past for anything for anxiety."
13548.0,Patient,"I take the medicine that I take for it every day, but I took that this morning before work, I always take it same time every day to help with any anxiety that I already have like just brings expect us to get excited but right now it's more like. situational situation right on made it work so."
298.0,Provider,What i'm. What is the insight the mad that you take every day.
13548.0,Patient,You know generic for lexapro as skills.
298.0,Provider,And what is the dose on it.
13548.0,Patient,10 milligrams.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you ever gone up on it."
13548.0,Patient,No. I didn't I felt like I didn't feel like I needed to.
298.0,Provider,"Before okay so i'm going to give you some choices okay and and you say yes yay or nay I don't have an agenda either way. There one choice is something called propranolol it's to calm the heart rate down and calm the blood pressure down it's really good on social anxiety it doesn't work on the brain but it calms the body down it's not addicting, it is a. Side effects can be if you jump up really fast your blood pressure can drop, and so you would feel low, but when your heart rate is going in your blood pressure is up. Even if you think you're going to let's say you know you're going to have to have a phone call with that person again, you can take it before the phone call, so that if you know there's going to be some stressful situation coming up what's nice about that medication is there it's. It doesn't affect your ability to your brain. So you're not going to be. clouded at all. that's one choice I know that's a benzodiazepine that's not offensive that is a beta Blocker medication, the next choice would be an Anti histamine that is a. cousin, so to speak, to benadryl but it's for daytime us it's not addicting either the name of that is this struggle. That would be my second choice and then my third choice would be a low dose of a xanax if that ever happened to you again that you would. And that's a benzodiazepine and strong, but if we would do it in like the lowest dose possible and you would only use it if you felt that hundred and 16 heart rate come on. kind of stuff. So those are the three choices, you could do propranolol and and like Sam X today, so that you had like five tablets in the House of xanax if you ever needed it in, you can have like 10 tablets of propranolol and you can tell me if you like, the way you feel that's my thought."
13548.0,Patient,"Okay um, what are the side effects with those with those."
298.0,Provider,"Side effects are it's addicting and so you could get addicted to it, I have people who don't have addictive personalities and they've used like two tablets in a month it's just not that's not their personality to have that, but they needed that assurance they keep it in their wallet. They needed their insurance that if they ever got into that situation, they could take care of it fast that's the good part of xanax is it's fast acting and so. If something were to happen again what I don't want to happen is you not have the skills or not have medicine and this happen again and you've already built neuro pathways to anxiety and. So we want to nip this in the bud. Before it happens again. And you're still very light headed and foggy and you know that's. it's hard to go through that I get it. So the thing is, you would, if you have an addictive personality, you would need to like put the phils in somebody else's care or something like that."
13548.0,Patient,We can just do the. Four panels yeah the first choice. that's perfectly fine i'll just be careful and standing.
298.0,Provider,That way.
13548.0,Patient,I would only have to take it when. needed when needed.
298.0,Provider,"And i'm. i'm going to give you 10 milligrams we tried, the lowest dose possible but somewhere between 10 milligrams and 40 milligrams is what it takes to get a person to calm down. I suspect it's at 20 milligrams but it comes in 10 and 20s and their capsules, so we need to try you first on 10 so i'm going to write it for you to. 10s. I already placed. All right, you don't have to stay with me, I can go ahead and write this you can just go relax."
13548.0,Patient,Is there anything else that I can do to try and I feel cold and.
298.0,Provider,tingle your ass yeah you're kind of at the end of this you could use some box breathing right now box breathing is take four seconds to go in and four seconds to go out. If you were to take some ice. and put it anywhere around your neck your face your staff it lowers your heart rate.
13548.0,Patient,My heart my heart rate went down. That I am cold now.
298.0,Provider,"And so I would get under a warm blanket and and you know practice some breathing and distract yourself. Okay. All right, sorry this happened take care. bye bye Thank you. bye bye bye."
13548.0,Patient,Hello.
