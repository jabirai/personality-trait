It was six weeks recovery. I mean yeah one like I mean and they had both of them. So, like it was like I had to literally go sick one hand, and then the six weeks with the other I went almost ended up being logged in so ended up being like probably three months that it took all together a little brighter fires cover. Like the. Time bank, yes, two hands. So. I thought you would have my medical chart that's not assigned to. All my circle Okay, all my surgeries done with allegiance health in Jackson Michigan so."
562.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I have your medical chart so I can definitely look through it, I don't look to it too much before I meet the patient, because sometimes the patient doesn't come to the appointment and then you know.

I would never take that and the way. I thought that 45 ways."
562.0,Provider,"So yeah yeah then withdrawal from that's pretty brutal so but it sounds like this, you feel like the suboxone works for you."

I don't know, maybe off the clock in or the one of the other, but I just I know that helps me. that's okay like yo I think that helps my hands is that, like it's it's a nerve."
562.0,Provider,"sounds like you need it. My only thing I was going to say is that the adderall. Often, can make like the anxiety worse and the client has been calms it down and so sometimes. decreasing, you can decrease one and then decrease both of those and then people just have like less anxiety and they feel better but that's just something that we can keep talking about you know.

Be things like my bike in here I just got a gas powered by we sat there splits the tires on it, so I was driving down the road you need special spotify as long as they can so we can collapse and on the phone. with him and my stepfather event not not support for me at all sabotage. get me put in prison because they think if i'm in prison. For the daily stand up straight line my hardest to get to a park like i've put five applications in the cost money okay i've applied everywhere, because last time I went to state hospital. I travel, I was screaming at the. deputy until i'm not going to jail jail I didn't do anything with all I did was yell at my sister I rent it to scale. Properly so like for her to be there, you need to be told me to get away and and not even actually she should have been aggressive, but instead when they came they recipe, because they felt right wrote a statement saying, she feared for life and never send the wrong the wrong with. Mr to the State thing that stuck with me feel like i'm on probation for a power. outage Vanessa. I like pivots yo I. don't know why but do it, I feel like they took advantage, with my life like I uneducated on me get educated law. i've got the basic side, so I started we'd love to do and all kinds of stuff is taking off and i'm going to work on that, but.

996.0,Patient,"I mean not really I was trying to do a and stuff like that and i'm also doing other classes, what I was trying to do is get away. With Calvin if I were to wait for my script with still now them or How does that go let's get. Our. pharmacy. Okay."
562.0,Provider,"have fun in two weeks and we need again in two weeks it sounds like so it sounds like. It sounds like he recommended a pain group for you, it sounds like that would be good, and maybe I don't have one now, so I can just keep seeing you individually and how about we meet in two weeks, and you know if things are going well, then we can we can meet once a month. And I can we. And I might start up being group i'm hoping to sometime next year and then we can go from there, but it sounds like you have a lot of other things going on right now. And then you know, maybe once you get off the probation. You could get into a pain group because me. I mean I don't know I know you go to addiction groups but sounds like."
996.0,Patient,I don't know we talked about in the pain group w I think I don't understand what i'd be talking about. The name like what what's going on with. People.
562.0,Provider,"yeah fair point I think you know it's it's like you know there's a lot of stuff about like you know there's a lot we can do to improve our pain when it comes to our mental health, which it sounds like you've taken care of our physical health. Like exercising stretching spiritual things things like that, but I know they have them in other states too, but so maybe we can see when you said you get off your probation in a few months."
996.0,Patient,"yeah like and now you now have attended like I said you're on it my sisters and making me do with the violence class okay and that's possibly $480 and that's every once a week, whatever to, and then I go. $480 $20 a session and 16 sessions, whatever that adds up so."
562.0,Provider,wow okay.
996.0,Patient,"and on top of it, they already hit me with over $3,000 in fines, you know I mean so like I got the fines almost down to $1,000 again like but it's just it's hard to keep it down when. I went to work on everything, like that, when I consolidated all my debt I got it like the one thing I got to avoid that. With our didn't even start off with a little bit that's good job 36 so like i'm looking to buy a house, since the wheel wrecked by main thing is to save enough money to silence or $200 a month with this room. drywall. For it's got everything so they are here before, too, so I."
562.0,Provider,Think you're in a good place.
996.0,Patient,"yeah it's gonna be easy for me to save money, you know I mean he doesn't he's not a drug addict so. I would not betray his. drink."
562.0,Provider,"Okay, so then let's see and you take two films a day, so I will send in enough for two weeks, how about we meet and wait what is two weeks two weeks Christmas, let me get my."
996.0,Patient,I don't know but are you sending in the pills and said.
562.0,Provider,"i'm not going to send in send me text, but I can send in like suboxone pills you want me to try and send those out."
996.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that's fine Oh, why can't what's wrong with the details about that."
562.0,Provider,"It is, but you know they basically so the suboxone is the suboxone is buprenorphine, which is the pain medicine and the addiction treatment Madison. plus the no locks on which is found in narcan but no locks on isn't absorbed it from the cheek and so it's just there, so people don't crush it and snort it."
996.0,Patient,"Okay well that's not what was very well word what is it interfering, I think this the paper napkins interfering with. No oxygen that's the problem with what I was saying."
562.0,Provider,"So, so it shouldn't because it because it no marks on can't be absorbed that way, the medicine just isn't absorbed to the cheek it can only be absorbed like you know when we now can people and we shoot it through their nose. yeah it's absorbed like that. Okay, so if you were to snort it then that you would. You would get the naloxone the nor can, but if you just take it like pop it in your cheek like that, and then. Then it shouldn't it's not activated from the cheek. Okay we're under the tongue."
996.0,Patient,"Okay. Well, you know does your insurance."
562.0,Provider,"cover the the the suboxone pills, I can try, you want to try the suboxone pills most patients don't like it."
996.0,Patient,I do like I rather the pills in the things but I. If you're not. going to be checks. or say hey I like the taste nasty or anything like that I don't give me.
