126.0,Provider,wow that's amazing that he works with you like that that.
11739.0,Patient,"Are I think he's got you know a little bit of a soft heart for me, because my son is autistic and he knew a family that was autistic and the sun was my Drake about when he was telling me the story. And bill lives with his mom and how he has to be taken care of and you know how hard it is to take care of someone with autism, and he felt bad for me and. He had just known that i'd been homeless for a while and when I told him that Jackson was autistic he was like you know what I believe in you, I think you can do this so i'm going to give you a chance and he did and i've been there, a little over two years now."
126.0,Provider,Nice you're able to pay the payments out of your with disability.

126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well that's great that you can be independent, I know it's it's so totally difficult just living from one check to the next and. That that's a tough thing you start worrying about your finances and then you just pray at the end of the month, things will you know."
11739.0,Patient,"yeah that's been me the last three months, my income was cut in half, and I was getting over 2000 over 2500 a month, but ones dead stop paying child support and July, so I haven't gotten any child support from him since then, which really hurt me bad."
126.0,Provider,yeah because you got to buy groceries.
11739.0,Patient,yeah well I get I get food stamps.
126.0,Provider,Okay.
11739.0,Patient,"But I don't. pull benefit because I have my income being so much you know, and I haven't reported that I would probably be getting more if I reported that I wasn't getting child support but. They never get back to me anyway so screw it."
126.0,Provider,yeah. wow yeah that's that's a big jump you have to budget like.
11739.0,Patient,"yep and I have four credit cards. That are suffering really bad right now, that means my credit score is too."
126.0,Provider,"Well, you know you only need that if you're going to go buy a car, because you're already got a house."
11739.0,Patient,I have a car.
126.0,Provider,Though then who cares.
11739.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,"I mean the the credit card thing I mean that's that's the American way we all live, you know off our credit cards and. You know, by the time you start paying them off and they start getting bigger and bigger it's it's kind of like an endless you just know you're going to be paying for credit card. And it really you've already got a house you've already got a car. What else, are you going to buy that you need that credit for."
11739.0,Patient,True. yeah.
126.0,Provider,"I mean it's nice to have good credit, but. it's it if you don't you know if you don't really need it. In in in your case you know you got to worry about yourself and your four kids. Right and that's all all those bills and everything have to come second that's. that's a way of life, especially in California. Even though you're not in California you're in Ohio right."
11739.0,Patient,i'm in Michigan I definitely couldn't afford to live in California.
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah it's so expensive out here. You know I went house hunting and apartment hunting and townhouse hunting or guest house, I mean just finding and trying to find another place to live, and you know out here. A studio apartment is about 1800 a month. A to bet I one bedroom would be about 2000 a two bedroom would be about 25."
11739.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh."
126.0,Provider,apartment not talking about a house. And houses are at least four or 5000.
11739.0,Patient,here.
126.0,Provider,I know you wonder how can people pay for that.
11739.0,Patient,I don't know I just thinking that. was just outrageous.
126.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's uh but I mean you know and there's lots of people are moving out to California, because it's too expensive, but it's like. I just wouldn't want to live anywhere else."
11739.0,Patient,Right. Prices are going everywhere so.
126.0,Provider,"Yes, and that's the thing they're going up every but the Midwest is like half you know, like rent and everything my daughter lives up in utah they're paying $800 a month for a house for rent. yeah just like what $800 for a house. You know yeah. So, but you know utah has as many people as probably the city of La total. Right whole state of utah so it's like nobody wants to live there. To move out of state just to pay lower prices that doesn't seem worth it, to me, I mean you leave all your friends and family behind. yeah yeah."
11739.0,Patient,I definitely wouldn't leave where i'm at. So I.
126.0,Provider,Can uh huh yeah.
