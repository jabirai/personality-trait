17338.0,Patient,How are you today.
760.0,Provider,doing good looks like we have a better connection today.
17338.0,Patient,"Yes, we do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good hey you kind of started the the process of this but I. didn't want to start it all over again. Just just because you. know many times yeah. You were interrupted. interrupted just too much. So. talk to me oh when. What is it that you want to get out of treatment, what do you, what do you want to gain for yourself in your life, I think we had started with that already, but you can just repeat that."
17338.0,Patient,"I want to grow and improvement for plus I wanna. learn new tactics of how to manage myself and my problems my baby my day to day, and no one to reach my highest and full potential."
760.0,Provider,Okay okay. And right now you're willing. You feeling kind of blocked right now.
17338.0,Patient,"Yes, and I want to kind of. master my my focus and my emotions and learn how to cope with all. yeah it's like."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right oh when i'm well talk to me about what symptoms you're having right now what mental health symptoms are you struggling with right now."
17338.0,Patient,focus on focus and attention to the same thing.
760.0,Provider,yeah. yeah could be slightly different but yeah yes kind of thing.
17338.0,Patient,So in that. sense of responsibility. responsibility.
760.0,Provider,Responsibility okay.
17338.0,Patient,"surgeon he. What else. just want to be, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, are you having anxiety, are you having depression, can you talk to me about those kinds of."
17338.0,Patient,"awesome. Because I wasn't getting the things as I wish they they were for the meeting, and all this. work was kind of like not that my my my best self. And so I kind of went to bed side."
760.0,Provider,"Oh, but yesterday. yeah, it is a rough day everything kind of went wrong. yeah yeah."
17338.0,Patient,more negative than positive so. yeah I had a hard time also to sleep.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you are feeling kind of down last night. Okay we're sorry that you went through that, but one thing I would suggest, for you to consider sometimes things are just not working out. And we kind of have to sometimes there's things that we can control. Unfortunately, the Internet connection, because often times. When it gets that kind of mind it's not one of those things and we just kind of have Okay, this is not working and there's always another day. And so you know it's it's you know, perhaps today will be clearer for you, you know because we're not going to have to you won't have to struggle with the. glitches that we were struggling with yesterday and kind of like rolling with that accepting that because life is like that. You know, we can't control every little detail going our way and and if we try to focus so intensely on things that I cannot control, then of course we're going to get all stressed out, you might feel anxious, so you know. We take a look at what are some of the things we can do for ourselves, right now, you know and kind of. Being in the moment with that. But just since you brought that up i'm going to just kind of throw that out there it's not really part of the assessment, but. I feel like it's a clean slate today like another way of perceiving it is you know, this is a clean slate now now, I have some idea. When we met at least yesterday, and now I have some idea of where to take these questions and and we can move forward from here, it was just glitchy thing, yesterday I. feel a little bit does that make sense to you or."
17338.0,Patient,"She does because i'm also I woke up also doing kind of concerned and worried, the first thing that came to my mind, is how am I going to fix it and I don't know. And I need to. my mind is between two options right now and I need to find. A place to stay to move to. The message is coming on the on the 17 so I need something until let's say the 15. But i'm trying not to use the best measure which is one option is just find the right place as fast as I can, in pressure trying to get approved and this and that trying to pay all the fees deposit and all this. But i'm not sure if that's going to be possible. Because it's yeah but i've been looking for like more than three months, four months but anyway that's one option that I can't seem to find a solution, the second one would be maybe instead of stressing myself a lot, maybe I should try to find the short term. Yes, solution which my head probably could be me but it's hard as well. So I don't know how to do that, that second one, which is this just came to my mind, like overnight. which would be Maybe I should find since my thesis coming Maybe I should find. I was thinking airbnb airbnb is out of the way the question because it's expensive. yeah fees and all that, so I don't know i'm not familiar with with short term Rentals like website or anything that I can be man to mind for like, for example, one month or two months, something like. On the range of $1,000 or a little bit over, but that I don't have to sign a lease for 12 months."
760.0,Provider,"A month to month lease I think it will be called. Yes, yeah."
17338.0,Patient,"But I don't even. know how to read my mind or a route everywhere, like that, right now, my brain is telling me that's the option that you should take."
760.0,Provider,Just I don't feel. pressured.
17338.0,Patient,What have you what have you stayed where you're at. Where I am right now. I don't know what is that.
760.0,Provider,"We haven't got to that question, so I don't know. that's what i'm asking."
17338.0,Patient,"And this is a so remember, I told you that I was with a roommate."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, you're right."
17338.0,Patient,You do I will not bring my sister to that environment. Logically it's not it's not gonna work out it wouldn't work out.
760.0,Provider,"If you had a brother and a sister, it would be another thing."
17338.0,Patient,"It wouldn't be another thing. yeah so i'm going to respect for me to you know, be the thoughtful."
760.0,Provider,I think. yeah okay.
17338.0,Patient,"Okay we're doing one that as well, so I left the House. Okay. I didn't need to but I I had to. So what what i'm right now i'm staying at the hospital."
760.0,Provider,Oh. yeah okay.
17338.0,Patient,"i'm not gonna make my sister, here too, because I chose the hospital because i've. been here for four years and I know what it's like to be in the hospital, I know, different muscles. And it's not a problem for me personally, because i'm saying a lot of mine."
760.0,Provider,And yeah no way.
17338.0,Patient,"it's like. it's like for a tour for 600 close to 700 rent that I was paying I went down to let's say on a month, I went down to 1200. So it's a substantial. say. Please, so I could leave like this, like here for like a month or two just I just use the space for like you know short term but nothing like long term. But. I only took this measure, because they wanted to get out of that space, so I could focus being by myself here focus in trying to have the best measures taken to towards that goal of finding a place for me and my sister. Here I know that I cannot. or yeah Maybe I should not. Because I don't think it would be decent for. she's not used to this environment. But maybe it's the right I should take a look at it it's the right measure that I took for the time being, in order to. Calm down and try to find a man to man place. yeah for me for like one month or two until I know collect my my paychecks collect unsafe, so I can apply for not only apply for an actual place when she gets here and we can look together instead of you know."
760.0,Provider,Trying to do everything by myself.
17338.0,Patient,I don't know you can give me an advice.
760.0,Provider,Have you called a property management company.
17338.0,Patient,um. I tried to look for myself and try calling the company's one by one.
760.0,Provider,"And nobody responds to you. Okay, I you've done the website, I know, housing, as well, they are you I think you said you were in."
17338.0,Patient,Los Angeles Sunday morning.
760.0,Provider,A Santa Monica.
17338.0,Patient,Sunday morning on second street. At the fairmont hotel and then I was living in for street to street behind. yeah so.
760.0,Provider,"Then, and you and you. And where do you work, because if there's other places in southern California that are a lot cheaper than Santa Monica Los Angeles so."
17338.0,Patient,"You learn, but I I work there. And I tried my strategy is if I don't have a car, right now, or instead of spending money with car and all that, why should I you know live far away, even though it's cheaper, but it will require money for me to get. bored."
760.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's why I. We kind of touched a little bit on work, but I just wanted to clarify it's kind of I know housing is like really, really rough right now all over, but I know you're living in one of our more costly areas."
17338.0,Patient,"Applied yesterday. For Santa Monica housing. Housing authority, yes, somebody i'm on the waitlist I don't even women."
760.0,Provider,Under yeah that's gonna be really long most likely.
17338.0,Patient,"But it doesn't hurt. yeah i'm just said, because that. Are you really need to have this sort of."
760.0,Provider,"So you have a lot of seems like you have a lot of pressure on you and it's causing you to have feelings of anxiety anxiousness and I don't want to put the words in your mouth, but can."
17338.0,Patient,that's it.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and she's coming on the 17th of January."
17338.0,Patient,This month.
760.0,Provider,Of this month oh. Okay. Housing authority. I don't know what kind of money you make. Perhaps staying separate renting a room for her somewhere where she had her own room and you stay in the hospital.
17338.0,Patient,You think. I don't know.
760.0,Provider,i'm just trying to think out of the box. I know I mean i'm in southern California to. I know what housing is like it's like you know.
17338.0,Patient,"Maybe that's an option actually like until I get my thing sorted out, this is."
760.0,Provider,"yeah. This it takes some of your pressure that we get her here, you would still be able to spend time together."
17338.0,Patient,"Then she doesn't have any history here in the States, yet how would they get approved for for a place. And then give it to her."
760.0,Provider,"that'd be a problem all right. I think, as long as you're honest with the person who owns yeah maybe I don't know how you feel about a room private room in somebody's house, maybe try to find an older person like a mature person I don't know interview them. and meet with them and just explain your situation and let them know that you're going to pay for it and i'm going to sign for it but she's going to be the one living here I think if you're up front, from the very beginning, they can say yes, or they can say no. Good yeah. yeah. Oh okay so. So you're feeling anxious you got a lot of things going on, are you taking any medications for anything for mental health, have you ever."
17338.0,Patient,"um I took a friend gave me. Under on. To try to to. To see how it reacts to me, and if we do food help. And I. Actually felt like. Like i've never been before like I woke up."
760.0,Provider,"I tell you felt better, is there a cleared, a lot of your symptoms, then."
17338.0,Patient,"it's all like it felt smarter, I felt like my most Jen self that I ever been in my life."
760.0,Provider,So maybe you feel clearer.
17338.0,Patient,"Clear yeah and, like all my problems went away like. I was completely focus, and this was on December 25 fronting giving the I worked for like 12 hours at 13 so I was like whoa. hi everyone, everyone is like impressed."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17338.0,Patient,yeah manager manager general manager everyone but I didn't tell them that that i'm that i'm on a draw anything.
760.0,Provider,"What that's your business, they are not. entitled to know. Things like that about you. Know we're entitled to our privacy with those issues with our health and our mental health or type of privacy."
17338.0,Patient,On your lady I learned about that.
760.0,Provider,yeah the law about that there's a whole health care law about that so yeah so that's that's that's what's your in kind of entitled to your your your just just go there do your job. They pay you and you know they're entitled to know where you are and that you're doing your job and that's it.
17338.0,Patient,Sure sure.
760.0,Provider,"yeah not where you are during work hours, I should say so."
17338.0,Patient,"yeah I wanted to touch. base on something that I really forgot and it's very important that I have that today, if possible. My at my work. And they need some kind of. doctor's notes. That i'm taking care, but not only that i'm that. My condition. My current condition."
760.0,Provider,That you're being treated are there yeah do I talk to me yesterday that they were starting to question some of your work.
17338.0,Patient,"And yeah. He said that I work in day that I that i'm a good work on that, but. I I lacked responsibility on the 22nd. i'm not so sure about the third, but I think I went to work that the under 29 I wasn't my right headspace so I couldn't even I didn't even I was in the dark space. I already took care of those days with them, but they want to date they wanted yesterday, but after the meeting, but since we couldn't really."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17338.0,Patient,"So they want some kind of note that Owen is going to mental health issues, or what what. I don't know if you have to be transparent, but they want to see that. As a physician or whoever's taking care of me says, states that. I can more likely have this kind of system, this kind of see this conversative so they have become the files on hr. For whenever I actually called out or for you know can."
760.0,Provider,Okay it's probably my experience that less information. or minimal amount of information is better than just like basically opening everything.
17338.0,Patient,yeah open everything I was naked.
760.0,Provider,"Yet no no in, and we were talking about the health about the health care law there's there's, you have the legal right to confidentiality, so if you need a letter, for your employer what I need your you're going to need to sign a release of information and. I need to know who is who's your employer what's their address what's their phone number and. We can I."
17338.0,Patient,Do what is your email.
760.0,Provider,By the well i'm. l p.
17338.0,Patient,E.
760.0,Provider,A que.
17338.0,Patient,que.
760.0,Provider,"You I no. At bright heart health.com so I. Believe i'm not sure who does the letter for you, because. In full transparency, this is my i've been in mental health for quite some time, but this is my third week here, working with bright heart health."
17338.0,Patient,Services week.
760.0,Provider,"Fourth week working with bright heart health but i've been in mental health from for a long time just with other companies previously. So I need to find out the process of it, I can tell you, generally, what the law says. And that's you have to sign the release. And it's probably better just some general letter stating that you restarted receiving services for your mental health you don't have they don't need to know your diagnosis, they don't need to know the medication you're taking they don't need that. treatment on this date. and You know and. Because there's also protections for your job if if people are struggling with mental health or physical health or even substance abuse. You know and they're seeking treatment, you have the right to."
17338.0,Patient,Listen.
760.0,Provider,"You have the right to the time you need to make those things better. As long as you give them documentation. So you have the time I mean not that these people, the employers don't do things they shouldn't do, but just in just in the United States that's the way it is you take what you know and they'll work with you. So you just let them know and maybe something like. You know you go to a group once weekly, and you, you know."
17338.0,Patient,"yeah they want to know that as well, they want to know the schedule what i'm just so do familiar and they're aware."
760.0,Provider,"So, for example, if I have to be at."
17338.0,Patient,"If I have to be at the meeting, if I have to be an elder she's she actually mentioned that. yeah so. feel free to get."
760.0,Provider,"That today, yes I don't I let me, let me see who I can send a message to kind of shrink down your screen i'll shoot."

17338.0,Patient,"They were expecting it yesterday, but I found that there was a problem with the connection and we rescheduled for today. To get that today."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, well, I just put into request so let's see. Perhaps you can show them the meeting. The meeting links that you were. sent in your phone. Things like that, just to kind of you know, let them know that there's a process to it. And if you're dealing with the HR department i'm sure they're aware there's a process to it and i'll get it to you as soon as I can kind of thing.

760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right. All right, alright so talk to me a little bit about the childhood experiences you don't have to go into the full detail like you did yesterday, but if you could just talk generally about.

17338.0,Patient,"A lot of negative it's. Nothing like out of the ordinary it's just he was selfish and. Just wanted things for himself and like didn't care for what we wanted, or for our right to have our mother, you know. Have a mother."
760.0,Provider,"And wasn't hey verbally hard on the balls to. Okay. All right, i'm sending another message for this letter so bear with me guys oh and."
17338.0,Patient,"It was very sickening no worries, but he had it's like he had two sides. everything he had bipolar or what but. I don't know nothing about his mental health but."
760.0,Provider,Do you suspect there was something going on with his mental health.
17338.0,Patient,"yeah because. Now that i'm grown up, I can kind of like look back and. Look at the facts. And, for example, now that i'm an adult adult I can. Put two information together like he is taking meds I don't know what those meds over. Four years. So at work, would be completely like you know, like super smart and. very, very respected individual but at home, would be like not nothing, nothing that I would see out there. Okay, the complete opposite. it's like you would be sad when you be home for this content or upset and always blaming everything and anything on us so. That was it. Okay, but the more I The more I learned this sense of self respect self value. And I decided I didn't want that life for me anymore, and I learned that because I have a citizenship in the US, I can just go I don't need no one. So I literally will didn't have any savings on it, you only have an honored any $7 plus the kids yeah plus the ticket that I saved for which was $734. And then. I came here, I decided to be homeless. So. For like the beginning my beginning here."
760.0,Provider,"And, and what what age were you when you come back to America. to redefine okay how old, are you now. So that's three years ago, more or less."
17338.0,Patient,For four years.
760.0,Provider,Before you.
17338.0,Patient,came. I came December.
760.0,Provider,2729 11 and.
17338.0,Patient,"December 27 and I got here December 29 of July 17 so 18 1921 almost four years i'm reaching there oh actually yeah a few days to seven to four years. OK, so my beginning here, it was very hard very top of the industry. Where time but I never stopped believing in me, I never I just needed like the golden ticket the good in was in my hand which is my passport my citizenship. So I went to Santa Monica courthouse I went to. The Orange county court like I just looked what my resources are, what can I do to change the situation and I just I expected and I just side effect not not my pride, but like I just understood what I needed to do. That was always there."
760.0,Provider,"So you, you have some level of us, one of my questions is self esteem so there's some there's some part of you that knows you have. A solid team."
17338.0,Patient,Was was not being content with what I would do in the my present situation.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, but you, you have confidence in yourself to achieve and."
17338.0,Patient,"yeah I got you over here, yes. Yes, yes."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, and you're still kind of. it's still I have to caution you all and it's a very challenging thing to come here with that small amount of money it's you know four years may sound like a lot in a lot of ways, but it's you know, over the course of your life it's really not that long. So you have you had a lot of barriers, you have a lot of limitations, you know resource when I."
17338.0,Patient,"played for. yeah would stand so played for Dr generally. And then I don't know I just believe in myself, and when I all the time when I believe in myself everything and anything that I want it happens okay. So everything that i've manifested. it's happening."
760.0,Provider,But there's a process to. That it's not.
17338.0,Patient,"Like it's gonna happen tomorrow, no. I and i'm aware of that, I know that since the beginning I knew that I was going to be the situation, I even thought I was going to be longer and you know in like pretty precarious situation, but actually no my first job was a dishwasher I I create them, the first day."
760.0,Provider,"Really i've never been a dishwasher but actually I think I did do it as. As like maybe 15. I think I did that as well and yeah it's it's upside the guy only did it like one day out of the month, with some special event that only happened one day. A month, but I dreaded though going there to that job so. Doing that full time or even part time on the regular basis that's really a rough."
17338.0,Patient,"it's rough yeah so my mentality is different for was different moments I do things with a purpose of. feeling or getting better like to the other side or improving so I why I did that it's, not because I needed a job, of course I needed a job, but I wanted to have a first experience. At the job that it's not so hard to get but also to kind of like Luke since i'm very good with people and communicating i'm the best at it. I wanted to understand how do people in different departments treat each other how do clients with each other, but first from inside the House from the very back of. The House how what happened, what what what those just there washing washing everyone quiet. doing my job watching everyone watching the manager washing server watching buster is the watching runners watching cooks lines of code everything I was just there looking and doing my job washing bands and."

17338.0,Patient,"yeah the leads they took me to hold cause they don't and. They I think they mistreated me there. um so. They took me there, and you know, took care of me, and all that and everything was an aside feeling better, I suppose, but i'm a person that like. A variable so my analogies my descriptions of things of life are very deep."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17338.0,Patient,"So some people are not prepared for today's conversation, so I thought the kind of treatment that I was getting their kind of I felt kind of like. Naked because you know when they say stripped down your clothes or remove your clothes, so you can wear this suit whatever that is the the the medic you know the one you were the doctor, you have to be you know fully. naked. exposed. So the nurse, that was the guy nurse that was was asking that for me was rude to me is like take down right now and i'm I need to see. Like I felt like what close the door like let me, let me, you know, give me my privacy, so I can change my clothes and i'll give you the Mike votes.

760.0,Provider,You were having you are having kind of a breakdown at the time. yeah but yeah very cool so.
17338.0,Patient,"Anyway, my computer heard he's hearing us. I spoke about hope now I got a notification about hope. Anyway, so that happened and I I told like another nurse no I told that nurse when I actually went back to the room, with him, I told. I said kind of like too deep like you know why people keep being punished or are said or with their lives and all these or just life in general, how it is with humanity. Because of people like you. that are supposed to love the job that they love for if they're doing taking care of other people, you know, like. taking good care of people in general they are being punished, or they hate their jobs, they are not they're doing their jobs for the wrong reasons. Maybe because of the money or what. But not for Jenny Jenny genuine love of taking care of another deep because this what you just showed me it's another. justification of why we all humans are suffering. suffering because of people like you, that you know just you know just anyway, they say they love their jobs, but like they're really just treating people like unfairly. So guys and I have this conditional definition or this breakdown, or what that you're supposed to treat people called it's you know it's because of what he said to me, I said Is this how you treat everyone that you take care said yes we're used to this, this is how we treat everyone. You know, we used to treating people like this, I said what you did not just tell me this for like I was kind of like. heard what you said. So."

But."
760.0,Provider,"You are aggressive with your words, perhaps. Not with your physical not. Like like so."
17338.0,Patient,"yeah but like not like him, you know, like saying the F word. it's just seeing something so calm and like, but that will get to you, to the best of you, you know so anyway, I said that and. He called he went outside and came back with five other nurses or helpers or whatever to to to sedate me by force, like they all came and helped me and like give me like you're aggressive. And they sent me to a 5150. You know what that is. yeah just want to support."
760.0,Provider,We you suicidal at the time.

760.0,Provider,"and any. Other drug was leaving your system, so the paranoia was going away. You were having some time to come down that's you know that's really the purpose. I can't speak to what happened to you, and in the hospital there, but is to give you time to cool down to keep you safe. so that you know your paranoia doesn't have you doing something that is harmful to yourself, or to others yeah.

Whatever way."
760.0,Provider,"To say you're carrying a lot of guilt, perhaps. yeah and you're hard on yourself."
