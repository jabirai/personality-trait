462.0,Provider,hi Angela how are you.
9945.0,Patient,"not very good at the moment. I think i'm in a manic. Well, so I was on the phone with my partner and that's in Canada, with my girlfriend. And I have a guinea pig with my name and sometimes I don't hear the guinea pigs, so all I hear them say something along the lines of like. cuz my nickname is angel and so i'll just hear them go angel and then start doing like baby noises and everything and it just instantly pisses me off because i'm not a baby I don't want to be talked to like a baby, especially if i'm not age regressed so like it pissed me off. And then, it sent me into i'm an angry manic episode against my partner. And then she thought so she has a disorder where words don't always make sense to her, and so a lot of the times she'll say provocative instead of prerogative and she'll say that's your provocative. And in that moment, while I was many it pissed me off, and so I tried to explain to her that prerogative and provocative are two different words they're not just different pronunciations they're entirely different words. And then she got pissed off at me because I was trying to correct her and she said i'm making fun of her disorder. In which case, and I kind of that my backfired that back onto her because she's always telling me like like i'll get into a manic state and I don't know if you've ever dealt with somebody with bipolar to or just bipolar in general. When we get in manic states telling us to stop to that's enough don't do that anymore things like that it doesn't work. Because I can't stop myself how Is anyone else gonna stop me. Like I physically can't shut myself up. To the point she she always ends up saying stuff like. And she's the system to like show isn't up saying something along the lines of. If you don't stop you might lose me if if this keeps happening it's going to be too late, when you've tried to start fixing things and it's like. Why do you need to tell me that. Like it doesn't help my situation. And then I just go non verbal because at that point. i've exploded entirely manic. And then I go non verbal and then now it's flip to i'm not angry anymore, but i'm delving deeper into that manic depression. And it's not a good thing. And it's like I hate this disorder, because no matter what I do. I can't. Just like and I feel like she doesn't understand the fact that I can't just stop it when she says stop. Like when she says stop or. that's enough or anything like that, at that point, it is far too late. You know, and then she says, but I tried telling you to stop beforehand to maneuver more calm. I think she's starting to not understand the fact that, even if I seem calm, I might still be manic."
462.0,Provider,Because like.
9945.0,Patient,"I can have calm manic episodes to where i'm not overtly being completely enraged and freaking out but i'm still manic. And so it's just I feel like she has a lack of understanding there. And so now i'm just depressed hating this disorder because. No matter what I do I can't fix it I can't make it go away, I can't I can then she tried to tell me, she was like this is why you're in therapy. To to try to learn these skills and everything like that, and you just haven't learned them yet and stuff like that and i'm just sitting there like. I also didn't mean to miss the last few sessions either I just genuinely forgot. Like and I genuinely didn't know, I was scheduled last sweet, so I completely spaced it because I have ADHD I don't remember everything. Even if I set reminders, and so it just. i'm just not in a great place mentally right now. And then me and my other partner that I live with, we had a really hard conversation. And he admitted to me that he's completely unhappy. And he feels like he needs to change and that i'm kind of hard to deal with, and everything was all my issues and stuff. he's not breaking up with me any staying with me and he loves me and cares about me but he's just not happy and he's dealing with a lot of stuff by themselves, and I just. I don't know how to help that in itself some kind of change, and I just don't know what to do so i've been trying extra hard last couple of days like cleaning trying to get rid of my stuff like. I don't want to lose him my that's my worst fear. So it's just a lot. And i'm kind of hating my disorders, because maybe if I didn't have. and be better I wouldn't be so messy I wouldn't. know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it was really hard so you know you have these disorders and a lot of time they can, more than anything, just provide helpful framework for how to navigate the world so rather than. hating them, what do you think they're telling you about how you need to navigate relationships in the world."
9945.0,Patient,"not sure. When. i'm in maybe be more cautious before I say things or think more about what I say, but doesn't have a difficulty with that."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, that could be a starting place trying to be more cautious about what you say, think about what you say. How do you think you could develop some awareness around that."
9945.0,Patient,"i'm not sure I don't have any idea how to do that, but. Maybe write something like before I speak if i'm upset or something write it down see if. that's a great sense on paper."
462.0,Provider,"that's a very good idea, so trying to write things out maybe before communicating so in the moment, maybe, excuse me if you realize that the communication seeming really tough. You can say hey I need to take a step back and think about us and we can communicate later, maybe, instead of in the moment kind of spiraling into that state that you just described."
9945.0,Patient,"And the problem is, is when I i've tried that. But sometimes they just not my partner live with more so my girlfriend. she's like she's the type of person that. wants to fix it right, then, and right there. She can't just. Make she doesn't want it to be later or anything like that, but i'm the type of person, where, especially if i'm upset I need my space."
462.0,Provider,That. Compromise there between the two of you a conversation needs to be had otherwise you're just going to continue spiraling in this circle.
9945.0,Patient,"i've been trying. Like like i'll try to say like hey I need to go, or like hey I need to get off the phone. And she'll say i'm trying to use that as an excuse or the I can't go or anything like that and The thing is, when she says that. And it's never intentional when she says that it makes me spiral more, and so, then I start to intentionally say things that bother them and intentionally say things that make them mad or upset or anything, because at that point I am trying to go. And at that point, I I go from. I don't want to hurt their feelings to screw it Fuck it i'm going to do whatever the Fuck it takes to get off this call. or whatever it may be, to the point that. it ends up so bad. That they just want to hang up, because then I get my space."
462.0,Provider,"Right so it's about trying to find a way to prevent that sooner, maybe you write down. How you want to communicate that you need that space and bring it up during a time that things are neutral so not in the moment right, not in the heated moments beforehand and say, from now on, this is what I need to do and i'll let you know by saying some phrase right like. i'm feeling he did I need to take a step back or something that way they know each time that it's just you needing your. space."
9945.0,Patient,And then you have a fast. But. It doesn't work very well because. I mean it works okay and but it's just sometimes it's a little frustrating.
462.0,Provider,"That could be the time to start talking about yeah you have a safe emotional word right like this is the time, where I need emotional safety and for that I need to step away."
9945.0,Patient,"yeah. A little bit hard for me, sometimes because, like I love them dearly, but I feel like i'm not being understood and they don't feel like they're being understood and it's just kind of a constant or."
462.0,Provider,yeah it's really hard it takes a lot of practice to. End like to start a new pattern.
9945.0,Patient,"i'm thinking so I was looking at like some ADHD things just because I was curious because i'm trying to understand my issues more. and I discovered, I think I might not just have ADHD because something's I do have a not on the ADHD spectrum at all. Because like. I have auditory issues like if I get to sensory overloaded, it can cause me to rage response, or I completely flip out not even like angry flip out or manic slip out just like. I need the sound to stop. Because if it doesn't it just drives me nuts. And so i'm thinking."
462.0,Provider,ptsd related.
9945.0,Patient,"I mean, I do have ptsd for sure have heard of me was thinking, maybe it could possibly be low spectrum autism as well. Just because I am already neuro divergent it wouldn't be surprising if I had low spectrum autism, because there are just some things I read about that I resonate with a lot when it comes on to the autism spectrum. And it's just i'm just but part of me is like I don't want to have low spectrum autism or autism in general. Like because that would suck and it would just. add another thing on to all the other things that I have to learn how to deal with."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well. again trying to think of diagnoses rather than changing anything of just as a framework so that very well, could be ptsd. as well and, to be honest, you may never know, but the question is, rather, how can you respond to those symptoms and what can you do to allow yourself to feel safe in that moment."
9945.0,Patient,"Most of the time managers have to move or remove myself from the situation, otherwise I start throwing things."
462.0,Provider,Making.
9945.0,Patient,"Except for in some situations, I can't exactly remove myself like say at work. I hear something or see something that causes a ptsd true because I definitely have ptsd. And then, and then what am I doing I can't just walk off. And so more what ends up happening is somebody in my system takes over. And also, I had like I I have been hating it, but like i've been having a lot more panic attacks and anxiety attacks lately. Like the main one that happened a couple nights ago was because of for my partner is like the fact that he's unhappy and tells me a lot."
462.0,Provider,yeah that is very.
9945.0,Patient,Having a lot of panic attacks and nightmares and. heart.
462.0,Provider,"yeah last time we met, we talked a little bit about setting a morning routine. Trying to kind of stay off social media at the beginning, doing some breathing exercises maybe doing artwork or makeup throughout the week because those are really good coping skills coping skills."
9945.0,Patient,"i've been trying, but for the most part, I haven't been doing those very much at all, because just. With everything going on, I just. haven't even been able to focus on anything much less actually getting ready or. anything like that, like i've been thinking about I was considering possibly today going and getting a haircut. Because I need one, but at the same time i'm just. Once don't know like I just I feel so lost right now. In some ways, and I just want to make things better for my partner, and I want to. make things better for my other partner and everything like that they just it just feels like a can't win, no matter what I do."
462.0,Provider,sounds like part of making things better for them is also focusing on yourself and making things better for yourself.
9945.0,Patient,"Know like one of the things my partner said is like. I need to be more independent. And that I rely on him a bit too much for things. Which is probably true. But it's been hard because, like i'm so used to focusing on everyone else first never putting myself first. And i've always been told well growing up, if I focus on myself i'm a bad person if I focus on myself that's selfish and bad and that I shouldn't do that and that I have to put everyone else first before myself. And so. Trying to rewire that and focus on myself and my therapy healing and. Everything like that feels wrong because. i'm supposed to focus on everyone else right unhealthy everyone else get better."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well that's something to really try to process and work through a little bit that belief that focusing on yourself is selfish. Because actually it, you know it struck me that you said Oh, I need to make things better for my partner and my other partner, but then you didn't say anything about yourself and a big part of that is being able to make things better, for you."
9945.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't know how to because, like, I was so badly been wanting to like. Do this things that I love like makeup and dressing, Nice and art and stuff like that, but every time I go to do that it's just an instant sherbrooke no you shouldn't be doing this for yourself no you can't that that's bad don't do that."
462.0,Provider,what's one saw. promise you could you think you could keep to yourself each day it doesn't even have to be anything big just one very small promise.
9945.0,Patient,i'm not sure what do you mean like I just need an example of what kind of like prompts.
462.0,Provider,"be something like every day i'm going to take 10 minutes in the morning to myself to just drink a cup of tea and just enjoy that moment for myself. could be every day i'm going to do 10 minutes of stretching to give back to my body and calm down a little bit, it could be every day i'm gonna make up on to feel better could be anything that you think. would be a small promise that you could keep that's just one thing."
9945.0,Patient,I mean the easiest thing I can think of right now that I could do is. Every day to color for myself.
462.0,Provider,To call me up a great.
9945.0,Patient,"coloring when I put on a movie and I just color I can like clearly district my mind the coloring in the movie and i'm just fully in myself in those moments, while i'm coloring."
462.0,Provider,"that's a really good idea and a good example colorings great so maybe that can be a goal that we list, for you know, between now and our next session to just. color every day, even if it's just for two minutes at least then you're starting to build trust with yourself that you can keep promises to yourself. and follow up on it."
9945.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that."
462.0,Provider,So that can be one thing another thing you mentioned last time was going to the beach because that's kind of grounding for you have you been to the beach at all.
9945.0,Patient,"No it's kind of hard to go to the beach. Those, we have to drive to the beach, and since I don't know how to. drive I can't really get there myself. But I mean I did tell you how I got that dog right."
462.0,Provider,Yes.
9945.0,Patient,And then we had to take her back to the shelter.
462.0,Provider,yep.
9945.0,Patient,"yeah well me and my partner talked about it and we're not going to get another. i'm not going to try to have a dog at all right now i'm just gonna have. My bunnies and my buddies are perfect PSA is like like Of course I can't cuddle them or anything like I would adopt but they they do the job for me like I can cut them, I can they recognize their names things like that it works. But I just. going for a walk like plus my partner knows me really well and he was just like with how overwhelmed you got just having her mind you, she had a lot of issues, it was like. I don't think you're in a place where you could train the puppy to be your service or your yes, a dog right now, he was like I don't think you're in a place like. To be able to do that and we don't have the space in our House to be able to do that, and so it kind of almost hard to come to terms with, but he was right."
462.0,Provider,"that's a hard situation and very emotional but it sounds like you, you know work through it and found the best solution, which was just a little bit of acceptance that right now, and the time for that."
9945.0,Patient,"yeah but it's just I feel like it's just been one thing hitting me after another recently and it's. Like I had the lesson my hours at work. Like it just. feels like everything is falling apart. Like i'm scared for the one relationship on. Everything is unknown and many other. And then, like As for myself. I keep trying to ignore myself and put my needs last and everything like that that every time I do that it seemed like everything blows up even more. Until it's like. But I don't know how to focus on myself to make everything else, better. Like I have triggers with cleaning, so I have a hard time cleaning the House or even cleaning up my own bedroom or anything like that. And it's just. I know I need to focus on myself, I know I need to find more that thing called self love is. But I just i've been told, so much in my life that will you're worthless you're not worth anything you're just something to us. And i've been told that my whole life so now, when I see like self love posts or even affirmations or things like that that I wish I could say those but every time I try it literally physically cringe and I cannot do it. Like it just the thought of it just makes my skin crawl."
462.0,Provider,yeah it's really hard when you've got those core beliefs sunk in so deep from trauma and beyond.
9945.0,Patient,"Just sucks because, like I know if I was able to get over those humps I was able to. actually be able to just worry about myself and not so much everything and everyone else, and everything it would probably fix a lot of things."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that's something to just think about how you can start doing that and if it feels impossible, a lot of times that indicates either the need for medication. or the need for a higher level of care, meaning either like an Inpatient therapy or intensive outpatient where you're. There many hours a week, getting therapy so that's something to think about for you to you can try like I said to be keeping these small promises to yourself. You know, trying to get back into your art and all of those things that make you feel like yourself, but if it just truly doesn't feel possible then like I said there's two ways to go from their medication trying that or trying a higher amount of therapy a higher level of care."
9945.0,Patient,"Well, I have been thinking about that, I do think it would probably benefit me to try to find the right medication for my bipolar especially. because that seems to be affecting my life hugely recently I don't understand why, but it has been with everything. And I just I desperately need help with it, but i'm very scared to have another allergic reaction or to have. It worse before it gets better."
462.0,Provider,"it's understandable so that's Those are two points that you can reflect on the medication and then the higher level of care and which one or. Both or either seems like maybe the route because i'm definitely hearing that you want to change and you you're trying things, but the. there's a lot at play and you just feel like it's an impossible road and so that's what makes me think okay well if it truly feels that impossible, then there might need to be more of an intervention than just therapy every two weeks."
9945.0,Patient,"that's just I don't like the thought of having to. Because like i've never been in an Inpatient program or an outpatient program so like the thought of those both kind of freaked me out because i've heard some horror stories. But um. I don't know plus It makes me feel like i'm crazy, if I have to have some kind of care, like that. because those are also expensive."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's something you can think about and we could also try to help you with resources if you needed, especially one that would maybe be covered by insurance and really an intensive outpatient would just be doing therapy for several hours a week versus like I said every. Two weeks with us."
9945.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've been seeing you guys, like every week and then."
462.0,Provider,"reality, which is good."
9945.0,Patient,"we've been trying to see you every week, too, but i've been having moments. So."
462.0,Provider,yeah so it's you know it's just something for you to reflect on so you've got a few points on here.
9945.0,Patient,Trying. To think about your self.
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm trying to do your keep your promises to yourself, and maybe the affirmation thing is something. To think about more maybe you can't say an affirmation out loud, but maybe you can write down just one like just write down I am worthy or something very simple and just see how that goes so maybe you're not ready to speak it out, but maybe you can try writing it."
9945.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,see if it makes you cringe as.
9945.0,Patient,"Well, the thing that's also weird is I can read it just fine and like. mm hmm it doesn't bother me it's when I try to speak it that I physically cringe. yeah like maybe I writing it. Okay, I can try that."
462.0,Provider,that's something to try and just kind of see how it goes keep an open mind to it if you feel your skin crawl like you said then just notice that and try to kind of be there and be present with that feeling and take deep breaths.
9945.0,Patient,"Okay, I can try them. So I really do want to get better."
462.0,Provider,yeah. So we.
9945.0,Patient,don't you some.
462.0,Provider,points to think about until look at. How about we do schedule you for again let's see.
9945.0,Patient,I intentionally took Mondays and Tuesdays off for therapy.
462.0,Provider,that's great okay so next Monday is the 13th. Are you available next Monday. Do you want to just go for 2pm again.
9945.0,Patient,yeah that works.
462.0,Provider,"So i'll schedule you for 2pm next Monday I did text you i'll I tell all my patient that's not my personal number. it's just for work it's a Google voice number, so I only see it when i'm working, but if, for some reason you needed to cancel or reschedule an appointment, you could let me know through there."
9945.0,Patient,Okay. I figured it was your personal number.
462.0,Provider,"I just tell everyone that like it's not an emergency line or anything just for scheduling during the during during the day, so I um and have you been having suicidal ideation."
9945.0,Patient,I mean. A couple of days ago I wanted to eat myself into the underworld but I wasn't. Like very bad mental place but I didn't actually want to die.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
9945.0,Patient,"me. at work. In the slightest like I. I did not want to be there at all, and I did not want to have to work or. anything like that I was spiraling very badly, to the point, I just wanted to be in the underworld."
462.0,Provider,Like i'm so.
9945.0,Patient,didn't want to know ideation it was. Extremely low in that regard.
462.0,Provider,"All right, and have you been thinking at all as far as suicide goes about a method or plan that you intend to carry out."
9945.0,Patient,"No mostly just reaches self harm thoughts like really bad self harm dots. Right, but I never do end up going through with any of them or anything like that at all I just get very intense thoughts of it because I did self harm for years and years. When I would stop for a couple of years alone, I self harm again for a few years and then. I haven't self harmed in three years."
462.0,Provider,"Oh wow that's great alright. Alright, so. that's that's a good place to be and you've got a couple of specific goals to think about we've got you in for next week and I will see you in group tomorrow."
9945.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay anything else, I can support you with or any questions about what we discussed."
9945.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so, I think I might just. Think about the outpatient program or medication and then try to focus on my promises of like just coloring for myself."
462.0,Provider,"Great sounds like a good plan alright angel well, then I will see you just tomorrow."
9945.0,Patient,"Alright sounds good, have a good on Jesse."
462.0,Provider,"You too bye now. Okay, can you please note the three goals that she just said there at the end and her treatment plan, this time for the month of December, thank you. Who and note that she has suicidal ideation but no method plan or intent, as well as self harm ideation but plan to carry anything out Thank you."
