226.0,Provider,"You see, on the birth certificate. yeah it's 5050."

226.0,Provider,sees his his your son still breastfeeding. How old is he.
5015.0,Patient,Is 11 months yesterday.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. You might not get 5050 okay. Because it's not realistic, because you're still breastfeeding."
5015.0,Patient,"yeah also and not only that, but I have way, like, I have a lot of. it's not even just he said she said, I have videos and pictures of his abuse and it, he also put jonah in huge danger, just because he was mad at me, so I have video of him driving in the car with."
226.0,Provider,You can put your you can put your hand over the microphone I need your help.
5015.0,Patient,"it's not. Can you hear me, though."
226.0,Provider,A little yeah.
5015.0,Patient,"So I have a video of him. Driving super crazy because he was mad at me and the road up to his house is super scary and he was on that road, and I have. All the video of it, and not just that I have a lot more than that."
226.0,Provider,You have an attorney.
5015.0,Patient,"No, but i'm going to get one. yeah."
226.0,Provider,I think if you can afford to get one that's a good idea.
5015.0,Patient,"yeah and also. He got super mad at me in the car when I saw. The video that I have with him doing that in the car race before that he. lashed out at me at a gas station and. This man happened to see and push joy away from me this guy actually happens to be the chief of the Swat team, and he told me that he will press charges against joey for me and I will have to do anything. So. I could call him anytime I needed and. I think that's a good help to have to."
226.0,Provider,How long ago did that happen.
5015.0,Patient,um this was in the break right before father's day I think it was June 19.
226.0,Provider,Okay. So. Where are you living right now.
5015.0,Patient,My mom's house right now.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and how's it going. Good. They get along with your mom okay. Okay, great okay perfect. And are you working at all, are you just taking care of jonah."
5015.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just taking care of jonah I don't have I want to work, but I don't have a babysitter and. Right now i'm just really focusing on him and art and stuff and I might just end up doing something with my heart."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. Are you going into the groups and, yes, okay all right. So what else, what would be helpful to talk about today it's been a while, I know, and I know you've got a lot going on."
5015.0,Patient,um. I don't know I. kind of curious if you've ever seen a case like what i'm going through and how it has worked out for the other person if the mom has got gotten full custody or if.
226.0,Provider,yeah so typically in California it's really difficult to get full custody unless there's mental health issues.
5015.0,Patient,health issues and addiction issues and he's not doing anything for it.
226.0,Provider,"So, then, that would be stuff that you would bring to your attorney and you would let your attorney now about that. Even with that stuff being brought out, you know they might order like drug testing and. As long as he's testing clean, he can you can still see. See in California, in California their philosophy is to try and keep the family together as much as possible, even though the couple's not together like physically living in the same House together. Their philosophy has really always been to keep the family unit as cohesive as possible, so. You know, it might turn out that. I mean you know these are involved, the process can be kind of long. it's hard to say cuz he's really young and he's still breastfeeding. But it's best to try and get it worked out as much as you can outside of court, if possible, because it ends up costing a ton of money, and it is incredibly stressful."
5015.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm trying to do what he just went for it and i'm. Honestly, I think that if I really like if I get you to me if I show them anything I have. That you will not be granted anytime with jonah so I feel like if he worked out something with me, I would get more time with him, then the courts will, so I tried to tell him that but he's not. Honestly, like even talking to him is so hard he is so irrational and like delusional."
226.0,Provider,Is he actively using.
5015.0,Patient,I think so for sure.
226.0,Provider,Why do you think he's using.
5015.0,Patient,methods.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. So that's a problem if he's using math and any kind of hard drugs math heroin makes it difficult for the other. Parents to be able to be present, with the child so Those are concerns that you definitely need to bring. to your attorney Okay, you can have concerns, and you can say that there needs to be drug testing needs to be done. A psychological evaluations. You know, you want to make sure you hand over all of the videos that you have of the abuse and that might get a little bit tricky they might say, well why didn't you press charges months yeah you know that can go like 10 different ways. So that's why I say you know if you can hire an attorney it might be a really good idea, just because they obviously know the law, I don't and you know, obviously they know the ins and outs of all of that, and the best way to proceed."
5015.0,Patient,Okay. So not in your mouth. Yes. No okay.
226.0,Provider,And then also so just know to that. The courts look at child support separately from child custody issues so Those are two separate things.
5015.0,Patient,Okay. So.
226.0,Provider,"let's see let's see okay so, but he has it he has to he has to pay child support you know in California there's you know the laws are restriction that. We have passed. So you so what you have to do, though, is, you have to fill out like these income declarations, both of you. And you know says what each of you make, and what you have like assets and all that stuff and then the Court will determine like what that child support will be."
5015.0,Patient,yeah What if he won't comply to filling out anything or listening to me about that do I just have to go forward myself.
226.0,Provider,"um yeah so for child support definitely Okay, so you would want to file all the paperwork for child support so like he he can't get out of paying child support."
5015.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,"Okay cuz that's that's basically that's that's the law, they have to pay child support."
5015.0,Patient,Right right. See I i'm just like not that kind of person i've been trying to give him a break like thinking he's gonna come around he's gonna. hey he's gonna help but i'm gonna have to go and really push it.
226.0,Provider,"Well, and don't forget. Like if he's. If he's actively using then you're not going to get very far with them."
5015.0,Patient,Right.
226.0,Provider,"You know that's that's an issue. it's not going to cooperate, it is going to be really erotic up and down nice one day mean the other."
5015.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So it's hard to talk sense into somebody or have a like a you know, a rational conversation, especially with somebody."
5015.0,Patient,"yeah seriously and I don't think it's only math he really likes pills to like when I was there, he was totally sneaking pills and that's another reason that we left. For for pills like. Yes, and. yeah so and then he told me, the other day that he would rather neither of us have our son. Then. me happen, he would rather be a frickin orphan I mean there's no way he has our son's best interest in mind if you could even say that, like I said this all stems from his anger towards me. Just because I don't. be with them, or something like that."
226.0,Provider,"yeah definitely so you know you just want to make sure that your son, not in the middle. yeah don't say anything negative about God ever you don't let him know your feelings about your dad."
5015.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,You just don't do that because it's really traumatizing for kids. Well yeah.
5015.0,Patient,"there's no way I would want to do that, to my child and he told me that he's going to let jonah know how terrible. I know."
226.0,Provider,"I know I mean you know I faced I hear that all the time, you know and look at you have no control over what he does or says he might you know but jonah will get to a place where he makes some choices and decisions oh. No that's you can't worry about that, like he's. he's speaking out of. Just anger and you know feeling the loss of you guys leaving so."
5015.0,Patient,"yeah for sure yeah no I don't worry too much about it, it just makes me see that he really isn't clear and that he doesn't isn't thinking about jonah's feelings."
226.0,Provider,"Absolutely that's what happens, unfortunately, it happens all too often. So you know you just stay really present for jonah and you know you just do what you do and you stay clean and he go to your group and you meet with me and you know you just you put one foot in front of the other."
5015.0,Patient,sure.
226.0,Provider,I know it's hard it's stressful really stressful time.
5015.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I know. It is it's sucks awful. But just keep your perspective, keep your focus your focus is jonah focuses, you know, being a really great mom that you are and staying clean and. and yeah. And so we have another appointment set on the 21st. at two is that still going to work."
5015.0,Patient,We first set to yeah yeah um I will write that down planner I don't think I knew about that one but i'll make sure. it's right yeah.
226.0,Provider,yeah I think what they did is they set that because we haven't seen each other in a while.
5015.0,Patient,All right.
226.0,Provider,"and his group going Okay, for you."
5015.0,Patient,"I have a question. I am going to be out of town, starting from the 10th to the 15th. And I was late on my surveys and my drug screen and. So my medication is split and for. Right, maybe town is there anything I could do about that that you know of."
