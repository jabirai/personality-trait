8079.0,Patient,"how's it going. All right, I just got the phone i've got in a fight about money. Some money has to, for you know. School is not give me didn't give me new as much money as I want it when need to not have to work full time. So i'm trying to correct that with them, but I asked for a break. from her for till after Friday when I get this exam done and then. i'll be able to focus on that, but you know she you know talks about how she stressed out about asking me for money and stuff like that and I bought this because I. You know i'm responsive to that i'm aware of the debt and really, really, really irks me when people again what people say shit that I didn't do. As you don't have to chase after me about money you don't do any of that but. Just you know I heard you. Know she's. She was erratic. POPs in her head she just says no."
416.0,Provider,And how did you respond to that.
8079.0,Patient,"Well, I told her you know just calm the Fuck down because they are you not to chase after you buy anything, because I am aware of it, and I heard you and pay you some money already i'm aware that i'll get to you have to Friday. But you know when when we hold up I just pay the rest of it because it'll leave me with nothing but i'm just done, I don't want to talk about this shit anymore with her, and I appreciate that you mentioned to me no me wrong, I needed it a month ago, but. What I don't like again it's just been accused of something I didn't do if I know her waves, not to remind you about me you like to remind me about shit. I haven't been telling you what's going on the whole time so that's what I told her you know, and so I said I like it now what is i'm done. And I met that actually kind of cosmically Lacey Sydney I think we're coming to a decision here. That right now i'm angry so i'm feeling a little callous but."
416.0,Provider,feeling it.
8079.0,Patient,"No, no yeah that's it's the mechanics of the relationship I don't like I mean I like her, I like i'm trying to turn on I wish I could enjoy I really do, but you know what Hers is too much is too erratic and it's too. inconsistent and is to mercurial and I can I can't i'm too high energy and it's just not working from the emotion. Just too much, so I hope to get this money from my school I think they made a mistake in their accounting if it does, that I have resources for which to you know get out of here if it doesn't if they don't give me anything, then i'm in serious I mean. I know I figured out but it'll be listed for it. I won't have the resources."
416.0,Provider,"So if you do assuming you do get that money, what is the plan."
8079.0,Patient,"You know i'm going to try to wrap my fears up, I mean I fortunate, I came here, with everything that can fit in the car load so that's not. that's not I don't have to you know I can leave, but I do have some stuff in storage San Francisco which is costing me, you know, so my goal is to I want to get to Atlanta. I want to get to Atlanta I think that's the next, the next step, I like to try. So."
416.0,Provider,"about that, before, what do you have people in Atlanta."
8079.0,Patient,"I don't know a single person, but I mean I don't that's not for me it doesn't matter, but it is interesting is closer to my mother in DC, so I would like to be able to do that she's getting older and. Even with all this shit with my brother, you know, I just want to be able to see her more regularly and my father to because all that's you know it's kind of all within eight hours of each other. So Atlanta Plus i've never been there and plus I know for African Americans for middle class African Americans up into the class African American systems to be a Mecca you probably heard that and. And you know also I have been attending. online. The black and poly Atlanta groups of black and polyamorous there's a group on meetup that you know. in any way they haven't done a couple of their meetings and it's great it is really good to be in a space like that. With exclusively black people who are all talking, you know it's the same stuff like about polyamory and stuff like that in open relationships and all that and but it's just. You know, it sounds sonic, no, no."
416.0,Provider,It sounds like you feel like you feel a sense of belonging.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely and it's just really nice. I get the sense that if i'm going to find a partner there i'm looking for that kind of community, I have a better shot, there is no guarantee of course I have a better shot. So it's a thought I mean i'm not. If I go there, I don't like it okay I leave doesn't well."
416.0,Provider,I mean there's always going to be things you do and don't like about every place.
8079.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's cold over. Well it's not cool I mean it gets know what twice a year, and they shut down the city or something like that that's the."
416.0,Provider,that's the joke right in Atlanta they do.
8079.0,Patient,yeah they get like a like a you know they're like a few flakes and they shut down and city.
416.0,Provider,funny.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah because they don't have any equipment to do to deal with us know. and we'll quickly, I was on this zoom call the folks from New Jersey and New York and Chicago who are transplanted to Atlanta, and they were talking about oh you guys ages, you know this is. You guys have no idea what cold is you can say, I have no idea now i'm from Detroit so yeah. yeah. I think that I think there may be a good move. Although I do want to get la. In there somehow because i've got friends in La who missed me and I missed them. I would like to spend some time with them. Before going or. Somehow."
416.0,Provider,That would be cool.
8079.0,Patient,it'd be very cool.
416.0,Provider,I this is part of that community that you had talked about before.
8079.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I mean, I know so i've met some just fascinated people this guy his name is Nick and he is a. Well, known as a Hollywood producer and he's got you know, he was a career in the industry and TV and movies and he's just a fascinating character you."
416.0,Provider,See the one that you were telling me about that lives in West Hollywood as the glory hole.
8079.0,Patient,yeah he's one of the most popular people.
416.0,Provider,yeah you were telling me about him.
8079.0,Patient,"I talked to him for two hours, he would be on the phone you know just because there's a couple weeks ago but. me rolling. he's moving to a new house nice big house and stuff like that, and still in Hollywood area. So anyway, and then you know just just just folks and I just feel like I need that."
416.0,Provider,"So, with the thing with Leah I mean you kind of came into this yeah it's the understanding that like you were going to be monogamous with her, you are going to give it a shot. And if it didn't work out you were going to be able to kind of walk away, knowing that it with no regrets right, knowing that you gave it your all. Do you feel like that's the case here."
8079.0,Patient,"Well, actually that's good that's a good question because that was one thing I did want to talk to you about there's something that blocks me when it comes to being. I feel like I don't want to be able to desire her, and I wonder if it's her any woman. That I have trouble letting myself be vulnerable to."
416.0,Provider,Can you give me an example of how you're not allowing yourself to be vulnerable like emotionally or physically or both or.
8079.0,Patient,"Both right either I mean the first one, I see okay yeah attracted but then after well you know, like she's kind of my nerves or something but we're just you know, a few days of being around here, I also don't want to. don't want to. tell her i'm attracted to her or act like i'm attracted to her. Because it feels like i'm good i'm weak somehow i'm vulnerable and subject to her. Not controlling tendencies. Like that feeling."
416.0,Provider,I mean yeah. I wouldn't like that feeling either I don't think most people would like that feeling. Her tendency to try to control and dictate your actions and your responses to things are causing you to pull back is what i'm hearing pull away from her.
8079.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly, I mean maybe What, for example. i'll double albuquerque I may say something like oh that's our town is a rough over there and it's tiny towns Nice. And she doesn't want to hear anything negative, but she doesn't want me to make a negative comment about this whole city, because she because I should be grateful to be here in a space where I can study. This is where I really lose it because, again I didn't say I wasn't grateful I didn't say I don't appreciate the opportunity and the flexibility with the money and things like that. But if you don't want to hear I make observations you know I mean I look around. it's gonna do one or the other, and it really."
416.0,Provider,"Just me off, I can see why yeah so I mean i'm not hearing like a. How do I say this i'm not hearing an A weird response to things I mean i'm hearing that. There are things that are getting in between you and your responses to pull away from her, I think it would be. I think it would be odd kind of not a natural response if you were feeling a certain way and responding to her a certain way, and then saying still like here, please let me be vulnerable and open my heart to you. Right, I mean I. yeah I think that's good does that sound right to you."
8079.0,Patient,"yeah yeah you know and again. Remember, this was one of the selling points with Lisa, and this is actually. Wrong is that was it was wrong. There it was helpful to have another standard to have a reference point emotionally this you know, this is a woman doesn't mean, I have to endure certain things that. You know just aren't pleasant."
416.0,Provider,yeah temperament wise even Lisa were really good fit.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely absolutely and we, and we can have difficult conversations and I remember having difficult conversations, for her and. I mean, I could feel the urge to you know to to react, but it would never ever never get to that point with it i've never done that, with her. At all the time i'm doing it with I mean because I never get to the point where i'm feeling attacked or I feel like I can't express myself and be heard. So yeah I mean that's just to say that. i'm becoming real. clear that this is not good."
416.0,Provider,So. Do you feel like you'll be able to walk away and go yeah you know I really gave this a try.
8079.0,Patient,yeah I don't think I think so yeah i'm pretty sure about that yeah okay.
416.0,Provider,"I think you did I mean I from my outside perspective, I think that you have given it a really solid try right there's been a lot of communication there's you've cut off the other connections right. and Here you are right, like really giving it this effort, but. But it isn't working. And you knew it might not you knew she might not be the girl for you right exactly that's right exactly."
8079.0,Patient,And then i'm having these other kinds of situations where folks and beginning to imagine possibilities so being in relationships with someone who.
416.0,Provider,And maybe with We talked a lot about masculinity. You and masculinity so important to you right such a big theme in your life and you and Leah have really different definitions of what masculinity is. And it's a square peg in a round hole in some ways right because she really needs you to be this other version of like her version of masculinity and you really need to be your much more flexible version more modern version of masculinity. yeah just seems like kind of a mismatch.
8079.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah that comes up a lot. And that brings up actually my father, I was just talking to him about 40 minutes ago, and because I called him, they were in Pittsburgh doing with my past his sister and they Laurel and my dad. Ever tell you i'm lending a junior and he's Leonard senior. Oh. yeah i'm i'm linney my family."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, is that a name you like."
8079.0,Patient,Oh it's fine yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,it's kind of cute.
8079.0,Patient,yeah it's funny I grew up with these fine.
416.0,Provider,Leah Leah was cute too.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah well yeah some yeah some folks my Korean students used to just call me Leo Mr Leo because then it isn't in Korea is a little harder to talk to say. I funny yeah. No yeah so I just talked to him, they got better choice they drove back in last night, but I realized this last week and then, when my father, when my when my dad died on Sunday and then now just now, a few minutes ago, my father. He is so emotionally. incapable, the man is he so instrumental in his grief, you know what I like it's like he says well you know we're going to get you the link and you know it's being streamed and any any repeats himself so much like do you know you know her, she her husband Alan right yeah I like that. yeah I don't know man, since I was a kid like you know he died and. Then so he's he just cannot. he's so mostly blocked."
416.0,Provider,And this is his sister right.
8079.0,Patient,"Yes, sister, I mean I would I put his sister was in the hospital he wanted to check how you doing what's going on what's going on out there how's the weather. Okay. Fine, you want to touch it Okay, but."
416.0,Provider,remember how we were talking about trauma responses.
8079.0,Patient,that's true.
416.0,Provider,grief responses My guess is that that's his right he just doesn't have the emotional bandwidth he doesn't have any idea how to do that it wasn't it wasn't permitted for him. Even more probably than it was permitted for you.
8079.0,Patient,"Know there's two things about my father I learned one recently the one I knew but i've been together but explain, I think, someone Mr he is where he is because you were saying with regards to your mother that you know understanding is forgiveness right understanding. and You know one he was a moved shifted around a lot as a kid I mean because it might hit my grandfather was a tournament united Methodist minister and we traveled churches and stuff. yeah and and so he was always shopped around i've definitely West West Virginia that's very different homes or relatives stuff like that every two years or so. So I think that there's some damage, I mean it's just unstable and he developed a hard shell. But also, when he was in charleston West Virginia staying with this crazy old back and I i'm very well aware of my language here is very derogatory with this i'm very angry this woman is old black woman who undefined on there, and she and her little crazy self. made this eight Year 10 year old boy whatever he was. kill a bag for the kittens you know. because she didn't want him. told him to do it. yeah yeah for real I mean that's what he did, and he did it and what could he do I mean was volume, he has his living there, his. He had to deal with it, you know. And he has probably cats and we had cats growing up, and he will always be. Oh boy yeah. yeah so either either drowned in my stone denied the story changes. yeah it is, I mean I love cats have a dog, you know. So that's why I didn't even notice woman, but."
416.0,Provider,"But it is really sort of emblematic of. of how there was no room for him to have emotions, he was expected to be a robot right. And so it's not surprising that here, he is right that he doesn't have know how to access that part of himself and so he is going to be kind of a robot. Through your auntie stuff and service and that's his trauma response because he doesn't he was never permitted to have anything else yeah yeah."
8079.0,Patient,"yeah they came they really hit me over the last week or so talking with him i'm like man, you really are and you know. It I think it's a whole family to some degree, I mean. Because I was in a call them on Sunday and they put me on speaker with all my aunts his sisters, you know your forces this and diane when he died is the oldest of that of that for. And they're all laughing joking, you know hey lenny Jay Jay. Jay Happy Birthday my birthday is October 17 This is my."
416.0,Provider,birthday.
8079.0,Patient,"Thank you 53 come around coming up. And you know even Jay and you know there's like last night his birthday yeah no yes, it is, and they start laughing and the woman is dead right dash. Five minutes to go, and you know, and they are cracking up on the phone and Laurel is like yeah this is weird. But whatever role where that."
416.0,Provider,yeah people have interesting responses to grief. and pain and emotional outlets.
8079.0,Patient,"You know, and so true i've seen out, you know now, you say that i'm like Why can I connect my chaplaincy experience with my life and I shouldn't be surprised i've seen some of that you know the hospitals and stuff that. rooms. But just expected for my family just."
416.0,Provider,"Well yeah yeah different expectations of your family but. yeah yeah your dad just doesn't have the I mean poor guy. He just doesn't have that skill is not there, so it's just not there. What would happen if you ever acknowledged that to him if you just said that it's Okay, I know it's really hard for you to express emotion. Nobody What would it, what do you think you would say."
8079.0,Patient,"Oh, he would, oh no i'm fine you know, and you know hey listen I like I like feedback I like to know cuz you know i'm trying to be good Christian and like. Okay."
416.0,Provider,"I like feedback, but not emotion, yes right yeah that's right that's a good point yeah no he doesn't do emotion. can say the word."
8079.0,Patient,"No, no right yeah trying to pin him down like that is very hard. streaming elusive I need a slippery. slope side of stuff."
416.0,Provider,perfected it many years.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah he's got it down I did tell him one time this is some weeks ago a month ago, so. on a whim, I said, you know that I kind of understand why you the backyard thing you know, took me out there Okay, I think I may have told you this, but. You know I said yeah I can understand that, I mean because you I was so I was so opposite of you like. Again, I like I said I was always extremely sensitive kid in them. And he just didn't have a clue and now he clearly didn't have a clue what to do with all that I was a bundle of emotion. For him yeah that was. completed."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8079.0,Patient,I just don't get this kid at all.
416.0,Provider,You might as well be speaking in Chinese.
8079.0,Patient,"Absolutely absolutely I know, so I kind of cracks me up but."
416.0,Provider,"it's you know it's funny, though, is it's cracking you up now right that's you yeah I mean when we talked about when we used to talk about this, you would get so angry. And I I see the change right now you're able to be like well it's kind of funny it's kind of sad, I mean it is what it is. It sucks for him it's X, for me, in some ways, but like you're not it doesn't seem like you're taking it as personally you're you're having a more lighthearted response to his limitations now."
8079.0,Patient,"would help was the last meeting when you said it, so that you know i'm just different from them and it's just not a good fit it's not the best fit. I mean, but I never I never thought of myself that way like i'm just different and it's okay."
416.0,Provider,I mean it's kind of great actually.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah I think so yeah this I like it, I like I like me. As my fact as a matter of fact, I can we talk about group on Monday. yeah yeah as well, because I, on Monday you're asking the question you know. You know how's everybody doing with you know emotions and that kind of the negative stuff and I kind of lift on my on my past because um. You know, honestly, I really had a good week last friday's exam. I gotta tell you I don't know how unusual, this is when I meet with my committee they'll tell me, I guess, but now is that I answer the questions I know, three out of six questions to get to five questions. I from memory cited the sources, where they are in the books, I read. it's a closed book exam yeah I mean I didn't even get to do all that I knew, because the questions were asked what I read and I was like us. But I just did is I got this so I cited the so and I had to write a letter I said listen, you know this, I didn't look at the books, because it's all on the honor system they just give you an exam eternity and four hours later and. I said look I didn't look at the books these I know it's gonna look like idea because i'm citing page whatever, but this author says this, but no it's all from me. So I don't know, I was kind of feel like the shift over the next."
416.0,Provider,"You said as well, you should."
8079.0,Patient,"I just you know i'm like wow what a fucking gift, I mean would it give me i'm seriously I do there are moments, where I get really grateful because. Whatever it is this is a gift, you know it's not like i'm so great at myself but. I. Just enjoy it yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah you're just you're you've cleared out a lot of the noise right and so that you have access to. That higher level of thinking better version of yourself and you've done that you're you you've worked really hard to get to that point. But it's really cool that you're seeing like oh my gosh my brain doesn't have to be confused and fuzzy and all over the place, like, I actually can be really focused and when i'm focused i'm kind of a badass."
8079.0,Patient,Exactly exactly.
416.0,Provider,Very amazing.
8079.0,Patient,"I am enjoying yes, thank you, it really feels good and. I just want to whatever you know got a birthday coming up 53 whatever whatever time I got left, I want to just have the ball I just wanna I cried on last Friday evening after the exam took myself to a movie so venom, by the way, i'm referring to that, but."
416.0,Provider,love it.
8079.0,Patient,love it okay.
416.0,Provider,I i'm i'm all about marvel.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah me too definitely like do so it was cool and. and afterwards I sent the parking lot of the car and I just kind of bold for a while, because I just. You know, I was grateful, so thank you and then please let me not end up where I started be different and where I started because i'm looking at my aunt. You know who was a crotchety old is she was nice person, but you know that whole family, I mean just you know it's kind of sad for you look at that family look to hurry like Fuck man, it could have been so much more you know but. She was a crotchety person and. I said, Lord please just don't Let me end up where I started just let me be different."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I don't think that you could end up where you started and because you've developed a new path you have a new roadmap now. Right and it's sort of like. So this isn't it like directly I don't know but it's similar in my mind when when we work with people who have drug addictions right. The first time somebody with a drug addiction gets goes into recovery and they start learning about their addiction and they start learning about themselves in different ways, and what. Their triggers are and what recovery feels like and looks like and how their life is different in recovery, they may still relapse and they probably will. there's going to be there's going to be bumps in the road for them, but they have a roadmap now to know what's possible and. And, and that changes everything right you're never going to like have the same experience you might fall backwards, a little bit, but um. But now you know what it feels like to feel good and to be a healthier version of yourself so even when you fall backward it's never going to be exactly the same yeah yeah right yeah and do you have a clear path to move forward. You know what works, no works yeah that's true."
8079.0,Patient,"that's remarkable actually. My brain is spinning theologically because. Of the exam on Friday so that's coming up, but i'm. Just a little bit of light it's all it takes just a little bit little bit of a glimpse just a taste of that is enough to bring this enough to anchor a person. It can be sometimes, no, no."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah anyway Okay, so I am. Oh, that reminds me as well, you talking about. Well it's not it's not a good segue so it's just a right turn here."
416.0,Provider,turn away.
8079.0,Patient,But about group on Monday.
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah okay.
8079.0,Patient,"I gotta tell you, so I did mostly listen, which is fine, and then we get to and then, and then you know gabby. reveals what should we be oh my God. But yo I thought I thought this will be the moment when the group which shift with get into we sync from the support you know discord sending each other pictures of dogs and cats and. You know, food because that's all they have and all that stuff I thought it was finally sit down to okay now we're going to really deal with each other, because. I, I could not believe, and you tell me what you feel and maybe other people how they feel, but when kyle opened his fucking mouth about his experience and really nice can relate to get this. Oh shit dude you fucking kidding me you I mean I just thought that would be the moment I thought someone's going to rip on him and tearing him like shut the Fuck up. And you know, nobody, you know that didn't seem to happen. and on discord doesn't seem to be happening. Because they continue the conversation and discord gabby and Kelly and kyle. And it's all mutual support and loving and cows on the by his. Look, I i'm not here to disrupt for me, let me just and The reason I say that is because, if it were, let me translate this to a racial discussion, if I had said something to somebody else's system they're not being black. or whatever. And he jumped in and said, well, I can relate, because you know I have this is. Just let me know now i'm going to lose my fucking mind on this too. And we'll let him have it, and you know, and I get caught I do we share some things with me about his background and discord and messages and he's had a rough situation. His brother is. fucked up just like mine is but um. But still. So I don't know I anyway, I just wanted to say that I had to get that out, I did I did yeah I didn't get it out."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I think that is fair. i'm sure you are not the only person who had that response to it."
8079.0,Patient,You know yeah.
416.0,Provider,And there are there are reasons why everybody is in that group yeah okay all right. yeah yeah and I supported if somebody wants to step up and say. hey that's not the same at all. If your pain is valid. And it's not the same.
8079.0,Patient,Interest he's the only guy he's only male this said anything right in the middle identify person that said anything. You know even Hugh and they did not say anything right. Because this is just not the anything like that about themselves. is just not. I just went.
416.0,Provider,yeah get be such a love to.
8079.0,Patient,ya know it's great I mean I really feel you know that's just I.
416.0,Provider,"It says a lot, though, that I mean people divulge they disclose a lot in that group that they may be wouldn't otherwise disclose i'm in it in a different category, like their people feel pretty safe, I think. Touching those things."
8079.0,Patient,You know yeah and I can't even imagine it being any different I mean I don't know how you were mentioning how the goods run there and i'm like man this this is this isn't even where you know my been deeper group experiences. You know.
416.0,Provider,"Well it's hard because of the. You know, since it's not a solid group, like people come and go still so that makes it a little more difficult to get the."
8079.0,Patient,Oh absolutely know. That yeah the bill to get that core and deepen. yeah I have to do the not totally do that and everything so. i'm glad that the group has the kind of intimacy.
416.0,Provider,yeah you guys are so great about embracing the people who come in and. showing them support.
8079.0,Patient,"yeah since that's the that's the mode at the moment, so yeah as well and and and. Some of the stories folks have shared so far. You know Natasha I believe or no with no she was new this past time, but it was somebody else machine is. The woman who lost her son in a car accident, I can."
416.0,Provider,I think that I think her name is Natasha.
8079.0,Patient,Just.
416.0,Provider,Let me just my two children.
8079.0,Patient,that's right.
416.0,Provider,"yeah it's really kind of turned in a lot of ways they lead to a grief group. And it feels really necessary, like let's just support each other through some grief."
8079.0,Patient,yeah no that's that's good.
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah kind of wasn't expecting that it took a little bit of a right turn on me but.
8079.0,Patient,I was gonna say I. mean it's okay well I.
416.0,Provider,i'm very willing to go wherever people need to go.
8079.0,Patient,"But you know it might be the way this group has to function, because you know, since it to me in my view, anyway, it seems like the superficial thing is so such a habit. it's so hard to break a habit that you know grief, something that you know sort of that kind of cuts through that and it allows me to still be supportive and hopefully eventually can lead to something."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8079.0,Patient,that's My guess anyway.
416.0,Provider,"And if if people are really stuck in grief right if you aren't able to move through it, or if you're avoiding or you know, trying to go around it or you're just so bogged down by it. Of course you're going to feel depressed of course you're going to feel anxious right, so it if that's the sticking point then it needs to be discussed it needs to be brought up and addressed."
8079.0,Patient,yeah that's true that's true yeah.
416.0,Provider,that's okay we'll do it.
8079.0,Patient,yeah ya know exactly exactly so um well yeah so I was. That was an interesting.
416.0,Provider,"I see here, I see your point on that. just leave it will leave it at that yeah."
8079.0,Patient,"Exactly and i'm all right, I am."
416.0,Provider,"And and i'll say it again, I do encourage you, if you start to feel like. I said that something needs to be said, oh, you know I support you speaking up."
8079.0,Patient,"yeah Jesus and I gotta take on, you know I don't know I mean, yes, clearly, I mean there's a lot he gives me a lot of opportunities to do so, and again I want to do it for his benefit is not like you know just I know I get irritated but it's it's it's also because. But. I don't know if I want to be the one, because I can see the group to reacting in the underscore their refund the new one and i'm not even on the on there, but they're like Linda well you saw me. Okay write down the bad guy. In that and I actually replicates a little bit of my family that's why i'm a little hesitant with that that opportunity, yes i'm the one well, I mean i'm not the only one who sees i'm sure, but I may be doing when he speaks or the first to speak on this and then. you're messing up our group. We had a nice party party pooper."
416.0,Provider,yeah we're in the middle of a love fest where we ignore everything unpleasant. So how dare you spoil that it's something that's actually real and important to discuss Leonard right exactly.
8079.0,Patient,that's my mother's day that's why.
416.0,Provider,can't you just keep everything pleasant.
8079.0,Patient,You know.
416.0,Provider,How dare you speak up and make things messy.
8079.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah exactly.
416.0,Provider,I mean okay. And sometimes things need to get messy because they get better afterwards.
8079.0,Patient,"Yes, that is true and I this might be in the opportunity to do that with in this group might be a way to. To again navigate some of that stuff with my family to do it in a way that's. Constructive and. work through all the reactions so."
416.0,Provider,"So, so if it comes up and you feel like you need to say something. Give me a little signal and group and i'll support you, through it, so if you start to kind of get into a place where what you're saying isn't productive where you, you know. I can, I can kind of help redirect you I can without being mean about it, or whatever, but I can help redirect you or I can help you rephrase things um. I can kind of mediate. To keep that to keep it okay right, I mean that's my job as the facilitator anyway, but I would also, so I wouldn't just keep the other person safe I would work very hard to keep you and your communication safety, so that it's not like off the rails."
8079.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely yeah damage that's helpful um I will I will really seriously do that and if what happened on Monday this had happened earlier in group, you know not like, with two minutes ago, then maybe you know something my head space for that, but. yeah but thank you for that that's helpful that's good to know."
416.0,Provider,"You do, and I know group it's funny groups are always so interesting they bring up so many I mean we all go into them with our own family dynamics right in the background. So that's what that is it's a big. Everybody brings themselves and their issues and their communication style and all of that, and like yeah we're in a love fest right now I fully expect that at some point, somebody is going to disrupt the love fest and. And I think it'll be really healthy when it happens and i'm okay with it and i'm just sort of waiting for it."

I missed those folks actually I could feel that I could fill their absence, and so I feel like okay there's some kind of cohesion happen here when someone's missing, I feel it yeah yeah."
