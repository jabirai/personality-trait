Because I feel like Maybe it was just worried because I felt like always needed to be on Admiral but I didn't like the possibility that lateral was like like a cocaine or something. And it scared me. yeah so when you told me that it's like a like it doesn't have that then like i'm i'm pretty willing to try it as long as it's not like a drug drug.
498.0,Provider,"Okay well it's like I said it's not a it's not am. A stimulant it does have a stimulative effect so people who suffer with a company like anxiety in addition to difficulty with attention and focus and concentration it's ideal for. Because it doesn't exacerbate anxiety in the way that stimulated. And it's still have to be mindful that if the call some GI upset. And again, it does have that stimulative activity, however. It doesn't hit as hard it's really like a gradual climb when you take out Raul you take it one day and you fill it the next. what's trendy or you feel the effects over a few."
14869.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,Excuse me.

498.0,Provider,"It does not have any report i'm exacerbating any local or suicidal ideation well we do educate people on. The. side effect of insomnia, and it can cause some dry mouth and constipation and decrease an appetite and beer for weight loss and I mentioned the GI upset. headaches dizziness and you should not open the capsules because if you open them, it can cause irritation to the eyes and we always screen or prospective patients for the medication for any historical cardiac issues."
14869.0,Patient,"um no I don't have any, not that I remember, I mean. No, no i'm good."
498.0,Provider,"Well, like I said the medication itself is it targets. Concentration attention span depressed mood as well and in can cause some anxiety because it does have a stimulant effect but it's not the kind of anxiety. anxiety exacerbation that is a company by step of stimulants so again side effects can present during like medication induction but it tapers off over the first two weeks takes about three to four weeks in order to really get a good overall perceived benefit from the medication."
14869.0,Patient,"Okay, so I have a concern. If I lose medical do I lose all this treatment like if I lose medical."
498.0,Provider,"And that's more of a question for case management. yeah i'm not sure how to answer that question if medical is your current ensure an insurance provider and they're covering your treatment. It may not be a case of where you lose treatment, but you may be financially responsible for treatment, but that's. that's like a again that's a case management question because there might be some other alternatives for you as well."

If I get a job they're going to kick me off, and I have to like start over again so. um."
498.0,Provider,"I wouldn't I wouldn't not necessarily. consider that the case like I said there may be some other alternatives. But i'll have someone from case management reach out to you directly, like answer any questions that you may have regarding it okay."
