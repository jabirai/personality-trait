And I didn't even say anything I just in my head i'm having this conversation with myself and donate donate donate and I was fine I didn't I did put the chips in a bowl for the kids so the bag wasn't sitting on the table."
79.0,Provider,So it.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah that way I didn't see the bag and then. The other bag, because my husband was eating different chips there was this. Paper towel big big paper towel roll that I just put in front of the bag of his chips, so I went to his chips because he was sitting across from me, so I didn't even see him they're eating them. didn't even bother me I was fine and then the next day, not so much, but I still did somewhat probably like. mediocre kind of thing like I was aware, but I still didn't over indulge but still ate but didn't eat. didn't eat healthy, I think that morning the morning we had chocolate chip waffles for breakfast. So I think I had like."

14394.0,Patient,"yeah we brought our bikes and I was constantly like doing stuff because there was no TV and the Internet didn't work so you're kind of like. do things so we found ourselves walking around and biking and stuff so um and then the the last day the kids wanted to go out for ice cream, so I got. One ice cream and then, then I didn't like Oh, you need that or you need that I just ate mine and then that was it. So, and then on the oh, and then I did get into some starburst so I was good, but not good so better better than what I thought the last day I think was the worst, for me, because we. I was just kind of like Oh well, you know you've ruined it already so but still I wasn't super bad either so."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was your favorite thing there that you saw."
14394.0,Patient,"um I think it probably was they have like domestic side like deer. That just kind of Luna do. bred to feed the ducks in the morning when we went out. For a beer i'm over yeah the deer is like looking at her like what are you, what are we doing we're like trying to your real quiet and like. Talking real quiet and they ate all our bread and then, when we got the right was done, they just turned around and walked away so that was kind of cool."
79.0,Provider,"That is funny. Q and the kids had a good time. yeah good that's awesome nice well good I mean yeah sounds like you had some good learning experiences, and you know tried to did you eat pretty regularly. like China. yeah."
14394.0,Patient,"To try to do, like every three to four hours."
79.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14394.0,Patient,"And then, when we came home, I tried to stay in that like because my thing is, I can eat i'll eat breakfast in the morning and then i'll leave all day i'll be like i'll come around to and then i'll eat at all, so I can throw granola bars in my purse. You know, an apple or a piece of fruit or something so I have been trying to do that and I got the granola bars that we talked about like the nature nature green ones opt in green and they come in to like you open one packet and there's like two flat ones."
79.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"So, like one if it's just like a snack or if I feel like my i'm like I have a hunger pain."
79.0,Provider,Right yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Trying to listen to my body. I might take, like a bite or two of it and then put it as if I eat more i'll just eat all of it mm hmm. yeah."
79.0,Provider,"i've just finished it yeah no it's true that tell me what you give me 25 every causes from yesterday just kind of go through the day for from today, like what you had for breakfast."
14394.0,Patient,"Okay, I woke up maybe about an hour ago and um. I had about. A half a cup of vanilla yogurt. And I put some granola in there, maybe like a. Just kind of crumpled some granola in there and then like three raspberries and maybe like three blueberries. Nice and some tea. But the last Monday, Tuesday we came back, I think I started Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I had like an egg and a piece of toast and one day I just had a are toast with peanut butter on it."
79.0,Provider,I swear that's so cool.
14394.0,Patient,"So great fruit with. toast or something. So into like just. try not to just like eat like in them, I know breakfast is probably more I should eat more."
79.0,Provider,"So okay i'm basing it just a little bit. yeah and how do you know that what's the signals that you can tell, I should probably do a little more."
14394.0,Patient,"When I don't and I just kind of do a snack I guess if you wanted to just do back in the morning and then I feel like throughout the day i'm just not that i'm hungry I don't have the hunger pains, but I just like as I come home or i'm like hitting the refrigerator. What is. What can I eat um but I when I eat a little bit heavier in the morning I seem to be okay with not always thinking about what's in the refrigerator, what can I eat so."
79.0,Provider,Your brain and your body is getting satisfied.
14394.0,Patient,that's grinch crying we still.
79.0,Provider,are trying.
14394.0,Patient,To get in a lot of fights.
79.0,Provider,Right. yeah tell me just yesterday's like. dinner give me a. Give me a feel for it.
14394.0,Patient,"i'm a half a grapefruit. that's it and then in the morning. And then. Around 10 and that was probably like seven then around 10 because I knew I was leaving. I wouldn't be near food for about two to three hours so triggered I better. I was because I was not my lashes done and she's she literally does like an hour and a half, because I wait until the last one here and want to hear so it's always a long process for my eyelashes show, I was like oh man I better eat, so I ate um. The granola bar ate a whole to both both of them, so the whole granola bar and around one or two I eat like a protein bar. uh huh and then. I get home about three okay. And dinner, we had tacos and I ate. Probably 456 look tiny little corn Tortilla tacos. yeah and refreshing beans onion cilantro and just a tiny little cheese, because I really like it when I forget the cheese I don't even really notice, so I just put a little cheese on there and salsa and I ate 454 and then I went back no I think three so 407. And I was, I was Okay, I was full. And I felt full. And then. We got up everyone's doing their own thing after dinner, and I go back to the refrigerator i'm full but I go back to the refrigerator and I ended up eating yogurt and I put some like. me. and That was, like the kinda bake with. And some blueberries and I hate that I went back later and eight smart raspberries and then we're going to bed, I had small raspberries yeah, but they did go out for yogurt yesterday. mm hmm and I didn't go with them, and when they came home I didn't. Like kind of like oh I I just stayed busy, and so I didn't even eat or go with them for the yogurt. mm hmm. Well, it was somewhat of a good day."
79.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean. The timing. So when you have the yogurt you know when you said I went back to the coach was that, after they came back with yogurt."
14394.0,Patient,I was home by myself.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, while they were gone."
14394.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,Okay i'm just I kind of want to get curious about that a little bit.
14394.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,And we're social creatures we stick with the tribe.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah and I was at, and I even said to them like Okay, if you guys are going to go have yogurt eat it there and what you don't finish it, you know, put it in the freezer in the garage but I was on the phone when they left. I didn't get to just say that to them, but then, when they came back I kind of just distanced myself."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm well see what i'm wondering is if part of you going to the fridge was that part of you, knowing you're missing out on something."
14394.0,Patient,"yeah I did kind of like. So they're going to go get this frozen yogurt and pack, it was the sugar and the gummy bears and all that other stuff that you have to go with it. That I would be you know somewhat and told myself, and with this just regular plain vanilla yogurt with very so and then yeah, then I kind of was like. Okay, I can do some i'll put some eminem's in there, so i'm put a couple of m&ms because I thought, if I do because there was a part of me that I was like yeah I want to go further and, and I think if I wasn't on the phone with a client. yeah I probably would have been like okay i'll go i'll just get like a small, vanilla, no, no, no candy or anything but I probably would have put some kind of candy in there. So um I think it was kind of like okay well. I said no to that, then that would have been really bad, so I can kind of reward myself and be like good job not doing something really bad, but we'll just do something kind of sorta so."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and I want to equalize it. Even more so. I want to go it's not bad, to go get Gilbert."
14394.0,Patient,"You know it cuz I just don't get. You I put my topic on the bottom. Because put more toppings and that way, if you put them on in first and then I put the yogurt on top, and then a little toppings on the top, so I like it's not really yogurt for me it's more like."
79.0,Provider,"A candy rush. Now yeah, and I mean maybe you know, maybe in the future, you can do something where you're you feel a little bit like kind of in the middle, that makes sense. yeah and I."
14394.0,Patient,"I can get to that point where I. Can it was small vanilla. up, it was just one or two little things."
79.0,Provider,"yeah because honestly, maybe, if you were eating mindfully maybe you would be like oh my gosh, this is actually like too much going on here like it's a little complicated from my mouth it'd be nicer if it just had. raspberries and m&ms on it, or something. You know, rather than all the different things um but yeah trying to bring out some of the good bad. Man if that makes sense and just going well, what would what would satisfy me, it doesn't feel good physically usually to eat a ton of sugar and that can be the clue that Okay, this is, you know something that's over. What wouldn't be good for me. And this is just enough that's good for me kind of finding that middle ground. But I still I agree with you that. You need to act gradually get to that right, and I think that's really wise to go okay I can't just go oh foods fit and there's no good bad foods. And I can eat whatever I want there's usually you have to approach it a little bit."
14394.0,Patient,yeah. I can't even with like fruits like. I.
79.0,Provider,guess to you.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. You know fruits are good for you vegetables are good for you so like I I literally have cauliflower cut up ready to go grab and go. In a bowl refrigerator. At arm's length like that you see that's, the first thing you go to and I skip right over it, and go to the fruit that's behind it and the fruitful. I was like I know I should do the cauliflower, but if we do the cauliflower I gotta I just to me it's kind of blessed so I get a little bowl of like ranch dressing."
79.0,Provider,kind of percent. Oh yeah. You have to have something with it.
14394.0,Patient,"Like like just dip it to just get a little bit of that flavor but like who've been on there and it's like ranch and then a little bit of cauliflower it's just little scoop that just to give it some flavor. yeah because. Maybe, and the same way, cold broccoli I can eat caught like steamed broccoli no problem, but Cobra I have to do a little bit of something so."
79.0,Provider,"I agree, and and there's there's a total reason for that our human mouth it's too bitter and yeah you have to increase the what is that called palatable this and maybe there's too much like. shane kind of bad association with the ranch or with dip."
14394.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"yeah maybe we just clarify that a little bit. And you know what are the good things from eating ranch and from eating, you know, maybe it's a sour cream dip or something I don't know what's good about that, for your body."
14394.0,Patient,"um well, I mean i'm putting it's not candy. Food into my body, and it is helping me and intensify the taste of the vegetables that I don't really like the taste of so it helps me eat the vegetables, I guess."
79.0,Provider,"yeah it totally does and just the fact itself is going to provide you nutrition, you need fat, you need it for your joints you need it for your. your nerves are wrapped with fat, they have to have fat, to be able to send it's kind of like sending the electricity it's the conduit that it sent on and people that don't eat enough fat can't think clearly. So you can kind of just go hey no i'm helping my brain it doesn't take a lot of fat right like you don't have to have equal amounts of fat to. Say grains or even protein because it's just more concentrated but you're right having a little bit so trying to equalize that so that you can. I mean, but at the same time, nothing wrong with the fruit, you know, maybe that's what you really want because that's what your body needs it needs a little bit more of the carbohydrate. And even candy I even want to equalize the candy and go, you know candy does have nutrition in it it's got energy for your body and granted too much candy is going to cause these problems too much candy is going to cause you to feel a little bit icky. In Spikes your blood sugar too high. And that's your body saying whoa. What. So if you're sensitive to your body you're going to you're going to notice those signals and be like oh actually I don't even want to eat. Oh here's what let's do the chips. When if you ate a whole bag of chips what what does that do to your physical body, how do you feel."
14394.0,Patient,I feel fat.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds like more of a. What do you call her mental note. yeah more biological. um, how do you feel. bloated okay bloated."
14394.0,Patient,Like ice a stem automatically just I like I just feel really bloated from and i'm not satisfied. A whole bag of chips until they're gone and then go know it. So i'm not.
79.0,Provider,What do you like your body's telling you there.
14394.0,Patient,"um well, I mean it's obvious to me that it's like. After the deeds done and i'm sitting there going okay like why, why did you just do that, like it's obvious to me that I just didn't have. I was kind of disconnected."
79.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"To to like just robotic just eat eat eat eat not even realizing that you are eating, all the way to the bottom of. So to me it's like a and then, when I get done, I mean physically and emotionally I just feel like I feel bad I feel like how. Could I allow myself. To not like love my body enough to. To say you really don't need to eat that whole bag like I just I literally disconnect from my body and then. i'm like. wherever I go my mind goes and then like someone class their hands i'm like oh oh."
79.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no that's. i've heard people say describe it exactly like that, like whoa wait a second. What did we just do. yeah so something triggers that little bit of a i'll call it a trip, for lack of a better word. yeah yeah. But if you really were in present in your body mindful, what would your mouth, what do you think your mouth feels like after eating that many chips."
14394.0,Patient,"um. No, I don't I don't know, maybe I don't think it has I don't think there is like no feeling there's to me there's no feeling."
79.0,Provider,cuz your third connected.
14394.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah this. The taste of it, like the first one or two or three. You know. And then, like the m&ms yesterday when we ate them in the yogurt they're like oh it tastes really good and then I was going to go back and have more, but then I had that the taste in my mouth of the aftertaste to be eminem's I was like i'm i'm good, and I was okay to go back, but."
79.0,Provider,"For me, to be mindful yeah really."
14394.0,Patient,"It kind of have that taste in my mouth so but as for chips um I don't know I guess I just don't even think about it, I don't even consciously. Because there's so like send don't even have I guess a taste, that I don't even realize that there's like i'm just eating just to eat and not."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and I want to i'm going to go back to you know why, why does, why do you why do you do that right there's a reason there's there's."
14394.0,Patient,A reason for it right.
79.0,Provider,"um but I mean sometimes what we'll have people do is do like a purposeful. kind of like a binge where you're like I want you to eat and really stay mindful, with the chips and i'm going to eat, you know X amount and really experience what is it like what is it like for your mouth. In general chips are there kind of sharp there salty and after so many it kind of beats your mouth up like you, most people if they've eaten a lot of chips and they're really mindful they're going to tell you again my mouth kind of hurts, you know. And then, just like you said that bloated feeling yeah having too many chips like that is going to cause a bloated feeling of the stomach like whoa we've got more here, then we can kind of handle and we're having the kind of like overcompensate. So, but OK let's go back to there's a reason that let people binge right there's a reason there's some kind of need and any thoughts on what and that can change right but there's definitely a need and there's definitely a purpose that it serves."
14394.0,Patient,um okay so. I don't know what the need is.
79.0,Provider,Right and I don't expect you to.
14394.0,Patient,"But I do know. And I meant to write it down but. I didn't I didn't but Mike and I were discussing something. It was pretty intense, from what I remember, but I don't remember what it was so. yeah."
79.0,Provider,"Whatever you remember the feeling Oh, I totally get yeah yeah."
14394.0,Patient,"Remember, like, I was like I immediately like my body just kind of went and I just like for me when. I like close myself up and i'm the one that will flee I don't fight. I literally when they say bite your tongue don't say anything I literally clench my teeth like I just shut my mouth and chew my teeth and i've been I guess i'm do that a lot, because I have eventually now at 47 years old, I have tmj because I clenched my teeth so much. So I guess I do it a lot to her has affected me to that bad and I so now, when I clench my teeth, I really feel the pain like it's like oh yeah like don't clench so I, like my body recognizes that and clenching and it kind of makes me go okay don't clench. But then, if I didn't yeah I tried to relax my my whole face and my dog just just don't but depends on how the instance how intensified, it is, but then I just know that, like my shoulders automatically tighten up and. oh one, it takes about 20 minutes before I just kind of okay. i'm ready and it's, not because I talk about whatever was whatever I was in my mind of thinking like no I. I don't agree with what you're saying, and this is why or whatever I wanted it to say 20 minutes ago, a lot of times I just was like you know I don't even remember it was about like and. Why even discuss it it's like so little it's so tiny of a situation that why even blow it up into a big argument so just fleet just clench and. And I literally closed myself out to the world for like 20 minutes like and it's not like i'm just like going my room and I like shut the door I just like I don't. Talk i'm not really myself I kind of like loads up a little bit until it usually takes like 1520 minutes and then i'm just back to my normal self but unlike clenched and and and then I when this happened of whenever we had gotten in whatever you know just. disrupting as arguments or whatever it was I remember going Okay, what can I eat. Okay. And, but we were we were up it we are being somebody and we're wherever it was there was no food to where I could go think we were like at the beach or something so it was like. yeah you can't eat there's no nothing around here um but then it was like on like that so you're like if it was like. If I if I was in the home comfortable atmosphere and I comfort zone, when I probably would have gotten up and disk on the fridge what i've eaten anything I don't know, but I would have gone to the fridge opened it went to the pantry opened, it probably just been like. Why don't you know, and maybe ate something maybe not I don't know I don't know, but I do, I did recognize and I have been recognizing that when. Something stresses me out. I don't. fight to me. Leave it let it go and you know. It could, because I feel like if you do. Talk about it more and more and more and more and more it's going to escalate into something huge and then there's like for two days over something you know where I should have just whatever like i'm not the person that has to have the last word like. Okay, if that's what you think that's fine I you know. Ever is kind of how I end it like whatever."
79.0,Provider,"yeah I want you to take this to Andrea and I for a couple reasons because i'm obviously not therapist right. But there is definitely a food piece here and there's a need showing up, so this is where kind of the nutrition ends and therapy takes because. you've totally had a need there's something that happens inside you and that that creates a need for food or some kind of whether it's a soothing or. Being able to get out of that. uncomfortable spot. yeah whatever it is. But definitely bring this up with Andrea i'm going to make just to kind of a note because I feel I feel like it's important."
14394.0,Patient,yeah and I talked to her tomorrow morning.
79.0,Provider,"Oh perfect to remember. huh yeah but I mean, I just want to say, like having needs is is human right, having those needs, you need your needs met. You know so just understanding them and then going Okay, maybe there's a different way to meet this need, or maybe there's a different way that I don't get myself into that situation, at least, maybe not as often. And the clenching just you know. There you know you can use like I don't I had a friend who would use some lavender it was you know, high quality type of central lavender and to help and just to sort of do a relaxation. thing for her job, and she said, it seemed like it helped, but I don't have personal experience in that are much, but that would be painful and even the shoulders like yeah even doing a little Okay, you know. yeah up and down shoulders really."
14394.0,Patient,"yeah but yeah holding all that tension. I do yeah and then I just a I feel it and then I literally have to like tell my brain, just like breeze. like Britain positive breathe out negative, you know, like just get. The ball. And it's really i'm usually about 20 minutes, and I mean whether I eat or not and i'm sure this has happened before i've gone to the fridge maybe I did he I don't know, I was never really do together."
79.0,Provider,Right yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Well um I don't know i'm in my comfort zone, now that we're at home. I you know, have a little bit of some downtime because I just do houses that close so."
79.0,Provider,Like nice work.
14394.0,Patient,"it's always like really stressed and like i'm always on the edge until we get that final thumbs up your closing because anything could happen, I always feel a bit more tense during those times and then. Usually once I get done with it, I do take a few and just kind of don't talk to any clients I don't check my emails I don't look at houses online I just."
79.0,Provider,So wise.
14394.0,Patient,"day or two and just it's my time and then. So i'm kind of right there where that was my time and you so many you know, and I didn't talk to do work or anything and now i'm back on track and working working working. I did you know, and I probably wouldn't have done that in the past."
79.0,Provider,"wow that's awesome how did you get into this ability to go wait a second I i'm going to be a better person, a better you know agent mom if I take breaks step back. allowed myself to."
14394.0,Patient,"I. um I had I had two homes and escrow at the same time, and it was my first two homes together at the same time, and it was a little it wasn't too stressful but there were some moments. And back when I had it. I thought it was very stressful so I was like let me. Know anytime something's new yeah. What this and it was like waiting third party for the third party and it really looking back it really was a pretty easy transaction that I had and I had good buyers I had, I mean everybody in the whole team was at the end. just get. Going at the same time, and the two going at the same time, or like literally one block from each other."
79.0,Provider,One was unblocking oh.
14394.0,Patient,"it's like. Okay, which houses it and they're both three bedroom one bath 1400 square feet, so it was just like it was."
79.0,Provider,All confusing. Homes yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Two different investors so then after that I said I deserve to take a day or two off and so after that I just kind of was like. not consciously started doing it like after I would close the House i'd be like kind of rewarding myself I guess. Like okay I don't have to worry about money for a little bit I got the money in my head, you know, maybe I can do go do a little shopping or something so I think I just unconsciously reward it myself for. yeah I mean through what I think is stressful but like looking back going since then i've had crazy way more stressful ones. But I think that's kind of what I do is when I get done, I think Okay, so how can I like reward myself and some."
79.0,Provider,"Guy you've got to recharge and do that. yeah. that's good yeah that's such a high low. Job right. Yes, and. No see you're showing that you do have these natural. abilities to go wait, I need the self care, I need you know I need to do this so that's really cool so just brought me into some of the. intense relationship times, which I think are the hardest. it's really, really hard to navigate those so um so going back to the food kind of for the need for it, I mean it sounds like there's an emotional need right. There also sometimes as the Biological and you're working on a biological it sounds like you're taking food with you right. you're trying to eat more regularly you're trying to have a more satisfying breakfast and the brain has to have enough or it's going to make you feel like you're crazy lady for."
14394.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,So and it's just trying to survive. it's higher brain lower brain lower brain is just survival and it's kind of crazy. At least it feels that way. yeah even though it's not crazy it's just really determined on surviving.
14394.0,Patient,"So if i'm not hungry. Because I think i've been like always like instilled into me that, like don't eat until you're hungry don't eat until you're hungry. You know, wait for those hunger pains, and maybe because, like I just started my brain so much that it goes why it's like saying why even send you hunger pains when you're not going to listen to me anyway. So i'm totally that my phone to wear okay eight at 10 1112 on what two o'clock ish I like 130 set the alarm, so my alarm goes off to like eat I call it my ido arm eat. yeah but. Perfect i'm just trying to like get to that point where my brain will trust me again and. it's not there yet, but every maybe closer I don't know."
79.0,Provider,"No, you are I can totally tell you changed, and you are getting closer and you are a softening a little bit on the kind of the good bad foods. And it's true, you have to that's why we say three by three right eat every three hours because your body has experienced starvation your lower brain can't tell time. It doesn't know what day it is it doesn't know how long ago it was that you did this. It doesn't get that you're in a situation where there's lots of food accessible it just knows we have experienced periods of starvation in the past and we want to prevent that at all costs. And so make. thoughts about food, you know be constantly present. But if you're eating. regularly that lower brain just stays hibernated and goes we're not needed right now. we're getting food regularly."
14394.0,Patient,"What kind of food, I mean I try to stick to so like if i'm around a place and now i'll use my sister's home as an. example if I met her home and she's my mom she's both of them they're they're accessible to me when i'm not home, so I live about 15 minutes away from them. yeah in the area where i'm closer to my mom's or my sister's house, instead of driving 15 minutes home or or i'm out driven around I don't I don't know if I don't have anything with me like if I go to my sister's she literally has only junk food in her house and then. junk food, and I would not eat that because I have no idea how long it's been sitting there and I can't tell you what is in that. splash splash whatever she made like I can't and so like I look at it and go there is nothing good for me to eat here, and I think Okay, what is there around me OK, I can go to panera bread. And you know, like i'm eating like i'm eating a whole sandwich and it's only 10 o'clock you know, like why don't I don't have the time to go do run to the grocery store whatever like. My moms are my sisters and literally, there is nothing good to eat at my sisters and my mom's you take a chance you're not sure what's in the fridge yeah."
79.0,Provider,"yeah I hear you on all right, I do the thing. i'm."
14394.0,Patient,"traveling yeah I don't know what to do when i'm in that situation and I don't have anything with me because whatever happened I just wasn't prepared. yeah so but there's you know. pizza leftover from the night before shooting in my sister's refrigerator like I mean. I don't know what to do with it, and so, like a lot of times i'm like I can't come over to your House."
79.0,Provider,or I brought wrong yeah my bad.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah and I brought in, like to my protein shake mix. And you. Leave it here, this is mine So when I come, I have this to eat. But that was like a year ago and it's probably not even good it's probably."
79.0,Provider,"Not good anymore, he goes manson after of it."
14394.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I just um I sometimes just like feel like. Sometimes we'll have like fruit sitting out there, but it looks pretty old with fruit flies around it so i'm just like. She buying the fruit just for me because, like."
79.0,Provider,"Maybe she has hopes for herself, you know."
14394.0,Patient,"I don't know what to eat when. i'm in those situations because there isn't anything healthy available to me so, but yet i'm at my three four hours, where it's like okay. I know that I need to eat something but do I put chips in my mouse or do I not and just don't put anything in my mouth and I find myself in that situation, a lot."
79.0,Provider,"That is a tricky situation and I, I do think it's any food right your your brain just needs to have the food regularly. I you know those foods, a lot of times have a negative association because you've been done them before. So they have that history, if you will. yeah not inherently bad like it's the only foods that are bad or those that are poisonous are the ones you're allergic to or if it's been contaminated or to mold and expired like. At your mom's house, maybe yeah. But yeah the pizza would be fine the chips, and maybe put it like in a bowl or on a little plate."
14394.0,Patient,"And I. don't matter right that's like food for me and like if I if I say yes to the. Whatever they have like like chocolate covered almonds like. All it has the word in it, like in almonds are good for you, so you might like have a handful of and i'll go back and get. You know well, I don't want to get the chocolate all over my hands will put them in a bowl and then I like about three times and so it's those are she has almost all of my trigger foods in her home."
79.0,Provider,Oh wow okay.
14394.0,Patient,"Once I eat one. And let's say I just i'm there for five minutes and I eat a handful of chocolate almonds, and then I run up. In my mind i'm like holy already a bad."
79.0,Provider,You muscle right and then. yeah and that all or nothing is some thinking is probably something you're working on with Andrea right.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah I am working on trying to that was an hour ago and we're. Writing we're restarting restarting now, instead of tomorrow, so I am trying to work on that too, but. yeah it's a struggle, because I don't know what do when i'm at her house, so a lot of like I I don't eat because i'm like. I can't. I there's nothing for me to eat."
79.0,Provider,"yeah, what do you know about like nutrient storage in the body."
14394.0,Patient,"Not enough to where I think I could, I know that I need nutrients and I. Get that like if i'm lacking nutrients. i've my body of a certain nutrients that like it would be like, if I was. To prod depriving myself of maybe like vitamin C i'd be like i'm. craving maybe oranges."
79.0,Provider,yeah that's good yeah body totally does that yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah but I don't know like i'm craving for ice cream like what the heck like i'm what what am I starving like my body's asking for what kind of vitamin and you know that I think all right, well, it needs more of this or more of that because i'm raising it so."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and how how much of your body is built for. kind of like a machine like it just has these needs, it needs to be fulfilled, and how much of your body is built for pleasure for experiencing something that feels nice whether it's you know a little breeze or. You know, a hug from your kid or you know what I mean what would you say."
14394.0,Patient,"Get the satisfaction of like those kind of needs. aren't with food, like, I can literally and i'm trying to like eat something and go what am I tasting like i'm really trying to."
79.0,Provider,Work good job it's hard.
14394.0,Patient,"And, like last night at dinner like I was on my fourth Tortilla like I put the fork on the plate and fill it and then I get to my fourth one and, like something, just like my mind just went whoa. Like and I stopped, and I was like what are you tasting like whoa and and then I slow down like the first three I was disconnected."
79.0,Provider,I was just like nice job slowing down yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"And, and I like instantly was like Okay, what are you eating like what does it taste like um so I feel like I. don't get that sensation from food of like satisfaction, but where I do get it from is where I go okay i'm gonna like go and have a conversation with my daughter and outside on the patio and you know, whatever or you know hanging out with my kids are."
79.0,Provider,In love it.
14394.0,Patient,"does something like more physical I think satisfaction. In the food, food. doesn't really give me a satisfaction, like I don't think like i've ever that I couldn't possibly remember has probably been so long of me going huh. This is, this is really good you know what i'm wine tasting like I look. At hey yeah and they're like Oh yes, I taste I taste Okay, and this blueberries or whatever it and they taste, all these these."
79.0,Provider,you're looking at him like what.
14394.0,Patient,yeah. I read the menu of what you're supposed to be tasting i'm like. I taste know every. tells me i'm so you.
79.0,Provider,know I can read this.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah but. I just. don't taste the wine like and some people, you know have it in their mouth now and i'm like What do you do like you got mouthwash."
79.0,Provider,yeah So what do you think happened.
14394.0,Patient,"um I don't think I ever learned to taste and enjoy food I don't think I learned that because, and I think I probably. figured it out and my daughter started going to school and she's 17 now, so I took me this long, but she would eat. Slowly she would be full and push your plate away, you know, like I don't want to eat anymore, and then what I did to school. It was eat fast, you can hurry up and she even said, one day, like mama each super fast now you'd everything so that I can hurry up and go outside and have recess and play with my friends and that. triggered something to me that going that's not like that's that's what I do because that's, that is, I haven't learned to just sit. and enjoy your food i've learned and I remember in school to like i'd be like Oh, you only get a half hour lunch and and races, so you like to eat as fast as you can."
79.0,Provider,right if you're trained yeah so.
14394.0,Patient,"it's never stopped from there and and i'm seeing it with a now too because he's in first grade now, and he was eating slow and now that you know he's you know he gets recess, and you know he shows his food in his mouth and goes and it's like. I wasn't ever taught how to slow down and how to enjoy food, how to differentiate oh I taste the lemon in this."
79.0,Provider,Oh i'm.
14394.0,Patient,"Is a little bit more of whatever flavoring like I. don't know how to do that I just ED and then go. yeah that's what I know and it's. always been like. It like i've been like self conscious modern China like learned from my experience of eating and. eat at my desk I try to sit at the table, even if I just took off."
79.0,Provider,"i'll just say, I know I hear you have."
14394.0,Patient,"put my phone there, and maybe i'll check my emails like nothing too dramatic but I won't have the TV on and i'll just sit there but it's like okay i'm done and, like I literally, even when I sit at the table i'm disconnected like I just eat it so you can be done. And then go and you know eat more and eat it so you can be that, like there's no there's no like. I guess sensation to it there's no satisfaction to it."
79.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14394.0,Patient,"But again. yeah Andy I sometimes we like when I take that first or second bite like Oh, this is so good, then."
79.0,Provider,It hits yeah yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"Then, like you're eating like a whole bag. i'm sorry it's a whole bag of gummy bears. My aliens so sick, but what else can I eat so."
79.0,Provider,"yeah, why do you think the body does that little bit of a reward when you eat you know something that's sweet, what do you think the what's the survival bit there."
14394.0,Patient,I don't know.
79.0,Provider,I think it's like you know little kid they don't have all that reasoning logical that we have right it's very much experience experience experience.
14394.0,Patient,"So maybe or maybe like cuz I know like what I do with with my little one is OK, you get your homework done or. You go take a shower and then you can you know, have a little bit of whatever so maybe it's I feel like I deserve it it's kind of like rewarding myself, maybe I don't I don't know."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and your body is trying to say signal you that reward it needs carbohydrates, your body is energized by carbohydrates every process needs a glucose molecule you that's your it's your. When you call that is your fuel. You know whether they take you know your body takes it from some protein, it has to go through a longer process to get glucose out of that, but your mitochondria and every single little cell has to have the glucose so. It makes sense right that we're going to get a reward response from that because our body is hey that's a good thing eat that. We need this is our fuel so it's your body just trying to teach that very. You know tiny little kid brain, this is a good thing for us do that again, you know it's their survival. Little signal we don't our body doesn't speak English to us, but it sends us signals so it's actually healthy that your body has that signal response to sugar or to carbohydrate you know. it's just. Being human. And, but we also in our mouth we our mouth will tell us when it's had too much carbohydrate it kind of has a Max point if we pay attention to it and even our stomach will also signal whoa that's good. yeah send too much and it hurts."
14394.0,Patient,But my As for my nails I don't I don't I haven't caught on to that.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and I don't blame you yeah that's really uh. You know, further down the road you know something. But it's possible do you think it's possible for you that you could. You know, be able to know, am I enjoying this food, what do I, like about how i'm eating this."
14394.0,Patient,um.
79.0,Provider,You have that capability.
14394.0,Patient,yeah cuz I feel like i'm like baby steps like i'm trying super hard.
79.0,Provider,yeah you really are i'm so impressed.
14394.0,Patient,"And I just feel that like. I know that, like if I like i'm because of some of the things i'm reading in the book and then i'm also listening to oprah's book, the one that the girls said to go get 'em what happened to you."
79.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah yeah.
14394.0,Patient,Sorry.
79.0,Provider,And where you are in it.
14394.0,Patient,"i'm Chapter four, I think. After four right around there so that quite all the way into it, but we're getting they just finished talking about the pandemic kind of thing and how it can like keep stress people out but either in the oprah's book, I read that. When I feel that. Like don't die it because that's like you're you're you just are being strict on everything, like exactly this, I have a cup of this and eat exactly this and depriving your body and mind, of whatever you need. And being being a part of like a nutritional program to it's my body's going oh here's another diet you're trying. And a difficult more complicated process for me, because I have gone through so many diets before. And i've. been like exactly like measuring and i've even my scale with me to restaurants, that I can only eat four ounces so you know pull it out of my purse real quick put it on there, you know. So I think like for me to just try to like think too much on it, I feel like. My body's going mm hmm here's another one here's another diet Okay, and they kind of lay."
79.0,Provider,down.
14394.0,Patient,"Something I have to try and figure out a way and how to trick my mind into going, no, no, no, this isn't I promise you really trying and like. I think just I have had the most arguments with my with my brain like when they started with you guys like."
79.0,Provider,We find with that sounds like it's.
14394.0,Patient,"tiring yeah like i'm like you know. quit like you don't need to eat real you know you know yeah that's. onstage constant argument. I can add, and so there are times, where it's like I feel like i'm pushing myself so hard to or maybe if I just like just like taking a little bit of time and what's the difference between arguing with my brain and arguing with my husband or. You know, some like I am and I. Either fight or flee and with my with my mouth sometimes fight because, like I don't have to worry about like going into an explosion of anything but sometimes I do flee and I go all right, I given can go eat. So there's still some arguing going on and feel that like if I try to like. Think about is like this is a chore for me to do like i'm trying extra super hard like my brain is literally going yeah we've been here before we know like this is."
79.0,Provider,I can totally see it yeah. Another would do the same thing.
14394.0,Patient,"you're like oh i'm gonna do it this time, you know."
79.0,Provider,yeah So how can you make a difference.
14394.0,Patient,"And I just have to get that trust, I just have to just maybe kind of like instead of. Being the the rabbit and be the turtle and just i'll get there, but i'm just going to have to go slower, and then there will be obstacles, but i'll just have to just slow down and not feel like. i'm constantly okay I got to eat I got it and I can't I mean i'm still there yet, because I have to set my alarm, I have to, and I did that. And I diet like okay you got to eat your half a cup of this and you're that Kelly far and you whatever you got to eat at two o'clock my alarm will go off, and I would eat and so i'm."
79.0,Provider,Doing that now paralleling it yeah.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah so it's going like. we've done this before. yeah I do I know that you're not gonna i'm just like okay you're doing it and then all of a sudden. Two months down the road be like oh it's Christmas time we're going to eat, and you know make cookies and you know, then I start from square one, all over again and it's just a pattern that i've done so I don't think my mind trust mean like. Just kind of makes it more difficult it's like you're pushing back constantly."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah and I know this process for everybody is you know uncomfortable it's difficult. But I really feel like you're you're getting to something that is especially important for you, that this can set your brain into a spot that it's been before it's going to extra resist it. So yeah there's gotta be something there and I don't know I don't have maybe Andrea will have an idea of how to make the distinction, so that your body knows no this is safety. yeah, this is not starvation, this is not. deprivation."
14394.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,"This is just you know, trying to satisfy the body's needs."
14394.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,"And when you mentioned the you know the almonds going back from war. You know one thing that you know you can kind of, say, to yourself, is if I am hungry, maybe there is something I need you know, a bowl of almonds has only so much actually has a good amount of calcium, by the way, full of chocolate almonds Siena good calcium sorry but it doesn't have much. What vitamin C. You mentioned it earlier, not much vitamin C, but it has a little bit like if we pile up different things, according to how many nutrients, it has sometimes you have to eat a ton of it like, if you want to get. Protein let's say you want to get protein from spinach oh my gosh you'd have to eat so much spinach to get. Your body would hurt, it would be bloated because it can't digest. it's not a now or whatever. um, but if you had chicken you only have to eat that much and then you're satisfied with it. So sometimes if you only have one food available and the body is trying to signal, I need more of this nutrient you're going to go back for more and more of it, but if you have the variety that's why the three food groups. Every meal is so important, so that you're trying to hit all those different nutrient needs. And so you get satisfied."
14394.0,Patient,"Trying to like have a carb. A protein and what's the. Third, one."
79.0,Provider,"yeah carb protein and then usually like a fruit or vegetable. yeah you need to have a little bit of fat in there at each of your meals, to also meet that need and but sometimes the fat is in you know the meat or sometimes the fat is there. You know, with the sauce or like yogurt hopefully you eat yogurt that has fat in it."
14394.0,Patient,yeah it's.
79.0,Provider,"awesome because it does a better job absorbing everything anyway. yeah so so yeah just maybe trying to make sure you're getting the three food groups like if you have. A meal time and you're at your sisters be like you know if you have the chocolate almonds, you know think all right that's some protein. You know, and it does have some that I need some grain and then like fruit or vegetable or something you know, do you have any carrots, you know, most people cares last a long time in the fridge. have some carrots and maybe a piece of bread or something yeah. Just to help. meet your family yes and satisfaction."
14394.0,Patient,"yeah I know I just have to figure it out it'll take time, but."
79.0,Provider,yeah you're awesome though seriously i'm so impressed.
14394.0,Patient,Thank you.
79.0,Provider,You give even though you're hard on yourself sometimes you give yourself a lot of grace to and I love that you know you kind of like hey.
14394.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"we're gonna get this so it's really, really nice okay cool yeah we are at a time huh. yep um do you want to do same time next week, what and what update me on the. I O P, is that something that you're pursuing."
14394.0,Patient,"um I finally working with amanda to go and get was finally got to speak with someone in the county and the process that I have to go through is, I have to go through their whole entire process of getting referred to an iot program so i'm meeting with somebody. On the 18th it's like a three hour meeting of whatever they're going to ask and then from there they're going to refer me to someone to go to the. program and what ain't what Andrew was saying is they don't have anybody for the program so then she'll come swooping in and be like oh hey I can take her. So we kind of have to tell me. yeah."
79.0,Provider,Work the system.
14394.0,Patient,"yeah so um she said, like you, what you they'll refer you to her like people like a therapist you know, and he goes so you don't need that what you need is the next step. Past that like and more intense intensified program and I tried to explain it to these people that I was trying to like figure out like I know I don't need a therapist I have one I need them. they're like well we can't get you to that next level until you have a therapist and then andhra we figured it out and she's like just go do what they need you to do and then she goes i'll take it from there and swoop in and grab you and I was like okay so that's."
79.0,Provider,Smart Andrea.
14394.0,Patient,"And then. Time that goes through, and then they try to refer me and then unless i'm probably looking at November."
79.0,Provider,Okay yeah. No problem.
14394.0,Patient,"But we're one step closer, at least we figured out what we have to do, and before we."
