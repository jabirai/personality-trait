386.0,Provider,"hi i'm Jay i'm one of the prescription coordinator medical assistance, how are you doing today."
17466.0,Patient,"Well i'm afraid i'm not doing very well I I realize you're we don't know each other and you're coming into this with limited information but. I had my first appointment with your nurse practitioner Mary kastner. And I haven't slept in three days my next appointment with her is on Monday I tried sending her a message through carrio but she hasn't replied saying that you know, could we discuss a change, but before the weekend. And she didn't reply and I was just kind of on my last."
386.0,Provider,"I didn't know what else to do yeah i'm so i'm i'm not gonna i'm gonna just kind of let you know what I am able to do so, I am able to reach out to marry customer directly to see if there can be any change within the medication before the weekend, for you. I have her one of my other stuff my manager specifically has her direct phone line, so we can call her if she doesn't respond over to us to see what we need to do okay. um what I what three days, no sleep um any other symptoms."
17466.0,Patient,not directly i'm I am anxious about the fact that I haven't had any sleep and i'm having to cancel work things because I can't work if I haven't slept.
386.0,Provider,You can't focus absolutely.
17466.0,Patient,"But no, no, no other physical symptoms now just so you know. She had me on 50 milligrams seroquel and she instructed me on our first appointment to cut the murtaza pain 15 milligrams and half and only takes 7.5 milligrams because the murtaza pain. counter intuitively is supposed to have a higher drowsiness effect at lower dosages, however. I think i'm just past whatever these the whatever these medications are supposed to do i'm not sleeping. And uh you know I realized, I can have instant gratification but I can't I can't have her make a change and then go an entire week of not sleeping just to then tell her hey guess what it didn't work and I haven't slept for a week and. I you know I. I there's a few ambien pills that my GP prescribed but frankly i'm afraid to take them, because I know that's a short term solution. yeah I want to find a long term solution, but. I you know I can't I can't keep going on like this, not sleeping and I, and I am."
386.0,Provider,"that's not something that we would expect from you anyways so that's why we're we're that's why our providers are typically it to the patient portal that you've been trying to contact her, because that is probably the worst way I don't think it works appropriately. So just in the future that's not something that you're going to want to utilize i'm. sure what she'll do it, what you'll do is your login to the care now vc and then talk to if there's any issues in the in the future login to the care to a vc if it's regarding a prescription to forward it over to me or message. Mary customer directly type of response."
17466.0,Patient,Just so you know it has taken me 55 zero minutes to get to you.
386.0,Provider,"i'm so sorry i'm what a process, I do apologize um let's see what if we can get something you know solidified on a resolution here for you, I get some sleep okay."
17466.0,Patient,So.
386.0,Provider,"you're you said, your GP prescribed ambien at what dosage."
17466.0,Patient,"One moment. It was it's 10 milligrams but frankly I don't even see that as a well. I was saving those because I have a business trip in a few weeks that. You know, would require me to sleep, so I didn't I didn't want to take those."
386.0,Provider,"yeah well. With your GP so because, because we are mental health on we're not general practitioners so. i'm the kind of align ourselves so if your GP had prescribed ambient 10 milligrams and that's a possible resolution that Mary kastner would agree with. And we would intern get an another prescription order out for you, if that's something that we would be taking over. um again, it would be, depending on what type of directive, she would give me so um let me see what we're able to do it's an ABN 10 milligrams and how many did he the GP prescribe. A 1010 okay um when did you start did you just initialize both of these medications a circle and them or has a pain."
17466.0,Patient,In her oh.
386.0,Provider,started it when we could go.
17466.0,Patient,"And you know, and she didn't I understand i'm on a extremely low dosage of the seroquel."
386.0,Provider,This is.
17466.0,Patient,"And I was surprised that Mary kastner did not increase the seroquel and you know it was you know she had never met me, and it was a very short appointment so i'm just. yeah uneasy about this she really understand where i'm at and how this has affected my life. At this point, yeah."
386.0,Provider,"Well there's no way for us to be able to actually determine without actual visits on Brady in terms of getting medication, you know covered for you it's kind of like. kind of like trial and error, unfortunately, and that's just the way with any type of medication, but um at least what we have now, at this point is that you haven't slept in three days is way too long, so let's see what we're able to get going for you, I have your phone number at 949-943-0255."
