12373.0,Patient,i'm not good not good at all.
298.0,Provider,Tell me more.
12373.0,Patient,So i'm. My new therapist suggested that I get on medication or I talk to you about medication for. My Depression and anxiety.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have you used to be on simple purpose you're no longer on that correct. Yes, okay. Right and adderall what adderall doesn't work so i'm still putting in the brain but Sarah tone in is what is. causes that Depression and anxiety, if you have a lack of serotonin in the brain then you're feeling that and adderall can't touch that serotonin So what have you tried in the past that helps with Depression and anxiety."
12373.0,Patient,"cymbalta helps with my anxiety a bit didn't really do anything for my depression and I was taking wellbutrin. For a very long time, I think. And it did work for a while. i've tried lexapro I didn't really like it because I sort of. I don't remember. The six months that I was on it, I just I guess was a robot during that time, but. I don't i'm not. opposed to it, those are just the ones that i've experienced and taken in terms of antidepressants and anti anxiety. i'm having anxiety attacks that last. More than. about an hour hour and a half and. A half have a I have an apple watch that tracks my heartbeat so my heartbeat will be around 121 30 for about an hour straight."
298.0,Provider,"Well, I have it. Any triggers for that."
12373.0,Patient,"It just changes. I said, like one time I started looking for new apartments because we're supposed to. Our lease was up in July, and we were supposed to have found a place, but I I haven't been able to bring myself to start looking because it just seems. It and it did trigger me. Just things like. That it triggers my agoraphobia when I see things that happened like nearby. yeah."
298.0,Provider,"So your sleep is bad, can you tell me more about what your sleep habits are."
12373.0,Patient,"and I will go to bed around the same time, every day, but. I will be able to fall asleep. For a while and i'll do all the things that you know the the podcast and and they tell you to do you know don't bring your phone in have a self care routine and. All that. But it just. It just doesn't work and I have a lot of pain in my. my neck I have. arthritis and bulging discs. Two weeks ago, I had a cervical epidural because. My doctor my pain management doctor said that. I really. would benefit from it, but so far it's it's dulled the pain, a little bit, but it hasn't. I think I need to have a talk with him about another shots."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"i'm not taking any pain medication for that he prescribed. It for me, but I haven't filled the prescription. I just take regular tylenol because okay yeah."
298.0,Provider,"So I have a couple of thoughts, but I still have a couple more question can you kind of describe your mood to me."
12373.0,Patient,"i'm sure. anxiety is seems to be the predominant. feeling I have during the day and. When. When I take. When I take the adderall it helps me to. start going about my day you know in in in a fashion that makes sense, you know it's just just get up and do do it, you don't need to."
298.0,Provider,write.
12373.0,Patient,they're overwhelmed with you know what do I do first where where do I start with the easiest what's the fastest. what's the most urgent is I just start doing stuff so that's where the animals really benefited me. But if. If I if i'm coming down from it and i'll start to. lose. I guess will and i'll get caught up in you know. scrolling again and just laying down. From the pain in my neck.
298.0,Provider,"So there's a couple issues going on main one is anxiety, you can look at these medications and you can email me look them over decide if you would like to go on them here's my recommendation. there's some medicine at bedtime called amitriptyline and it's really good for people who have pain for going to sleep it's the very first generation. antidepressants that we use for the sleep ability. So look at that it would be just a very small dose just to help you sleep at night that's one thing The other option is to look at those loss."
12373.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"And look at that one to treat depression. And the other one is an Anti anxiety medication. called boots par the U s ta are. Okay, and any combination of those moves one of those men anything I think would be an improvement for you look at and look them over think about what you might want to do and let's talk the email, and if you have any questions i'll try to answer them OK."
12373.0,Patient,"So i'm i'm i'm open to starting. So the amateur explain, will I will take only a bed time."
298.0,Provider,or yes it's only a bad sign it and we're just we're not using it for is anti depressant properties because. it's just so much better for sleep and we don't need the extra side effects. We just need the fleet stuff. And then the last. is for people who have. it's just a good way to get Depression and anxiety under control. Side effects. are the same as cymbalta as far as is the serotonin replacement so. It can upset your stomach. Those sort of things and then this part is unique all its own that is totally an Anti anxiety medication it's taken regularly. And you it takes two weeks to build up in your system to get the anxiety under control.
12373.0,Patient,"And i'd like to get started. Okay, I trust you. Yes. Okay, and. What would you like to get. What oh sorry, are we on time."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, we are we're getting. close to the. ocean Okay, would you like to start with the amitriptyline Amazon locks and then see how your anxiety is."
12373.0,Patient,Sure um can I get prescriptions for all three and then all of all. i'll keep you updated by email.
298.0,Provider,"Absolutely 100% are so smart on this. i'm going to make a note and hand write it because our server for the prescriptions just went down so booth par and. The loft and. amitriptyline for sleep. Okay, and you can take the amitriptyline as needed it's up to you."
12373.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"But the police are into laughter regular and I would start just one of them at a time, so you know that that which side effects, because if you take all three then you'll never know what."
12373.0,Patient,"Yes, oh sure sure."
298.0,Provider,"yeah all right. Okay, any other questions Kim."
