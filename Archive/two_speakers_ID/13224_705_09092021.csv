13224.0,Patient,hi. How are you.
705.0,Provider,Last time we talked you were saying that your dog was going to have. Her operation.
13224.0,Patient,"yeah that's, the reason I forgot about a ruler and Tuesday I was taking care of her after she got home."
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah you know Henry sometimes it happens, I know you're not the first person to miss a group or an individual session i'm glad you're here today. And is also what's your what's your dog's name. Winnie Winnie is Winnie okay."
13224.0,Patient,yeah she's now that she's not so doped up on anesthesia and stuff she's she's acting more like herself. The. The. what's the word the stitches are still bothering her but that's to be expected. she's going to be wearing the Cone pretty much until they take the stitches out next week.
705.0,Provider,"And that's so hard when I my cat and she did not like the Cone and it's just are you having difficulties is when he, like trying to get it off and going towards the wall."
13224.0,Patient,"um yeah she tries to take it off, sometimes, but I just tell her no and she stops and then kind of lays down and looks at me like see where you're making me live through."
705.0,Provider,"She gives you that look like, please, please just take it off five minutes five minutes. Well i'm glad that you're able to care for Wednesday and make sure she's okay and. Hopefully, the recovery is how many weeks."
13224.0,Patient,"They said about two weeks, but since she's young it's she is she's bouncing back pretty fast. Okay, just a matter of really watching her and making sure she doesn't get out of the color and doesn't mess with her stitches and her incision site."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. wow i'm glad you're you're on it you're like nope not on my watch. Okay. last thing to when we talk to my apologies, again I know we have more time today it's scheduled longer so again, my apologies, last time I felt like we were just getting into. exploring a little bit more even talked about sometimes when you have a conversation with your dad you walk away and feel guilty. yeah is that still going on."
13224.0,Patient,Not so much. Not so much this week. So that's the Nice. Mainly he mainly because we haven't really had a conversation where has made me feel that way.
705.0,Provider,"Has anything, besides not having that type of conversation I mean is there anything else, like did you resolve some of it and that's why you in. your father."
13224.0,Patient,"I do, I wouldn't say we resolve that so much as we just haven't had conversations like that, since I last talked about it. A few weeks back, he was trying to guilt me into having a conversation about politics with him, even though he and I very much disagree on a lot of and he knows that. And he also knows that I get emotional when I talk about politics, because a lot of the political stuff that I follow is about LGBT rights and stuff like that and. that's that can literally be life or death for me if i'm ever in a place where the law doesn't protect me from hate crimes. Based on being LGBT. That can literally be life or death for me and he just doesn't. Understand that even when I explained it to him. um. I did eventually tell him a few weeks back. That I I just I can't have those conversations with him, even though I want to be able to discuss it with them. Because he wants me to be able to do it without getting upset and I don't my brain doesn't work, the same way, is does I don't feel process emotions, in the same way that he does. and"
705.0,Provider,"that's one, but also to Henry is the you shared, you know that this to you because it affects you that, of course, that you're going to have some feelings behind that and that that too, sometimes that fear of not being protected and that what that means to you, you. You did very well, though, by sharing it with your father and now it's up to him of what he may choose to do with it."
13224.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Like you have valid reasons to be like no this this, this is where I go with this, because it directly affects me."
13224.0,Patient,"Well yeah so I wouldn't necessarily say it's This issue is resolved so much as shelved for now, if that makes sense."
705.0,Provider,One of those things that both of you agree to disagree and just not not talk about it for right now.
13224.0,Patient,pretty much.
705.0,Provider,"Do you have someone that you do feel comfortable with you know that you're able to talk, maybe a little bit more on a balance about. political views, and some of your fears."
13224.0,Patient,"yeah i've got i've got several people I can discuss it with without. I still get emotional because i'm just kinda i'm kind of a passionate person it's about something they care about, but I don't like get frustrated and cry because I get frustrated and cry with my dad because it's my dad. But there's other people that I can actually have discussions with."
705.0,Provider,Different level understanding you i'm glad that you have you know some of your go to people that do understand.
13224.0,Patient,me to.
705.0,Provider,"Have you in your father, you know always had like that political views for different or Is this something fairly new."
13224.0,Patient,"fairly new I shared his political views back when he was the only person I listened to. Because that's the only when I was you know, a teenager or a kid. You know you as my dad and I thought, if he thought this and must be right, but then I actually started listening to other points of view and started. I started hearing different levels of logic that would poke holes in what my dad. Thought and believed, and I just started forming opinions of my own, but he's convinced that that the Liberal colleges just brainwashed me or whatever, but it's like. I started changing my views I was still a teenager I just never talked with them about it because I knew he'd think I was being brainwashed."
705.0,Provider,"And what I thought of Henry when you were telling me as I was, like wow that's growth, where you had a healthy sense of self where you decided, yes, you get your dad's value, but you built on those to make it your core beliefs. know and your values. that's healthy."
13224.0,Patient,"and part of the reason that I get so frustrated with dad when he wants to talk politics is that he tells me that he wants to understand my point of view. But history has shown that, when I try to tell them my point of view, he interrupts me or he just dismisses it and then just goes on rants of his own without letting me. Without really listening to me. And my point of view it's like. You can't tell me that you want to hear my point of view lily actively do not listen to it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and to walk away, where you feel like it clash, and you aren't heard, and you know it's it's hard, especially when you have two different people that are passionate about what they believe in. any room for common ground between you and your father."
13224.0,Patient,"i'm not entirely certain, but if you mean literally you're not entirely certain."
705.0,Provider,"Establishing to just some some rules, you know that the two of you are like look Okay, we have such polar difference that we're going to put more of a healthy boundary around it, you know. What topics, do you feel you can speak to your dad about."
13224.0,Patient,Not much because he always uses it to change the subjects to all this stuff that I get upset about.
705.0,Provider,"So, in the past you've probably I felt like he used it sometimes people call it ammunition for future use."
13224.0,Patient,munition new.
705.0,Provider,That doesn't feel good in a conversation.
13224.0,Patient,"It doesn't. I did, establish a boundary a few weeks back so that's it is program still frustrating."
705.0,Provider,"It is and sometimes too I know. Even with my own parents as they were born in a different generation, I can understand that, but it also when you're in this generation your life but look. yeah. And that's why, with the people that do get you in the people that are like hey willing to listen and you're listening to them and it's more of like a an honest healthy conversation it's like yeah it can be you know, open and honest."
13224.0,Patient,"um. So the nightmares have kind of started to go away a little bit. Okay um. there's been a few times that I have. woken up but I haven't entirely woken up. You know where it's like i'm. I realize eventually that i'm sitting up in bed, and I kind of snap out of it but i'm but up until that point I don't know how long i've been sitting up or moving around i'm. While still kind of dreaming about. traumatic stuff."
705.0,Provider,How do you bring yourself Henry for for when you do realize you're awake or to help you.
13224.0,Patient,"um. well. it's kind of hard to remember cuz it's like my brain is in a follow up at the time that it happens um. I kind of vaguely remember a. Try and um. I don't know if it's like actually grounding technique, but I just try to. touch things feel things different textures i'm. i'm. That kind of thing and I it kind of makes it kind of makes this disconnect do I brain of I my brain thinks i'm experiencing this. But I, but my hands my. feet are feeling this. And then. There was one night that I happened that when he was in the bed with me and I started petting her and that. really helped with that particular. That particular. technique I guess. Where I wasn't just feeling like my own blanket or my own pillows I was actually feeling, you know when he's for in her head and was heading or and then It made me remember oh yeah. This isn't back because I didn't have Winnie all those years ago."
705.0,Provider,"Right and self soothing too I like how you have two different go tues for techniques you're absolutely right, you know with having that that disconnect like this is my bed, this is where I am. And then, with with lenny being there that's that's great she probably already knows before like she probably recognizes when you're having a dream, maybe."
13224.0,Patient,A few think she does cuz. i'm just trying to remember. there's been a couple of times that it's happened where i'll start putting her and it'll kind of wake her up and then she'll actually move closer to me and start licking me.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah instinctual she must know what Henry.
13224.0,Patient,something's up and that I need her.
705.0,Provider,"And then she responds and she's there for you. Could it be possible to Because of all this, like the new techniques that you're trying and doing that that the nightmares are getting less frequent frequent because you're like lowering the intensity by doing feeling like you have more power when you're awake to do something."
13224.0,Patient,"Maybe. That could definitely. That could be possible yeah. There was one nightmare, I had that was about my ex girlfriend. And I dated her when I was like she and I were in the same grade in high school and. It was, I mean it was a toxic friendship before it was ever a relationship, and it was a toxic relationship to. But. She was very controlling. She would guilt me into being on the phone with her almost 24 seven just talking. And anytime I wanted to go hang out with someone else, she would threaten to break up with me. um. But then she would go days, ignoring me because she was hanging out with other people. And will get angry at me for reaching out wanting to talk. But then, of course, if I tried to do the same thing for just a day she'd be blowing my phone up threatening to break up with me threatening to hurt herself. And i'm the type of person that I take seriously when people are talking about hurting themselves, but she was very much just faking that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's hard Henry because I get you know where you're like if you're gonna hurt yourself and you're fully alert of the consequences and you're there for that person, you know."
13224.0,Patient,"And she basically would threaten that just to scare me into. hang out with her. And she's pretty much the only person i've ever been. sexually involved with ever. And that wasn't. Good she. She assaulted me multiple times during our relationship. never respected my boundaries or my consent or my lack of consent. A lot of my dreams like. recreate different. Times that she's assaulted me. But it's like it alters details or it mixes memories I don't know if that makes sense. Like. There was wondering my ad on nightmare, I had it was a. It was not in the place that it is that the memory took place in, and it was in our our school that I went do when I was a freshman and that's where I met her um. But the school was made completely of bedsheets. Like everything the floors the walls, the desks was white bedsheets. It was just it was. bizarre and upsetting, of course, because of what was happening yeah."
705.0,Provider,"that's your brain to still trying to process. And sometimes those images just stand out. That wasn't you know that was wrong and that that is especially so unfair Henry that here you are this was your first experience and you didn't deserve that and you. You know at that age you don't know any different no. But if you think back today. You know, a difference."
13224.0,Patient,"I do yeah. it's been over a decade and i'm I still haven't. been able to. Be intimate with anyone else sexually anyway. romantically is different i'm still kind of. Of course they're. My brains getting my brain is getting ahead of my mouth ADHD i'm like I do have issues romantically as well, but i'm specifically sexually she is the only person i've ever been with and that's really screwed up."
705.0,Provider,"And my hope for you Henry is that you find someone that you trust that you can take small steps with them to regain that trust and especially sexually where you're being vulnerable and you're like you know, having my past here, I need this, I need you to be just patient. And when you say no, no means no no. and eating back your power. i'm sorry Henry what were you gonna say."
13224.0,Patient,"Oh, I was just going to reiterate that I was gonna say no means no and also yes means yes so."
705.0,Provider,Right you're exactly right on the same path and that's where i'm like you know what Henry you are not the person that you were back then and it's like dang it you take back your power and it's just like look. You labeled it right when you said toxic unhealthy.
13224.0,Patient,"And, not to mention the fact that it was a closeted relationship. The entire almost two years that I dated her. And she treated me like garbage. and She just. never wanted it to be public knowledge. Which. In a way, I still to this day, I still understand how she felt that at the time that we started dating because her mom was kind of homophobic. um. But, after almost two years and then she started. seeing this other dude assistant or dude that her mom basically pressured her into dating even though come to find out several years later, her mom suspected that she and I were dating at the time, and still pressured her into dating this other guy. that's beside the point. She just never my ex never thought I was worth being open. And our relationship with our other with you know our loved ones."
705.0,Provider,"And that feeling to I can see to Henry where not only did you feel like you had to hide, then the relationship, but hi to the abuse that you are in dory you know. Part of the healing process to you know Henry as as you shared with the nightmares that they're starting to not be as frequent, I think that that that I would think is progress, I mean it's somewhere that you're starting. To have a little bit more and you're coming up with grounding techniques, where you're back in control."
13224.0,Patient,"yeah well the numbers are about. Now they're about as frequent as they were but that's because they started becoming more frequent within the last few weeks. and So, even though it's less frequent now compared to a few weeks ago it's still about the same as how it's been for 10 years. i'll cry but it's better than it was a few weeks ago, so that is, I still consider that progress anyway."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely and Henry talking about this, because most people and, again, back then, you were young and you're trying to figure this all out and people didn't talk about you know that here you are today and trying still to like. gain a better sense of self where you do deserve. That healthy loving relationship. You do deserve that if you want to be sexual with someone to feel safe enough to be able to have that experience that's healthy you deserve all that and more. To this about you taking back that power and going, you know what i'm continuing to Hill and you can't stop me. You know. i'm Sorry, I think that was our communication it's on the. We do what's called slack where it's our company thing you see if I can. Lower it a little bit."
13224.0,Patient,is okay just caught me off guard.
705.0,Provider,Very.
13224.0,Patient,"I have not told many people about those kinds of nightmares. and i've told my partners. there's this other night kind of nightmare that is. Almost consistently the same. it's it doesn't have to do with my X, it has to do with my grandmother, though. And it's. it's really weird it's. it's sort of partially a recreation of different. A. Different traumatic experiences that my grandma. put me through it's partly a recreation of those but then it's also like. My worst frickin nightmare, which is that she is back from the dead and knows it and taunts me with the fact that I will never escape her. And then puts me through those same things all over again, this time, just to be hateful and. specifically to hurt me. Those ones are pretty consistent in the sense that it's. Half it's halfway a recreation of old memories and halfway just my worst frickin nightmare. that I know is not logically possible but."
705.0,Provider,But it feels real at the time.
13224.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Is it harder for you to try to do some of the grounding techniques, with the nightmares regarding your grandmother or no difference between that and the girlfriend ex."
13224.0,Patient,Is it's about the same there's been a couple times it's been a little harder. The for the most part that's about the same.
705.0,Provider,"Would you say Henry that at the core of this because, again with your grandmother, and your young that it's about feeling unsafe and the people that you love. end up being you know abusive. You not creating that safe space for you."
13224.0,Patient,yeah I think that's that's exactly it.
705.0,Provider,Where do you feel safe.
13224.0,Patient,"by myself, mostly. I feel safe and i'm with Ashley. I feel. sort of safe when i'm with. Other people that are like me. I don't go out often so I don't often. meet other people meet, but when I do there's this. I guess you could call it a gaydar but more of the LGBT umbrella, and not just gay. So there's this instance sense of camaraderie of I know what your experiences are because i've had very similar ones, and I am as a person, and I feel you're a safe person."
705.0,Provider,yeah and that you're feeling that energy you're putting out that energy and it's like on both parties it's there yeah how i'm feeling connected.
13224.0,Patient,"And it's, not that I don't feel safe with my dad. it's just. He doesn't get it. He he just really doesn't get it, I mean he's got trauma zone but he's the kind of person that doesn't believe in therapy. And even if he did believe in therapy he wouldn't ever admit that he needed it, and so it would never work, even if someone was to actually. make him go to therapy, it would not work because he wouldn't want it to yeah."
705.0,Provider,"i'm not that Defense mechanism right there that you described is what keeps people from getting the help that they need you you've already jumped over that hurdle, you know and re you've been like you know what it's not going to stop me and that's empowering in itself. i'm hearing that you have created not only within yourself the belief again and the trust within yourself. But, also, that you're open to Ashley and even beyond that that people that you said that you feel connected to and can already used the word gate you know your gator is like i'm safe you're safe. that's huge progress. that's healing."
13224.0,Patient,"yeah. When you put it that way, I can see that."
705.0,Provider,You made that happen.
13224.0,Patient,"I just. really want to be able to trust again. I know i'm never going to get a Paul and an apology from my grandma because she's dead. And if there is a hell she's in it. Even though I still love her, and if there is a heaven, I wish, she was there, but. She was not a good person not a nice person. I know I know i'm not going to get an apology from an ex because she's just friggin narcissistic and. has done so many mental gymnastics to. Make herself feel like she's the victim of our relationship when i'm the one with all this frickin trauma. that she caused. i'm never going to get an apology from her ever. I wish I could. mm hmm it hurts that. I know that I won't. And I struggled for years to try to just. let go of the world and the need for an apology from her. still struggling with him."
705.0,Provider,that's okay Henry and i'm glad that you're acknowledging that part. Because yeah that makes sense that you would want an apology. terfel. The you don't get what you need.
13224.0,Patient,I deserve one but i'm not going to get it.
705.0,Provider,Oh i'm sorry go ahead.
13224.0,Patient,"Oh no it's Okay, you can I."
705.0,Provider,am interested of what you were gonna say Henry so sorry.
13224.0,Patient,"Oh um. I was gonna say. What was I gonna say. Oh, I was gonna say that. uh. Even with. All this acknowledging. That my trauma and my pain there's this part of me that, like. Still attempts to gaslight myself, I think, where it's like because I know my my memory of that relationship is fragmented to shit pardon my language I. Remember things in different orders every time I remember, I remember things differently or all remember something new that makes me realize oh this happened this way and not like this, so there's always this part of me that thought that still questions. You know. What if. All that bad crap didn't actually happen the way you think it didn't sleep. Well, something happened something traumatized me right."
705.0,Provider,"With with trauma to it usually is not a clear cut that it it comes in different ways, and that people do have that doubt but that that is common Henry."
13224.0,Patient,So frustrated.
705.0,Provider,"that's the piece of your brain trying to process it out and then, as you as you navigate through life, and you have your experience we attach different experiences and then that gets confused, especially in a nightmare, especially with trauma. You know that's where with trauma and I was going to say to that the way that you put things in perspective and just like you use the word I think it was mental gymnastics how to describe. it's a beautiful way that you have about describing things part of the healing process is sometimes people start writing it down and just write a letter to yourself if you, you know think that hey maybe this is a part, I want to take a look at."
13224.0,Patient,"I can. Excuse me, I can see how that could help."
705.0,Provider,"It could be an outlet for you Henry it, you know i'm just gonna put it out there, sometimes it may bring up a little bit more and and you know that things start to surface. So be mindful, if you if you do just gauge if you need to take a break, or you need to just not do that, you know not right for a bit. And the grounding techniques, you did have just you know, keep telling yourself that you're creating your safe space you believe in yourself. you're making it happen."
13224.0,Patient,What was the other thing that you were going to mention or was that what you just said.
705.0,Provider,"It was part of the Henry is just as you're describing all this and you have such a beautiful way of describing things as I always think like a long our healing processes and we're all different. And some of even your trauma and how you're remembering it is coming out different you know because of your vivid memories and things that you're attaching new. So just trying, you know you're creating already to believe in yourself and Ashley and even the Community. And it's like okay what What else do you feel like would get your needs met today that maybe you couldn't do as a kid."
13224.0,Patient,"not sure. I really I really wouldn't know where to begin honestly, aside from. Maybe finding a local rage room and pain to frickin smash some stuff by oh."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that would be one way of. Expressing all this stuff they. Have bottled up yeah that would be absolutely ideal way to do it. yeah me, you can also rage in your in your letters and not hold back that maybe you held back in the past. is like in your grandmother to have where you are so young Henry and that as a child and your way that you're viewing the world is through this caretaker that is not showing you unconditional love and compassion and. Not nurturing your safety, you know."
13224.0,Patient,"She uh. She made it very clear that. me living at her house growing up growing up here, even now i'm still here it's part of the reason I want to move out so bad too much baggage, but. Right committed very clear her house and you know her rules. Are way. And if I didn't like it, I could get out."
705.0,Provider,"But guess what. you're there, and she isn't and you're living your life. Your true authentic life right. I didn't even until you said that Henry it just clicked with me that you are living in the same. house and meeting that challenge to you."
13224.0,Patient,"That was something I wound up actually talking with dad and lori about lori lori is my step mom. Because I when I first told them that I was planning on moving out, you know September, October whenever. i'm. lori even mentioned because she and dad want to sell the House and move eventually. lori even mentioned. We don't have that because they spent like the last four years just slowly renovating things, making it look a little nicer and more presentable. to sell but at some point, you know you're just sinking money into it, when you could just sell as is. Because how much money from the sale when it's all Nice and pretty is going to go towards making up for all the money spent, making it pretty again. And she actually told them but I wouldn't mind like selling this place and then getting a little condo even here in California, even though dad hates it here in California and that actually prompted me to tell that honestly that. Even if you guys. sell the House and rent a place here until you decide on a more permanent place to move, I think that would do wonders, for your mental health dad. And I just read it hold on because this place has too much emotional baggage for the both of us, because as much as my grandmother did not treat me well, she was much worse with my dad when she and him were younger and she actually had the physical strength. To physically abuse him. When he was a kid in a teenager."
705.0,Provider,"and say you know this and, even though it helps you. understand why your dad is maybe the way he is it's still as hard when it's you. that's having to be at the receiving end of some of this. And that's not your fault that's that was his upbringing."
13224.0,Patient,"Be I just critical dead that I think it would do him good to just move out of your. Even if things don't go according to plan on the timeline they're wanting it to. This place has too much baggage, because I know I wake up every day and a new unpleasant memory kind of surfaces when I see when I noticed something in the House like oh yeah this was always like this. And then that would be associated with an unpleasant memory, and I can only imagine how much worse, it is for him with. verbal and emotional and physical abuse that he suffered for his whole life at the hands of his mother yeah and, of course, the physical eventually stopped when she no longer had the strength, but. I just told him the students back a chair and I think it would do you good to move out to. Both both of them."
705.0,Provider,that's very supportive and i'm sure your father needed to hear that Henry.
13224.0,Patient,"I think he did, and I think I was surprised lori when I said it too because it's always been kind of an unspoken thing that the energy in the House just even though grammy is gone. PR PR energy her presence. is very much folks. To this day."
705.0,Provider,Do you know any history on your grandmother of foo raised her and what condition.
13224.0,Patient,"I know some. and honestly i'm not a psychologist but I did research, when I was like a teenager on different. Like psychological disorders, or whatever um and I compared it to her behavior when I started realizing hey her behaviors not normal. And i'm pretty sure she had intermittent explosive disorder."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, can be, and especially if it was untreated."
13224.0,Patient,"yeah she like literally at one point she and my grandpa my dad's dad. took on an on an unnecessary financial burden of buying a car, just to avoid going to therapies like until the basically the CPS worker we can't afford the therapy you're trying to make us do. Just to get out of therapy because that's how much he did not believe in it."
705.0,Provider,"and not at all to excuse the behavior just understanding the behavior I imagine for you, you know Henry would would. have some sense of not i'm not going to use the word relief, because I don't think that that would would be a true description, but just to gain a better understanding of Okay, this is where it came from this is not my fault at all, this is what I can see, you know."
13224.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. Honestly, she was hardest on my dad and my aunt deanna. And D. And D was the firstborn and my grandma got married to grandpa when she was like 16 or 17. In order to escape her abuse of own life. Excuse me so and db and the firstborn. grammy kind of resented her because she was so freaking young when she got married and had kids and then my dad came along, and he looked just like his grandpa her grammys dad her abusive dad. And so, she was hardest on both of them, for various reasons, but."
705.0,Provider,"Still doesn't make it okay it's like never is that that right, but you have a new level of understanding. It is then Henry is you're breaking the cycle. of many, many years. Of that pattern. And that family history."
13224.0,Patient,"And I truly think that. If and when dad and lori move out of this House, I think that it will just make a world of difference for the both of them, but especially for dad."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13224.0,Patient,"Yes, twice as many bad memories of this place than I do, and I can't even freakin imagine."
705.0,Provider,"If I mean if your dad is thinking about moving somewhere else, have you ever thought about where you would feel. best."
13224.0,Patient,A California it's my home.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13224.0,Patient,"it's, not that I don't want to see other places I just. California, is my home."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm and you know that then yeah so it's like okay i'll scratch off the list, then looking at anything else different because. You like California. it's a family, you know, like you were saying your step mom has there been any recent conversations about you know. If they are thinking of selling the House or not."
13224.0,Patient,"A. Recent. Recent ish a. few weeks back or something. Like they've been talking about it. For at least a couple of years, the thing is, is that dad doesn't own the House my uncle does he was kind of grammys favorite. and that's a whole other can of worms honestly."
705.0,Provider,That tells you a lot right there Henry yeah yeah.
13224.0,Patient,"I love uncle Doug I just. This always been frustrating because he's never been able to understand. Why didn't I feel the way we have felt about grammy because Doug never experienced. Right grammys wrath, to the point that Andy did."
705.0,Provider,yeah and for a mother to make that distinction between her children and not be able to be impartial just shares with you that that mental health heart that was not treated yeah.
13224.0,Patient,"um but basically and it's not like Doug is. antagonists antagonistic in any way, he is he's a good dude he's a pleasant dude to be around. He and my dad always have and always will have each other's backs there's thick and thin. And it's not that he would be. actively against what dad and lori decide to do it's just that he is kind of this extra step for the in the process that they would need to do it, so it does complicate things, even though he wouldn't actively be trying to sabotage will complicate anything himself. Just the fact that he's the he was the executor of the will he owns the properties that she left behind and that's just how it is."
705.0,Provider,yeah that's you know what the family dynamics there Henry i'm glad that you have Ashley and that that's something that has nothing we go with the family side you're just like look I just need you to just listen and don't. Just listen yeah.
13224.0,Patient,"Oh, one of the thing that I wanted to I guess kind of. Talk about or just say really um because I know I mentioned that there's a part of me that still tries to gaslight myself regarding you know my trauma regarding Shelby. But. The main reason that I know that it's true, and that it happened is because Ashley. i've been friends with Ashley i'm just as long as I was friends with Shelby my ex and we were all friends and Ashley was. A witness to a lot of the bullcrap that she'll be tried to pull and she would actively you know call her out on it."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13224.0,Patient,"Which just would stunned me back then, to show we would make me feel like it was all my fault. But anyway, yeah Ashley. very much a big reason why I know i'm not making it up."
705.0,Provider,"Right and and it came with trauma, it is you know common that sometimes, because you try to avoid and push those feelings down of why you would. Second guess yourself but to have this person is like no Henry i'm sorry, but it did happen, this is, you know i'm being able to heal and that way to. know now. Well, you know I know you're doing a lot of really good work and. Sometimes, too, especially with this much family history as I try to if it gets too overwhelming to pull it back and just be like you know what just for today. done when I need to do i'm going to move on to something else, and then tomorrow, if you want to pick it back up this be might be mindful of how you're feeling each day yeah yeah."
13224.0,Patient,Do you think. there's more benefit to physically writing it out versus typing it on a digital document or.
705.0,Provider,Which one do you feel like you're more connected to.
13224.0,Patient,"it's kind of 5050 because there's pros and cons to each. If I physically write it out, then, sometimes I have trouble putting thoughts and feelings into words and I draw. My doodle yeah. But i'm downside is that. there's a higher chance of someone finding the physical writing and reading it and invading my privacy and that's just a whole nother thing I wouldn't need that i'll probably talk about next week. But then writing it out. Like typing it on digital document it's easy for me to save it and access it and not lose it. I wouldn't be able to doodle directly on the document, but I do have my iPad and the special pen for that yeah so I can still kind of draw my feelings if I need to I just wouldn't be able to directly transition from type into drawing in the same file."
705.0,Provider,"If that works so for you Henry and especially to even if you are concerned is even password protected, you know, whatever you're creating to be able to have it that safe space yeah. And you know what you're writing to is coming from the place of just you know here's what I need this is what I deserve. I wanted to say to is going to bring up I know we're we're towards the end here, and I appreciate how open and honest and you know, again, I can see where the path that. you're taking is like really healthy and I know, sometimes family members, going to struggle with that because they're not if you're healthy, then I got to look at myself and make myself healthy and it's just like ah avoid. But you're here and you're doing it. And so I encourage you to you know. Do now it's time for you Henry yes, I do what's going to make you feel better. Would you like to do too I don't see like I pulled up the color i'm glancing at it. I don't believe last time we set up another appointment."
13224.0,Patient,I don't think we did.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to go in scheduled out yeah."
13224.0,Patient,it's only been an hour so many notifications.
705.0,Provider,Would you like to you want me to see like next week on the 16th if there's availability.
13224.0,Patient,"If. If that works. I thought we were only doing. Every other week, but if if my insurance would cover the weekly I wouldn't mind it."
705.0,Provider,"um I don't know if it does, but I will see if I can find out for for you Henry of what it does cover because that's a good point. I don't you know I think weekly would be great, but I don't want you to put you in a position where then your insurance is like Oh, we only allow. So I will put in an increased for you so let's go ahead, then the 23rd you if you want to do that and then i'll give you know I can take a look in it."

13224.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good."
705.0,Provider,"Perfect i'm going to put that in then right now, while we're speaking where that way, no one else gets it and then put the 60 minutes, where then there's no one right behind you know I like an hour if that still works for you."
13224.0,Patient,OK OK.
705.0,Provider,So i'm going to put the 2034 pm.
13224.0,Patient,"i'm i've been meaning to ask, do you prefer to be cold Valerie or Dr Patterson or Dr Valerie year."

Maybe one day i'll go back and get my doctrines but for. elysee yeah but I appreciate you asking Henry but valor valerie's fine. yeah so we're then set on the 23rd at 4pm and then I look forward to also seeing you to say."
