7612.0,Patient,Hello.
10.0,Provider,Are you there.
7612.0,Patient,Yes.
10.0,Provider,how's it going.
7612.0,Patient,i'm fine just. The Court today. Very.
10.0,Provider,What happened.
7612.0,Patient,"I said it didn't go very well, I can tell you a little more about it, I wanted to X i'm like what's going on with the group and stuff."
10.0,Provider,yeah so let me pull up the. emails that were going around. One second here. So how do you think it's going. In. When around with it for you.
7612.0,Patient,And i've definitely gotten better I feel like the program is helping me what I actually didn't get to talk to anybody about was the issue with the therapist. With the one on one.
10.0,Provider,You just muted yourself.
7612.0,Patient,"Oh sorry, can you hear me."
10.0,Provider,yeah what was the issue.
7612.0,Patient,With my one on one therapy.
10.0,Provider,yeah what was the issue.
7612.0,Patient,"I haven't been scheduled any slack when sean's started, I think I met with her one time and then after that we didn't have anything else scheduled. And then I, the next time I spoke with her, she was saying that I was being discharged from the program but I didn't understand that, because i've been coming to group. And we could I don't know like I feel like it just could have been figured out, instead of being discharged. In our guest on face net again."
10.0,Provider,I think. yeah the issue was that you hadn't been attending your individual therapy.
7612.0,Patient,Right.
10.0,Provider,"So that that's a big part of the Program. And then. bear with me one, second, please. yeah so. It looks like you're overdue for your urine test and. They they're saying that since you're not engaging in therapy. and yeah so they're they're feeling like. Like maybe the program is not a good fit for you, what do you think."
7612.0,Patient,"That, I think it is, I mean, I want to do therapy, I would rather have the one on one I just when I met with her. The first time was supposed to schedule, one I think I missed it or I missed maybe two or whatever the next time you spoke. She was like very rude and aggressive and I was saying, like why couldn't we just have this conversation during one of the groups or after. Like when she pulled me aside the last group, we have we actually did talk, she was just saying like. I asked them to drop you from the program because you missed the appointments or whatever and i'm like I haven't seen any scheduling for them. You like it's been a problem with my therapy since i've joined after Cynthia left it's been confusing since then, the first therapist I asked for a different one. Because I feel like we weren't seeing it I like I was trying to explain to her, like the stuff that I was going through and all that, and she wasn't. She wasn't listening to me, then I think like if i'm not speaking to a therapist that has my best. interest you know, like maybe I need to get this for different one, so I think that's how I ended up with shine but I didn't know who she was you know I didn't never see her or meet with her when they did a sinus. But I think I did miss them i'm not saying that I didn't but I don't think that I should be dropped from dude for that, I think I was actually telling her like I think we could have. worked out a schedule, or something with that, even though i've been explaining like my current situation, the moving situation all that stuff like being kicked out of the program is not gonna help."
10.0,Provider,"You, so what i'm hearing you say is that you feel like that program is helping you and you were having some issues getting scheduled with a therapist. Okay, I think that."
7612.0,Patient,"flight, basically, I met her. In group, not one on one, the first time we spoke was in group, and she was saying Oh, you were supposed to have a meeting with me and I was like oh I didn't know. Okay."
10.0,Provider,"I think what we could do is. switch you to a different group I will ask them, it might be out of my hands. But I will ask them if they will give you another chance and we can change your therapist. So I think. The key is going to be easy to take care of screening right away."
7612.0,Patient,"I spoke with the clinic about that too, they haven't sent one, and when I asked them like, why does it keep popping up that I need to do a test and he was saying i'm not doing yet."
10.0,Provider,Okay sounds like there's been some. Some miscommunication.
7612.0,Patient,"I think I even have an email speaking with someone that I think I can pull it up on my screen, but I asked them was there anything else, I was missing, besides the way my. therapy therapy."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, looking right now. According to this your is significantly past do, and that you would you were sent one in August that hasn't been taken care of and the last one that you did wait, what is your frequency your. Frequency is. Quarterly oh. Actually it's saying monthly, let me change this, so how often do you think you need to come to."
7612.0,Patient,"group, I can do group every week."
10.0,Provider,So i'll put you on for weekly.
7612.0,Patient,"that's Another thing I was explaining to shine I think she think I was court appointed like I was had to do this, but I was trying to tell her like I came here on my own I came here before my case even started this i've been enrolled in here since like October last year."
10.0,Provider,yeah.
7612.0,Patient,"I guess yeah. yeah and she was like oh I didn't know that and I was saying, like yeah you don't ask me anything like my I don't have an issue with her is just I don't I don't understand like what her issue is. Oh no I can't even explain it, it seems like I understand that I missed group but, like her, like how a grant so she is like she I don't think I can talk to her like I wouldn't be able to explain, you know, like what happened and then or what's wrong with me or you know, like. I can't talk to her, she don't she don't don't know. I don't I don't want to be out of the program I don't need to stay here it's been helping me a lot. I just would like to find a therapist that I can actually speak with. Or that wants to talk to me."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long you been in the Program."
7612.0,Patient,or over a year since October.
10.0,Provider,"So i'm going to change it to. every three months, and then you come to group every week and you have your therapy once a month."
7612.0,Patient,that's fine.
10.0,Provider,"Is that good for you. yeah alright so i'll ask them if that's Okay, if I can switch you to another group so you're going to come to my but that's a Tuesday night group can you make that."
7612.0,Patient,yep tuesday's. yeah.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you. If you miss start missing groups and it's going to be on you a little bit like if you if they don't contact you about therapy, you need to contact them and make sure that you get that every month therapy session because I know that's important for you and then also. yeah I don't know what the deal is sounds like you and shawn maybe just in there didn't click together so we'll have you come to group on Tuesday and I can't promise this so i'm going to put an email and say that we met and that we discussed the program and and that we're going to. You know we're going to get we're going to try give you one more shot, but it means you. Go to virtual clinic right now, if you need a new cup because it sounds like you don't have one right. Right yeah and your last year in was. hold on, let me see."
7612.0,Patient,It was a while ago yeah so.
10.0,Provider,"It, we need to. I may have said, the wrong thing because previously, I was under the impression that if you weren't getting a control of medicine you didn't have to get your urine checks, but now it's like part of the program even if you're not getting any."
7612.0,Patient,day you gotta.
10.0,Provider,"check that periodically, so we can make sure we're providing adequate care so. So let me see last time you did that. And I want to say, congratulations on being sober how long's it been."
7612.0,Patient,A year.
10.0,Provider,wow.
7612.0,Patient,"over a year since October, since I joined here i've been sober."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so I mean I think that's a that's a success story."
7612.0,Patient,"It is and that's why I was also trying to explain to her like. i'd rather talk one on one like I wasn't missing the meetings on purpose, once the Court started. Then, my timing got messed up like we're coming to the meetings and doing work and stuff so I was and then my therapist was getting switched and stuff and I was trying to explain that to her and she was like. Well, this is your third therapists maybe it's you like you're the problems like like that just made me not want to speak with her, because I was like Why would you. think that. Like you switch between from this person I was like well Cynthia last and the other lady was acting like this, like are they just so mean I don't like they're like i'm coming to therapy, I need some help I don't want to be talk to like that."
10.0,Provider,"yeah okay so yeah last time that we have on you, is. July, so we need to get that done right away so basically do you have something to write on how are you going to remember all this."
7612.0,Patient,I haven't.
10.0,Provider,So you're going to come to the group on Tuesday at seven with me and Ashley. You need to go to virtual clinic and get your urine test done immediately. And they can even just send it to the lab and then you just go to the lab you have to wait for a cup. And then you need to make a new therapy appointment. And you need to keep all your appointments is the most important thing. If you start missing appointments again then it's going to be out of my hands but i'm going to. write one more chance and hope that they let you stay in the program because I feel like clearly it is helping you you've been in recovery. And it sounds like there might have been just a personality clash between you and shawn.
7612.0,Patient,Right.
10.0,Provider,"So. I will, I will work on that email now and then. In unless something changes well either way you can come to group not tonight, but next week and then i'll let."
7612.0,Patient,"Next week, Tuesday."
10.0,Provider,Tuesday yeah a week from today.
7612.0,Patient,So every Tuesday night will be.
10.0,Provider,"Every Tuesday night same room number. And will and if there's an issue we'll discuss it next week, but hopefully they'll be cool with me letting you have another chance."
7612.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
10.0,Provider,Okay you're welcome any other questions concerns.
7612.0,Patient,With the therapy appointment I go back to the clinic for that.
10.0,Provider,"yeah go back to the clinic that it might be. A little tricky because you're in the process of being discharged so. I will send a note and hopefully we can get you in with a new therapist if if they don't do that right away, I might have to wait until they make a decision on you staying with the Program."
7612.0,Patient,"Okay, so just check that. out check. Okay."
10.0,Provider,"Yes, I think the main thing is you just got to be really on top of your appointments on top of your your testing the urine testing, which is only once a quarter so it's every three months, but you got to remember it and then. And yeah and hopefully that will be show show them that you're engaged in the Program."
7612.0,Patient,"Okay, I will."
10.0,Provider,Okay.
7612.0,Patient,I guess I can talk about my. Group.
10.0,Provider,But if you want to tell me what's going on in a nutshell that'd be helpful.
7612.0,Patient,"Well, today I went in to take a deal, it was for. felony dui and. I would do 210 days and then get out and do another year on ankle monitor. And I didn't take it. So i'm going back to court in Friday actually is going to do a preliminary hearing the lawyer informed me that I might be taken into custody which i'll have to bail out. From that if he takes me off. So that's basically what's happened happening today wow."
10.0,Provider,that's just so you you didn't take it so you're gonna fight for no jail time.
7612.0,Patient,"yeah That was the initial thing like I was gonna try to do the ankle monitor but I found out he never asked the Court for sentencing on the ankle monitor so they never brought it up, which is why I didn't take the deal. Okay, because I wanted to do no jail time but i'm."
10.0,Provider,Just a public defender.
7612.0,Patient,No paid lawyer.
10.0,Provider,"A lawyer okay. All right, well, he offered them."
7612.0,Patient,"To for me to do eight months with five years on, come on there. Is I don't know I just feel like he want me to go to jail so. i'm paste fire. And i'm going to trial."
10.0,Provider,you're gonna get a new lawyer.
7612.0,Patient,"Well i'm gonna actually go with the public defender now because I don't think they're going to go up on the. glass deal they offered, even though I didn't take it, but I just can't see them going higher so i'm i'm hopefully just trying to get that same time, but on the ankle monitor, so I can stay outing working stuff."
10.0,Provider,The way they give you a. felony what happened.
7612.0,Patient,I have five.
10.0,Provider,I see.
7612.0,Patient,"In a less than 10 year period, but i've never liked hurt anybody or nothing I just I got pulled over got a dui got released like like the first couple of times I did a class and all that, so this is the fifth one and it's I guess like after the fifth one it's a felony. which I would be. really willing to take, but just not with the custody and the ankle monitor. So that's what i'm going through."
10.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like you learn your lesson and you left the alcohol behind."
7612.0,Patient,I did.
10.0,Provider,How do you feel about that.
7612.0,Patient,"i'm proud of myself, but I don't feel it because I feel like you don't matter."
10.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, either way that's it it matters. Be clear about that it matters that you're not drinking that you're living a sober lifestyle matters for your kids you have a kid right. yeah and for your family and for your life so. I think it's it's important not to even if you do end up having to go in. don't lose track of the fact that you know you made a huge change yeah. and yeah I mean it's a. it's a disease, you know alcoholism is a disease and you don't don't blame yourself, for it and you know you're doing the right thing to treat yourself and that's why I want to keep you in the program so."
7612.0,Patient,And that's another reason why I want to stay. And that's also another reason why I need a therapist like I need to be able to. Talk it out. yeah yeah it feels better yeah. Let me go.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, well, let me work on this email and i'll See you in group next week at Tuesday I mean next week, Tuesday, at seven."
7612.0,Patient,"got it Okay, thank you."
10.0,Provider,you're welcome all right bye bye.
