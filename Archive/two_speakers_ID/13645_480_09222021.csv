Domestic violence and homelessness and they do classes as call it's like an internship was like a. interns are school for 12 weeks and it's four nights a week Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and they do like job readiness preparedness self Defense occupational therapy mentor in your field. and other classes and things that like prepare you for the workforce."
480.0,Provider,Very cool.
13645.0,Patient,yeah. And so I did two interviews with them and then I end up finding out yesterday I got in.
480.0,Provider,congrats.
13645.0,Patient,Thank you so now my Mondays is much more busier.
480.0,Provider,yeah what it sounds like all your days are that much more busier now.
13645.0,Patient,yeah especially Mondays because money is in like. And then my work doubled as well.
480.0,Provider,The car engine and group So why did it double.
13645.0,Patient,"um well, it was supposed to double so I wasn't expecting it to double this quickly. But they were like they love my two weeks of work and. So they're like hey we really enjoy your writing, and we know like what the learners believe that it might be a lot harder for you, but. we're willing to take a chance, and we see that you're on time with your work and you complete it, and do it, and so that was really exciting and we're like they didn't tell me that I just showed up as like oh you're double work i'm like you guys could tell me."
480.0,Provider,A heads up might have been nice.
13645.0,Patient,"yeah so that was my only awake and I guess like the car generally supposed to take like two minutes each and they take me like 15 and 30 minutes to an hour so so my brain processes 10 times slower than the average person because of the accident that I was in. And I saw a lot of like recovery with it. yeah like like work on it, and everything but."
480.0,Provider,What do you mean work on it like do you do cognitive exercises or something.
13645.0,Patient,"yeah I went through late i'm five quarters with Western Washington University in Washington with a speech and language clinic. Was Washington. For three years it was like three years of it, and then I went through 20 weeks of vision therapy. And then I went through physical therapy."
480.0,Provider,rehabilitation.
13645.0,Patient,"and other things. yeah so I pretty much had a real learn how to read and write and function and come up with words and so. yeah I had a learning disability coming into the car accident, but I just made it that much harder and that's where like my pot tied accelerated the conditioning that I have kind of accelerated. Four years later, after the course that they didn't find out those we need my brain for six months."
480.0,Provider,Oh. wow.
13645.0,Patient,"And so that's why they feel like it was all worse, and then the doctors in Washington weren't really like responding like something's wrong, something is not right, I was also like heavily don't either I lost over 50 pounds in a year. wow um and it was really hard after five months, like the first and then I decided to go back to school go back into work. And within a year and a half, I end up burning out pretty badly where end up going to get strokes and things and so i've gone through over like six T shirts in my lifetime and the last five years yeah, and so they end up figuring out through a. migraine clinic that it was those strokes are from migraines. causing like a weird neurological. signals and I bring not like doing electrical so it's not really the blood flow and my brain is more of a logical and balance."
480.0,Provider,"What can they do, for that is there, like anything."
13645.0,Patient,"No, unfortunately with like with all them they're they're not they're logical issues and with like pods and everything like they see that, like my heart, like they did an ekg and I the testing and they're going to read during our heart older sign again but. And they keep going back to like mris and like ages and everything, but all of them are showing as clear which we know that's like it's false with me. Because, like, for me, when I was diagnosed with everything they didn't know what was going to happen because I couldn't even move like the accident like. No one really paid attention to it like like was like oh here's this we just like sent me to all these doctors and we're hoping like. They were going to fix everything, but my health was such a like bamboozled that they're like we don't even know where to start we don't even know and like a lot of the medications a lot of the therapies actually made me a lot worse. And so, how do we start everything all over. And over and over again for like five years."
480.0,Provider,sounds exhausting.
13645.0,Patient,"yeah, and so they like luckily i'm not the point where I Max a day, where it's not as bad, but I definitely have the exhaustion still I still going and have like the like the migraines every once in a while that. And everything and then on top of all the other conditions and the mental health aspects of it's like."
480.0,Provider,As a lot. yeah there's a lot of layers and moving pieces. yeah.
13645.0,Patient,"And when I came here like I almost went here for a year but, like the team of doctors didn't really do anything until like. I was like throwing up blood and they're like oh you're not going to be able to GI specialist until October. And so I haven't really solid GI specialist and everything else for like my ibs and then I was like my vision is getting worse again like can you figure out like why my vision is getting worse again."
480.0,Provider,And they won't.
13645.0,Patient,"it's like and so that's. Just the frustrating part is like. Constantly like having to be on top of like doctors and specialists and places and people and then like. Like oh you're not as though you're not like we don't see any red flags and then like two months later, like Oh, we should listen to you, there was a word flogging this and that's what's hard it's like. always having to like to."
480.0,Provider,"Say like you're constantly having to advocate for yourself, which is really hard when you're not. feeling well and there's you're not a doctor either you don't know what's going on."
13645.0,Patient,"yeah and it's like hard because it's like. it's hard because it's like I know like when things aren't going right and when presenting things and people are like Oh, I was just your anxiety, or just like trauma response to the body i'm like. i'm like yeah I can be that as well, I can understand, but. They."
480.0,Provider,"Are you know your body, you know your trauma responses, so you know when it's not that."
13645.0,Patient,"yeah, and so it makes it really difficult when it's like when like i'm on like 20 medications 15 supplements like. and doctors like oh. Like you're the doctors, why are you asked me if I should be on all these medications yeah so yeah that's just. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"that's a lot So how are you feeling as far as what we talked about on Monday, have you thought about like do you want to stay up right hard you want to get referrals for outside psychiatrist because I can easily get referrals for you, I just have to. So."
13645.0,Patient,"I was like talking with Sema on Monday, and then I was also talking with my brother on a Monday. um and like we had just felt like there's a lot of like moving parts of our star Member at heart that like it it's kind of a lot to like. We didn't like when I originally signed up for bret Hart they didn't really tell us like oh you'll be required to go to groups you're required to do, like all of these different requirements with it. And so that was like it was just we were just like thrown out of the loop with it and so."
480.0,Provider,"So just so I know and can address this within the company, who did the intake with you, was it the doctor or was it the intake specialists that didn't tell you about the program the intake specialist. yeah okay. yeah because that's something that people need to know going in because we've had some similar complaints if, like well I didn't know that it was all of the stuff and. i'm trying to figure out like where the breakdown in communication is so that when people sign up you're not blindsided you know."
13645.0,Patient,"yeah and then also. Since I had a counselor outside of you guys, they were saying that I was needing to see a concert with you guys, but then they're like no you still have a city councilor. And then my psychiatrist he didn't even know that like oh wasn't you have a counselor, then you don't need to go grew. And so just getting so many things and then compliance is like no, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this. And I was like no one was giving me any information about even what the groups were about they're like no you just have to show up to it, and hopefully it works for you. And it's like we like as patients, we don't even have like a yes or no about issues like like it's almost like our control as patients is like completely taken away with right heart. is like that's like a lot of things, or is like. Nothing was really explain to us like even like recording like sessions or planes. Like nothing was really explain to me, and then, when I was explaining like what was going on with CMOs like this is like what's been going on, just like this is weird and like how they do different things and. I was like I don't know because I don't even know like what even the program is no one's really explained to me like exactly like how long the program is how long classes are, how long like accounting sessions are, and I was just like. Just toss into multiple different things, and also different areas where i'm like i'm still trying to deal with my things on the outside world, when I was thrown into everything back in July with you guys. And now it's September, and I still don't even know like three months later, and I still like huh."
480.0,Provider,you've been here since July with right.
13645.0,Patient,end of July.
480.0,Provider,"one. Oh, like so are you even actively engaging in anything since."
13645.0,Patient,The psychiatrist.
480.0,Provider,Oh interesting okay.
13645.0,Patient,"I didn't other accounts, there was you guys and then I did all of the intakes and I did all of the processes like i'm supposed to see a wellness coach next month in October. And so, like they'll just like send me emails and say hey you got to turn this appointment here's a time and date. Like or they'll like say like oh call us back because you have this appointment and then they'll tell us like oh you're required to do this, and like i'm like Hello like. And like even when I explained to them like I even explain to them on when I talked to compliance all the times and my character, saying that, like my monies are busy, I am fully booked like this is going to be essential situation and what can you guys do about this."
480.0,Provider,And i'm.
13645.0,Patient,Sorry you're just gonna have to talk to her providers and you're just gonna have to suck it up until you can figure out what's you.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you have someone else that can take over your meds."
13645.0,Patient,"No, no other psychiatry meds because I do have a primary care doctor, but with my primary care office is really hard to get into appointments with them. it's actually really necessary to get into them so and bright heart on my schedule medications every month like girls. yeah so like like I was planning to say like bright heart and Todd Gordon and there's like heartless I can see at least."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to. Put in an inquiry in your chart so um the the department, we have that does referrals and stuff i'll just ask them if they can find some resources in your area, so, then at least we have some suggestions for you."
13645.0,Patient,"yeah and then I know my caseworker here said that she was going to talk with the DMA or something don't even know who they are i'm here, I think. i'm. and see and then my my counselor is going to see about like what we can do. Like I said i've been thrown around with counselors since. June. No wonder to get seema July."
480.0,Provider,yeah. seems like she's been with you for a couple months at least right.
13645.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah cuz I saw her right after my er visit one I look so as a week after so the last week of. July lie, I saw her."
480.0,Provider,So if we can find you psychiatry referrals then your goal is to just discharged from bright heart completely right.
13645.0,Patient,yeah I was just like I just don't know how it would work out with everything.
480.0,Provider,"yeah and then I was like that's. Probably the best option, but I do like that you want to stay here until have someone very smart."
13645.0,Patient,"yeah and that's like the only thing like I was like. I don't really want to leave in case something happens my medication and I can't get into the new psychiatry so I don't even know when that appointments going to open that kind of win in a week and I could open a month, I can. um yeah, and so I know like multiple different people are trying to figure it out. With everything except."
480.0,Provider,"For just for your knowledge, if you don't want to come to group on Mondays and you don't want to do the peer support appointment next month, and all of that you can call and cancel and it won't count against you compliance wise. Over as long as you call the virtual clinic and cancel your appointments it doesn't count against you, the only reason it counts is if there's a no show and then it's mainly so bright heart initially was designed for. medication assisted treatment with opiate addiction like that was the niche initially so we've expanded to do other things, but that's why a lot of the program is designed how it's designed is to. We do like the weekly groups with a doctor for my check ins, because most of those people are on some sort of human or friend and they get their minutes every week. And so that's where the compliance comes into play is people that are on weekly meds if they miss appointments than their prescription gets cut in half, with a refill so like we're never keeping meds from people but. it's kind of motivation to want to show up to your appointments, because otherwise, you have to go to pharmacy twice, instead of once in a week, you know so mental health clients. totally different compliance issues don't really affect you as much because you're getting 30 day prescriptions anyways and they're not going to call in seven pills of an antidepressant you know what I mean. So if it gets really overwhelming you don't feel like you can handle group that's totally fine, we can still keep you enrolled just cancel your appointment, so it doesn't affect your medication at all. I feel like that's probably the best way to I mean you're welcome to still come to groups until you discharge, but I know you said they're really triggering and Mondays are really long so might not be the best idea for your overall wellness."
13645.0,Patient,expression was all the classes and group they're going to have us do I don't even know exactly to the full extent of them. are like. They are they're not like a counseling they do have a counselor with them that does things but it's just like. In this situation in the Grand scheme of things like to try to take on so many things that have already going on. yeah which i've done this most of my life is what myself solid and then for a not really quickly.
480.0,Provider,"Oh yeah, which is totally a trauma response i'm sure you know, like making your plate so overly full and then burning out that's like trauma response pattern right there."
13645.0,Patient,yeah as those like i'm Emma like even my things are like do you have room to relax and chill like yeah my thing is just zoning out to TV shows when I get the chance to because it's all my brain can think and do.
480.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, I think it sounds like a good plan um. Do you feel comfortable with this plan."
13645.0,Patient,"yeah, I think, just like and i'll let my caseworker here know, and my counselor and you can let them know as well, because they probably want to hear from you as well, what the plan is. So just keep on with the. So what are like. i'm like trying to understand like what so how is this going to work for the next however long."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you want to keep coming to group, you can keep coming to group, if you don't want your current medication prescriptions like Where are you at are you when are you going to need a refill."
13645.0,Patient,The ace. In two weeks.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so what I feel like what fits best with your schedule is just scheduling an individual appointment with share because she's on the prescribed your meds and then canceling your group appointment. i'm the wellness coaching don't bother. it's like it's from what i've heard from people is that it's not a therapist that does it and it's very self healthy like stuff you can read on Google. yeah so typically they try to do the peer support more for people that are struggling with compliance. And, but they have everyone do it once just as like part of the program but i've heard from a lot of mental health clients that it's actually a little bit harmful because of the The self help type of stuff. yeah um, so I would not recommend going to that I don't think that would be a good use of your time so hansel that as well. So basically if you want, I can email you and send right in the email the number that you would you can just text you don't even have to call you can text and asked to cancel your group appointments and the peer support appointment. And then you do have to call the virtual clinic to make an appointment Sharon. I don't think you can text to make. Appointments, but I can send you an email, with all that information if it's easier than just doing it."
13645.0,Patient,on me.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, you can."
13645.0,Patient,"So I didn't hear anything what you just said, because they zoned out."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so um. So if it's easier for you, I can send you an email, with all of the instructions. Of what you need to do."
13645.0,Patient,"Yes, I don't even know there's a text number they never told us about that."
480.0,Provider,"yeah it's newer like in the past couple months but that's how we're having people check in for individual appointments now, because then you don't have to wait in the virtual clinic which is lovely it's been working out really well. So she's."
13645.0,Patient,Like 10 or 1520 minutes waiting in line for appointments.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and it depends on how like later in the day it's even worse, I heard somebody yesterday, and one of my Group said they were on for over two hours trying to do a drug test, because it was evening time yeah. So texting is a way to go with the virtual clinic."
13645.0,Patient,yeah I also have 100 clients.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
13645.0,Patient,"How, what was the weather was like holy moly."
480.0,Provider,"So it's manageable because that's the way our program is so a lot of the people, so I see people in my group, so I see them once a week in group, and then a lot of my clients only do every two weeks. And well I say it's half and half like I have half that do weekly and half that do every two weeks, and then I have some that only do once a month because that's how the program is designed to do like a step down right, so you start with. Groups weekly therapy twice a month and then after you've been doing well for a while you step down to only to coming to groups every two weeks. There be still two weeks or once a month, depending on what you're working on and then eventually you get to the point where you're only going to group once a month and then therapy once a month."
13645.0,Patient,"So I. explained this to us, but then never explained this to me whatsoever."
480.0,Provider,"can't believe they didn't explain that to you like, I know what it's all in the intake packet but I don't expect you to be reading all the intake like that's something that should be verbally explain to you when you're doing your assessment."
13645.0,Patient,yeah no none of that was explained to me.
480.0,Provider,"it's frustrating, I will definitely relate that information i'm. Something to is things are constantly changing here. Which is good because we're changing things based on client feedback everyone's like constantly trying to make things better and easier and faster and easier to navigate and all of that, but it's still a work in progress, which is why we still sometimes have issues. So. i'm going to email you all this information, I already put an inquiry into look for resources in your area for psychiatry, so I will also email you that when I hear back it's usually within like two or three days that I hear back from them. So I will send that information to you and i'll probably if you're okay with it just copy see my on the emails."
13645.0,Patient,"Yes, fine. Anyway, so."
480.0,Provider,yeah perfect.
13645.0,Patient,yeah I was gonna I was like yeah just do it because I wasn't before forward it to her anyway.
480.0,Provider,"hey. We can be done today, if you want, since you know technically we're not doing therapy anymore, but I really appreciate how open you Ben and i've enjoyed hearing parts of your story."
13645.0,Patient,"Thank you so much, thank you for listening and making this work and crazy kind of everything i'm like how. What a worked out with you guys. It seems like a really great programs and create opportunities and everything else, like I wish I had you guys in 2020 of them so much. Like yeah I thought you guys are 2020 I probably would have gone down such a slippery slope in life, and what do you want a leg. Like."
480.0,Provider,22 when you look at where you are now.
13645.0,Patient,I know.
480.0,Provider,that's amazing.
13645.0,Patient,"yeah a year like years clean and sober a year out, was eating disorder help and everything else from ETA and everything so it's like it's just crazy like. How much my life has changed dramatically I think it's so crazy because people like they see me at the point where they meet me, and so they don't understand, like all the other way what i've had to get through here and like. I know there's so so much more growth and opportunity, especially like with all the trauma and ptsd and the mental health aspect of it, but I don't like. Can we just figure something out."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well you're incredible you're resilient you're strong and I know you're going to do, big things in life because that's what we do when we've been through hell and back yep we use it to help others right."
13645.0,Patient,yeah Thank you so much for your understanding everything and talking with.
480.0,Provider,"I will email you and feel free if you have any questions, between now and time of discharged email me anytime i'm always available."
13645.0,Patient,"Already, thank you."
480.0,Provider,"you're welcome, and I see we."
13645.0,Patient,"Can you also email me Mayra psychologists email as well, you should never give it to me."
480.0,Provider,"So i'm not allowed to give other providers emails that's up to the provider like half of our therapists don't give out their emails it's a personal choice that I get my now. So, can you replace it with her ask her if she gives out or email. Okay, because some of them do some of them down i'm just not allowed to give anyone else."
13645.0,Patient,yeah no that makes total sense. already take care.
