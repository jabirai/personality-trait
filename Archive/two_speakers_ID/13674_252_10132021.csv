Oh wow so long if i'm gone. wow."
252.0,Provider,So it's exciting to be able to go back and. yeah me and.
13674.0,Patient,my brother saying with my mom though so i'm a little nervous for is not just because he's never met my way friend. I don't know if you remember me telling you about all this potential with ISIS disco and him like attacking my mom and showing up at my apartment. yeah my brother so just I don't really talk to him. i've seen him a few times and it's just like Hello not conversation but he's never met my boyfriend and when he acted like that with my roommate who were male he freaked out so i'm just like if you can. kind of begin to react I don't know what to expect from him.
252.0,Provider,his vision. I. see where you're worried. yeah you know.
13674.0,Patient,"that the last few times, I must say mom she misses in the room, the entire time like he did not come out. With some if he does that."
252.0,Provider,Every good.
13674.0,Patient,"You can come and say hello, but I just don't know how he's gonna react. So."
252.0,Provider,What is your boyfriend say about it.
13674.0,Patient,"While we were going to take the camper visually so we can stop the go camping down at joshua tree, but we changed our mind and we didn't realize how long we were his cousin was going to be out of town. So, then, we were talking about it, I was like I don't i'm kind of nervous about leaving the camera my mom's fall we're going to San Diego because of my brother he's like well do you think he would do anything to all my I don't think. But I just don't know like. I know he's. he's a math guy he's very unpredictable. So I was displayed here that will be have insurance with them like yeah I know I just don't know if you can actually view the whole thing is just making me a little nervous i'm probably just overthinking and getting into my own hands, but. I just don't trust him. trust him I don't want it to be like a promotion or. I don't know he hadn't acted that way with me and the only time I ever saw it was when he showed up at my house, but he's acting that way with my mom a few times when she first started dating her boyfriend which is, when all this started happening. But i've never seen him act like that that's fine but he's also never met my boyfriend my boyfriend, which was a long time ago. Before all of this. And we'll see."
252.0,Provider,yeah just I think that is that being cautious is good. yeah. You know what I know.
13674.0,Patient,"Having exactly yeah but my resume wasn't too worried like I don't think you'll do anything you know, like we haven't sure and. Now we're not saying with the camper so i'm like making me feel a little bit better I think it'll be okay we're just going to probably just like real my mom's house and just spend the day with her. i'm."
252.0,Provider,Good have an exit plan.
13674.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"always have an exit plan, just in case, especially with the unpredictability and not being medicated you know what I mean. past history. Keep yourself. You know."
13674.0,Patient,"yeah like when i'm at her house i'm okay I don't now I am before it took me a while like if he was there I wouldn't say I would just leave. He wouldn't say anything to me, he would just go into the room and then, finally, we talked again like black maybe only two Christmases ago now, or last Christmas Christmas, you had come over, and it was just kind of. awkward just like okay you don't have anyone out. If you're not. you're not medicated I know it affects him a lot. So my mom said she tried to talk to him about it, and she said, you know, like if. i've talked to her about it and i'm like the medication is going to help him talking to someone and just you know it's going to be new and he doesn't know where to start ago but that's what's going to help him like. And she said that she started talking about things that one he just doesn't want to I don't know if it's just like a denial clean or. What."
252.0,Provider,"Well, he has a schizophrenia right. mm hmm so there's a piece of it, and this isn't not have normal people struggle with with schizophrenia they'll start to feel better on the meds and then they'll quit taking them think they don't need them anymore. Somebody that fights being on medication there's almost this delusion that you're the medication you're trying to. not accept him fully or you know, trying to knock him out, you know subdue him, and you know with schizophrenia they really believe those things."
13674.0,Patient,yeah well the paranoia. yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know, it makes sense, but once they get on on medication, you know they feel better, but once they feel better they don't think they need it so it's kind of a vicious cycle, you know."
13674.0,Patient,yeah i'm.
252.0,Provider,"On disease, you know if he's not monitor to MIT you know we're in some kind of program that can keep an eye on them closely, you know."
13674.0,Patient,"Down you don't have like a year management, but well yeah I don't think that's the right. right one for him and part of it yeah he sent me a talking my mom."
252.0,Provider,that's.
13674.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,that's all he's in his anger management.
13674.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,well.
13674.0,Patient,They did anger management for it and then he's on probation.
252.0,Provider,probation. Is all. has his mom talked his probation officer.
13674.0,Patient,"about getting him. Mental health devout evaluated i'm not sure. I know that during the core my mom. So, and she said he needs help you know just be like the right people but i'm not sure what happened. From that he was just in jail for like another month and then they released him and he thought the two years duration and for three years probation I think it's a two year in your management program and then he has to complete all of it or all it's going to be a felony so. I don't know about anybody else, but when I know you know medication and once I feel. Like the apple my or she would walk into his room and he was just like staring at the wall like laughing like just. stuff it's like."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, it's a friend that schizophrenia baby, or you know."
13674.0,Patient,Yes.
252.0,Provider,Anger management class doesn't know that he's struggling with. They can't see it.
13674.0,Patient,I don't know.
252.0,Provider,i'm just like. that's weird to me.
13674.0,Patient,"I don't know and when my mom was talking to like the district attorney she said that my mom was talking to her like, how can we get him like on medication and she's like well we can't because he's an adult. So i'm like Okay, does he actually has to go like 5150 to be seen. and"
252.0,Provider,It seems to me like his probation officer can say you know what you need to go get a mental health evaluation.
13674.0,Patient,"yeah well like I mentioned it to my mom i'm not sure. How I don't know if I should get that information, though, like he won't share anything with her which you'd be able to get it from like the police station or."
252.0,Provider,He won't share her or who who his probation officer is.
13674.0,Patient,Like they don't really talk. brothers is very isolated and certain fellow. So.
252.0,Provider,I would think that you would be able to call the probation department and asked to speak to so and so's probation officer and even if there isn't a release of information she can leave the information on the. probation officers voicemail.
13674.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,"You know I know it's easy to say listen I know there's not a release of information for you to talk to me. But I need to give you this information, I really my son, you know he lives in my home and he needs an evaluation mental health. yeah you know he suffers from schizophrenia, and he needs help with that. I mean that's giving him information not asking for any information, you know."
13674.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,So there's that.
13674.0,Patient,"Oh, I thought i'll talk to her about it and it's hard for her to understand. A lot of it to like even with me when I would like to talk to her about like at ease he's just like you just need a like get up and do it. And I heard she like has the same thing you know, like her, she struggles, with just keeping up like I see my sister and my sister always fell on top of everything and i'm just like, how do you get something done and, like today, like that. seems impossible and exhausted, like a few hours. Just like get five tracks and my mom she's the same way, so like I remember the math or I haven't unpacked from like two months ago and. she's just always constantly like overwhelmed as well, or just always having to do something. So then she sees me into this like you don't need medication or man i'm just like okay well there's a lot going to help me and i'm just feeling stuck for the past 10 years and have not accomplished my goals and. i'm going to try it out and then after she was just building negative about it, and I was just like i'm just not going to talk to you about it i'm just not going to talk to you anymore about it. And then she called my sister up that says he's not gonna say anything, and we will follow your business and I don't want to have to hear, like her opinion. And so yeah I haven't really done anything to her, she hasn't been either. Not."
252.0,Provider,"turned on it, no."
13674.0,Patient,"I so first we started with the wellbutrin before doing any stimulants and I was like during my vacation and then I started with health me and then I was noticing like some side effects with it. And then, when it came to school, I was still just like cannot sit there, and like just I would get so sidetracked all the time and just I was just like okay I don't know if this is like the right one."
252.0,Provider,This is Morgan.
13674.0,Patient,"So, then, I talked to her and then she asked me to Ritalin which then I would take it, and they would just be a few hours, and then I would just be so tired like I kept taking NAPs during the day. I still wasn't like really getting anything done, and then I started with like googling like, how do you write. You know what's working what's not you like, if this sounds good to me so, then I was also getting these like weird head pressures. Like I had like split them in half, and then. Just for like a few days like this may not really a headache just felt like. A balloon kind of. And I was like drinking so much water is i'm like it can't be like dehydration and so then she just wished me now it's to the extended release line, but I am waiting on it, because the wonder about my insurance they don't cover it, they have to get like a request, so the. call me today saying we have she has to submit something and then, once it's approved, then we fulfill it. So I told them, I was leaving out of town so they're like sorry like we won't get it so now next week to wait till next week so hopefully that one will help."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
13674.0,Patient,"I won't be so tired, but just."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
13674.0,Patient,i'm trying to be patient.
252.0,Provider,yeah. you're doing a great job at it.
13674.0,Patient,"I don't feel like. i'm a teacher and I just wasn't sleeping during the day, and it felt so nice I was like waking up early. And just kind of have like a schedule and then now I switched off of it and i'm just like sleeping in later like even today I missed my my zoom meeting. I was just so tired, I was like now, I have to go through my day knowing I missed it and i'm just like Okay, hopefully with this new one. My alarm take it. You know, go back to sleep so yeah just some work."
252.0,Provider,"Unfortunately, with ADHD meds there's no. Perfect cocktail it's like you have to you know, experience and see which one actually you know works and allows you to be. focused, you know, while you're working while you're doing more."
13674.0,Patient,"That my boyfriend sister had that as well, so she was like. For. Try to ask not for tablets like those there's like a date like she just gets like all these little info with like what works for her and i'm like okay well. I don't know so i'm just gonna like can go along with it, but i'm just like I don't know what's really expect like i've never been mini medicated so i'm like. yeah so it's trying to be but i'm, just like the reference like they're dying guinea pig and what. I kind of added because I don't know what it is, or isn't going to help me. Everyone right."
252.0,Provider,"yeah everyone's different you know what might help for your sister in law may not work for you, it just depends. And you know it's working if you're able to concentrate and get things done right. yeah that's the ultimate goal. And that's yeah to be able to focus and and get things done."
13674.0,Patient,"yeah so. not there yet, but we'll see with the next week, I get the other one. three other. yeah that's so. cool. Just going okay. um yes, so I know my boyfriend has a lot of work to do so, I have to do. Tomorrow, and Friday nothing make stephen's do on Sundays. By like just one of my classes, which I hate that I told you, I hate writing."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13674.0,Patient,"I just. Just right. And that's what happened last time I was like getting God walking around I kept eating i'm just like trying sitting there just like so i'm signing off to myself just do it. it's like a one page paper it's taking me like six hours i'm like I don't think. It should be taken me this long to write like 500 words. And it was like a easy you about how to like you're going to write a house direction for someone flying for the first time, internationally, but you didn't like a research paper anything literally instruction. look like."
252.0,Provider,"So there's two elements that were fighting against you, and that was the the unending interest in writing the paper. Right and ADHD. Have you thought about like type to text or voice to text voice to to right."
13674.0,Patient,Now I haven't.
252.0,Provider,"They have those programs that you can put on your system and. It will write your paper as you're talking is your you're saying. As you're dictating so basically it's taking the information down. So when you have to write a paper you know if you can just talk into a microphone and say what you want the paper to say and then look at the paper and Edit it. That would be a lot better than having to struggle with continually sitting there and staring at a paper. Getting up and down, you know."
13674.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just like a perfectionist too so even when I write a paragraph out i'll reread it and then i'll be like no that sounds better and then i'll like reread it again and when i'm like on this one little intro paragraph or forever, but I am like edited 20 times. i'm like okay it's like an hour and a half and i've gotten one. One paragraph that. But hopefully by the end of this. i'll be back yes writing."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, the great part about it and with talk to right is that you can actually dictate the whole paper and then spend a couple hours editing. yeah papers done right. So you gotta do is the edit part of it and change, you know what you want to change, you know."
13674.0,Patient,"yeah i'm diving good um I had read like his reviews and a lot of people said that they he helped a lot with their writing and he's having a few like outline first and then submitting matt. And so, anything that is. Helping to for me not to just. Do you, like all or nothing."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
13674.0,Patient,really what it is. yeah i'm. on it.
252.0,Provider,"I used to love outlines i'm. writing a paper because it, you know just felt like it made it so easier easier, you know. yeah i've been talking, you know first off except the second topic third topic, you know what I mean and you just build it."
13674.0,Patient,yeah and here we have been like laying it out for us like a bit I want that there has to be there's got to be this in this paragraph to be that and so that makes it sound much. Easier here for me to not have to think about it.
252.0,Provider,Totally definitely.
13674.0,Patient,But writing i'd rather be doing that.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Definitely, well, I hope you have a good time. You know where you. And i'm glad that things have gotten better you know."
13674.0,Patient,mm hmm.
