760.0,Provider,morning.
16880.0,Patient,"Good morning, how are you."
760.0,Provider,Good how about you.
16880.0,Patient,"Okay, I was just. Thinking about. What to talk about but i'll let you go ahead and."
760.0,Provider,Okay stress. I wanted to see how you did with your journaling we talked about you we're going to Journal on pointing to my notes how healing is a process.
16880.0,Patient,"yeah i've i've failed my journaling assignment I don't know if I journaled once sorry about that I was not because I didn't want to I just I think why I brought this up in group on Monday this week, which is if I get like. Really sort of excited by something or a want to like. buy a bunch of books or. Try a bunch of new things, and then I I suddenly there's like 10 things to do in a day for me that's like self care mm hmm. therapeutic and then what happens that don't do any of it, because then I get so in my head about trying, you know which one to do and, and so the recommendation that they gave me was you know to just to. To kind of focus on what does that mantra she gave me like progress not perfection."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16880.0,Patient,"of just taking it like really, really slowly. But I have noticed. haven't journaled I have noticed a lot of i'm working a lot with the cognitive distortion list that you gave me I printed it out and posted it. and yeah i've got i've got several that are reoccurring. black or white thinking or all or nothing thinking for sure."
760.0,Provider,comes down belong for me.
16880.0,Patient,And I would I was just thinking about it to like probably emotional reasoning is a big one.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16880.0,Patient,"Also fortune telling or yes, you know, like you can."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, mine."
16880.0,Patient,know what the future.
760.0,Provider,might be.
16880.0,Patient,yeah Those are some big ones that keep coming up.
760.0,Provider,"yeah I think we have a tendency to. We think a thought or we have a belief, we have, and then we have an emotional response which may or may not be logical or or true, but I think we. have a tendency to believe it just because we're thinking it or just because this is emotion that I happen to be experiencing right now and training the brain to take in it is a process, Daniel of training, the brain retraining the brain to take a step back from that. and questioning. You know, questioning Is this true is this right. Instead of you know, perhaps so maybe some concepts of mindfulness mindful practices would be useful for you. Because that's. Do you I know you're you're pretty aware of spiritual ideas so, can you describe, for me, Daniel sitting here right now what you understand mindfulness to me."
16880.0,Patient,um. yeah does it come from like Jon kabat zinn and kind of extracted the sort of secularized version of Zen Buddhism.
760.0,Provider,"And that's yeah that's Mary it could come from there, but in in the purpose of like mental health treatments and we don't you know we religion can be important, but only when it's important to you, you know the patient. is ready to be in because not every patient. believes in Buddhism or Christianity some don't believe in anything so you know they're. atheists so right so but mindfulness is still a technique that can be useful, whether you have spiritual. If whether you're defining yourself as being a spiritual person or not so there's two basic really basic points number one is present moment awareness. Which means that i'm in the moment not stressing about the mistakes, I made in the past and i'm not projecting into the future, what i'm afraid of i'm going to be here right now. And, being aware of what am I thinking what am I feeling and what are the sensations that are occurring can be sensations can be things like temperature, or if you're outdoors of breeze or the sun, on your face or. Anything that you touch you know, to the feeling the way that your clothing feels you know, on your arms. You know how the. Other you know if you're walking, how is the are you walking on rocks or sand or grass cement and those kinds of sensations so it's like. And it's kind of designed. To kind of slow down the brain a little bit so that you're you know you're not stressing about the past or the future and then to add the second part of it that's super important Daniel and that's just. Developing a non non judgmental awareness. not judging it, meaning that means like. kind of taking a step back and having more of a curious mind, instead of being attached to the thinking or attached to the emotion and this kind of destructive way and and just kind of observing oneself. So those are the basic concepts of that and so. I like mindfulness because you want, you can sit down and you can do a meditation which you know I that can be done, but mindfulness and also be practice when you're doing daily chores daily duties washing dishes doing laundry exercising walking. It can be both so. So to kind of bring you back, maybe it would be better to pinpoint for these next couple weeks some small something. to work on, because it seems like we seem to be making progress about looking at your cognitive cognitive distortion, so why don't you describe, for me, before we move a little bit further what you're learning about your own cognitive distortions and how that's affecting you and. How are you trying to work with that."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. The all or nothing thinking tends to come in about. surrounding about like. Some there's some perfectionism in there. You know, thinking that if I if I don't do something perfectly. You know it's. it's no it's not worth doing or maybe it's reflecting. Poorly on myself or how or who I. As far as. i'm all or nothing is in like making things very binary like it's either. This or that. As far as how I perceive situation, sometimes or people or. I would say. The emotional reasoning kind of comes in, about. Allowing my feelings to drive and dictate. My choices or. To do or not do anything you know if I if i'm not feeling like it's going to work which emotional reasoning seems to sometimes tie into a little bit of that fortune telling minded."
760.0,Provider,And like.
16880.0,Patient,"If I feel like. Like a certain say like career path, if I feel like i'm not going to be good at it then i'm not going to. enjoy it or be good at it, you know before I even start anything you know and so. yeah I think what that looks like is. I mean this is. I kind of feel like this is an issue that i've had for a while now, and not being able to figure it out, but it's kind of tied into like. That idea of. Again feeling like I need to see what the end looks like, before beginning and feeling like. I need to. feel good about it all along the way. As i'm doing it. It for me, is, I mean for me the huge thing is like career stuff because I that's like a huge insecurity of mine. And it's been that way for a while, I think. Even going back to when I was actively kind of pursuing an artistic life of entertainment and that sort of thing and. was always kind of insecure about. How I thought it needed to look. Like be and be successful and it needed to. I needed to be successful in it, in order to gain. I don't know, maybe the world's approval my own approval my parents approval. and And so I think what happens is with this, I mean this is just My guess, but it seems like. emotional reasoning kind of plays such a huge part and I. Am only partly aware of it, and what happens is, I will not want to. I don't want to make a mistake. Because I you know i'm so hard on myself from the past and I perceive myself to be a failure that's like you know, and so, for now, like from now on it's like oh I don't really trust my. I don't really trust my work ethic I don't really trust my instincts I don't really trust my. ability to to handle life. You know, and so that's it's. It kind of puts me I put myself in this position of of kind of disempowering myself and like not really. Choosing. And meanwhile like time moves forward and life continues, and I am like wow Why do I again feel the same way of like i'm not even running the race, you know i'm kind of on the sidelines just. watching and then The longer this race called life is going. I compare myself to everybody else my peers everybody else, and then it's like. it's almost like if if say people are like two laps in and i'm like okay i'm going to get going and then i'm like then they're five laps in like well i'm never going to catch up to them, so why should I start. And that's how I feel sometimes about. career job, providing for myself for family all these. things and I don't ya feel equipped again just a lot of feelings and they're kind of dictating my. I don't know stagnation, I guess."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's let's break down a couple of those because you kind of gave me a lot there, I know how do people learn. let's let's take a simple example. let's take like this one of the most simple examples of how do people learn I think of a child who's learning to walk for the first time. You know the reason and they they have to spend a tremendous amount of time, focusing on every you know the movement of their legs their feet their ankles their knees, the you know, do you know how to grab on to things. And they. They fall down a lot. And they get back up. And then they keep going. They keep trying to keep they keep going there's the thing with the child is there's no judgment of themselves. Most of the time they you know parents, sometimes think Oh, they might be heard, but they're not they just get up they they don't even private just keep going. And so, and they keep trying and then eventually they figure it out. and learning is a lot like that you have to. You have to try. And a lot of times we learn more from our failures or our own successes, if we can get out of our head and not judging ourselves, we can learn from those failures. And also, as long as you're doing things that are safe you're not doing unsafe kind of practices, but you know if you if you try a career and. You know there's a beginning part you're you're not going to get the whole thing from the first day, you have to go through the process of learning it. doing it, and then you might do it for a while and you might discover it's not for you. it's just but to continue to keep going. there's an expression that Thomas Edison. found over I don't remember what the number is, but over thousands of ways, not to discover the light bulb, but he kept going. And when people get stuck in their failures, they stop they you know because we start to think okay I don't believe I can do this, so I stopped was point with us so i'm gonna stop. But it's really only one way to look at it is, if you try something and it doesn't work out it's not a failure, you just figured out this isn't the right way so that gives you information to move on to what is the next idea. And it's all in the way that you frame your mind."
16880.0,Patient,And that's what kind of reframing kind of means like a therapeutic sense.
760.0,Provider,"yeah and and you know the catch though the difficult part of that is that when we have what I like to term habits of thought or thought habits and it's my habit, to be a perfectionist and to judge myself harshly and have these kinds of cognitive distortions it's. kind of automatic i'll just almost like we don't think about breathing and so sometimes when we have these entrenched thought habits, we do them almost as easily as breathing and so when I do that then it's going to affect what I think what I feel. What I choose to do. and So you know, perhaps finding a way to this is just a suggestion so again it's it's your life, Daniel you have to decide. what's going to be your path, but I could suggest working on some mindfulness as the way I did I laid it out and then, when you catch yourself being hard. You take a step back from that I oh I seem to be being hard on myself, and then you can either journal, or you can just make a mental note, or you can think and process that on it more."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's a good idea I. The last couple days i've been very aware of that and I think that. journaling a little bit on it could be helpful to kind of get it out of my mind, not out of my head, but you know."
760.0,Provider,"Processing to start it's. it's it's like the brain is awful lot like a computer you know when a computer gets a virus, you know we have to kind of take off the files that are important that work, and then we have to kind of wipe it clean. And so, if you think of your own thinking in those kinds of terms you know, because you know every thought we have every emotion, we have is electricity like going through our brain. And, and so you kind of have to you know, and the more you think something, the more the the pathways are kind of wired together so. that's a scientific thing it feels kind of like airy and you know kind of almost unreal but it's really there is a science to it, if you think of it in that term. And then, for me, when I think of it that in that term for my own self that helps me to take out the judgment of myself when I think in those ways and then allows me energy to focus on okay affirmations you know the mantra progress not perfection that's a great one. And you know when you catch yourself when you're mindful and when you catch yourself being hard on yourself and being in that perfectionist to kind of frame of mind. Then it allows you to kind of. catch it and then reprogram a little bit. And it's it's really the most important thing you know, is the consistency doing the best you can being mindful being in the moment letting go of judgment doing the best you can. Because we're humans, we, we are not we just you know we make mistakes. All the time and. yeah there is no progress without mistakes. If you think about it. Think about learning math I don't know how math easy math was for you, but for me math was like really hard you know you watch a math problem and. You think you got it and then you make a mistake and then watch it again and you just kind of have to keep repeating until finally something clicks. And oh Now I understand the math concept finally something clicked in my brain and so perhaps thinking in those terms, might be a little bit better for you, because you've learned the opposite."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah and. I think that. Excuse me. In addition to that, I also have about perfection on the perfectionism it's it's almost as if, like. There is an ideal. Out there."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16880.0,Patient,"That I have in mind, but I can't quite define it, and so I guess yeah that's. Something else that I would like to work on which is like. yeah maybe maybe it is just like you said trying my best and. The best that I can do in any given moment, I suppose."
760.0,Provider,I know your spirituality and your your relationship with your own internal higher power is important to you sometimes it can be useful to just put that in the hands of the higher power and just keep going.
16880.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"That requires trust. So. Sometimes we don't have the vision and sometimes my my path could be different, you know, maybe my path earlier in life. is different because you're still you're still a young guy Daniel so you know your path in life may be different now as far as employment, then what it's going to be when you're older. Sometimes those things might change. When we learn to be mindful. I think. When our own negative thinking and judgment get out of the way we see other alternatives or options that you know when we're hard on ourselves when we're judging ourselves constantly we kind of we miss we missed those things. And so. You know in you know, using spirituality which would be a huge tool kind of kind of helps with that because it takes that burden off of you, you don't have to know what that is. You can you can use that in a meditation or prayer or a combination of the two you can use that. and ask for guidance in that, and then practice your mindfulness work on your you know reprogramming the perfectionist and the other cognitive distortions that you have. heal you and heal and I think you'll be amazed. of how you feel. If you can stay focused like that, and what you can get to and you're probably in my own experience I I landed somewhere completely different than I thought so it's. Just being in the moment and doing one thing at a time, and then we also talked in terms of stepping stones, you know. getting a job, having an income is even if you're not like a huge fan of the job as long as the job is safe. Then that's better than no job but it doesn't have to be the end of the story, you just be in the moment and you keep looking for the next, but better thing."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah i've been the last couple days applying to different jobs online. And that certainly feels good to. Like there's some movement, you know. i've been looking at full time jobs and not. Again, I think, going back to wanting to know and not knowing and not knowing which direction to go in, so if something seems interesting all apply for it."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16880.0,Patient,"I think that. Yesterday I was talking about it with my girlfriend and just kind of. Talking it out and saying like well, I think I just I probably would like. Maybe i'll start i'd like a part time job somewhere. Like you said just to have. Not just to have a job, but to have some money coming in and and I think that could take a lot of stress off. yeah I, and I think what yeah what came up was immediately just thinking like well. I need to be able to make enough money to support myself I don't want to be living at home, you know with my mom and I don't know if I want to live in San Diego I know I don't want to live in La so he knows all these suddenly like I need to have it all figured out. And eaten, and then I like that's how. that's the sound kind of sneaks up on me, I think. Okay yeah."
760.0,Provider,"well. there's ways to look at that differently as well. kind of Nice, not to be you know stuck in the idea that you have to be in a certain location, because that there's more up if you're willing to move you're willing to go someplace else, then perhaps you'll get something better somewhere else. That would be one way to look at that. With the part time thing the, the most important thing is, you know. Making sure you need to make sure that you're taking proper care of yourself and that you're healing yourself with your mental health issues, because you don't want mental health issues to get in the way of employment, so if you think that it might be stressful for you in the beginning. Take a part time job, but sometimes it's like I once took a part time. part time temporary job that turned into full time. You know. Because that's just the way that have worked out you just you just don't know and and you know I almost didn't apply to that job, but that job was a great job was a wonderful job I love the job I really, really love the job, and so it wasn't anything that I thought, when I initially applied. So you know. Applying. You know, taking the judgment out of it and just just try something and then, if you find that you know, perhaps apply to full time and part time. And if you take a full time job and you find okay I seem to be struggling with my mental health right now I don't think I can manage this, then you can you can leave and you really haven't lost anything because. You know you've taken a step now you know okay this doesn't work it's really that judgment part you know, look at it, as like information. You know. takes time for the picture you know your careers, a lot like a picture you know, in the very beginning it's kind of hard, because you really don't know what's gonna look like just kind of have to build. and take what works and let the rest of all. That you, you know if you're open to move try, maybe research some places that might be nice to live look, you know look look for cost of living, because Los Angeles San Diego to can be very costly to live."
16880.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Consider consider what's important to you, you know the you know things to do. You know, and just make some job applications. You know there's also. You know you don't have to stay stuck on indeed there's also linkedin there's. zip recruiter. And you know post up your resume see maybe somebody will find you."
16880.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know, so that is just. Taking little just try different things and see what works, and it does feel good to take action, even if the action doesn't go anywhere, even if I apply for this job today, and nobody calls me or you know it still feels good. Because it's the again it's the consistency. You don't have to know where you're going to live, if you do decide to move, though, you might want to like investigate the area, make sure you want to live there check the price of Rentals and crime and weather and things to do, and all that stuff."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah I. Well, we haven't talked about this yet and. that's kind of Part of the reason why I am i'm like find myself back in therapy. Because of making like a very extreme choice to take a job across the country and then turning the job down and."
760.0,Provider,What tell me about man.
16880.0,Patient,"I guess I haven't talked about it because it's sort of like. there's some like religious spiritual aspects of it that probably aren't really. Like. There isn't like. I don't know my assumption is that, like it's not really like a. thing for like therapy. You know, like if I say like attic. Conversion experience like that's not in like. I don't know I don't I just don't want to to like. I know I know you're not you're not doing it i'm my own like hesitation to bring it up is just because of like."
760.0,Provider,"Well, we don't have to talk about the spiritual side of it, but just talk about the part about how you moved across the country and. Then you turned it down, maybe because. Because the job wasn't what you thought it was because."
16880.0,Patient,"Well yeah so I I had like a yeah it's a spiritual experience and in. Like the beginning of July, at the end of June, beginning of July last year and. wanted to find something where I could work within. Within the church or an organization something in like with new media, something that uses my background at film production and I applied to a bunch of different places and I found. This one job posting for the diocese of savannah Georgia and they posted you know. Video photo writing and kind of like it just seemed like an all inclusive, not all inclusive, but many things that I enjoy and and I feel like I could do the job well and it spoke to me and and. I guess. A lot of my decision making, was again based in like the feeling, or the intuition, rather I guess of it, looking back on it. You know they flew me out and I met people I met the. You know everyone is really nice and the city was beautiful they toured me around. Historic savannah it's very gorgeous and you know it's way different than southern California."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16880.0,Patient,"And so, so I thought you know what this is actually could be a really good move the cost of living is cheap. My family was supportive my girlfriend was not a fan, and that was a really big. That was really big point. Of like coming back as well, because she was. It was kind of like tearing us apart right and. hard for her hard for me, I was. confident that, like, if I could go over there, and maybe. get an apartment or home or something and make it Nice and maybe she would want to come out and check it out and maybe she would like it, because she had talked about not wanting to live in. Los Angeles, either, and so. She didn't want to live in savannah Georgia and so. So I. decided to take the leap, and I was really excited and full of. Energy and momentum and was just like this is a big yes, you know, I was just every like to do it and so. You know, got rid of most of my stuff I got rid of my apartment so I packed up my car with the remaining belongings, and my dad and I drove we had a cross country road trip drove to savannah had a good bonding experience. and Once I got there, suddenly, like all of the. positive things that I was feeling and the kind of sense of ease of finding the job like suddenly everything like turned upside down, it was sort of felt like. Like instead of being toured around the nicest historic parts of savannah I was looking at like what I probably could actually afford based on the salary that they're going to give me. i'm like oh this actually is like a. Very. Not as safe, you know kind of crime ridden and I started thinking about people visiting and being like nervous about that. It. Suddenly the southern hospitality wasn't quite. What it was when I first visited you know I suddenly was like oh man, people are really so nice, I mean they're just kind of it's just way different and. And then. I. wasn't able to find an apartment I felt like I was spent I spent days calling just about every apartment place in savannah felt like and. They had everyone I talked to is like it's real estate super hot right now to find it departments really hard. houses are going fast and so. Did like a just put in like an offer on a house, because it was 140 $4,000 Mike well, I mean even given on the salary that i'm. going to be paid like that's going to be less than like an apartment and then a crappy apartment that i'm looking at over here and so. It seemed like through this miraculous turn of events I ended up getting the bid got the House. which was super stressful I didn't know how stressful buying a house could be."
760.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
16880.0,Patient,"It was like, but it was like you know within, not even a week of being there, it was like about to start a new job buying a home figure learning as i'm going my dad's helping me out he's been really supportive but. I think he's also. just wanted to help in any way possible, so if I once I started to kind of feel all of these negative effects of stress and missing a girlfriend my family. And I use just wanting to help solve those things, and so. So what happened was I get to the diocese and like there's no. there's really no. onboarding you know, like they they mentioned that too, they were like yeah it's just kind of like you just start controlling things and kind of realized like how disorganized it was you know and essentially and I talked to my sister about and she was like yes sort of like. would be essentially working for like a nonprofit in some ways, where like I may have been expecting. You know this."
760.0,Provider,Is a certain level of there's a certain level of perfectionism in Los Angeles. That probably does not translate to other parts of the country.
16880.0,Patient,"Oh. For sure yeah and I was just. I just couldn't believe how disorganized it was and how like. learned that they had had multiple people in this position. Even within the last like couple years, and so what I was perceiving was like. In this meeting, the communications department, I would have been doing, like video mostly but then also kind of pseudo reporter story writer. And suddenly it felt kind of like what they had promised over the phone and like initially was like oh yeah you'll like have autonomy to come up kind of come up with whatever you want to come up with. And you know, create things and then suddenly when I was there, like the first day Eve, and like one of the guys it's the guy that's in charge of it editing he was. Almost felt like a new Toy to him in some ways, where he was just like oh we're going to do this, video and that video and that video and and suddenly like by the first day there was like. Multiple people were coming up to me yeah we're going to do this, video like so there's like four in the queue and. i'm like. Trying to pick up the pieces of they're disorganized. equipment like there was like missing equipment they didn't even have a microphone kind of like you know you need like a camera or microphone and a computer essentially to like edit like they didn't have a microphone the computer like. The first day or second day it was like so disorganized and and the speakers didn't work so like I couldn't. even hear. If I had recorded sound like that there was just so much there right, and I think that there was probably my perception of how it was going to be versus how actually was. And that was a big thing right my being black blinded but like being really like ah, an opportunity like a job that actually wants me, you know, in a job that actually I have feel like I can do. But that first couple days there, I was so fragile, I mean I was, I was crying multiple times throughout the day because of being homesick because of some imposter syndrome, I suppose, but also because of like what did I do did I just like blow up my entire life for this job that now. I don't you know I feeling it's seeing it in a different way than I had before, and really maybe not making the best decision based purely on like emotion or. intuition, rather than using some like logic and reasoning and like you said, like take a look at the not only the cost of living, but also the crime and also this and that and. and"
760.0,Provider,"So. So, so when was this when did you have this experience that you took this job what year."
16880.0,Patient,"This was last year, this was a September."
760.0,Provider,September of 21.
16880.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,Oh really recent then okay. So so did that affect you did this whole experience to have can you talk to me about. The how that affected your mental health. and your emotions oh.
16880.0,Patient,"Oh yeah, it is a huge reason of why i'm like here, you know, like talking to you because I. You know I started questioning everything questioning. Why did I do this was this right thing is this did I lose my mind and. And then, also on top of that, like. I was just scared that I was just going to. Be in savannah and then like never come back. And I was just nervous, I was scared I was nervous I. Had a couple of like one or two like panic attacks, when I was there and I haven't it's not like a normal thing for me. um and I just."
760.0,Provider,After. They were there without your support system. If. My friend.
16880.0,Patient,"Right yeah I mean my dad was there, but then I like knew that he was going to be going, you know and and I was just super scared and. and yeah after I had a. Panic attack and I was like trying to figure it out and and I just. And again, it was based on feelings, it was like okay Well, this is causing me this emotion this negative emotion, this new job this new place so if I removed myself from it with that solve the issue and, in my mind at that time, it seemed like the best option. and Some of their day I came in talk to that talk to the HR and was like you know I don't this not kind of what I was expecting and. The city wasn't what I was expecting this whole move try buy a home everything was just like way, I felt way over my head suddenly and and they were really understanding, you know they were really kind and gracious about and. actually helped out with getting out of the housing contract. You know, they were willing to you know write a letter that said it just. The job didn't work out and. which was very nice and so, so I got out of the hat. got the earnest money back. driving back you know and then packed up and drove back across the United States that was like I was gone for like two weeks, and then came back, and so I mean so that was like the first thing which was. so embarrassed so ashamed, I had. You know. felt like the boy who cried wolf you know, I was, like all right i'll see you guys come visit me in savannah and then like two weeks later, I send this Max texts and being like i'm coming back actually. And I just was and so coming back, I thought you know what okay i'm gonna be. i'm gonna take life by the horns i'm going to find a new job i'm gonna like you know. change it all up and it's gonna be great my relationship with my girlfriend is going to be great. And then I came back, and it was like. And then suddenly everything back here seemed like like Why did I come back my girlfriend and I started arguing all the time. You know. My own motivation just completely dropped my. embarrassment to be with to like even hang out with my friends like prevented me from seeing anybody I prevent myself from seeing anybody and that's still kind of current i'm like I don't like talking about myself right now, because I don't know what to talk about and. So all of this sort of. search for like well like what. What was that Why did I move and so suddenly then since coming back it was like well. Then I kind of saw it from the other side, where I thought well. gosh you know what I I should have talked to somebody I should have talked to them about it about like the expectations about the. hierarchy of like you know people just kind of ordering me around to do something and then i'm like I don't even have the basic equipment, you know it's."
760.0,Provider,Getting can I stop you for a minute right there.
16880.0,Patient,"Yes, please."
760.0,Provider,"If we go back to what we were talking about in the beginning of the session we were talking about you, having information. Sometimes I think probably most of the time you know we can read about a job posting we can think we know what the job is, but we do really don't know the job until we actually start it. And so, if we go back to that concept of if I try something and it doesn't work out. that's information. that's information that you can learn and instead of using that to be you know hyper critical of yourself that that you know couple of things i'm assuming Daniel that you've lived most of your life in southern California. or all of your life, maybe."
16880.0,Patient,"Most yeah and I I live in Chicago or not, nine months a couple years ago."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, not nine months because I know that in the United States, you know, there you know when I moved to southern California from the Midwest I experienced kind of like a culture shock a little bit. And so i'm assuming from you know San Diego and Los Angeles going to savannah Georgia, you might have had some of that going on as well. Oh yeah. Because the South is completely different so there's that. But you're you know you've you've learned something about how to question. You know, you know if we apply the concept of mindfulness the next time you get a job offer you have more idea of what are some questions that you can ask. about the job and and maybe you don't want to go all the way from San Diego to Georgia, maybe, but maybe you know going a little bit someplace a little bit closer maybe some place else in California, or you know someplace that's not quite so far, and then you know. drive the neighborhood one way I if I don't know, an area, one thing I tried to do is i'll i'll go to that area on like Saturday night in the evening, because if you want to see crime that's when you're going to see it. You know so there's so it's it's about the information and it's our judgment about the information that kind of gets in the way. Is you know they kind of seems like they weren't seems like that job. Probably. You know. Was withholding things about the job. When they were trying to get you to accept it and you had no way of knowing that until you got there. Unless you were going to ask the question you me and that's a good question to ask me about my equipment that i'm going to have access to those kinds of questions."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely agree, and you know, I think that. My own idea like idealising it. I just didn't know how disorganized they were you know they showed me everything that showed me the studio that they had that was a. complete mess, but when I saw it initially I thought I can fix this place, I can you know clean it up and then as soon as I got there oh Oh, this is so much more than like me just try to clean this. clean up a physical location of the studio but yeah I think it was probably some. Getting this job offer them flying me out then being very kind, and you know wanting and wanting me to and being to be i've never had a job. i've had restaurant jobs for the most of my life, you know, and also with working in the industry it's like you're like a day player so he's like no one really. Treating you like."
760.0,Provider,"Great you know. that's really disappointing Daniel. You know, I think. You know. it's not surprising that you know of course you wanted something better, you wanted something in your field, and you love the concept of it having like spiritual spiritual side of it. So. You know, so how can you be gentle or thinking about about that you, you tried something and it didn't work out it wasn't what you thought."
16880.0,Patient,"I guess I just I wanted. I guess, I just want so badly something to work out, you know."
760.0,Provider,Is that you think that you're more gun shy now as far as applying for something and it's accepting something now that you had this experience in Georgia.
16880.0,Patient,So.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So do you think it feels less overwhelming to get to maybe go after some type of a part time job does that feel a bit less overwhelming for you, for now. As you're working on your mental health."
16880.0,Patient,yeah I think that kind of sounds a. Not as not as daunting.
760.0,Provider,Alright So how do you feel After talking about that. feel a little triggered.
16880.0,Patient,"yeah I think. There still. seems like there's still some. I don't know why i'm really beating myself up about it but. yeah I guess still feeling. Not over it, I guess yeah."
760.0,Provider,"What would you say to a friend that had a similar experience. Somebody that you cared about. As a close friend, what would you say to that friend. If they tried a job and didn't fully understand what it was got excited about it. had all these negative experiences once they got here what what would How would you talk to him about it or her."
16880.0,Patient,"yeah probably say. You know, sometimes you don't know. You can't know something until you try it or experience it. and You know you don't need to be embarrassed. By going for it because. If you didn't he probably would have always wondered. If that was like you know perfect job for you or it perfect job, but you know a good opportunity and. And what if."
760.0,Provider,He.
16880.0,Patient,probably did.
760.0,Provider,Go ahead.
16880.0,Patient,Sorry.
760.0,Provider,I was gonna say yeah and just encouraging to.
16880.0,Patient,"You know, keep keep going forward I guess."
760.0,Provider,On one level Daniel another way to view this whole experience is what you did was like really brave. You saw an opportunity that you thought was excellent. And you took a big risk this break. It was also brave to come back when you realize you made that it was not what you thought. You can't take that one and. You. Know tell me the truth.
16880.0,Patient,"I want to. I want to. believe that it's this as soon as I hear it, I the negative voices character come in about. Not vegan voices, but just negative perception of. Myself fits and kind of come in, you know."
760.0,Provider,"And negative voices that could be okay. How can you apply mindfulness and how can you correct that. If we if we think of that that mantra that was suggested to you and grew up the other day of progress not perfection taking a chance on a career opportunity. Is as all the things that you said you never would have known if you hadn't taken it, he would have always been in regret. Because you wouldn't you would have had the picture in your head that you had before going out there would still be here with you today. Just for the chance of taking a chance on something is progress. Because we learn information through our errors or I really don't even know if I would call that a mistake. But when we when we take action, like that we learn things. And so now you've learned additional questions that should be asked additional steps that should take in Should you decide you're planning i'm going to take this job in another area. You know, because you've already expressed to me you don't you're not sure you want to be in San Diego. So that kind of requires you moving somewhere."
16880.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"So you, what is the information that you've that you've gained."
16880.0,Patient,"So be how to be more thorough in. asking about questions about a job. Especially if it's a job that I. have experienced in. That I can. Ask about you know code man, I can ask about project timelines and you know who i'm. in contact with or who i'm. yeah taking orders from so speak. I can also probably asked to. explore the area, a little bit more, you know, initially, I think it was out there for like a day and a half and I didn't have a car. And they were nice to drive me around, but I was. You know if i'd like driven around just outside of the kind of beautiful historic downtown area what it kind of seemed like Oh, this is, you know another most of savannah is."
760.0,Provider,"yeah well, they were they were still in process of trying to sell you on this job so. Right so they're not going to take you to those horrible areas are those bad areas they keep you in the pretty part."
16880.0,Patient,"Right and they did mention you know about like that it's. it's not like we're not good enough to mention the crime but it's like you know it's got a lot of kind of bad areas, so to speak, but. yeah, I think, looking at the area crime reports cost of living. And then also like close to family that's important to me as well and."
760.0,Provider,"So so there's there's information. yeah because when you move someplace new you don't know anybody, so that you know you it's also a discussion that you know, maybe you might want to think about having with your girlfriend and you kind of you know, instead of you know. understanding that, even though a job may look to be perfect, maybe it's not really so let me like talk this through, and not work myself up to the same degree would be another thing that you could learn."
16880.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,We have I have about a minute before my next appointment Daniel. Can we schedule the next appointment.
16880.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, I hope. that's going to be. February. February Wednesday February, the second. yeah I have, I have 10 in the morning, again, if you like, that time slot."
16880.0,Patient,Oh yeah that's fine for me.
760.0,Provider,"And, can you confirm your date of birth, Daniel."
16880.0,Patient,yeah January 10 1987 OK.
760.0,Provider,"OK, so I have Wednesday February 2 at 10am."
16880.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so you're going to continue to work with your cognitive distortions and journaling. Do you are you on board, to start with working kind of incorporating in these concepts of mindfulness."
16880.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'll. Work on that building the present moment awareness.
760.0,Provider,yeah and the judgment part because that'll that'll help you with the distortions.
16880.0,Patient,gotcha.
760.0,Provider,Do you want to do meditation or do you want to do like more mindful activity or perhaps both what is your goal with that.
16880.0,Patient,i'm. Mindful activity and probably a. type of meditation that. meditation prayer combo maybe.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. And you want to do, how often you want to do that."
16880.0,Patient,"um I guess. The activity, probably at least a couple times a day to be aware of what i'm doing and. The fermentation probably i'd like to do at least once a day that'll be nice."
760.0,Provider,"All right, okay that sounds good. So that's a good plan. It seems like you're off to a good start you've been we've been looking at your cognitive distortion so you're working on that."
16880.0,Patient,yeah Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"And thank you, I know it was hard for you to share, about that experience but i'm glad you did because it kind of helps to seems like it's kind of a foundational part of where you're at right now."
16880.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
760.0,Provider,Thank you for sharing that Daniel and that was difficult.
16880.0,Patient,yeah Thank you. yeah I know you have another clients I don't want to keep you.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. I do have a few minutes but don't see them in you just see. I think I have a few minutes if you want to just there something else that I can help you with."
16880.0,Patient,"I can think of, at the moment."
760.0,Provider,"takes take some deep breaths Daniel you seem seem to be like. Your emotions are kind of seem a little. Perhaps negative right now, because of what we just talked about deep breathing maybe it might be useful if you have time to go do a meditation right now calm yourself down think about mindfulness maybe the prayer part."
16880.0,Patient,yeah that was kept my. feeling my chest is really tight. yeah that sounds good.
760.0,Provider,"Thank you breath. You do a meditation or you could just go journal which one, do you think would be more useful for you right now."
16880.0,Patient,"i'm probably some. Some meditation would be. Okay, good yeah. Just to relax a little and. and breathe a little bit."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay. Again, the remember the curious mind I seem to be feeling anxious seem to be judging myself right now seemed hard on myself right now try to take a deep breath in the moment. Not thinking about the past worrying about the future being in the moment. and try your mindfulness practice practice. Okay."
16880.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
760.0,Provider,"Alright, see you in a couple weeks."
16880.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. All right, bye bye."
