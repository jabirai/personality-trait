16926.0,Patient,Other week another hotel room. Back in Chicago this week.
148.0,Provider,yeah you're in a hotel right now yeah but different background than. Back in Chicago for what do you for business.
16926.0,Patient,"Right after business yeah and I had my brother and his wife and. My nephew's also live here, so I flew in Friday night. At the weekend, with them. Nice yeah."
148.0,Provider,Good you seem like you have. Like to you today.
16926.0,Patient,Just lighting in the room me.
148.0,Provider,know the energy to you seem a little bit I didn't know how can I say happy.
16926.0,Patient,i'm glad that's good.
148.0,Provider,"you're smiling yeah it's good to see. All right, um how are you feeling in recovery what's been going on."
16926.0,Patient,"Not a whole lot I mean every day is kind of the same, I guess, in a way it's not you know no cravings no issues, no. it's you know it is what it is, I made a decision and that's what it is."
148.0,Provider,No cravings and all great.
16926.0,Patient,You know if there's a fully stocked minibar in my hotel room it. means nothing to me.
148.0,Provider,wow that's tough and you're. Not having each not challenging for you no temptation nothing okay.
16926.0,Patient,"I mean I you know I go to dinner, and I, you know just from a career of being around food and wine it's like I it crosses my mind of like oh this dish would go good with this wine. But it's not it's not I need to have that wine to enjoy myself."
148.0,Provider,yeah. So you feel like you've made some progress and in your sobriety here.
16926.0,Patient,"I think so, you know not drinking was never an issue, it was stopping drinking when I started."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16926.0,Patient,And even then that wasn't an always issue you never knew when it was going to kind of appear. So you know the if you'd ever start you don't have to stop so I guess that's my philosophy on the whole thing at this point okay yeah but it's it's it's going well.
148.0,Provider,um Have you had any contact with your girlfriend right she's girlfriend.
16926.0,Patient,yeah i'm not still just text messaging and I think more than that. You know where I don't know what her plans are for the holidays i'm assuming she's going to go be with family. Which we're supposed to be doing together but we're not.
148.0,Provider,"Know um. I guess just the work that you're doing, and you know in this program does she know how hard you're working to be silver."
16926.0,Patient,"um she knows that i've told her it's been something i've been doing, I don't know if she understands where the with the program fully entails or cares at this point. there's still some healing there that there, there is healing there that's still happening and. You know I don't think it's I don't think it matters that much to her at this very moment mm hmm okay."
148.0,Provider,"What are the next steps for you like, what would the next steps look like, for you in this, because I know that this is. not the only reason but it's a big reason why you want to be sober right is to to fix this relationship and to heal this relationship."
16926.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know I mean she better at you know part of me thinks. that she doesn't want to be in California, so I don't know if that's part of the conversation. of just kind of starting over somewhere else. it's you know she's still not in a place where she wants to have an actual conversation on the phone and. I don't really know where to take it next I think it's just kind of a waiting game or not a time thing at this point."
148.0,Provider,In time thing for you to regain her trust.
16926.0,Patient,"I don't really know how I could do that if we're not communicating or entertaining having conversations and. You know, when I leave California, maybe I mean i've got a great job and. that's it that's all I have is a job, I have had lots of jobs, all over the world, I know, so I could do it again, but. it's I don't know what I don't know what decision i'm going to be given to make or what's out there."
148.0,Provider,"Right right. But this this relationship is more important. than anything else, is what I hear. yeah okay okay so just knowing that is huge right, knowing that you're willing. To do what it takes to. To gain the trust back and to make this work."
16926.0,Patient,If it doesn't it doesn't. know until the next adventure mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,"Alright, so except you have some acceptance either way."
16926.0,Patient,really have a choice.
148.0,Provider,"well. You have a choice to do what you can do right and you're making the choice that. is going to lead to healing right whether she wants to do with you or not, that you're making a really positive choice for your life, right now, and all your relationships. And that's all you can do. yeah. Good um. Okay. yeah just one day at a time. One day, at a time, with everything right now um was there anything specific that you wanted to talk about today anything coming up for you."
16926.0,Patient,"Nothing off the top of my mind, though I did my homework I watched the video that you about rats and Portugal and heroin. That was interesting."
148.0,Provider,What did you think.
16926.0,Patient,"I thought it was interesting study I mean I don't know, I think it was more. You know, focused on like the street drug side of things and addiction, but I think it was still interesting from like an intellectual perspective of the the overall study on how those type things are handled across the world, and how the science shows it's different."
148.0,Provider,Right yeah is there anything that really stuck out to you.
16926.0,Patient,"know you know I think it's interesting under the kind of the idea that you know, the way that Portugal like decriminalize drugs and all of that, and you know I would I thought about that from my living in today, are you driving through you know I live in oakland and. drive it driving through the tent cities, and you know people strung out on drugs and all that. I mean it's, I think, where I wouldn't say we've decriminalized it but it's not like we're enforcing anything in the US or just kind of ignoring it. that's not really solving anything so we surely haven't figured it out yet. You know portugal's the size of. indiana so it's not really a I don't know if we could do something like that. Right yeah."
148.0,Provider,So that piece stuck out to you.
16926.0,Patient,I think just from from the I thought was interesting.
148.0,Provider,"Good okay good um. Anything else that you want to be working on right now, like any goals any anything coming up for you."
16926.0,Patient,"um you know I had an appointment with Dr hector on Friday. And you know we talked a little bit about you know just you know more. Focusing on physical health as well. I can definitely get stuck in the. You know, hotel to the airport to you know eating quick food that's probably not the best for you and not focusing on. You know, getting out and being more active when I when I can, and you know I gave me an example of my my air my hotel in my office is less than a mile from each other and. there's no reason for me to ever call an uber to do that, you know but there's definitely been late nights that I sat there and. took twice as long as the drive, is it would have been to walk it just because one way streets and whatnot. But I think it's important to focus on that, I mean I shouldn't be on blood pressure medication at 32. So anything I can do to kind of improve that area, as well as. I think I feel like it's important to do and."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so incorporating more exercise and physical activity into your self care routine. done okay that sounds like more walking for you, choosing to."
16926.0,Patient,"You that's yeah I mean that's the that's the easiest kind of. way that I can you know still run life in a day to day, as it is and. You know it's a small change and a small decision, I think I could make to. add some extra steps and a little more Cardio to the day and. manageable mm hmm."
148.0,Provider,what's gonna hold you accountable and doing that.
16926.0,Patient,"I guess me was you know holding myself accountable is the only only option, I have, and you know let's give you one of those things that. You know it'll be easy to not do, but it's just it's just as easy to do."
148.0,Provider,Okay i'm.
16926.0,Patient,"In the same way as you know, it's I kind of look at it the same way as you know. Not drinking anymore, I said I was going to do something so i'm going to do it."
148.0,Provider,And you're doing it yeah so.
16926.0,Patient,that's kind of I don't know I look at a lot of things that kind of. way if i'm going to do something i'm going to do it. there's really nobody that's going to get my way.
148.0,Provider,"yeah you have a really strong mindset, when you say you're gonna do something you absolutely do it and you stay committed to that yeah. Pretty powerful so like you said it's not always easy. and motivation fluctuates right. The motivation may not always be there, but what you can turn to is your commitment and dedication that can be there. Even if you want to do it or not right. you're not always feel like doing it, but your commitment dedication, is what shines through and you. yeah good okay that sounds like a good goal so just more exercise more walking. Are you doing any any are you still writing. journey."
16926.0,Patient,"it's been a couple weeks. I guess the writer's block maybe not sure what to write to write about. So I think the the letter to alcohol is the last thing, but I. Fully rolled out those you know with any thought or. yeah that was less than."
148.0,Provider,"um. Well, one thing that you could write about if you feel like you're writing and you're not sure what to write about you could reflect reflect you know where you were your go to where you are today and just reflect on the progress that you're making and that you continue to make. That could be a good one for you. You could write a letter to your significant other there's things that you're feeling that you'd like to get out and your she's just not maybe ready to hear um yeah as a way for you to release some of the things some of these emotions that you're having. holding on to right now."
16926.0,Patient,"I was doing that the like kind of the immediate few weeks after she left, I was, I was writing into like a Google drive and. I gave her access to it, so you can read it, if you want you don't have to. And I know she was reading it a little bit in a while, and I think it just became too much for me to read it, and she even said in a certain points, just like I you know i'm going to not continue to kind of look in there and I think at that point, I just stopped writing in there. You know, it was just 20 or 30 pages of writing over a couple weeks."
148.0,Provider,"yeah it could still be important for you to do for your own healing to not necessarily doing it for her to read, but just doing it as an outlet for you. If you feel like it if you feel like that could be helpful. Okay, good good i'm. super solid in your sobriety right now, and you know feel like you're going through the motions. I really don't I don't have concerns for you right now I don't know other questions are really coming up for me glad you got to have some good family time this weekend."
16926.0,Patient,"That was nice it was we didn't really do anything but just kind of hung out at their house and it was nice I know weekend for being home, I myself I just kind of. Set the couch so. I didn't really do anything I didn't want to do anything. yeah it was nice to have something to do people to hang out with."
148.0,Provider,Good good and what are your plans for Christmas.
16926.0,Patient,"i'm going to. I was going to be in the carolinas with her, but now i'm going to fly into Cleveland. or I grew up directly from Chicago. And my family will be there. Nothing my sister still lives there, but my siblings and my parents will do Christmas morning in my sister's house and then. drive out to Pennsylvania for Christmas dinner at grandma's house. hmm and then I think was a family kind of Christmas party on Sunday. And then yeah back to Chicago actually for work again next week."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16926.0,Patient,And then i'll probably get back to the bay area sometime around third. Which yeah.
148.0,Provider,So what's the travel right now let's have. Some good family time coming up for you or how do you feel about that is that something that you're looking forward to.
16926.0,Patient,You know. I don't like looking forward to like answering the question of why i'm alone. You know cuz. last six years they don't they're not used to just seeing me. Some of them already know. that's gonna suck.
148.0,Provider,"How, how can you prepare for that, for being asked that question."
16926.0,Patient,"I think you know I don't i'm not gonna get probably in do it with anybody or really go into details, but if that's where she's i'll just say sort of family. leave it at that. same thing you know same thing I told my nephews. Now they're they're young they don't need to. know everything. They realize life gets weird soon enough."
148.0,Provider,"yeah exactly okay so yeah just setting strong boundaries around that you know you don't have to give an explanation to don't feel like you need to, and if the question comes up just. This is what I said in that class right. Good okay okay that sounds good okay Andrew um. Anything else coming up for you today."
16926.0,Patient,that's been work is busy it's good distraction.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16926.0,Patient,let's yeah let's. Go but it's all I got really focusing on that right now.
148.0,Provider,"i'm won't bring in more than that self care to focus on to so work and self care and just your your healing right now. Good and. you're still pretty quiet in group that's okay i'm glad that you, you know I see you every week and you're showing up and I just wanted you to know that i'm acknowledge that, and thank you for showing up for yourself but. Are there any topics that you would like to see discussed."
16926.0,Patient,"um I guess just not because I don't you know I have never gone through a program or process or any kind of recovery before, so I don't really I don't really know what to expect I think a lot of it's a lot of listening and learning and. You know there's parts of it that just there's a lack of ability to relate. So I figure it's better just gonna. Listen and said I don't want to. start a debate, you know."
148.0,Provider,"Right right yeah and if it doesn't apply just let it fly it's nothing they have to hold on to or. You know, let bother you because yeah absolutely it's a big group and it's common one is especially in bigger groups that you know you're never going to be one any group you're never going to be exactly where the next person is right."
16926.0,Patient,"that's the I think it's I definitely see people you know it seems like some people really, really benefit from it and then need it so it's kind of it's cool to watch and. See how you know people have their struggles, I mean a lot of times I kind of. walked out of there and. be like I don't have it that bad boy. that's a good thing, but. You know I guess it gives some perspective."
148.0,Provider,yeah absolutely absolutely good yeah.
16926.0,Patient,"So yeah i'll continue to be there, I do actually I mentioned, Dr packer on Friday to me tell you, I do have a potential flight out that might get in the way tomorrow, but I will be back the following week."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay.
16926.0,Patient,And it's I might move the flight it just depends I gotta I gotta fly into New York. Just for the day on Wednesday and in Chicago.
148.0,Provider,yeah no worries no worries at all.
16926.0,Patient,"If I can be there, I will."
148.0,Provider,"Okay um and if you know you can't I would just let virtual clinic no. So it doesn't count as a no show. Because I don't want to tell them now well Okay, no nevermind if you don't if I don't see you tomorrow night i'll just let them know to can to make sure it's cancelled, not as a no show you let me know early they might not be able to yeah we'll do it that way."
