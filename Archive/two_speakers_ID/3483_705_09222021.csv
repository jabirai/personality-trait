705.0,Provider,"Well, thank you for asking, and more importantly let's catch up and hear what's going on with you."
3483.0,Patient,"well. You know I still have the. course my transportation issue. We still don't have a vehicle and we live on a ranch you know I think I told you that, of course, my tennis shoe i'm so sorry should be more organized as well. Valerie is is kind of really feeling like it's. fitting into place. But I think that I let you know that my friend, is also a patient with Dr Lund. So we're just really enjoying the benefits of. The telemedicine and suboxone and. Just happy to be with you yeah."
705.0,Provider,So therapeutic levels on your medication is sounds like.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah, I think, so I think so, the only thing that I am thinking that I don't like about it, is it makes me still hungry and i'm getting fat. Well, for me, I think I am now."
705.0,Provider,"that's when I was asked, is it. Is it something that you feel like you can. balance out with with. Healthy weight than that you can appreciate."
3483.0,Patient,"Oh yeah oh yeah absolutely I never had a problem with my weight anyway, so a little weight is not that big of a deal it's just. For me it's like well you know I used to wear like you know my tank tops and my whatever parents and now I have this big you know muffin top or whatever you want to call it. I don't mind, and you know my husband certainly is is so wonderful and no he's just it doesn't matter you know everything's good so. You know we're doing what we can and I guess it's a good thing that we're eating a lot and i'm cooking a lot because that's one thing that i'd love to do so."
705.0,Provider,"Read and a lot of times to, as you probably already know natalie is that you know when you're using substance that depletes the body of vitamins and nutrients, so your body is like making up going hey."
3483.0,Patient,We might go.
705.0,Provider,we're going to put we're going to store some extra healthy weight.
3483.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh yes it's totally doing that you know I really didn't think about that. You know, but it's been, of course, so many years that you know back and forth, and all that. You know the suboxone I don't know if it's a suboxone or if it's just me that likes to sleep a lot, because I don't feel really that depressed or anything I feel pretty good but. You know, over the course of time, maybe you know missing out on a lot of sleep I don't really know but. I like to sleep a lot, but not overly sleep, you know what i'm saying it just I like to lay down and rest and it feels good to have a good night sleep, you know."
705.0,Provider,"All that too is probably been like you said, the the yo yo effect where it was interrupted, and then you try to get a daily habit going interrupted. He is like hey we're going to take a rest and we're going to eat the food that we need and store some extra. And to prepare ourselves."
3483.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely and I think my husband is going to hear that as well. You know, but he's he's thinner guy and he looks great I just love that he's putting so a weight on, and you know it makes me happy that you know I could make some good meals and it actually shows on him."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly. And I know, sometimes when you first start gaining the weight and you're like okay number one you're healthy and you're not using substances and then it's like. All the other stuff it's like, if you like, could you maybe do some exercise Well, yes, if you like, right now, that self care, though, when you're tired you're sleeping is like kind of first things first."
3483.0,Patient,yeah absolutely um you know we do a lot of actually we don't have our vehicle running. We have some bicycles. And it is. let's say approximately about three miles down to our nearest little town I don't know if you've heard of San Juan Bautista. No that's okay. it's the word like the California missions.
705.0,Provider,are okay.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah so it's a very beautiful historic town and we love it we just love it and we have a lot of history here my family does anyways but. You know just having to either walk or take your bikes my gosh we get a lot of exercise, and I feel like i'm dying, by the time I get up this Hill, you know and but that's Okay, I feel good about it, we both do."
705.0,Provider,Well that's that sounds really healthy right there and as you're saying that natalie and you're talking about three miles and appeal i'm thinking put that correlation of law you're so tired or bobby's like.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah okay well, that would make sense to of course yeah."
705.0,Provider,we've.
3483.0,Patient,"we've been really both. we're both you know physically active, we like to do things and. You just be outdoors you know whether it just be outside of our home, which is what we're doing now, you know and for it was because of necessity, but nonetheless it's good."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. Often, you know, in the in the course of time, as far as any support groups such as you know, attending any of the anonymous groups outsider bright heart health."
3483.0,Patient,"um I have not, I guess, I can look into that another aspect of. problem with. Not only transportation with communication our phones, we have the free phones. And I am just excited as heck to be able to get online with you guys and with my husband as well, because we. can't even dial out these phones are so terrible so online stuff I try to set aside just for bright heart health only because, if I don't have that or we don't have that then we're really in a not a good situation you know, we want to be able to keep that line open so. We know."
705.0,Provider,"We don't have any we don't have a good wireless carrier, let me put it that way. Okay yeah and that's where it's. Like Okay, is there alternatives than to in person, because I know that's limited to right now with some of the local places either never before had the in person or they're not."
3483.0,Patient,"yeah and again it's the transportation issue you know um. It is it takes it takes about 15 minutes to get down the hill to town which doesn't have anything but a little you know market which we're thankful for in a beautiful mission Church, which we love to go to but coming back up the hill is a whole different situation we have. bikes that we got from one was my mom's old bike and the other one was from the goodwill, which is about half the size that it needs to be for us so we're just doing what we can so it's hard to get anywhere and in person meeting would not be. Really kind of we can do right now, let me just say that. Right now."
705.0,Provider,"it's just like I like how you said that natalie though we're doing the best we can, with what what's the situation basically and it's just. What what back and be like you know what. Important that you are able to sign on today, and so that's absolutely a win. And you've been able to 10 years."
3483.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah so we're we're thankful, and just keep going, you know just really thankful for a bright heart health and you and you know, Dr groves and Dr London with john reinhart. yeah so."
705.0,Provider,"How often with um you know, are you having to deal with any cravings or anything's coming up for you."
3483.0,Patient,"And you know what. We have well I say we, you know it's kind of like we're very, very close, you know, and we have been for years, because you know we were homeless and this and that and we just have grown with our relationship with the Lord and and all that so we're pretty honest about it so. You know cravings it happens, it does I can't say that it doesn't but. The medication, really, really does help it really takes takes that off our minds and. You know we're just getting into a different routine. We really are you know we're getting up and having coffee and watering or flowers and doing whatever we need to do for that day that we can do. And sometimes it's not a big thing to do, but you know cleaning our House just you know we're we're very proactive about that, but yeah it just it's good there's not to be honest there's really not a lot of cravings because. You know, we we just don't want to be there anymore, of course, just you know we're done."
705.0,Provider,"And that's where you know already natalie as you're sharing, like some of those things that make it that if a craving does arise that you're able to distract are able to you know develop this routine this healthy routine. That and doing that so you're ahead of it."
3483.0,Patient,"yeah definitely and my husband so good about it, you know if we even talk a little about anything we're like we're like let's you know let's take a walk or. You know, whatever the case, maybe it's. You know when i'm here i'm going to walk again okay yeah so yeah just one of those things. That that were fortunately we have another person to depend on you know to. You know, it just it feels good to know that we're on the same page and we're going forward. yeah just eating a lot of."
705.0,Provider,"Right now it's just like you know with recovery sometimes. there's there's some of it that's a challenging at first, but it's learning like you're already doing it's just how do we keep what we've earned and how do we keep you know the healthiness balance and especially. yeah. To be. You know, actively using together and then you were able to create recovery, together with with each other that's that's powerful stuff."
3483.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I don't even realize how good it is until I am I go to a group and whatnot and here, let me go inside to talk about this. You know, like going to group and and hearing about. A couples that have an issue because one is still doing it, and the other isn't and I can't, not even in that with with my husband because either we're together and we're doing it right or we're doing it wrong, you know, and we have been on and off, but for a long time. it's just been you know, whatever we say we're good together, you know we've always been like that and. Just it's good to have that extra. person in your life that that calls you out on stuff even if you get nail they might be, you know thinking about other things I still call you out on that. And then you come together and you decide, you know it's not worth it, and it's a good thing, just take a walk one of the plants, whatever whatever you know call somebody. The work, so it does it works. And I really feel for people that don't have anybody that. Then itself must be you know cuz i've been there too. And it's hard it's a it's a long road, when you're by yourself."
705.0,Provider,So.
3483.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's really to each day to just be able to appreciate how far you have come and that you know it's like a lot of these things that you take for granted, where you're building all your daily routine is like. You didn't have that before on that you've recreated that. And then it's like you doing it and then keep pushing forward every day it's like pretty freaking amazing."
3483.0,Patient,"It is it totally totally is you know we're. we're doing we're doing good you know we just have to you know, concentrate on. You know, whatever work, we can do. it's it's hard it's hard up here and we have a contract for a year in our place and we've been here a year already so that's The wonderful thing in itself, but my gosh you know, we still have to hear. That. yeah we still have to be able to. Try to make ends meet and it's not easy when you live up on a hill on a ranch and nobody can either come and pick you up for work or you know we have a bus. coins for the bus and we still have to travel to get to the system like they come up and you up at the ranch you know. So it's very hard it's very hard and my moms like why don't you just get housing in in hollister you were in town, you know. Well, it doesn't work like that my mom you know she's willing to do it, you know, for whatever you want to say she's comfortable and. You know she comes up here a lot, and she because we don't have a washer and dryer she does their laundry and she's happy to do it, she has. way so much energy naturally she's never done any drugs anything like that her mom or my grandma was that alcoholic for years so she has been anti everything which has been great both my mom and my dad have been like that you know they're divorced, but. They both been great great role model same for my husband, the very Square and wonderful you know. And and it's it's great to have that privilege to have parents like that, because I see myself and i'm like oh my gosh I wish I could have been like that, but that's not how my cards were laid out there. You know."
705.0,Provider,yeah I know to last time natalie We talked a little bit about the the struggle with sometimes not you know with you and your son and him living apart.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah you know that's been a big thing it's been a big thing, and I did talk to him this last week. And he's just doing great you know, and when I do talk to him it's wonderful, I just want to see him more but. That has a lot to do with my mom Unfortunately, you know. It just does you know she my ex husband and working. You know anyways he's. He doesn't have parents that are live anymore, and so, when they passed away. You kind of look to my mom and then, when things happen with me he hired a lawyer, because he has money he's from a ranching family and I have no money so he took me to court and he said. You know if you don't sign these papers and sign your son over then i'm going to expose that you are on drugs and blah blah blah you're homeless or you're with. Any you know just he did that you know and, at the time I didn't have anybody I even talked to my mom about it and she's you know at the time it just was a big mess, and that was about 10 years ago, you know and ever since then I have had no. Actual rights to my son, because the lawyer and Court was like if you don't sign these papers we're gonna expose that you've done drugs and that you know and, at the time I was like well, I certainly don't want that, because I was you know still working as a nurse. You know, so it was just bad really bad."
705.0,Provider,"It is natalie i'm glad that you realize that that situation, it was a no win situation, and for something that someone knows about you to be used. As a threat as just so inappropriate and with the disease of addiction is if if the Attorney only treated it. Like it deserved to be treated instead of turning it around and you know for for you natalie is that you've made the best out of that situation you did what you thought was the best at that time. And yeah you're you're connected to your son, where you do like i'm hearing you want to see a more, but you are getting. More yeah."
3483.0,Patient,"yeah and that's another thing my dad so my mom and my dad had been divorced for like 35 years or whatever he's been remarried and. I have a great relationship with my dad you know he's just a great guy and and. He just says one thing because because. there's only one grandchild that's my son in the family that's it and it's like oh my gosh you know just my mom treats him like he's like eight years old he's 15 now you know he's 15 years old and and and he gets straight a's in school, he was diagnosed. With ADHD and. i'm a high functioning autism, you know, and my mom would say in my ex husband wants to be like, no, no, very you know he's fine, but I took him when I knew I should they get that early early. You know all of the tests that they do. You know about when he was about three and a half or so because I realized that he wasn't exactly you know I have nothing to compare him to because I don't have any other children, of course, but. I just felt like Well, this is a real handful you know, so I took him in and that's what they said and. The other part of the families like no he's not like that he's just been a boy, but it has shown over the years and he's just a beautiful little man, you know he just is wonderful, but. My family has like my mom you know I try to get along with her, I love her very much and I would never disrespect her, but she has. said so much stuff about me over the years to my son. to other people that my other family doesn't talk to me, you know and. I felt like yeah I feel like you know she's only here because she is my mom good I feel like she just hates me as i'm."
705.0,Provider,Have you in your mom ever been close natalie where you could tell her some of the things of how you're feeling.
3483.0,Patient,"Oh yes, yes, absolutely. But she thinks i'm crazy when I talked to her about."
705.0,Provider,She doesn't ever validate of where this might come from or.
3483.0,Patient,"Oh absolutely not no she thinks that because I have made. Poor decisions. she thinks everything that she is because she's a retired aren't. You know. And she's like I said she's he has plenty of money that's, not just because she I mean she worked her butt off, you know I know that. But. Her mom left her an inheritance so she was able to get you know, like doing whatever she wanted and which i'm happy for but. She gives me bad time about you know $2 or $5 or you know and i'm not asking for anything I just want her to see me as a person, she doesn't never does. You know she got. My i'll see you have one sister she doesn't even talk to me never did anything to hurt you know. Never. She didn't call me back into the whole family treats me like a piece of shit really. know my dad my dad never does."
705.0,Provider,it's almost like the rest of the family treat you as the escape goat is that they're looking to blame someone being is refusing to look at their own stuff and so you're the person.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah exactly yeah so that's what I deal with all the time and then I. You know I don't want to say bow down, but I want to say I don't speak my mind, because my mom takes me is like wow don't raise your voice to me or you're bullying me is what she told me when I said, my mom my gosh you're my mom I love you why would a bully you what the heck. She never she never stood up for me for nothing, so I always stuff for myself. You know."
705.0,Provider,Hearing to your your remark right now about your mom and It just shows you that that's her level of functioning that your mom. You know.
3483.0,Patient,Right.
705.0,Provider,"yeah that there's some impairment there and as. going through that and your parent being impaired there's some things from your childhood that you bring into your adulthood, and you know now as an adult, you have the voice and you can express these. Things, but a lot of times the family still wants to like keep things you know let's not talk about it let's be in denial, just like your son. You did what was best for your son, by getting him the appropriate diagnosis, where it can help understand how his brain works different and to get them the help that he needs."
3483.0,Patient,That was my point right.
705.0,Provider,"Right, but you did that, out of love and out of knowing that you put everything else to the side, it was about your son and making sure that he was going to get the proper diagnosis and you did that."
3483.0,Patient,"That was my main point and and i'm telling you my mom was just like no everybody, you know was just. hating on me, I felt just. hating on me for for for being honest, you know i'm like look I don't have like I said I don't have anything to compare it to but. know that it is not a normal child development, you know as a nurse myself, but I lost my nursing license as well and that's another. great thing for everybody to hate on natalie, for you know, over the years i'm just i'm so over it, you know, and my husband is like you know just like my dad my husband and my dad they get along very well and i'm thankful and. they're both like just. let you know because we love Jesus, we do so let. let things happen the way they're supposed to happen, you know little by little, it is you know it's. Beautiful to look forward to all this stuff that my gosh all the hurtful things and I don't say anything to anybody, because I have respect but. It seems that, like my mom especially you know, like like I said she's like our only ride into town and back, but she's retired she doesn't have. A job to go to and stuff and she's fully functional and takes care of everything she'll do everything for everybody else, but when it comes to me. She makes me feel like a piece of crap when I asked her if you could possibly give me a ride into town, just to get groceries sometimes it's like. Oh, my car is just it's getting beat up going up the road, just like does it ever matter that you know all you need is a beautiful that's a reliable that I can get a job you know in town and all she says is you just need to get a housing in town, but she does not understand. It that housing it doesn't come that way not only that fit that all of her friends and she or if they don't have money problems, let me just say that they have no money problems at all. So when it comes. Up she'll pay for a. $40 box of tomatoes, which I, you know we went and can the other day, which was a good day with my mom thankfully. It was. But. My gosh you know she pays $40 for that, but she doesn't want to give me $2 for for this or that i'm not asking her for money, I just want her to stop treating me like a piece of crap. Because i'm not."
705.0,Provider,yeah and to have some understanding of what you're going through and what a struggle it's been and where you are today and doing well.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah and even when I say that it's still such as. It is, and I understand over the years, people have to heal and some people don't forgive and I understand that I knew, but if you still have to be a part of their lives, like a family member does, of course, you know what are you gonna do you're going to do the best you can and. Holding for something that has happened 10 years ago that you cannot say you're starting a for like like I think I told you, I took a $100 gift card from her and she just won't let that go and I understand that Okay, I do, however, I have not. i'm not that person, you know I could say a lot of things like well why did you tell the whole family and I have a piece of crap and. And did all this stuff and this and that when you don't even know what you're talking about you know but everybody believes you because you have a good reputation and a good name and this and that you know."
705.0,Provider,"That comes back to you and and gaining even more of a healthy sense of self, and you know building your own family were a lot of times it doesn't have to be blood it's like you know. your husband it's like people like that that you're like this is my family, this is my support system and who I choose."
3483.0,Patient,"When to tell you that. He and his family he's a he has he's a Mexican wonderful beautiful family there well brothers and sisters and they have welcomed me more than my other family has you know and and we've been together eight and a half years now. So it's a good thing you know we have problems of course with, and he has five kids you know that are grown up and there's always those dynamics, but we just deal with them as healthy as we can."
705.0,Provider,"Taking it back. today. It looks a little bit of feedback there is happening, can you hear me okay."
3483.0,Patient,"Yes to say it here, let me try this Sir. Okay, I don't know if this is any better, I had a bad parent earphones is better."
705.0,Provider,That sounds great natalie I.
3483.0,Patient,could just hear.
705.0,Provider,"back when I was sharing I don't know if you, you heard were you know, sometimes too is just throughout where the family, you know dynamics is coming into play is just to pull it back and be like just for today i'm sober and I can build on that transportation is. It you but i'm building on being sober and drawing on your spirituality where you're like you know what i'm going to pray about it i'm going to be with others. and make it each day, no."
3483.0,Patient,"Yes. yeah most definitely and Valerie Thank you so much, you know it's hard do well i'm kind of a sensitive person, I guess, I would say, but I appreciate you very much, and thank you for your time, you know it's been. it's hard to revisit those those times that you keep thinking back like. You know what am I gonna be able to get through this but i'm already through it, it just keeps coming back, and each time sometimes it's like oh it's Okay, and sometimes it's really heartfelt you know it just depends."
705.0,Provider,If I can. open to maybe a recovery assignment of something just to explore.
3483.0,Patient,"Sure, what are you thinking."
705.0,Provider,Sometimes it's helpful and again this is just something i'm putting out there and then. you're always in control of choosing yay or nay.
3483.0,Patient,Some of the.
705.0,Provider,"Things that maybe for like you forgiving yourself, or if it's questionable. Like things that you did when maybe you were actively using and just starting to write a list of it as you remember write a list of it. And then, as you write a list of it out decided. I want you to skirt. Around, though. Where. You know, thank you did, to be able to say outside it today on sober here's what I did in the past today i'm going to my my group meetings and my you know."
3483.0,Patient,"Just kidding okay. Okay yeah I understand that that's a that's a pretty cool new concept, because I was thinking you know, like. You know I i've gone to a meetings before and I don't get me wrong my grandma my mom's mom was an alcoholic for many, many years. And my mom herself was molested by somebody because my grandma was drawn it didn't know it happened as soon as, of course, in the 50s you know, like 50s so my mom is traumatized by that so everything is like a or my mom goes to me or you know what is it not any. What is it that."
705.0,Provider,I can either see CA there's him as a comedian.
3483.0,Patient,"yeah exactly exactly you know just a family members that have been hurt by an. Allen on Thank you Alan on. Yes, thank you. Very much so yeah so i'm just trying my best to appreciate every, but these dynamics on this and I think I do a pretty good job just Sometimes I feel like. You know I don't want to be take it for granted, because i'm here and i'm doing good, but you know, sometimes I don't need to or most of the time I don't need to prove anything to anybody myself and Jesus, you know my family that cares. that's best like."
705.0,Provider,"You said is absolutely right. And that is giving yourself permission to forgive yourself and really thoroughly take a look at it, that we all make mistakes we're entitled to make."
3483.0,Patient,Mistakes every.
705.0,Provider,"Day, yes and that's where. The reasons why you're where you are today is because your experiences your opportunities that you've learned from. And so, a lot of like you coming through and especially when we talk about addiction and not using that takes so much strength that takes so much motivation from yourself that takes so much like. yeah and so highlight those things. I know you froze for a minute and Atlanta i'm hoping, you can hear me. I will put it in the chat too. Patient went away i'm hoping seems like it was an Internet problem i'm hoping she's able to reconnect we will wait for patient. we're going to still wait on patient to return hoping she can return, where we can end the session I will wait for a patient to be able. The next appointment at 12 o'clock so we'll see what happens. still waiting for patient she's not been able to enter so i'm creating an email. Just letting her know and being able to email some of the wellness resources, we talked about. So I will give it a few more minutes before Disconnecting. i'm going to end here, unfortunately, the patient was not able to sign back on, but I did send an email so patient will receive an email and asking if our next appointment can be October the six at 130 will wait for patient to respond via email. This appointment, though, is closed."
