15220.0,Patient,"yeah um my experience, like my experience at all sides are frustrated were pretty positive. But my experience at Center for change was. Not. Okay um so I was on their Inpatient unit, I had a two for four months. And then I went to the residential side for four months."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15220.0,Patient,"Sorry, was there for a while and like they. were going to do em Dr with me and they said I had to get off the tube so that's what I worked for it was still like to end, our because I know that I need it. yeah um but then once I got off the two they tell me that much Karma history is too expensive and they couldn't address it there."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. So. Did they discharge you back home, then or okay."
15220.0,Patient,It was not what my treatment team my outpatient treatment team was like very against it. Okay.
120.0,Provider,"So, have you gotten any mtr."

Look at what i'm doing. Okay, so tell me kind of about your eating disorder like kind of what what you've been diagnosed with or what the behaviors are."
15220.0,Patient,"or well I haven't i've been diagnosed with interest yeah. My eating sugar starting 2017. And and, like, for the most part is involved restriction and like exercise. Okay um there's been some purging but that's like kind of secondary restriction. Overall right um."
120.0,Provider,How often with the with the purging.
15220.0,Patient,um well right now it's probably like once or twice a week.
120.0,Provider,Okay.

120.0,Provider,"Okay, do you binge to. know before purging okay."

120.0,Provider,But this historically.
15220.0,Patient,Urges there yeah okay.
120.0,Provider,"So you have some some urges but. you're not engaging in that right now. Okay, and. So I tell me kind of why, why are you seeking help now like, did you kind of realize that you were on a bad track or. In your case manager referred you but did we do you feel like you need more help too."
15220.0,Patient,"yeah because it has been like I don't have a good living environment so like basically I came back to like no support and little. um so it made the transition really hard and like. Right now it's like. i'm kind of spiraling okay with like everything. And so that's why she recommended that I look into this and, like it's on the only one, the only person to take my insurance, so I see."
120.0,Provider,Okay um do you why do you want recovery like what motivates you to do things differently.
15220.0,Patient,"um because I know that this is not sustainable, like what i'm doing now, and like ultimately I feel like if I like. I like told myself that, like the last time I was in treatment was the last time because there's like the fourth time that i've been a treatment analysis like hands on everything, and like I put everything that I had is that. um so like when I came home I. I do feel like if I don't get help I might end up killing myself. i'm. Just because, like I. Like I can't continue to live the way I live and feel the way I show."
120.0,Provider,"When you say killing yourself, does that mean because you're eating disorder will destroy your body or that you would intentionally kill yourself."
15220.0,Patient,"No, well, I mean that's like a long way away, but like. Like I like don't care if I were to die from my eating disorder. Okay, but. it's really more of like right now it's more like doing something to kill myself."
120.0,Provider,"So now you're it's more of kind of a suicidal. suicidal thinking okay. Okay um. How is your eating disorder like affecting you know your your life like your relationships or employment those kinds of things, or do you feel like it does."
15220.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean like I. it's. um. it's just like maintaining like. My trauma basically so like i'm not really like working through that i'm just using my eating disorder to like deal with those things will come, and so I feel like. It is like Oh, I think about most of the time we're not the only thing I think about, but I think about it all the time. you're in like I."
120.0,Provider,trauma or the eating disorder or.
15220.0,Patient,A little both.
120.0,Provider,But okay.
15220.0,Patient,"um my eating disorder like I. worry about like calories and sugar and all that when I know like it's not that's not really like. yeah doesn't matter, but I can't stop like worrying about it."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, like a lot of thinking."
15220.0,Patient,Like.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. How, how is your your health have you had some health complications from this. Like cardiac problems or hair falling out or like blood pressure, like worth a static blood pressure, where you get lightheaded when you stand up things like that."
15220.0,Patient,"yeah um. I have like chronic anemia. And gastroparesis. Okay, and then I do have or the static hypertension. In the past I have like had normal ekg."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15220.0,Patient,um and then i'm just like kind of chronically dehydrated because our strict food.
120.0,Provider,"So you have a hard time, just like drinking water."
15220.0,Patient,Okay.
120.0,Provider,um and what do you have right now in regards to treatment are you seeing a therapist or dietician. Is your therapist and eating disorder therapist. or like a trauma therapist. So you haven't really gotten into the kind of the heavy parts of the trauma because of the eating disorder being so unstable.
15220.0,Patient,yeah and just like trying to manage like my safety.
120.0,Provider,"All right, and how often do you see that therapist."
15220.0,Patient,On once a week.
120.0,Provider,To weekly okay how about dietitian are you meeting with them too.
15220.0,Patient,"I was until like three weeks ago she went on vacation. Okay, and then we just haven't scheduled another appointment okay."
120.0,Provider,"Do you feel like you can trust that person or that and do what she says, or do you feel like you're not able to to follow through on the goals and stuff that they that you guys set together."
15220.0,Patient,"i'm like historically, I have not been able to like follow like her meal plan and stuff like that. Okay um but like she'll work with me on like different things, I can try to do, and like i'll try to do them. Okay um but she doesn't have me on like a set meal plan, because she knows I don't follow it like. Okay her own like the set meal plan that she wants me to do, and she knows oh."
120.0,Provider,Okay um. Have you ever like had periods of time like maybe after when you got out of a treatment program or you did well for a while.
15220.0,Patient,"um. When I got out of treatment, the first time I was like I did okay for a little bit and then things started like go downhill so, then I like reach back out to my team and then served like treatment again like outpatient treatment."
120.0,Provider,Right okay. I just was kind of wondering like what you have found to be helpful if anything outside of an Inpatient setting.
15220.0,Patient,"was like kind of hard because, like my disk charges, none of them have really been ideal. Meaning I haven't really had like anything set up like they didn't help me set up stuff for what once they discharge me. um and I also like their situations were selected tapestry, they put me in virtual pH for the first time, and like then they say I need a higher level of care. um but then, how many beds, so they just discharged me because they said I wasn't appropriate php and didn't help me find like a residential place."
120.0,Provider,"They didn't give you already referrals to any other places. Okay. um So what is your eating disorder like right now, like How much are you eating day today."
15220.0,Patient,I eat like a meal in like. One and a half snacks maybe.
120.0,Provider,So one meal and one and a half snacks each day. yeah okay what what is it like a in regards to like a meal size as it could have an average sized meal or do tend to restrict that or do you areas or meal or.
15220.0,Patient,"I mean, I would think that is like normal but I don't know if other people will think it's normal like I don't know if they think that it's a plus and what a normal meal would be. Okay i'm like calorie wise, I know that spot."
120.0,Provider,Do you do you pay attention to calories or like count calories.
15220.0,Patient,"um yeah I don't like. write down everything but, like, I know, the number of calories in the things that he saw just like added up in my head."
120.0,Provider,"What are you what calorie range, do you tend to to eat in."
15220.0,Patient,i'm like 600 and sometimes 700.
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15220.0,Patient,Which is like better than what I husband that's.
120.0,Provider,"So some some improvement there. Okay um. Do you ever see said you don't binge and sometimes you purge. Yes, with with that right okay. Yes, and do you ever use laxatives or diet pills. Okay, and then you mentioned exercise, you said you're not doing that currently is is that right. Yes, Okay, what have you done historically with exercise."
15220.0,Patient,"i'm. Just like a bunch of cardio. Like before I want to. Center for change, I was doing like 40 miles, a day on a bike. And it became a compulsive to where I was doing it six days a week, and I felt like even though my body was like telling me like don't do it, I still couldn't do it because I felt like I had to do it like like it was going to be bad if I didn't."
120.0,Provider,Okay. Okay. When do you think you're eating disorder was kind of at its worst or or do you can you even I do you know that I was just curious if it's been worse than it is now or and you're trying to prevent it from going that direction again.
15220.0,Patient,yeah I don't feel it's just like my worst.
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay. you're trying to you're feeling a little bit more hopeful right now, then it because it's been worse before."
15220.0,Patient,um I don't know about local eyes know that like. it's gonna get better like continue to progress well do something different.
120.0,Provider,"I see okay i'm glad that you have that insight to kind of be a whistleblower on yourself, so to speak. So i'm. Are you seeing medical doctor right now to manage your physical symptoms. Yes, how often do you see them."
15220.0,Patient,i'm like once every three or four weeks.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, what was the last time you were seeing. Yesterday okay. Do they do labs on you and stuff. Yes, Okay, do you know if your labs have been okay."
15220.0,Patient,i'm just like i've been in the MIC.

15220.0,Patient,But then i'm also again PT because. i'm i've been having like some like kinda like neurological symptoms. Okay um. and um they thought it was like vertigo. But physically there isn't like sure that that's what it is because I don't have like a classically issues I see.
120.0,Provider,you're trying to kind of figure out that piece too.
15220.0,Patient,"yeah I won't when I was in North Carolina I had to go the hospital twice. And they did like a CT scan cuz I was like so dizzy and like throwing up everywhere and. They like said that they thought that I saw have a history of like self harm and like part of that is like punching myself in the head. Okay, so they said they thought that I may have given myself a mild concussion That was what was causing it."
120.0,Provider,"Where you punching yourself in the head, while you were there."
15220.0,Patient,But then they are like i'm also worried because they found with a spot on my brain. And they like recommended I get an MRI or never so my doctor ordered that and my insurance denied it okay.

15220.0,Patient,"i'm To be honest, like it makes me want to kill myself yeah."
120.0,Provider,You feel so awful about it.
15220.0,Patient,"Well, and it's not really the number necessarily it's how I feel my body like i'm pretty good like estimator of like where my weight is just because I know my own body. Sure um. But it makes me feel like I feel like so disgusting and dirty in my body, and so, like the bigger that I am the I feel like there's like more of me to hate, I see."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15220.0,Patient,So that's like can share reading to like my si.
120.0,Provider,Do you feel like you have some skills to manage those feelings when you have that really horrible body image experience.
15220.0,Patient,"um I mean I try to use distraction, and like to have like some things that I do like activities that I do. Okay, but for the most part, like. Besides, like. Self harm like. there's not a whole lot that really like has a significant impact."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so self harm was the only thing that you really felt that took some of the edge off. Yes, okay. All right, um, what is your what when was your lowest weight and do you know, like what it was, and when it was."
15220.0,Patient,um it's like 2017. And it was like 84.
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15220.0,Patient,"And then, like in 2019 it got low again, and it was at 94."
120.0,Provider,Was that when you were on the tube feet.
15220.0,Patient,um yeah okay.
120.0,Provider,And what about like. The highest weight that your body has been.
15220.0,Patient,um i've been like it was more than 25 so like i'm not like the top of my range I can't do this anymore.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, when was the 125."
15220.0,Patient,i'm. Like. 2014.
120.0,Provider,But right now you're feeling like you're can't manage it anymore.
15220.0,Patient,"yeah like I. have done some things like. they're not necessarily like I plan to do it, but like it's like acting out what I would like to do."
120.0,Provider,What did you do.
15220.0,Patient,i'm. Like I just imagine like what it was like to like shoot myself in the head. So I held her leaving gun to my head.
120.0,Provider,Without today. know where was that.
15220.0,Patient,um. And it's. On Sunday.
120.0,Provider,Last Sunday okay. we're kind of fantasizing about what it would be like.
15220.0,Patient,"yeah and like I I like put them away there's just like I, and I understand like there's concern and like. Because I like. To look. Like bullets from my parents. um but then I put them back like I gave him back because my case managers like if you don't do them call, please."
120.0,Provider,Like bb pellets or. No like bullet bullet do you have a gun then.
15220.0,Patient,They do.
120.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, so you had bullets and the and the gun from your parents."
15220.0,Patient,um.
120.0,Provider,"I had a list to it. Do you live with them. Yes, okay that's what I wasn't sure. So there is a gun there is it locked up."
15220.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know if there is any more because I had talked to my mom about the fact that I knew where it was and I knew where the key was. mm hmm um so I had to ask her to like move it, so I don't know if they like move it out of the House. mm hmm or if they just tried to hide it somewhere."
120.0,Provider,Do you feel like if you had access to that you would go through with it.
15220.0,Patient,i'm. know.
120.0,Provider,What keeps you from from falling through on suicide.
15220.0,Patient,So I got most of the time is because I would feel guilty like I don't want to hurt people. Okay um but then there's flashes of like. Time like they're like brief but they're pretty intense to where I like get to the point to where I don't feel. Like. Like I feel like I can just I will just deal with that guilt. Like it doesn't matter like. What I do here yeah okay.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. and Do you right now, would you say that you're feeling suicidal."
15220.0,Patient,"um. I mean I don't feel like i'm like going to do anything and it's not like, I have a desire to like go do anything right this moment, but like there is a desire to just be dead."
120.0,Provider,"Right okay. Like you don't feel like you would go and act on it, but it would be nice if it just happened."
15220.0,Patient,Yes.
120.0,Provider,"Like that okay. Okay i'm. back to the weight thing it sounds like the weight, like the number itself is a pretty big deal for you is that true. I do really worry about that number."
15220.0,Patient,um.
120.0,Provider,Or do you just try to avoid it or.
15220.0,Patient,"Like if I felt differently, like in my body like that this way, then I don't think i'd have such a problem with it, but it's like such a trigger to me right now that I can't deal with it."
120.0,Provider,"So it's like not necessarily what you look like, or what the number is, but how you feel in your body. What what How would you describe your current body image like do you just do hate your body or are you so pretty strongly."
15220.0,Patient,yeah there's not anything I like bomani okay.
120.0,Provider,"Did was it that way, when you were at tapestry or did it help when you were there and then it just got bad again when you got out."
15220.0,Patient,"So it was bad, but like I did have like some hope at tapestry, because I felt like we were like getting into stuff that was pertinent like helping me like move past my eating disorder. mm hmm um but then so, then I got discharged and that felt like how starting all over in our started over again so many times in the last the last four years that it just felt hopeless and like there is not. A belief, like a strong belief that if anything's going to help. mm hmm so I mean my body image is like not gotten like necessarily better, but I was able to better deal with it, when I was at tap shoes."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay. um do you have any particular food rules, besides just eating very little food. Like are there, certain foods that you're. more afraid of than others."
15220.0,Patient,"I mean, I like try to avoid foods like with high sugar. Okay, like calories."
120.0,Provider,So those are kind of the scarier ones.
15220.0,Patient,yeah like carbohydrates.
120.0,Provider,Okay. Oh. How do you feel about eating with other people.
15220.0,Patient,I don't.
120.0,Provider,You don't or like you won't do it or.
15220.0,Patient,"yeah I mean unless I like absolutely have to like I visited my dad this weekend and like they wanted to go out to eat, so I just got something really small like I yeah well I got a salad but I didn't. Like it was not it's not something I would ever choose."
120.0,Provider,Sure okay okay well like at when you were in treatment were you able to like sit at a table and other people. with other clients.
15220.0,Patient,"yeah it was like 20 different because I guess like maybe I just like don't might have new friends here, so I can't think of like anybody here that I would like, want to necessarily go anywhere but i'm like it was a little bit different there because, like. The I felt like they understood like. how hard it was just to sit and say oh."
120.0,Provider,"Sure yeah. You have more support and whatnot sure, because in our group in our group, we do eat together. The computer and so you have to have a camera on you can't be like over in the corner and things like that, like that you know and that's hard, because you have to choose to do that, you know, because obviously no one's going to force you. So that's something to think about as you think you can you know get can do that without having a big issue about it. So that's something to kind of think about and we only require that one of the groups, once a week. But we encourage it during other groups like if it but everyone's in like a different time zone and stuff and so it's kind of hard to have everyone eating the same time, because we're all in different meal schedules. But the group on Thursday we do do like a challenge, every week like something that's kind of hard like a donut or a burrito or. Something fried or whatever they kind of they come up with a goal each week so that's kind of what that would look like. Okay. um so the next part is about your psyche history, you mentioned ptsd do you have what other illnesses have you been diagnosed with."
15220.0,Patient,Major depression. And ADHD. And then there's been like some places have like diagnosed me with CAD. um and like I did do work but it's been like several years um I did like some kind of OCD work.
120.0,Provider,"Can you, excuse me for one second I need to let my dog in. One second she's at the door. If I don't let her in while she when she scratches then she'll keep scratching and I don't want to mess my door and so."
15220.0,Patient,What kind of dog is she.
120.0,Provider,"she's a border collie, I have three, but I have to border collies and then, I have a foster border collie I just picked up on Sunday, then i'm trying to get him into a better situation."
15220.0,Patient,So school so.
120.0,Provider,"they're awesome I love them. But Okay, have you ever had been diagnosed with like with borderline. No, no, or. By polarities like that. No okay. And then do you have any chronic health problems that aren't related to the disorder, you know things like diabetes or fibromyalgia or other might be related but that are kind of different or like seizure disorders things like that. No okay. So. The next question is kind of about suicidal ideation I know you said you've experienced it a lot, have you ever had any attempts."
15220.0,Patient,i'm not like. intentionally.
120.0,Provider,"Can you tell me about more about that, like what is, what does that mean."

15220.0,Patient,"um yeah a lot of my identity and like was wrapped up into like my. professional life, like that was something I, the one thing, like in my life that I knew that I was good out. mm hmm So then, when I like stuff like filter and I wasn't able to do that anymore, he kind of like took a big hit I took a big hit."
120.0,Provider,I bet I bet what is it that keeps you from being able to do that.
15220.0,Patient,Right now being in our treatment and not being stable enough to get.
120.0,Provider,"Okay that's what I was wasn't sure if, like both if there was kind of a chicken or the egg thing, where you know you're you're not able to kind of live, you know, in your professional life, because of mental illness but, but it also makes you feel worse. yeah keep shooting yeah okay.

15220.0,Patient,"But they're like. I did get a job. um. But I right now i'm like really terrified to go anywhere like I hate being at my house, because I just like like a bunch of shit happen here and I just like the history of it, but then also i'm like straight to go out. i'm like even like the store wow."
120.0,Provider,Okay um. Do you have any legal issues like it did you ever try to press charges on that person who raped you.
15220.0,Patient,know.
120.0,Provider,Is that something you'd be interested in trying to do or not.
15220.0,Patient,i'm not really.
120.0,Provider,And do you have anything that brings you joy that you like hobbies or anything that. That bring some some lightness to your life.
15220.0,Patient,um I like like to build with legos.
120.0,Provider,legos are cool and I saw you if you were dating or crocheting or something.
15220.0,Patient,yeah I was crushing.
120.0,Provider,cool. um do you have any questions for me about anything about this program or anything.
15220.0,Patient,I also like tacking sorry.
120.0,Provider,Oh kayaking cool. Do you have any questions for me about anything.
15220.0,Patient,"i'm. Like what kind of approaches, do you all use."
120.0,Provider,"um it's pretty individual basically we meet three times a week, if a group Monday, Tuesday Thursday. And then the groups are some of them are process groups so they're kind of open to what people bring to the group and then there's some that are like. Living skills are based on a specific topic we do a db T group, where we have you do diary cards, and then we do a body image group. Which is all focused on pushing you to learn to accept your body and and sort of blaming it for the problems in your life, and then we do a nutrition group, where we eat together. And then dietitian wise it's kind of between you and the dietitian. So it's a little bit flexible that way, but we usually use, recovery record. yeah reason you're probably familiar with that one and we're always shooting for three meals and three snacks that's what we try to do, but sometimes it starts with just three meals. Do you feel like you'd be able to do that if being asked to."
15220.0,Patient,um. I would try doing it.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. And then. You would meet with one of our therapists also and that would be based on that that's always pretty individual. But a lot of that is usually geared towards kind of trying to understand why this exists in your life and it sounds like you already have some quite a bit of awareness of that in regards to the trauma and we don't do em Dr. Because we're it's all virtual and that's not really it's not recognize air it's not recommended to do it virtually. yeah and it's also not recommended to do it if you're not nourished fully that's probably why you're haven't been able to do it. Because in you know you are still being like at Center for change, you said you were still being being tube fed and so they know they're it's. And that's and that's you know contra indicated to do when you're being to bed, because your brain has to be in a pretty balanced state to be able to benefit from it. So we don't do that. But we do more, cognitive behavioral or. Helping you kind of decide what you would rather be doing in your life like what are the things that you want and kind of shooting for that, rather than just trying to avoid what you don't want that makes sense."
15220.0,Patient,yeah is like do you have people that like don't necessarily like face their approach and cvt.
120.0,Provider,That they don't they don't work sorry.
15220.0,Patient,Like necessarily like base their approach like put like. Completely approach everything from cvt.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean what most of us are I mean. Most therapists in general aren't hardcore any particular thing. They usually kind of try to meet the person where they're at in regards to what helps and. So, most of the time they'll be you know conversations that pull from a couple of different theoretical theoretical approaches. You know lot a lot of dpt kind of stuff around mindfulness and observing your emotions, rather than acting on them like that would probably be a big part of yours, because of the self harm and suicidal stuff either probably be a really big push on that. And then. You know, and then trauma, but you know good traumas. That, to me it sounds like you really need trauma work that that's probably where a lot of this is stemming from. And that's really hard to do in this kind of a setting. Because, as you very well know. it's like playing whack a mole with symptoms, you know, like."
15220.0,Patient,You know yeah.
120.0,Provider,"The this and this pops up and this pops up, and you know, in a virtual world that's really hard to manage. And so, for when people are in our program we do like need them to be pretty stable and pretty self self motivated because no one's going to follow you around and make sure you're safe. You know, and no one's going to make sure that you're not purging and you could easily lie, you could say oh yeah eight this and we wouldn't know. You know so so that's why I always like to kind of put that out there is, if you feel like you need more structure than that. Then you probably would need a higher level of care and i'm a little bit nervous about the degree of your si what I really wished, you could do is to go to a trauma Program. You know that that where they can manage the food but also hit the trauma pretty hard, because I think that's probably a lot of the roots of this. yeah and the adoption stuff too, I mean that's probably probably some trauma rooted there also if kind of thing like you weren't wanted or that you had to be perfect or your parents would send you back that sort of thing like you mentioned. So I think that you know em Dr could be helpful for that. So I."
15220.0,Patient,Oh sorry go ahead.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, what I was just going to say is I think what I would recommend to your case manager, I mean, I think that you're going to need a little bit more than what we have to offer. Simply because we don't have a big heavy trauma piece. yeah and because of the nature of this and and i'm concerned that, if we just work on food you're going to be just working on the symptoms kind of."
15220.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, instead of the root of it, so do you know if there's any opportunity to go to a trauma based Program."
15220.0,Patient,i'm not sure.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, because that's what I would like to do is make the recommendation to your case manager that we look for a trauma based program you know, maybe like tk or something that does. As simple as both those trauma and manages foodstuff. Because you kind of have a pretty complex situation, I think."
15220.0,Patient,Okay.
