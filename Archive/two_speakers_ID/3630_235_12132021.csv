235.0,Provider,"The big time yeah we're hurt and wonder read a couple things T plus my clinical director want me to get on this smart. thing as far as setting goals and stuff so think about a goal we could set that REACH and boil that, but let me read this for you, first, I think you'll find this interesting, this is from. Just from this book in his image by all brand and Philip yancey i'm sure you might have heard it Philip yancey he's uh. Anyhow, it says. This is from Leo toss it possibly what is art, a Christian ideal changed in reverse everything so that as the Gospel put it, that which was exalted a moment has become an abomination in the sight of God. The ideal is no longer the greatness of pharaoh or of a Roman Emperor not the beauty of of a Greek know the wealth of a Phoenician but humility purity compassion and love. The hero, is no longer Davis but Lazarus the beggar not Mary Mary Magdalene and the day of her beauty, but the day of her repentance. Not those who acquire wealth, but those who have abandoned it not those who dwell and palaces but those who dwelt in the catacombs and huts not those who rule over others, but those who acknowledged no authority but god's. You know and reason I reading that because I think we get caught up, I know I do I get caught up so much what's going on the world and get stressed out, and you know. In lauridsen control man. You know."

3630.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no."
235.0,Provider,"Let me read this what. What is short term and long term goals, you know, and you know, like a magic wand, if he could have things happen that you want to have happen and the smart is an acronym for. specific, measurable achievable, realistic and time frame. So they they want us to try to do this with with you and with all clients is find out. The goal. That maybe you want to do. Like a specific one doesn't have to be much might be exercise three times a week or or you know go to a meeting or. yeah but notice earlier. yeah."

3630.0,Patient,Oh God 2000 2007 2008 or.
235.0,Provider,"So it should be on your record that would be off your record after seven years so that shouldn't be an issue. You know thinking. right but. All right, well, we got three goals here, but why don't we specify and make just one for right the immediate one like a specific clean clear and emphasize what you want to happen. So do you want first of all to happen is to go to start going to a a meetings or fellowship in a church or full time employment which one, do you think you've won focus in on first."

235.0,Provider,Maybe a we're.
3630.0,Patient,yeah maybe a.
235.0,Provider,"Okay let's make that as our short term goal all right. Okay right, I mean it's a long term, but for right now for that first one so under the smart deal we're going to put down okay under the S. Which is specific we're going to go to go to amy thanks. All right, go to a meetings. And then number two would be the measurable. Which is a goal, where you can measure your progress. That would be like what's what's realistic for you going to meetings during how many during the week, can you make you think. Realistically."
3630.0,Patient,Two or three at least.
235.0,Provider,"two to three we'll start off. To start off with. we'll start off with. let's go to meetings right now week and then we'll we'll see three the following time or something like that, what do you think. Okay i'll just put down two to three meetings, a week."
3630.0,Patient,Okay.
235.0,Provider,"This way we can go back and check on two three meetings, a week. Number three is the a which is achievable. And this one is goals need to be attainable.
