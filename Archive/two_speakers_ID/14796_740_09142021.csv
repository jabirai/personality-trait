And then I put my feet back in the car I go to the back, see all the windows already down I just lay down because I was just so super angry and I couldn't like I don't know I get like was a switch it was kind of weird. And so. I had my feet out and then. I. hey like pulled up and then I make my torso super long sorry like didn't just go and then I like just hopped out like I went back and then topped out again."

740.0,Provider,"Okay, and. What made you angry."
14796.0,Patient,"um there were two comments that have gotten made, but if that were triggers but it shouldn't have even it was just like my own, my own like self that made me angry about it, that makes sense, just like certain things within myself made me angry and so that's why I did that."
740.0,Provider,So when you align down on the ground. know. When you were like lying on the bed laying down on the back feet. With your feet out the window what were you thinking about in that moment.
14796.0,Patient,I don't even think I was I wasn't thinking as angry I couldn't even tell us thinking about it already this there's already like a switch that was just like I was not thinking about anything.
740.0,Provider,So. So you took the little handle thing in the backseat the one that's attached to the feeling I mean the roof.
14796.0,Patient,That time yeah.
740.0,Provider,And you taught the end you missed it yourself up a little bit. yeah ha. Ha ha.

740.0,Provider,"Remember handle bottom, if you have an open window."
14796.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,I know i'm trying to envision It makes sense.
14796.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So that means you you literally scooted Joseph up. To the window, where you put your feet was already hanging out so that means you but was already up against the door. So you use the handlebar basically to lift up your butt. and push yourself through the window."
14796.0,Patient,Listening holy shit um.
740.0,Provider,Is there right.
14796.0,Patient,Along jalen things.

740.0,Provider,"Birth all the way, that if that's all that's all the time thing now, mind you, it may have went by so fast for you to where it was kind of like you can't even recall what wow Halloween down."
14796.0,Patient,"No, no, I don't know no I know how on down I just talked about it at this now I got I was the window is like you know yeah no I didn't have my ass up no I screwed in my ass out and fucking. I don't remember I completely blanked as soon as I before I hit the floor, so I don't remember hitting the floor don't remember being on the floor. I don't remember being picked up, I remember walking to the car and getting in the car and then slightly driving back to the ambulance but I don't remember hitting the floor feeling anything but I remember. My fear out kicking it, and so I go I use the handle and I pull up, and so I my. screen and then I jumped. It was like a fast."
740.0,Provider,"Exactly so their motion you just did that's what i'm talking about. So with your leg already at then me, and you have screwed up to the door in order to do that handle pull yourself back."
14796.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah because, if I didn't use the hand I. have been able."
740.0,Provider,To do it.
14796.0,Patient,"I mean, I would have I would have been my own strength."
740.0,Provider,"The leaf hold the door, you would have to hold on to something or push yourself up from the feet. like this. In order. To get out the door. I mean yeah so Okay, so you hit that. You hit. You hit the ground. You don't."
14796.0,Patient,"know I know. I know I can tell you probably how I hit it, though, but I don't remember, but I I just went how my body is and things on me, I can tell you how I hit it."
740.0,Provider,Do you have any bruising.

14796.0,Patient,"Yes, what is yes, what is the safety plan mean."
740.0,Provider,"forward a safety plan is, is it is something that we create is kind of an exit plan. So the next time you feel the urge to. jump out a window jump off the cars or do something that you may do something to harm yourself it's kind of like putting interventions in place so that you can utilize those resources and better of taking the. taking the initiative to harm yourself. Okay, does that make sense. Yes, is that something that you want to do. Yes, okay. So this is, this is the play. And so right now we're going to identify three warning sign. Okay, we know that anger is one. Yes, okay So these are three one of the signs that something is about to happen that a crisis is developing. So we have, but what I know angry is is anger because anger ranked number one number two or number three."
14796.0,Patient,"don't know I don't know I don't know, maybe one or two. yeah when I get angry I just thought when I struggle, the most and that's why this is like i'm not over it, but I get I I have developed tools, not be over by get over it very quickly."
740.0,Provider,So you get over very quickly after the paint.
14796.0,Patient,Know like. I just I have to fucking move on and think i'd still be here so i'm just gonna keep fighting keep going.
740.0,Provider,"Okay cuz you said they weren't you said earlier than when you're angry you black out so that means you're prone to do anything. And now, remember."
14796.0,Patient,"That when i'm in wait, will you will you repeat what you just said, please."
740.0,Provider,"You said earlier, when you were talking about the situation between your your mom in the car, but she she had made a statement and you say you have really, really bad anger issues. And they're when they're angry, you can something you can sometimes like that."
14796.0,Patient,"Okay i'm when i'm angry, I do not black out."

14796.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good it wasn't it wasn't even when I hit the ground, it was before I hit the ground i'm probably when I jumped out, it was a body reaction my body."

740.0,Provider,"Okay, so they may say my my apologies."
14796.0,Patient,"No you're good you're good to know your goodness, I wanted to clarify you're totally good Thank you."

Just in case you can never duplicate you can get Ahold of me you'll be able to buy. All right, so I know we're not going to be getting fit everything, because I want to make sure we have that in place because that's, the most important thing everything else we can kind of do within the next patient or so, but I leave for the habit. dolan so we can have it in place. um what are some things you want to work on why you're here and treatment."
14796.0,Patient,"i'm. Talking only impulsivity and boundaries and. i'm. Definitely patients, but there was one more. i'm definitely definitely anger i'd say if I could work on angry, too, is that, if that counts in here unless I got to do another class but."

When I got to like maybe like older maybe like I don't know what I don't know what age I don't know what age i'll figure it out, but. i'm going to like a certain age where family kind of got harder because certain family got distant with other family and there was more drama in between and drama that God talks about and, like in a way. verbal like just too loud but. Other than that, like if that wasn't there I don't know otherwise good like my parents were amazing with how they've raised me and my brother obviously some things are. You know, lacking, but for the most part, I don't know, I think it was really like good but um yeah i'd say family was like it was always just before. me. my brother my mom and my dad and then I have an older brother step brother named Taylor he's from my dad but he was in our mix too."
