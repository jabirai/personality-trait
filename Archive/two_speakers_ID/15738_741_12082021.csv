741.0,Provider,i'm sure.
15738.0,Patient,"But other than that i'm Okay, I talked to Julie okay. she's going to write me letters well actually she already did."
741.0,Provider,she's actually.
15738.0,Patient,"Jamie for Jamie to put a letterhead and stuff on it, and she also put me on lexapro and. Some pro panel. I don't know what that is she said, both of them both of them is for like she said, both of them would help for my anxiety and my nerves. i'm going to pick those up tomorrow and start those prescriptions and then go from there."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. that'll work that'll work now let's talk about being aware. of things that are out of our control. Oh. Yes, we're."
15738.0,Patient,"All crazy crazy i'd like what I don't understand is I don't even know how in the world it's all going to play out, this is all from like even the indictment that was filed on me right now says that i'm 30 years old. i'm 37 i'll be 38 this year coming up."
741.0,Provider,So they don't have the correct date.
15738.0,Patient,"No, they still like I said and there's another family member that's involved, as well as the exact same charges so now my whole family's against me. And all mad at me, and all this is all my fault, because I, you know, I was the one that was strung out and all out there and I involved this person and got them in this trouble and yeah."
741.0,Provider,Okay yeah right okay like that person didn't have the right to say no huh.
15738.0,Patient,"right but see. Like where we're being charged with the exact same charges and on her indictment it says like she's 58. And it says that she's 51. And i'm 37 i'll be 38 in June and it says that i'm 30. The statute of limitation at Ohio is six years, I have no clue how this is even no clue at all."
741.0,Provider,What is this come from my goodness.
15738.0,Patient,"you're telling me I have I don't know I. Last week I was sitting there watching TV and I get a screenshot from my hand, that is, the where they had released it out into the paper. diamonds, there was like 37 diamonds, and it was a screenshot of mine, they got me for possession and trafficking. And like I said it says, my name and it says 30 years old and wheelers work okay i've lived I haven't even lived in wheelers where since February of 2009. i've lived in greenfield in our halfway and i'm 37. i'll be 38 and do."
741.0,Provider,"Well Okay, this is the deal all right all of their information is old and found and that one has no choice but to throw that crap out."
15738.0,Patient,that's what i'm thinking.
741.0,Provider,Have you contacted an attorney.
15738.0,Patient,"know because I know that, like one I don't have a way to get an attorney like to pay you on one and i'm sure that you know i'll have to wait in one will be appointed to me I just don't know. I don't know. Like I mean yeah what i'm going to. Go take care of it, you I mean my core data is coming up on the 21st so I have to go down there before then to take care of all of it because I don't want to have. A failure to have here, but I haven't even been served the indictment I haven't been served nothing yet like they have not have not physically."
741.0,Provider,Probably don't even know what the hell you're at.
15738.0,Patient,yeah. that's exactly what i'm thinking I haven't even lived around there and going on three years well. yeah it was February 2019.
741.0,Provider,wow.
15738.0,Patient,"Okay yeah since I moved up here, but all this incident happened was in. July and August of 2014. So whenever."
741.0,Provider,"That took too long and I, I mean."
15738.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah because, like even like I mean i've looked it up every way that I could possibly look it up. And i've seen if there's any loopholes or, like any way that they could take an extra two years or whatever and there's absolutely. No other way that I can find like every single thing i've looked up says that the statute of limitation is six years, no matter what well six years would have been what in 2020. Okay, what is the way. I would have thought, the last time that they would have been able to indict me would have been 2020. So i'm hoping i'm hoping and praying that this is the deal, but I don't know. I have."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, have you gotten in trouble since then. So that I mean that's that's that's the extent of it is that they're not gonna have any grounds to stand on."
15738.0,Patient,"Right. Now, like, I have not had like I said i've not had any contact with hardly anybody down there or anything like my kids. And my mom and my brother is about the only people that I talk to you down there I don't even talk to anybody down there I don't even talk to. Like I mean I even used to talk to a couple people from like meetings and stuff I haven't even talked to them and forever. Not for any reason, just because you know, like we all just kind of like separated and have our own life right um but yeah like i've completely adjusted my life like completely away from that place on purpose like."
741.0,Provider,Why.
15738.0,Patient,"I, for a reason."
741.0,Provider,And now they're.
15738.0,Patient,Just like oh i'm a mess.
741.0,Provider,"Well Okay, but how, why are you allowing us to steal your peace. Because the reality is that you have looked it up and down dear."
15738.0,Patient,"I know, but I was still a nervous wreck Ellen I don't know what to expect I don't know. I know."
741.0,Provider,I know. And you're.
15738.0,Patient,"crazy. And I have gotten there's like six felony ones, I mean it's crazy."
741.0,Provider,"Yes. So i'm in there, I understand that I understand that."
15738.0,Patient,"I don't know what's gonna happen and so i'm just i'm scared i'm nervous I don't know what to expect because i've never been to anything like this before in my life. Right now, I mean jail like. i'm not gonna go to jail."
741.0,Provider,"Well okay. Let me ask you this, how are you planning to have you have you devise a plan to handle this."
15738.0,Patient,"I don't know how do I don't know what I don't even know where to start, I mean like I started like trying to figure out, you know. Like you know I sent us an email about a letter of recommendation i'm going to write the judge myself I started right the judge myself like explaining to him that. You know the things that happen in 2014 is not the same person that I am today like I don't even remember so much of that year. of my life, because all I did was, I mean that was the year that I got really, really, really bad strung out on heroin. I was doing heroin so bad, and I was mixing it was nerve pills, I do not remember so much of that that part of my life, and so I mean i'm going to write the judge Julie, sending a letter you get a letter from you."
741.0,Provider,And I made it.
15738.0,Patient,worse for.
741.0,Provider,"me caution you okay don't tell the judge, any more than you have to."
15738.0,Patient,write.
741.0,Provider,"I know hell don't tell them anything about. What you were doing in 2014. Tell them about what you've done the last three years. Okay Okay, because. You can say look I don't even live in that county anymore."
15738.0,Patient,I don't and I have it like. vin changed up.
741.0,Provider,"Even I am you know just say I don't even have you know I contact my mother and my. Children and that's it. Yes, and that I don't have any business down there okay now that's, the first thing the second thing is, you need to plan when you're going to go turn yourself in. And I know that sounds like crappy things, but you need to do that, you need to take responsibility and go turn yourself in. yeah no that's okay yeah arraigned. and have a court appointed attorney before you go to court. On the 23rd. Now, the one thing that is kind of tricky about this as. You want to be able to be released on your own recognizance."
15738.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,sure you don't have to spend too much time in the jail and the county jail.
15738.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,So that in and of itself is you're gonna have to pray yourself up. Take Jesus by the hand and go for it. And I know it. sounds like crap but.
15738.0,Patient,"Oh, I know I know that's what that's I mean I mean."
741.0,Provider,Because it's a risk.
15738.0,Patient,"For today I know that's what I have to do, like, I mean I went and bought a new White brawl I went and bought white panties and everything, because I know that this is what I have to do, but like. I don't know I mean should I do it like I didn't want to sit in there forever my coordinates to 21st."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. So I. Am. on the phone okay so. All right, so."
15738.0,Patient,"Online whenever I go ahead online whenever I look up like my name on the common pleas thing and it shows, like all the charges and everything and I scroll down and it says like next court date scheduled is December 21 at 1030. So. If I go turn myself in before that and I go to court, then, do you think that i'll be able to sign my own bond, then, to get out."
741.0,Provider,"as possible. And But OK, so today is the seventh the 21st is exactly two weeks from today. Okay. i'm. Personally, I would not wait until the 23rd. I will go. See is kind of a it's a gamble. You know you're gonna really have to put your faith in God and walk in there, knowing that god's got your back and he was going to take care of you. Okay. you're not going anywhere and one of the things that will be. to your advantage. is to walk in there and turn yourself in before the time that you have to. write this is a testament to the fact that you're not running away from this and you're not going anywhere now."
15738.0,Patient,"I don't want them to think that i'm running away just because I live a couple counties over i'm not running from them, I haven't never. You know. Physical contact listen, so I don't want them to think that i'm running that's like that's, the last thing that I want them to think."
741.0,Provider,"Well that's why i'm saying, if you go turn to yourself and fall for the 23rd like wait till next week. Go to group. then go turn yourself in after group. Yes, you may have to pay it, you may have to stay in jail over the weekend until the 21st. But you may not. You may not have to. Because they may they probably will go ahead and at least a rain you. understood and set bail. Or let you out on your own or cognisance plus they'll also assign you an attorney."
15738.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,Does that do young generation what what i'm talking about now.
15738.0,Patient,yeah yeah like I like I said I just don't i'm not familiar with the whole I just know that like.
741.0,Provider,whole process yeah.
15738.0,Patient,"yeah the whole process, the whole arraignment the whole pre trial as a whole."
741.0,Provider,"I don't ya know that the first thing that they're gonna do is they're going around you and set bail or not set well and also assign you an attorney okay. Then, once they've assigned you an attorney a problem you know once you've requested and probably attorney. and depends on the Court sometimes they let you meet with your attorney before they set your bail sometimes I just said it Okay, but either way when you talk to the judge inform the JET i've turned myself in I live two counties away, I am not going anywhere. I want this dealt with and I want to handle. Okay, you know you just have to let them know that you're you're not afraid because you are in the right."
15738.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,And that's the truth.
15738.0,Patient,I know.
741.0,Provider,That statute of limitations has run out. Your you have your life together. And there's no reason for them to parachute at this point.
15738.0,Patient,I mean like.
741.0,Provider,I don't really know.
15738.0,Patient,"it's crazy it's oh hold on okay yeah it is super crazy to me, but like I said I mean, I know that, like god's in control of all of it, I know that he is but the unknown is what just."
741.0,Provider,"Oh, I know."
15738.0,Patient,I know that I control and my brain don't stop ever.
741.0,Provider,Right right.
15738.0,Patient,"I know asked, since I found this out like it has been really bad."
741.0,Provider,"What is that what if. What if what if what if and coming up with all. kinds of horrifying stereos and, but I can tell i'm talking to you as somebody who's been there, done that Okay, the first. thing we're going to do is they are going to they're going to charge you they're going to take you in they're gonna they're gonna fingerprint you. they're gonna do all of that stuff Okay, and that stuff is going to be an assault to your pride okay i'm not gonna i'm not gonna lie to you, it will but. You will go before the judge. And he will Lorraine you at that point, you will get an attorney and they will set bond. Like I said when he asks about the bond. ask if you could please be released on your own cognisance that you're not going anywhere that you turned yourself in."
15738.0,Patient,"Okay, so he'll say something about the bond to like my attorney or say something to them about the bond to me."
741.0,Provider,"Well, it depends on how they handle it if they assign you an attorney he'll talk to your to your attorney. Okay Okay, but. Sometimes you know the DEA. Is they're pushing for a bond, and you don't even have an attorney get assigned to you, yet. Okay okay so plus if it's a low bond, you can get out. If it's a personal reconnaissance and yeah you'll walk out. right but, but you still have to go through the arraignment process Okay, and it would be better if you could have an attorney walk in there with you, but if you can't afford one you can't afford one."
15738.0,Patient,Right I just don't know I mean I can't imagine like what one would even.
741.0,Provider,It would most my time.
15738.0,Patient,"yeah and most of the time, like I know. Most of the time they don't do payments and stuff they want everything up front. yeah i've known one attorney that would do like that done payments in they are no longer around here anymore, so I wouldn't even I mean there would be no way that i'd be able to come up with a couple thousand dollars to hate somebody just. You know, and that will just even be the beginning of it."
741.0,Provider,there's just like let's just the retainer yeah. And and incremental cases they generally want all of it up front.
15738.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"Or at least half of it to begin and then the other half was in a you know, a short period of time, just because if they lose, then you they don't have any way to get paid. Right, you know and but the reality of it is, is that. You don't really need tammy I mean this is craziness."
15738.0,Patient,"The hell that's what i'm thinking like I could see I mean like I said, if it was last year."
741.0,Provider,"Well, they may not even around you. They may not even around you, because when you go in there with your ID and it says, you are not 30 years old, you are 37. Then they're going to find the discrepancies and figure out they've messed up."
15738.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm thinking because i'm thinking like yeah they would have if if this would have been last year, or whatever year before then they probably they could have had me but. Like they waited too long to file the paperwork i'm pretty sure that's what what happened because then diamond was just filed last week and, like I said it says that i'm 30 years old from wheelers bird. i'm 37 about to be 38 in June of this year and I haven't lived in wheelers working like I said three years."
741.0,Provider,"yeah and. You know that's that's strange that because, is there a date on the offense is it listed on the fence and."
15738.0,Patient,"I don't know i've never i've not seeing any of the. paperwork, besides what I can look up online where it just says, all it says is the date that the indictment was filed. which was last week but."
741.0,Provider,I well that's too late.
15738.0,Patient,But it still says like I said it still says that i'm 30 and I know that this stuff that they're going back on like. What like like I said it happened in because they were working for the doctor's office in Portsmouth and she no longer she quit working for that doctor's office in August of 2014.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
15738.0,Patient,"And that was the last time, so this like July and August of 2014 was the last time. That anything anything happens so i'm just saying like there's just there's no way."
741.0,Provider,Right right so it's like way their way out of out of their league.
15738.0,Patient,"Exactly I would have had it would have had to done it violates August of 2020 and it's going. To be 2022. Right well i'm hoping and praying like I like I said I prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed i've looked it up every way that you can possibly look it up and i'm hoping and praying that that's going to be the outcome. But I also want to have everything lined up and everything in a row, just in case that that doesn't happen to be the outcome, I want to have all my stuff lined up to prove to them that whatever happened in 2014 when all this stuff took place that that's not me anymore."
741.0,Provider,"Right right okay and. I will email you a letter just stating that i'm your therapist and that you are in actively participating and treatment. that's, all I can say I can't say anymore, and I won't say anymore unless a core has me. See I didn't see that in the room and subpoenas me to turn over my record switch. I mean, of course, it has to order me to do that a judge has to order me I won't do it otherwise. Okay, so."
15738.0,Patient,I don't think I don't like.
741.0,Provider,telling them anything i'm not telling them nothing other than you are participating and actively participating in the treatment programs to bright heart right and that's all i'm gonna say.
15738.0,Patient,"Right yeah that's what I just wanted something just that way they know that I am willingly participating in recovery and that I have been. And that you know. Like I said I just I just want them to know that i'm no longer, who I was whenever all these offenses took place."
741.0,Provider,"well. First, I want you to be careful about. owning those charges okay. don't admit to anything don't say anything ever van I no longer reside in this county I am turning myself and be careful about what you say okay don't don't acknowledge that you did the crime."
15738.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,i'm not gonna okay.
15738.0,Patient,i'm not guilty of any of that.
741.0,Provider,Because the person that you are today is not guilty of that.
15738.0,Patient,"I know I know that's what that's what I was, I was talking to another friend of mine i'm like i'm really not like you know but man it's just it's crazy I just I don't even know what to say about anymore."
741.0,Provider,"So scary as a scary situation and I I don't blame you for being petrified. But you have taken every at every you've taken every precaution you've researched it. says so, this is what will happen, you will go in and you will turn yourself in they will around you. After they they will book, you will okay i'm not going to because i've got a fingerprint you give you a mug shot all that stuff and they're going to take you in to see the judge at that point you request a public defender and. request to be released. On your own recognizance based on the fact that you turn yourself in."
15738.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And that you are not running or avoiding this issue.
15738.0,Patient,And i've not had any contact with him since any of this none none.
741.0,Provider,"And I wouldn't you know I wouldn't even, I would just say you know i'm not going anywhere and. So this has no bearing is, as I turned myself and how long will it be before I get to see the judge. um well that depends on when you go. Okay, but the earlier in the day that you go the earlier in the morning that you go to the better. Okay Okay, because that way you'll be able to see the judge before he leaves for the day. i'm saying."
15738.0,Patient,Is that how they that's how they do it was all the port.
741.0,Provider,Most of them. I mean.
15738.0,Patient,"I figure they're pretty much I mean most of the time, whenever you hear people talk about certain things with Court they're pretty much all the same, so. yeah I just. i'm sure like I say, because on on the thing on the on the Court papers on the common pleas court thing online it just says that the next court date was the 21st so I didn't know if I go in for the 21st if i'm going to be able to see the judge before the 21st. Okay."
741.0,Provider,They have renew and they have to around you within like 24 to 48 hours they can't just keep you without a bond.
15738.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"Well, you have to be you have to be assigned an attorney and you have they can't just keep you without. letting you know what's going on, basically, but that's why I would I would wait until next week, maybe. So that even if you don't get released. i'm. On a personal. reconnaissance bond. That you won't have to stay long. Before the 23rd you're showing i'm saying. I mean yeah I know. That still five days or something like that, but it's not two weeks. Now um but it stands to reason that they will assign you an attorney before the 23rd."
15738.0,Patient,"So, as I go through myself in first. They will sign up to me, before the 21st."
741.0,Provider,"They should hmm. OK OK, I mean like I don't. I mean I don't know anything about your judicial system up, there are the town or any of that or the county or any of that kind of stuff but, for the most part they work, the same way, you know. Some are a little slower because of the amount of traffic through you know, like like I was arrested in Dallas county. Which is in the metroplex in Dallas Texas okay so it's a very large area. Dallas county is a huge. Huge seven story to tower of jail geez okay so. I was arrested. And booked. In a little town where I was arrested, I was arrested in as ever. So I was arrested in books and all of that stuff and then I was transported to Dallas county."
15738.0,Patient,Nice.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know. And they handle all the rest of it from there. Now I wasn't as lucky, I was in trouble, I was caught right here. I mean you know, so I spent six months in County. Because I didn't have no way to bond out or nothing. right but. i'm. At when they arraigned me they assigned me an attorney and they sat my bond. Which wasn't necessarily all that high I just didn't have any money, I have no way to get out."
15738.0,Patient,"sign up. Sign your own or and get out or no, no."
741.0,Provider,Not that time first time I got arrested idea. But not that time.
15738.0,Patient,not have time.
741.0,Provider,"Now, the first time I got arrested, it was literally not my fault and i'm not saying that I wasn't. The charges were not what I was doing wrong."
15738.0,Patient,Right. I got you.
741.0,Provider,um but I did get to assign myself out. I was only in the jail. While I was on crutches. But I was only in there for maybe 10 minutes.
15738.0,Patient,Oh let's just go ahead and get them that's cool.
741.0,Provider,"So, but they know they had planned to live at least me anyway, I wasn't going anywhere. You know at time I had a job there, and stuff and I wasn't going anywhere but. Then I went and got an attorney so yeah. But it was."
15738.0,Patient,It was expensive.
741.0,Provider,"was very expensive very, very expensive, fortunately, at that point in time, I had some money and my parents also it's just but the second time I got arrested my parents, when you answer my phone call. You know."
15738.0,Patient,It happened on yeah.
741.0,Provider,"You know, but. That. It was not. The most pleasant experience but."
15738.0,Patient,"I couldn't imagine being in jail and like a big place like that, like Dallas I mean i'm going to be in jail like i'm inside account like it's going to be in Portsmouth Ohio. So it's soda county so I mean I don't even know how many it's a new correction facility, they haven't it hasn't been built very long ago, but I think it holds like. I think it's like 400 inmates total."
741.0,Provider,yeah it's gonna be like Dallas.
15738.0,Patient,know and i'm pretty sure that that's male and female inmates like i'm thinking that's tops so it's going to nothing and going to be nothing like you know big city or anything like that it's just still the point that it's jail.
741.0,Provider,"Right well yeah I mean you know it's it's a it's an assault to your pride and and your dignity and all of that, but."
15738.0,Patient,"Just I never dreamed especially like since everything has been so different in the last three years and, like my life has really done a complete. You know 360 in the last three years, like i'm a completely different person than what I once was, I mean everything about me has changed, like, I never dreamed in a million years. that this would ever come to haunt me like ever Julie, the first message, she sent me back, she said, this is part of recovery and i'm like. I know what I go on like are you kidding me seven years I said the debt and the devil is still trying to attack and it seems like the more and more and more I prep."
741.0,Provider,"Better you do. And the more you rely on God and the better, and the more he will store. Yes, Satan is after your but."
15738.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, the more i've like i've been reading this like devotional book and it has like Bible verses and stuff in it and, like the more I pray and stuff I noticed the more he attacks on a daily basis, it is."
741.0,Provider,Does it yeah. me who doesn't not want you to believe the truth that you find in the Bible. I know you do whatever he can. To keep you away from God.
15738.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"i've noticed that and. Lucifer was actually a chair up he was actually a cherub and he was created to cover the glory of God. Well, even though he's fallen from heaven he covers the glory of God from us so that we can see god's glory so we're not attracted to God. Okay that's. crazy so he still tries to cover god's glory but. God always wins he always his glory always shines and we are always drawn to him, because what his children. But Satan is so jealous. of that."
15738.0,Patient,And he is so much into this world and everywhere that you turn like the world is so full of Satan it is so sad so sad.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, so it doesn't surprise me that you are experiencing this. Bad, yes, but. This is also one way that God can shine."
15738.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,I know. I know.
15738.0,Patient,"I know, no matter what, at the end of the day, I know that he's got me, I know that he's going to get me through it it's just the unknowns until then like I just I, and I gotta I gotta stop worrying and i've got to continue to pray more, because as long as I worry."
741.0,Provider,You know I mean is he's he.
15738.0,Patient,I know.
741.0,Provider,On your pace.
15738.0,Patient,"To stop. And so that's reason why I talked to Julie about it i'm like I don't know what else to do because it's really driving me crazy and so she told me to start on the lexapro to see if that helps. See I used to be, I was on lexapro once before it's been a few years ago, whenever I was actually doing good at one point and it doesn't really I didn't really good on it so i'm thinking that maybe it might help with my anxiety because it's been through the roof that."
741.0,Provider,yeah well and if.
15738.0,Patient,You that's for sure.
741.0,Provider,Tonight good and I I would. I suggest that you continue to read your Bible. But I also would suggest that every time you start worrying about what's going to happen. about the unknown. Tell God what you want to see happen.
15738.0,Patient,OK. OK.
741.0,Provider,just say you know if it's your will I would prefer to see this happen.
15738.0,Patient,"yeah. So let man all about like. Trying to you know to learn to follow god's will like you know because I already knows them, I will get me know where i've been you know I practice this on a daily basis, I have to start sometimes three and four times a day, I have to start my day over. mm hmm does i've done started on the wrong path and i'm getting absolutely nowhere."
741.0,Provider,"That is, that is."
15738.0,Patient,That i've started catching myself.
741.0,Provider,Right so right.
15738.0,Patient,To notice it like whoa okay hold on we don't have to do this.
741.0,Provider,Much.
15738.0,Patient,favorite start.
741.0,Provider,"yeah right The other thing that you might want to try doing as that every morning when you get up between now and the time you go to turn yourself in every morning when you get up make a list of like 10 different things that you're grateful for. and thank God for the experience, because this is a reminder that number one he's bigger than anything. And number two. This will show his glory when it's all said and done. Yes, it's not enough stuff. i'm sorry go ahead."
15738.0,Patient,"i'm you and Julie, I just take them with me or how should I do that. Like I guess Julie. Julie, said that she sent it to Jamie just you know, like I said it's just because I like I told her, she sent me an email asking me, you know what I wanted her to say I said it's just a letter recommendation just telling them that i'm willingly participating, you know in. recovery and stuff just so they see that i'm not the only one that's saying that i've changed do I mean support and so she said that she sent it to Jamie and that Jamie was going to get a letterhead on it and get it sent to me, so I don't know if she's going to email it to me. Okay okay I wasn't sure. And I just need to try to get those printed out right for my email, I think I can go down to the library and do that i'm pretty sure."
741.0,Provider,"yeah if you go to the library and sign in on one of their computers to your email and then that will print using kinect from there. And and. As your boyfriend going to go for a rain man, will he be I mean like will he be able to be there to help you. Yes."
15738.0,Patient,yeah yeah he's gonna be there with me through free.
741.0,Provider,"I mean cuz he won't be able to go back in there with you, while you're being fingerprinted and all of that stuff, but when it's time to go before the judge he needs to be there with those letter. You know you don't want to take them in because they're going to put them in your property."
15738.0,Patient,"Right okay that's what I was wondering. So you want him to have them write him printed out. not have that way Jason can have them in that way, he can bring them in so he doesn't need to bring them in whenever I go in to see the judge, for the first time. Okay."
741.0,Provider,"yeah well. I will personally I would have multiple copies. yeah So if you have a copy that you can hand the judge. Will during your arraignment but also, and you need a copy, for your attorney when they're when you're appointed one, and then you need to keep one for your record, so I personally would get like three copies."
15738.0,Patient,of each okay. All right.
741.0,Provider,"Just just so that, because you, you may need it, that many times. You never know if you have a copy of it, you can always make more copies."
15738.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"to hand out. But I know for a fact you're going to want to give one to the judge and you're going to want to give one to your attorney. Okay, you may need another copy somewhere else down the line you never."
15738.0,Patient,"Know for the prosecuting attorney or something like that. Okay, so now with my individuals with you i'll be in group. Thursday this Thursday and then i'm probably going to do what you said i'll be in group next Thursday and then i'm probably gonna go take your all this. Time So do I need to go ahead and sign in and see to get to see about getting another individual before the 21st or."
741.0,Provider,It might be helpful for you.
15738.0,Patient,that's what I was thinking.
741.0,Provider,"To kind of help keep you steady and grounded and. and So it wasn't that you would have anything open before then or not. Okay yeah I have openings I have openings. cuz there's a lot of people saying is the holidays i'm blowing it off, and they shouldn't, but they are. Right and."
15738.0,Patient,"And I don't understand why because it helps me so much I don't like. I missed that one appointment, it was seriously like a legitimate mistake, I wrote it down. It was on a Tuesday and I wrote it down for Thursday, for whatever reason. I caught and rescheduled it, but I don't understand why everybody is all about missing counseling because it helps me a lot."
741.0,Provider,"Well, they just don't they haven't got there yet they're just not there Okay, you know."
15738.0,Patient,They will them.
741.0,Provider,yeah they're eventually they will.
15738.0,Patient,"They will realize that I mean I like I said i've had one mess up since January or February 24 of. i've been on subjects okay Well, first, I tried to box in the box and maybe really sick. yeah I started getting somebody takes okay and i've had one mess up since February 24 of 2009. And it was whenever I couldn't find medicine, I miss my doctor's appointment, I can buy medicine and the next day, I was right back calling getting into the doctor to get my subjects back so like I know what it takes, I know what I need to do to continue. And I know that counseling is a big part of it."
741.0,Provider,"yeah i'm. Speaking of which um I need to kind of figure out what kind of goal, you want to work on. Well you're canceling. Like what's important what it what I know, right now, you just want some serenity. haha."
15738.0,Patient,"But other than that, I mean. I don't know Ellen I don't I can't I don't even know."
741.0,Provider,"I can't even think about it, can you."
15738.0,Patient,"I can't no but I will i'll think about it and. Okay, if nothing else, tomorrow, whenever I start i'm gonna start my list in the morning of the things i'm thankful for and doing that and then i'll start thinking about that, and I have a notebook that's for that I write down, like all my appointments and stuff with you."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
15738.0,Patient,"i'll write it down, so my next individual i'll get my notebook out and i'll i'll think of some other things that I want to work on after I get this legal stuff taken care of."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
15738.0,Patient,"Everything because it was my health and my health is still not figured out. You know I still have to go have a bone marrow biopsy done Okay, that is that's now rescheduled for January, but I don't know how that's going to go. And my blood count is still really low they still want to schedule my scope but they can't schedule my scope to go down my throat until my blood count is backup so."
741.0,Provider,Do they know why your blood counts low.
15738.0,Patient,"No. Have no clue event to my regular doctor my regular doctor referred me to oncology, which is a cancer doctor. And then i'm going to the infectious disease doctor because see i'm getting I was getting ready to start taking the medicine for my HEP C. And then waiting on my prior authorization for four weeks now well now that my doctors pushing it my prior authorizations about to go through. I don't know what to do about this situation either I don't know whether to go ahead. and go on, I called left a message on the doctor's office and told him that I had some legal issues going on and I needed to talk to somebody because I can't go over there and get my medicine and start it. And then miss two or three days of it, because that medicine you can't miss it all, and you have to have blood work done while you're taking that medicine, so I can't do that and then worry about being in jail."
741.0,Provider,"that's something else that you also need to make sure that that when you are assigned an attorney you're turning needs to be aware of your medical situation. Because with habsi they don't want to pay for your for your treatment and if you're in their system, then they'll have to pay for it okay. um so that's going to be something that's going to also help keep you out of Chico just just so you know Okay, I mean."
15738.0,Patient,"Okay. It sucks because, like I said i'm supposed to. Go back over there tomorrow, but because i'm having such a hard time getting blood work done every time I try to go to the hospital here in greenville to get blood work done. They have collapsed both of my veins on my hands, they went through I tried to do a cat scan and they got part of the cat scan done through the IV thing and then collapse my vein, in the middle of the cat skin. So they have the hardest time every time I go here, I have to be stuck like 567 different times in the last time I was stuck seven different times and none of them wasn't able to get it anyways. So it was a way to check for nothing."
741.0,Provider,And they need to start using an ultrasound on you to find the vein.
15738.0,Patient,"Well, they had the vein Finder trying to do it, you should have seen her, she was trying to hide she had the needle job in in my arm one way and how old the vein fine or whether chin the other way, I was like oh."
741.0,Provider,My God yeah I know. I go through it every time.
15738.0,Patient,"And facts right a lot of. All that figured out to. yeah on the doctor I left a message today with that doctor, to see what he wanted me to do to see what he recommended that way I. Because like I said I don't want to get that medicine approved to my insurance and then be able to take a couple days worth of it and then end up in jail and not they're not giving it to me, and then I just started all this medicine for nothing and it's like a $30,000 medicine."
741.0,Provider,"Because like I said it's took four weeks and it's still not approved, yet to my insurance."
15738.0,Patient,The doctor said he had to fill out a great big huge pain bunch of paperwork and send off all my bloodwork information to them to try to get it approved.
741.0,Provider,"Right yeah alright, so the medical issues, let me ask you this, what are you doing to support your health medically I mean what are you doing for yourself to support your health."
15738.0,Patient,"I mean, I mean like."

Organic unrefined stevia or a survey or stuff like that. Okay, are low and glycaemic. properties and they're better for. diabetics. Okay, but. yeah just look into it and see their little more expensive obviously like I use I don't use any refined sugar and I don't use any sugar substitutes in my house. So that means that I have to make all of my salad dressing i'm like ketchup and I can't get anything out of a box and. I eat gluten free."

Like a grain like rice like a whole rise like brown rice or long grain wild rice or something like that um or sweet potato. But i've tried to limit, a lot of that that like heavy carb type stuff."
15738.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i've been doing to i've been eliminating a lot of the carbs and stuff just because, at least at least really heavy on my stomach. And then, it makes it feel like it takes forever to digest because I have a hard time digesting everything and anything right now anyways like. Taking forever to go to the bathroom so i've been watching all that stuff but yeah I mean jason's been."
741.0,Provider,"yeah well wait, because if you don't want your gallbladder is bomb."
