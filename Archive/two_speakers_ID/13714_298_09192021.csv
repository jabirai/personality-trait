298.0,Provider,Okay.
13714.0,Patient,And I ended up having to call the police on her multiple times and I ended up having to get a. psychiatric mobile response team. out here to evaluate her and put her on a 5150 holes. And that happened on Wednesday. And yeah so she's in the hospital right now and i'm trying to move and it's been a little stress.
298.0,Provider,I can. yeah yeah.
13714.0,Patient,"So I apologize. i'm really sorry also I don't know why, but I am not getting alerts about our. Appointments I don't know why, and I even put it on my calendar, with an alert for two hours before and it didn't happen, I don't know why i'm sorry."
298.0,Provider,I don't know i'm sorry it's not. Not good with that are you working.
13714.0,Patient,"part time yeah I worked yesterday, the day before."
298.0,Provider,Okay. And are you taking the modafinil.
13714.0,Patient,"I have tried that several times, I still feel like it's too early to say. Because I was. I was new to that and to my GP also put me on a thyroid medication. diagnosed me as subclinical hypothyroidism and one of the two was, at least in the beginning was making me really. irritable."
298.0,Provider,And I don't know which one it was.
13714.0,Patient,"So what I did was, I decided. To keep taking the love of Iraq scene. and see if it helped me narrow down which one was making the irritable. And then, once I got stable on the level, then maybe try them modafinil again so that's where i'm at with that. So, and when I tried them a daffodil I quartered it, so I have a prescription for 200 words and a quarter them into 50s and that's I was using the. The 50 milligram baby dose. And so I don't know if that was making me irritable or not, but something, something that I was, of course, it also could have been over stress."
