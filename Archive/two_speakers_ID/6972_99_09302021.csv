6972.0,Patient,"Honestly don't I think about that. A lot obviously I think about that a lot for you, so I think how does one human take on so many different lives. And I and it's. obvious that you care so you know if you weren't a caring person it's easy to just kind of brush it off and I wondered what you just been carrying how difficult it must be."
99.0,Provider,"Thank you, thanks for your consideration of my well being good yeah it's curious I don't can't really. put my finger on it like a big thing it's just there's something moving through, and I trust that too."

99.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
6972.0,Patient,If you're the person that does need to realize that. yeah you're human. yeah so yeah.
99.0,Provider,"How about you, what would you like to to touch into today."
6972.0,Patient,"whoa. something extremely interesting, as well as back to this situation. But um. Yesterday and, last night I started doing a lot of research on Google and stuff. And I kind of knew where I was going because I. I know I hear those sounds and I know I hear them here and nowhere else. And, but nobody else did so I started thinking what could that be, and so I I looked at that. And you think about like sound waves."
99.0,Provider,"um. No, no it's not something i'm very."
6972.0,Patient,"Well, so I as I ran I was thinking, for some reason, this is where I feel because her air conditioner has these wires coming out of it it's not normal I know it's here, I know that I haven't told nobody this, because then, I really would sound crazy but at night. I hair movement when it starts shutting down each each spot has a different type of music is music rock start calling in your life. Because that's more of what it is, each one has a different type of noise and when the House is quiet and assurance like remember, I told her, I was like covering the the windows and I would think that she wouldn't play, because one of those will cover."
99.0,Provider,yeah.
6972.0,Patient,"I actually I went and I bought some like. Some sound barrier stuff. And I put on the windows and I put it in a few other places, and then was when. I went way down and on my window, I could see what I had put up vibrating."
99.0,Provider,huh oh.
6972.0,Patient,"yeah it was vibrating so okay i'm actually seeing me hearing so each one of these places that I can actually pinpoint. They shut down at night, and I can I can hear movement which makes no sense that's why, when I looked up on my at it, so I ended up downloading this APP. And because what I had read that phone reporter. it's really not that great if it's not great, so I actually don't want one but. I don't know if you can see, I see if you can see it. Anyway, do you see those lines. You see, I can trust it."
99.0,Provider,"No, no, I see it."
6972.0,Patient,"Okay, because i'd like to and I watch if you watch her. And I i'm positive."
99.0,Provider,yeah.
6972.0,Patient,yeah moving.
99.0,Provider,yeah great Teresa so.
6972.0,Patient,"It is. Something this is exact billy what I hear. I can see it. I know, ahead of water here so like the speed of sound and stuff. And so. I ended up walking through the House and the little notes, where I know the music art the sound is not not only you know, there was a real well. But as I walked to the areas that I could hear movement it started just going up and down like I said the same way, I wrote it down as tone is identical there you know when they go up and they go down there later and they changed some it's absolutely what I hear mm hmm so. i'm not exactly sure how she's done it, but you can have like these. These bearings I think they're like a mental thing that actually. bounces back from electricity. Is it one it is it it's a sound wave it's not actual sound, but I think. I think I was probably here, I think it was probably going into my ears before I could even hear it, like everybody else. And I think I think At first it was just a natural thing going on with her, and then I made her mad by asking, and then I got the COPs involved it made her mouth and she is mentally ill, and she sits up there. And I can hear her open and close things and i'm. Like I said. it's a sound way and I know I don't know how she has it hook I don't know how she has it hooked up here I don't know how they move, but when I read on it. is actually pulling song that's exactly what I hear is like a pulling up a wire through a wall but that's not happening because i've gone out so many time so I would say it, and it can be this big. You know, it can just be a tiny. thing they did so I didn't get the part where I can but i'm find a way to start blocking it um they said, like the can type thing that you can actually. Actually block. The sun ways. So when I walk around with that I can find out where they're at I know where they're at but I don't know where they're at I don't know sure i'm like well. I don't know is there in my panic, but I don't know if I told you that i'm positive she came into my house, because my dog was out. There telling you about that."
99.0,Provider,It tell me that yeah.
6972.0,Patient,"yeah I, and then it got didn't got worse and before all this, I didn't really even lock my doors you live out in. yeah so we're thinking, they are my house do this. there's like a part around the House and there's these vince on the outside going around. So i'm thinking, maybe in there, but it's definitely in the air conditioner what got my attention robot is I opened the furnace last night, and it was the last sound going. And um and then I heard that more, but it was the first time I had the furnace open and I was really sharing it, and when I heard the noise in the furnace and it shut off and that seemed just completely went down to normal. I don't know what to do. But she's trying to drive me crazy she and she she doing a damn good job and I do believe my ears are messed up because I mean you can only listen to these pitches of ours. And all these different types of sounds in your brain i'm hearing and when I go to him, I hear a different type of sound now I can even send you the link and everything but um yeah."
99.0,Provider,"So so. sounds like you're you're you're investigating you're figuring stuff out you've got like some tangible. Proof that there's something going on, so now what Theresa i'm just wondering what is your next step, because I am."
6972.0,Patient,"I don't know I really don't know that's Ross Cameron so. I can't live with the domini I cannot continue to live it. Last night before I got that. I was looking at prices of sound barrier that have like some barrier curtains and stuff like that, and then they actually have these things that you can put down into the pipes. See Anthony was up there, and I have sources, we take. take these. pieces of cloth I have, I said you put them in the and it brought it down everything I kept putting up as a barrier, it would go down."
99.0,Provider,"it's hearing it when he's with you and you're saying here it is he's not hearing it. No Okay, so that just tells me that there is something going on sure it's happening, it is definitely happening and there's something physiologically to have you made a doctor's appointment yeah."
6972.0,Patient,"yeah I went to the lab and how to run around because I didn't get all the lab work and blah blah blah blah blah. And i'm going to talk to you, they sent me a letter yesterday from from. income support and on there they put a code and I looked up the code and it's kind of like a an investigation of the amount of money, I claimed."
99.0,Provider,Oh shoot.
6972.0,Patient,"not claim that that money I didn't claim it they've never done it before, but I had a feeling they work as a governor said they were going to start putting income support stuff with childcare assistance, because they're kind of the same thing you get food stamps or electricity. medicaid and try care assistance, so what."
99.0,Provider,Were what you were worried about was what.
6972.0,Patient,"Is gonna happen it hasn't come in, yet, but it's going to learn to and then. You know I don't know what i'm going to do from there. I work really hard and getting my taxes done because. With my taxes done I I have enough right off to get it. Down look down, but you can make like 1300 dollars a month. So I don't know what i'm going to do, and it is a stress it's a big stress. Both of these things are stressful because. Anthony hasn't seen the thing yet. I don't think she believes me. Either he doesn't, believe me, or he's just tired of dealing with it. could be but it's because it's like I told i'm living it. you're not living it you're just hearing about it you're not in the middle of it, you know live and work in it, I it's hard on me."
99.0,Provider,"yeah So what are you feeling, as he told me this."
6972.0,Patient,"very emotional. angry, because the COPs told me, I was on drugs and like so like I could turn to the COPs I was like okay. I mean unless somehow she knows when people come into my house. that's why I came to this part of the House and server in my bedroom it's just when you get well sure I don't know, but she knows somehow it goes down, I hear it go down. So."
99.0,Provider,"Are you able and willing to leave your home for like I don't know if you can do this, but for a week to do an experiment like maybe go state anthony's a few will be so kind as to have you and see if this. If it happens somewhere else, because i'm not I don't know what's going on, I just it does concern me that Anthony cannot hear it, I believe something's happening, do you are experienced something that's something that's real."
6972.0,Patient,"The thing is, I, I think, possibly. i've been living with it and not hearing it for a long time that's what I think just the same as everybody else, and then, as it continued on and on and on, without me hearing it. It has actually. interfere with my ears. And my arrows are very sensitive to almost everything now I mean you could drop a pin and I can hear it."
99.0,Provider,"yeah, so I am wondering if you can, if you can, if anthony's willing to have you at his place for maybe even four days to give you enough time where you're you're settled in and and see if this happens somewhere else to."
6972.0,Patient,But I don't feel say.
99.0,Provider,You don't feel safe.
6972.0,Patient,Right sure. She she I don't have enough and instantly. feel.
99.0,Provider,You don't feel safe that she was moving home.
6972.0,Patient,Leaving my. job.
99.0,Provider,Because her so.
6972.0,Patient,"I even have to I. have to prove it to yourself, because. Like I said that thing is you exactly to the point, and I know where the areas are, and I can walk over to it, and he just thought I walk away from I am I, I took I took a screenshot for Anthony and I walked from my room where it was. And I walked over her kidneys room and, as I walked in that Lor Lor Lor alright, so my kidneys are barely barely even move it and then I said okay i'ma walk back that way and it did the same thing from lower higher higher. Because it's in domain is in my room and in the place in my garage area."
99.0,Provider,I just don't I don't know like what if it's some electrical thing or. You know the air conditioning vent or something that is is causing that to go up.
6972.0,Patient,"it's just really hell of a thing is i'm trying to I turn the air conditioner if I turn the fans off I turned off any source oh nuts. And I made sure every source of noise I turned it off, let me. What I need to be honest with you. As someone to. Trust me enough that i'm saying no. There on time what's happening I don't have anybody. No one that trusts what's happening so I feel very alone. feel very, very, very young. And that's what I need I need somebody to say. I trust you. You you you've been doing your homework you bear you know, posing go so you've been doing this stuff and no you actually bought it. Exactly what I hear it's not like I was writing to know some more it was. It was it I didn't read about how it can be done."
99.0,Provider,It really so you really want to be trusted you really want to be trusted in my. So so let's let's get past this Theresa Is this the first time that you've ever struggled so hard with not being trusted around something that you're experiencing.
6972.0,Patient,yeah I guess so for always kept stuff to myself.
99.0,Provider,one.
6972.0,Patient,So it's not really maybe because i'm a founder like I have So what do you have like that you don't. You don't really share.
99.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So, so this is a really you know vulnerable and confusing situation that you're sharing and you're not being you don't experience that you're being fully trusted so. let's go back again is there has there ever been another time in your life when you chose to share really vulnerable about some confusion or something that you weren't clear. or no, it sounds like you're clear what what maybe not understanding what's happening fully and you haven't been met with. The validation."
6972.0,Patient,I don't think so.
99.0,Provider,"hello, so this is."
6972.0,Patient,"This I don't think i've ever experienced. Anything that i'm the only word. That word here yeah my kids have told me that they here. yeah they in fact they came running to me, and they said there's there's crazy music or there was creating music when you're over there. And so I actually had mckinley walk outside and that's where I heard, I heard the sound it but. But nobody else can. And that's what that one thing does it takes it takes away all the outside, noise and, like the air conditioners, and stuff like that."
99.0,Provider,"Teresa do you see how it could be difficult for. You or Anthony to be able to really get what you're saying when you're telling me no one else can hear it, but I can. Yes, yeah and I, I actually I fully believe that you're having an experience I just don't know what's going on it's confusing to me and i'm not there, I can't validate or not, you know anything so it's it's really."
6972.0,Patient,"All I couldn't. I heard validate it before I didn't have. No understanding of it at all. I feel I know with what I read in that it's easy to not normally set up to be done now that's that's a totally different thing it's not normally set up to be done, but if. it's easy to be done. You know, like maybe on accident or something. Also here what I one of the things I I will i'll just send it to you and see what could be is okay, whatever these things are that move. And then, when they move they go off well there's nobody up there and see I can see, because to me it's not actually absolutely amazing and I gotta say with the flashlight and everything I stayed inside. What I Ocean is. How lower than. I trust you would do it that I do 100%. But how I don't know."
99.0,Provider,You trust what.
6972.0,Patient,"I trust 100% that her only entertainment is to sit over there and. and see me go bonkers because it is, I mean it's, not that I don't you know stop a few minutes ago she was doing something in. What it sounded like was and i've heard this before like what are those those big big nails like will type deals, or like hold on a tick type thing you know, one of those it was metal. or her hitting it and I could hear it going into the growl and we were right beside each other, and I very common said essentially. Dear Do you realize. That my house is not just my house. I said, my house is full of children. I said children that their bodies are just starting to develop. I said, there are 234. Right now, with me here this House. They could be they could be. You know, they can be their ears can be damaged ever tell me why you would do that, to a child, I said, you know those children here. And I said, you know that's not the person I met I said you've always been so kind and always been so nice to my kids. I said so, if you have something wrong with me and it was this force but lauer if you have something wrong with me, I understand that. But I said I don't understand that you will continue to do it when you do, you have children, this House, and then I said, you know what I know you're a good person, and I said I know that you're a parent person. And I will go ahead and continue to pray for you, because I know this person I know it's not who you are, and then I say goodnight says he walks in and shut the door, and that was almost exact thing I said to it. And I can still hear her right inside she stopped the hammer, but she was doing something cuz my air conditioner with making noise that's what maybe go out there. I don't know."
99.0,Provider,"So I don't I don't think I was totally clear what happened with the lab work, did they do it, or no."
6972.0,Patient,"Well, there was two separate things of rock supposed to be done. And I went in. I guess the lady taking the blood was having a bad day because she would not correspond with their own and I kept asking her I said, you know I have. two pieces of lab work and there's supposed to be seven seven different tests done and I said, are you sure you got the boat that you pay per second only see one paper there, and she just turned around she walked out issue that because she already are, so the doctors. nurse called me on Monday. And they said well Vance with my thyroid and stuff and I said oh I answered their questions and I said, but what about other stuff I said I have concerns. about the urge each where she was one of the things I said, remember, we talked about the other senate papers and she has oh yeah I do, but they didn't do him. So that day afternoon, I went back down there and I got the rest of the lab work done. I know from Friday to Monday, they have enough time to get it to the doctor. from Monday. to Wednesday I haven't heard anything but it was Monday about 530 at night. So, but I did ask them to take. I didn't want just boy chicken or one urine samples taken I said I definitely want my kitty area she looked at."
99.0,Provider,"me, you asked so you requested, all this, but you haven't Had it done you."
6972.0,Patient,know I have had.
99.0,Provider,have had it done okay.
6972.0,Patient,"Whatever works in the lab I told I asked the nerve pills before they told me they couldn't do a urine test there, but I talked to a different person. And she told me yeah we go ahead and do that, and you could just do it, while you're there and I said i'd appreciate that, because as soon as the better. So I took the rest of the lab work and I checked the urine test that I haven't heard back from them and if I lose my hair shirts on it's on the 30th."
99.0,Provider,uh huh.
6972.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"And what do you what what was worked out with bright heart health if you do lose your insurance, what did they say, would be the next step."
6972.0,Patient,"Are you said was. A hurry. Oh, we see that you've been extremely compliant with everything throughout the entire year and your therapist asked if there was any other sources. He said I can't really say anything, right now, because we don't know, but he said, if you lose it we're behind you 100%."
99.0,Provider,it's pretty vague.
6972.0,Patient,"And that's extremely vague, but that that's what's all of it."
99.0,Provider,Okay okay well let's cross that bridge if and when we get there. gosh so i'm curious Theresa because we've been working together for.
6972.0,Patient,over here yeah. September right so yeah we've been working together yeah.
99.0,Provider,"And the the issue with the sound has been a more recent thing, and I am hitting this point where i'm wondering what do you want to get out of our sessions regarding. This because I feel like we're kind of at a like i'm like we're hitting a wall with it, you know."
6972.0,Patient,I don't know what else right now are just with this there's nothing you could do. mm hmm another more I could do mm hmm but to have somebody to talk to you about it. Really. Nice Andy.
99.0,Provider,"yeah that's what that's what That was my first because I asked myself the question like what what do I think Teresa most needs and it's to be heard, although i'm wondering if it's is it frustrating for you and disappointing that I can't say yes, this is what's going on, I."
6972.0,Patient,"I don't know I told him. I understand. yeah, how can I ask people that. are not. That are not experiencing this to understand it. yeah I totally get that Would I be looking at this every word are yeah I wore."
99.0,Provider,"i'm not actually thinking you're weird or that. I don't think you're making it up either i'm just i'm baffled that what is going on, I believe. That you are experiencing something I. I just i'm it yeah it's hard. it's."
6972.0,Patient,hard to do.
99.0,Provider,More but listen and I guess at this point that's all that you're needing to someone to listen.
6972.0,Patient,"Yes, everybody don't listen. Maybe encourage you, that I work. Leslie to really feeling like. I have made some steps of your study what could be happening. And I feel like with that out. If I can figure out if I will have to get on my own roof, and they have to go into my own as well, so just. blowing it off, but to me that seems like what I would have to do, because I know exactly where the spots are I just don't have anybody like nicer offering to help me, and so it is right now I very bitter and that's because. hey Joe, but this is tearing me up. He knows where to start to me, and he could say. Like the other day he came over, and I have a bottle spray for Eric Mr hill I said it squeaky top of everything else he went and he sprayed it and I said you're up there, I think we look around, to see what. He did. He. yeah he did those things that it was aggravated. This is doing so much to his mother mentally physically emotionally. And he seems bugged because I asked him to go up there it's right there sure he knows where I feel like this stuff is coming from two seconds to look around see if it is, it looks different."
99.0,Provider,"I just wonder, this is totally it could not be true at all, but I wonder if it's becoming like a rabbit hole of mystery and speculation, but nothing concrete to."
6972.0,Patient,I I feel like play D. board exact I I can't make that thing work just to save it as I could write on paper. I. It does it does exactly what I hear.
99.0,Provider,you're giving you better than me right now. you're frustrated with this situation it's becoming exhausting.
6972.0,Patient,"Because it has to stop. poses seem to really care say hey. let's go look let's check it out let's see if we can solve. You know it's not that hard. it's hard for me to scare ensures have to work on one hour, but it's gonna chill out for them and Dubai so."
99.0,Provider,"hmm Teresa i'm worried i'm worried that you're you're at your wit's end and i'm i'm actually worried. That, if you if you know you may try to do some of this on your own and hurt yourself."
6972.0,Patient,yeah. Like crazy to the attic I scared it yeah.
99.0,Provider,yeah i'm concerned with the lack of sleep and everything um. I don't know what to say i'm.
6972.0,Patient,Either I should have cares it. should carry them. To help. This what's happening right now is big time way backwards with him. hey hey hey work backwards. I don't want to talk to her.
99.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6972.0,Patient,"I don't I don't know what nothing to do. yeah. Because oh Oh, should I texted him to say something that i'll say something else that he responds to that. He won't respond to the situation."
99.0,Provider,"Well, I mean the first thought that comes to my mind, is it may be time to reach out to someone else for help, because you're it seems like you're continuing to reach to."
6972.0,Patient,I want to call.
99.0,Provider,what's up.
6972.0,Patient,"I want our normal people right now, I would say the cockpit come in, maybe see."
