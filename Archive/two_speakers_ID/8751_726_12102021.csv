726.0,Provider,"Again, so sorry about that I was running late with my person right before you and if I don't close it and then jump log back and it's it's a."
8751.0,Patient,I was like I was like. I actually went to my other screen and i'm looking at something and i'm like. I closed out. And I noticed the other window closed i'm like. Oh. What did I do.
726.0,Provider,"No, no you're good you're good. How are you."
8751.0,Patient,i'm here.
726.0,Provider,yeah I was surprised I put it on something for you to be part of that chronic pain for the nothing to take.
8751.0,Patient,"You a. Day said I had to. See the. came back amy I think. hello, I. switch or whatever I. Say actually had an appointment, for me it was like. I did my group last Wednesday after group I got an email, I guess, they got. They got that they were going to try and set up, we set up an appointment for Thursday morning the next morning. yeah and. had one of those nights where like I didn't really sleep somewhere around 6am I think I like kind of passed out. Well, I got up, I was wait for that appointment, if I can't even remember, but I did I went straight to my Western a written out for things I had to do. Because I had to go to the bank before automatic payment yet. So. I. went ahead and followed by West I didn't even look at the calendar and i'm like hi shane. I now, I have another appointment scheduled but it's like the end of the month. yeah I. I tend to when I do make it out, I tend to overdo it, because I try and accomplish things that has needed to be done for a long time. And I try and jam, the law when I can't. I pay for it for a long time i'm still not I only slept like an hour last night. I was, I was kind of nervous about being awake. Okay, you know to be hearing you know 10 o'clock in the morning, my tech. She seemed awfully wait kind of weird to complain about a 10 o'clock meeting but."
726.0,Provider,"No it's Nice, not everybody yeah. Man I think it's more than that."
8751.0,Patient,In my own natural time scheme i've actually a night person anyway so. yeah always have a high functioning better that way.
726.0,Provider,"yeah. I think, also like if we have a lot more nights available like just in general for to work with people and everything I think a lot of people would do a lot more night sessions, because during the day everybody's working doing something so it's."
8751.0,Patient,"hard to get these appointments. Well, it is all those things you have to do. You have to do during the day. yeah but people work. yeah but that's not when real people want. that's the schedule so. There you go you go to the bank you gotta be there by three to. get your deposit in. You know it's just that. sort of mentality and and then you know you tack on. You know, not being out as as often is no normal or whatever. And you try and. Put in extra things into those into those. days when you do make it out. start the cycle over. Where you end up at home for a couple weeks not accomplishing things that get added to the next list that you have to overdo."
726.0,Provider,well. Tommy haha has it been that password two weeks since I saw you.
8751.0,Patient,Oh last week's been recovering from lay out a. Little stressful and. Had a little computer glitch that kind of freaked me out. Because my PC my current good PC the one that actually functions enough to do all of this stuff. is like. 11 years old.
726.0,Provider,"Well, if it's still working that's pretty good."
8751.0,Patient,"yeah right I. have replaced a couple parts on it, but. I got rid of most of my. Books to my collection of parts and stuff. Previously, and I don't have anything modern anyways like now so new. new architecture and stuff like that, and then be a yeah it had a little hiccup the other day, they kind of freaked me out because. it's kind of my source to the outside world at this point. When I have a have an iPad I have my phone, but I can't see those screens. It is too small i'm too old for that."
726.0,Provider,"So you could connect probably you know what those big screens for computers, now they are like even a TV now I think USB I think if you connected with your computer or what's your something now you get the big nice big screen. Instead of the tiny."
8751.0,Patient,thing I have to monitor wow three monitors. Set up in front of me there's there's actually. Like six screens set up in front of you yeah rolling up but.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"But I have, I have like a 24 inch monitor area that I use for like normal stuff and then I have my 32. it's not as high resolution I mean it's like. 10 ATP monitor but."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"it's just Bay, so I use after like my videos or games, or if I had to like actually read something I can put it on the bigger and then increase the text as needed I can make it as big as I want and not lose screen. As the problem with smaller screens you make a big you only get like one word on the screen. You can't read a sentence that way. too big too big minor helps with that. I need to I need to get my eyes checked. there's something going on with the division in addition to the headaches and stuff. there's something else going on with with hat. Like beyond the. Beyond the pain participation, and I think there's some loss. Of course crusade they can't they say what's actually wrong with my eyes in in junior high my eyes over converged 10 degrees, or something as now, is there a gave me bifocals. In seventh grade I got bifocals. 10 years after that I guy. Take a fall guess. prescription glasses. And I got these these words actually got. Nine years ago. And they're basically coated readers their prescription reading glasses, when I went back that was that was what they came up with was. You just need readers. So I went from junior high with bifocals to slightly better than readers down to readers but. Those days are long. Day and they're not even like strong readers are like one X readers. Now I I think I need a little bit higher strength. yeah just for normal stuff but I. had trouble with focus like. It came in both senses of the word. Concentration side of focus. yeah whatever else right. Any. Longer reading I mean I kareena sentence and sometimes if it's a long sense I can like. we're out before I get to the time. Like the eyes just stop wanting to focus so that's."
726.0,Provider,"The things that you could get tested to the past, I think what's it a blood test or some sort of tests that you've had gone to get yet."
8751.0,Patient,"I use this there's still an order for for some blood work for. The natural path is not once. But it with with my disability case still pending. I don't. If I don't have anything scheduled with her anyways just because. she's. I can't make her my primary care, and I can handle throwing another doctor and Max."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8751.0,Patient,I it's already i'm already balancing all these different appointments different things sort of different hoops to jump through it's.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
8751.0,Patient,it's a little much. Adding adding extra. yo regular doctors it onto the scheduling.
726.0,Provider,i'm just gonna look on your chart because I know you have another doctor. yeah. Did you could schedule with amy I know. yeah we oh OK.
8751.0,Patient,I got I drove it's like the end of month.
726.0,Provider,"yeah the 27 okay was that that's good film, because I think, maybe when you meet with her um then that's something where you could join us, be a part of that group just because I remember our first meeting and you were in such pain and I was like you need to be in a chronic pain group."
8751.0,Patient,"yeah. hey. hey. hey there's there's definitely something something to be said for. Having some. Similar experience people in the group. is actually. manny manny wasn't there this week, I guess, he family issue or something yeah so Chatel actually ran the group, this week, and she did it more like. more like a traditional group. Basically, which is basically everyone's muted, except whoever's talking. And everyone was sort of one, at a time. yeah not really a lot of. open city back from the group which is. To me, what group is supposed to be. yeah she she just ran and sort of more open forum group, and that was kind of cool. I. don't I don't know if it would work on a regular basis with that group of people, but the concept in the style of of group as far as online was very interesting."
726.0,Provider,Was the topic that was discussed.
8751.0,Patient,"Well, we usually start off we do highs and lows of the last week. So everyone sort of does a round Robin on that and then. It was. Basically. problem resolution. Recognition recognition of the problem and. Who do you go to how do you solving. That kind of thing."

726.0,Provider,Okay we're having kids.
8751.0,Patient,"Well then, there was one legal. possibility and they. Either either i'm not or she dropped."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, oh."
8751.0,Patient,"It was there was a blood test courts involved in a blood test something happened with the blood tests, they had to retest and then I never heard anything. The case was dropped or. Whatever so. But now I know that no just just for kids."
726.0,Provider,"must have been really difficult for you and your family, though, because you know. That haven't at the age of 10 having that happened and then. Also, when when your parents passed does she come around at all, or because it sounds like you took care of a lot of their things."
8751.0,Patient,"yeah I I I was always the one. mom was diabetic. and not a very good. Like she she was she was not good at managing or butcher. I, and these there's a lot of these incidents that. Can I add into like what I what I think it's probably part of the ptsd stuff I mean I thought my mother passed out unconscious on the floor several times. and Like had to save her life literally. And that started when I was like four. As the earliest I can recall having an answer and I was like four years old. yeah and and saving your mother's life at four years old. shouldn't be a requirement."
726.0,Provider,yeah no not for. Did you refer to any work any trauma work in the past or.
8751.0,Patient,We.
726.0,Provider,Like i'm in the past to jennifer's seek out there before the trauma.
8751.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, no, I I come from. como white middle class wish they were better off than they were can't admit anything. In high school I had some behavioral issues. The school wanted us to do, family counseling. yeah which was probably really good they probably have noticed something. yeah and we went there, of course, it was all the bullshit you know blab blab blab blab back to it back for us here's your money to buy. It there was no therapy, there was no we didn't actually talk about anything. yeah there was no yes my mom yells all the time there wasn't. There was no yes my sister had a nervous break. hey that didn't think about. It did dating there was no discussion of relations. Everything was. swept under the raw. History junior high. This is when everything sort of came out, which was conveniently like a year and a half after. The incident that I sister ended up being all the way for. They started testing me for learning disability trying to figure out what's going on. Oh good find it defining I mean I literally went from. In like fourth grade I tested at college plus reading level vocabulary. 12th grade math level for me, I was way ahead of the curve in fourth grade. By seventh grade I was way behind. I mean I I literally I walked and talked in nine months old. And I didn't talk like ball with Bob I said thanks. Have a good debate story was my first word was big red ball cleaning at a sunset. That was my first word with us. With an action and and. I like. What happened. yeah if I if I had it all together, like that what happened. so drastically they."
726.0,Provider,can happen.
8751.0,Patient,That between yourself fourth and fifth grade. junior high. really good two three years in there. What happened.
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"hey. Best as I can figure between that and then. by bicycle answer, where I screwed up my knee. Those are the only two like major things that happened in that time frame at all. And they. wanted to do the. learning disability testing before I had actually messed up my knee so I know that part of it so like. When it comes back to childhood at that. Were between you know it's a mom and her health and. And you know the patty say. I like Okay, so now i've got that. yeah but I mean I. What do you do with that you know I mean. yeah i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure my sister doesn't really read that for the audience. I mean. I was. Over 40 years ago and she was that they're good mental State then so have both my parents are gone so I mean all I have what I have for pieces of memories and. All the stories that i've heard from different people who've heard it from different people. say my mom my mom is want to. The base story and usually correct. I heard details get fuzzy."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"She tells other people that story. The details tab to change but. is still there, so and I heard that. same base from everyone who knows anything about the story so. Unfortunately, I believe. This situation was when it was."
726.0,Provider,One part that has like cuz You said the pain really started off to your parents.
8751.0,Patient,"Okay, just bring my after. After they passed after mom died."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
8751.0,Patient,"I. I did more to help dad. But there was definitely some sense of relief. She. She was with a diabetes, I mean I don't know how how much you know about diabetes, or whatever, but. She was Type one diabetic for. 5537 years. she's still had her kidneys. she's still at both feet she still had vision alone, she had had a lot of work done under rise. yeah she she was actually part of an original ways around laser eye surgery test group. Oh back to like. The late 70s early 80s. Oh yeah like. She lived a lot longer than she probably should have the way she took care of herself. And I know I pay played a big part of that because I saved your life. At least 810 times. That. I was not. I helped her, I will be saved her life, like she could function and if I had walked away instead of helping her she'd be dead. That guy that saving your life, I mean that's. A rough either I kid growing up."
726.0,Provider,yeah. yeah and how was your dad during that time. How was your relationship that.
8751.0,Patient,"He worked. He work he provided. This. Baby i'd say once a month. Usually on like a Sunday afternoon after week. Go to church come home read the paper. Usually, try and work in a couple hours to try and do something. We tried many different things over the years. We built a flute kites."
726.0,Provider,Nice.
8751.0,Patient,"We attempted different sports, he was not athletic at all. yeah this."
726.0,Provider,sounds like he tried.
8751.0,Patient,"He he tried, I mean. You are six days a week, you know 12 hours again. that's that's right, and I know that I knew what he was doing right."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"I didn't default it. For it. yeah I do, he was provided for us, and I do everything we had was because I have so. I was fine with that I understood the way the world works."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"But yeah after Bob past thanks thanks hey him and I both okay. Without a sort of a sigh of relief that. We didn't have to worry about take care of her. Was that that chapter is finally done and and we both have me, we have more issues of our own."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"shit we probably had been ignoring. For a bar. And we both. had some issues and started going downhill. And I got divorced. Looking at her apartment and. While I was looking. It became more apparent that he was it couldn't be able to live on its own, for very long. So I decided I. will read with him. And then I sort of ended up becoming. More and more caretaker as time went on, rather than just helping out if. It got to be pretty much full time. pretty quickly actually but. It was tough that way where. where he had he had a fall and that's when I noticed. There was a strength to get my arms and hands. say when I could think about and then I was like okay. something's not right. And, but the focus was still on here. And then I. can now come in and they're relieved a little bit of stress that that did seem to do it and i'm like Okay, something else is wrong. And then he died, and then I settle the estate. and clear out the House, you know that and. It just became a much longer process than. It should have been. Because I was losing the strength and the energy and I went direct ties again."
726.0,Provider,"A question for you with all of us, this would like to work on the ptsd. Do you think it has anything to do with your chronic pain as well."
8751.0,Patient,"I don't know I mean, I know I know. there's probably some issues. Related to that that do come into play. With you know everyday life, but they don't know they stop saying. I don't know if there's any answers I don't know if there's anything to be done about it."
726.0,Provider,"Only I only say that because I know that for a lot I don't want to say everybody, because that wouldn't be a correct statement is. For some people sometimes obviously there's the biological reasons for chronic pain that could happen, but there's also. A correlation between ptsd and trauma and chronic pain is later on, as adults and so i'm wondering if, by working on some of the ptsd it might actually help with the pain. I mean it's and it's something that you can think about I don't want you to feel like you have to give an answer right now, you can just think about it and see if maybe it's it could be a treatment goal or."
8751.0,Patient,"I mean and that's The thing is. it's hard to really. figure out where things fit into the grants field, I mean, is it. yeah I do, I have the depression, because of the ptsd. To I have the depression and ptsd either a separate. And you know. Because I also have like there's a lot of. I don't know how long you been around or will but. there's a lot of adoption issues."
726.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"there's one thing about like a private adoption, where you know you don't know the birth parents would. it's how you discuss. It how you break it out, I was told that a very early a chance to talk. and While that's from name for me, I know that. My mother was a type of person who over shared. So she told everyone. I was her special child."
726.0,Provider,me.
8751.0,Patient,"I don't know about you, but back in the day, special children went to. Their. Special special it's. So. yeah her friends that have kids my age. Here that i'm their special side, and then I go to you."
726.0,Provider,For like what.
8751.0,Patient,"yeah like what. Okay, and then, and then there was no. There was jealous my sister's jealousy because I was adopted, there was an acceptance of the family. That family never accepted the most families. as big as they are is non existent in my wife really me. They talk they I mean we never really saw."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. So James just because we're gonna be wrapping up in a little bit, I want to make sure we schedule something, and in two weeks. Would you like to do a similar time to today are you an early bird by any chance, no. Oh that's right."
8751.0,Patient,I could do early. If you meant like early. yeah you meant like 4am no problem I can. I could do that. Anything between 5am at noon. not such a great time. When I passed up.
726.0,Provider,"Well, I have available it's December 22 and it's a 20 Am I think your time it's yeah Pacific time. If that works for you it's up to you."
8751.0,Patient,And o'clock on Wednesday. I can do that.
726.0,Provider,"Because I want to impact. The way you're talking about the adoption, they."
8751.0,Patient,"yeah there's there's a lot of little bits and pieces in that. I know that definitely plays into it, because. I literally. never felt like I had family, the way she made it out to be, and it was like okay. You tell people all that shit but we don't actually live there."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, James I will see you or Jim I should quiet gym because after you put on your screen Jerry I will."
