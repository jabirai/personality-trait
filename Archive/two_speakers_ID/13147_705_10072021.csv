705.0,Provider,"To see that see the school psychologist. yeah I think that for you to get someone that's in person, so she's in person."
13147.0,Patient,"Yes, she's in my school campus."
705.0,Provider,"I think that for you to see her would be beautiful, you know, and then to be able to see to in person, someone to meet your medical needs also. I. That you're coming up with the. chanel side you know style and, yes, I think that that's a good outlet for you to have a counselor at your school and then for your medical part where they can see you more often in person is to get on that you like that's in person close by your House."
13147.0,Patient,"Oh well, we have one we have one her name is. Her name. Her name is serie she lives in bed nice but she's already going to charge me I believe she's done a discharge room because i've been there for four years."

13147.0,Patient,"The Middle hello, we are, we are you know the whole issues already we planned it out."
705.0,Provider,"But good and so continue to maintain that. So you know each each month it's just like chanel hi how are you doing health wise check you got all that down and then, when it's time. Then you can check back and they'll go through again the criteria to come back to breitbart health, to see if you're at that level where it think of it as. Rebuilding right if a house, all of a sudden let's say a windstorm happen and the House is like the Foundation and the wood and everything is falling off you got to rebuild it right. harness to that unknown we're at first you're like oh I don't know about this take that to your advantage and let it let it motivate you."
13147.0,Patient,"All right, oh so anyways we I me and my mom has a question for you. Okay, so I know my school's been having kind of issue with me right now, but the COPs come into the House every single day already so they decide to have an idea about it, so they invited you in it. Okay, and I don't know what the date is, but I know they said it's going to be in November. or October."
705.0,Provider,"October i'm sure now I can take a look, and if I can work that because we know we see people individual If not you could be able, you know, to let me know how that's going. Okay yeah."
13147.0,Patient,there's been there's been COPs come to that also lock so it's getting you. know.
705.0,Provider,"We talked about this last time, and I think you said it was a classmate was sending them and you were I thought you were resolved that no."
13147.0,Patient,"No, it didn't work out we stopped everything."
705.0,Provider,"And when they come out Is it based on our. New taxing people, something that they're having concerns about."
13147.0,Patient,i'm not really sure.
705.0,Provider,"I know i'm sure no one time that you wrote, as you said, I can't take it anymore, and when when that's the statement when we don't have any details and a person says, I can't take it anymore. Then I know, for us, you know because I work with people sometimes that want to harm themselves and."
13147.0,Patient,"Now i'm not like, I guess, I guess, my memory was kind of all."
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I think what it is just having this knowledge, where instead of sending out like I can't take it anymore. You could just say i'm really frustrated because if you say i'm frustrated, a person wouldn't think you're going to harm yourself, they would just know you're frustrated there wouldn't be that question."
13147.0,Patient,yeah. i'm speaking of your belly i've been home three times in a row from school. Already.
705.0,Provider,Okay what's going on with with school and being sent home.
13147.0,Patient,My mom knows that do you want me to bring her.
705.0,Provider,"that's Okay, I want to hear from you, because I want to hear from your point of view of what's going on."
13147.0,Patient,"said that I never have fever, but they said that it could be, it could be a panic attack or co host a show me shaking up side yesterday and and I don't know where it's been it's been hard for me to step on."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, this is one of the things that I think chanel is going to be a benefit for you to get a health provider that can see you more often to monitor your blood pressure and to see. Like if you're shaking to be able to to what's that thing called that you put in your ears, the doctor and they listened to your heart."
13147.0,Patient,Oh doctor.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's like I think it's called a test of scope i'm saying it wrong, but you know what i'm talking about right."
13147.0,Patient,"Yes, I know you said you said it the right way."
705.0,Provider,"that's going to be key because now, they can start to monitor what's going on with you different times of the day and different days of the week and see like really for weeks to be. able to see, you know how you're doing."
13147.0,Patient,So do you want that to happen this month or next month. What you said.
705.0,Provider,About you going to the doctor.
13147.0,Patient,"And sorry. I need to get checked for it, what you said."
705.0,Provider,"yeah what I would like to do is yes, for you to get a new doctor that that has availability to see you, you know in person. And then. And then, because just let them know you want to monitor more if it's a seizure, or if it's a panic attack and to get a little bit closer what's going on right. And they can check your temperature."
13147.0,Patient,"yeah because all the time and went to rolla just is always been a high fever, but all the time, I met so there's no fever. doesn't make any sense."
705.0,Provider,"It doesn't and i'm glad that you recognize that chanel that it's like yeah it doesn't make sense, so in order to start making sense. This is what we're talking about where i've enjoyed working with you, and it has nothing about like you as a person you're beautiful you've been learning all this new stuff, this is about your medical also needs that's what that's why we're."
13147.0,Patient,"already have a heart condition, so I found that already. Okay yeah."
705.0,Provider,yeah it's things like that chanel that in person will make it where they can check on your heart and they could understand a little bit more where they can start to say you know what chanel here's what's going on. yeah.
13147.0,Patient,yeah you want to spend that to my mum that any under Dr some so she understood them so.
705.0,Provider,it's it's up to you chanel if you want to give me permission to talk to your mom and if she's there.
13147.0,Patient,"yeah I give you permission. Okay mommy valerie's on. Okay, I told them what you said, but she's on the phone."
705.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so your mom knows that, at this point you'll get someone in person, and so what will happen is you're going to what's called the discharge process from right heart health and you're going to."
13147.0,Patient,Wait so.
705.0,Provider,"I know it's a weird word just think for right now we're discontinuing working with you, where you're going to focus right you're going to focus on all these other things."
13147.0,Patient,Wait what happens if I changed my mind to stay.
705.0,Provider,"Right now, with the care team show now because we care so much we can't allow you to stay because there's some concerns here we're concerned. You have. Either the medication, the health."
13147.0,Patient,"yeah for that, but occasional about the orange one very cast when I gave me a. I don't know what it is, but they the school nurses it kind of gets me a lot of seizures she sees herself."
705.0,Provider,"And that's where why, for me, especially when I hear that that that's happening i'm like I i'm virtual so I can't I can't help you, which is why I. want you to get that hill that you need. Right."
13147.0,Patient,Because it has to be.
705.0,Provider,"difficult for you, when you don't know when you're not feeling at your best you know with the if it's the the heart or your fever."
13147.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Think of it this way is you're going to get better and better every day you're going to go see someone new they're going to be able to check for different things they might be able to look at medication. For you, that can make you feel even better."
13147.0,Patient,"Okay, then I can come back."
705.0,Provider,"It is a process, and so I want to be very honest with you it's a process so after you would get what we call stable where your health issues are all taken care of."
13147.0,Patient,Okay So what do you mean. Is that for school that you want me to have an eight that's what I mean right for all times.
705.0,Provider,You were seeing a therapist and I think a therapist in your school would be good.
13147.0,Patient,"And then, Michelle all of them yeah. cuz I never because all of a sudden my social worker coops calling for where I want to run and I know you're gonna agree with it as well yourself."
705.0,Provider,"I think again for one on one, it would definitely give me some support, especially if you're saying you've needed to go home several times because of your your more health condition. So I think that that would be supportive and so there's three things that I think chanel that you've talked about i'm so happy you're bringing this up. Okay. One is getting the psychologist that therapist to talk to you at school to school counselor."
13147.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,You want to write that down.
13147.0,Patient,I know I know what to do.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so so that would be the first one. The second one is asked about your one on one aid."
13147.0,Patient,"Okay, I got that one."
705.0,Provider,And then the third. would be to locate an in person doctor.
13147.0,Patient,"Okay, are you talking about a nurse comes to the House and check the blood pressure, you need."
705.0,Provider,"It can be either a nurse, but it needs to be a medical professional that can prescribe your medications and evaluate you so probably if you can go see someone or if they come to your House but seeing someone more consistently. You know i'm in person, so I think those three things are really."
13147.0,Patient,Good at that I didn't really got me really sick. Okay that's why I didn't see you last time I don't know what day that was they got me sick.
705.0,Provider,"Do you still have your list of coping skills to when you do feel Okay, that you can draw from that."
13147.0,Patient,yeah I remember all of them i've been using it and i'm feeling much better than I was before. I haven't been ordering.

13147.0,Patient,One and also do you want me to ask for the IP date as well.
705.0,Provider,"If they have it i'm just now, but it doesn't it, it may be difficult for me to attend, because I see patients pretty much one after the other, but you can let me know when it is and i'll do my best, but i'm just going to be very honest with you, I don't want."
13147.0,Patient,"to marry take over for you. Oh, she can be till it."
