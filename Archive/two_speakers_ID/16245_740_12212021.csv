I just I still have like thoughts in my brain some some in a while. uh regarding like my the people who I love the most so I have those those are coming back and forth once in a while I think it's getting better, but in terms of focusing on one task and then moving to another that's that's an issue still. Okay, but in terms of being a little bit relaxed and I guess, to say a little bit more happier than before, and often you know, try to get back to the normal life, I will say dad is improving. haha yeah that does a good thing, so i'm kind of deciding to go back to work out again, you know getting back to shave and. going out, I think that is.

If you said that some I know if it is then. that's when it turned into a fight when you start to add when you start to agitate the situation that's all the time and turns into a fight. But if you go to somebody and an assertive respectful way and to say respectfully I have to decline."

16245.0,Patient,So that's that's why he got all added up in my brain so i'm trying to kind of you know I got. Everything kind of exploded at something.
740.0,Provider,"and say a lot of times we like to we try to revert to obey Jesus yeah. yeah i'm saying, and I mean that's what we know if I don't know anything new that i'm going to revert back to what was oh. So, so an old behavior, which is to react right but. Excuse me that's not the behavior we trying to. behave watch an exhibit. So to do that. it's just one of the things. That you have to you have to implement for yourself first out. You got to stop exposing your buttons. that's, the first thing. don't be so quick to react all the time, because when you're quick to react you expose your button to people, so they know wordpress. They know what to push. They know what's gonna make you make. Right no one's gonna pay she wow wow because you react every time, which means every time when you read you expose your buttons."
16245.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,try your best to just keep your cool.
16245.0,Patient,"Okay. I never travel with a family or anything it got to that point but. I don't respect kind of stayed silent, I did say no actually there's the same way and I. became that separation, which I liked it. I love that. It became and he kind of understood that oh now he's kind of changing saying no to you know, like he will surprise. But some in while I mean he doesn't he doesn't really call me or anything like that i'm talking about my uncle again and."

740.0,Provider,Which is a good thing when you're putting down.
16245.0,Patient,"Right right that's that's that's a great thing I actually happening so um but once in a while he says stuff that I know. A regular person would just ignore it, you know I can ignore it so that's the problem that I started having I used to ignore things really easily but uh people awards and everything stays in my mind, and how can I get that out. The one because."
740.0,Provider,You you determine whether now what they say is true about you.
16245.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,Either you're going to allow his words to say you are you going to the test from them.
16245.0,Patient,"Okay. You control the feelings, like the feeling like the bad feelings that you get, for example, you're in a school, you were applied to a good school right and some some sort of people have some sort of jealousy towards it. And it will put all this stuff in front of you, so you could trip and not go forwards. They will say like Oh, why don't you like to fly somewhere else instead of like data schools, specifically and. Will after you work really hard after all those years, like four to five years. I mean the words of people could catch at some point affects you and get you more nervous and I want to kind of know how could I get more stronger in terms of. be like Okay, because I usually tell them okay yeah that's why I mean I mean that I don't want to go to I want you asking me to, I just want to continue what i'm doing, but thanks for."
740.0,Provider,Doing i'm.
16245.0,Patient,"Like that's how I respond, but in a long term just stays with me. That that's when I get more angry about it and more angry about us like because I don't communicate it out to somebody so I just get mad at that, and once they repeated again that's when like my brain just goes crazy like I just want to jump out the first."
740.0,Provider,New journal.
16245.0,Patient,"Oh no I don't. Like reading out. No, no we're not an."
740.0,Provider,issue. so glad you're here onto the paper.
16245.0,Patient,"Well, regarding water."
740.0,Provider,"Whatever it is that you keep your head. Like if you're like with the school thing if they say something to you, and in a moment, he was like No thank you i'm good where i'm at. Within, of course, what they said a bother you but you but you just you know, decided to kind of play it cool, but then of course I can't get it out of my head, because it really bothered me will write it down. journal about it."
16245.0,Patient,George.
740.0,Provider,"It is an outlet is a form of a release, because what happens is is that you have read in your head. But then you don't have no place for it to go. put it on paper. I mean you already don't like talking to people to bring on Santa Barbara so i'll put it on. And then we can talk about it. We don't have to if you put it up and and that's the thing if you try to journal. use that as a form of outlet. To to kind of put your thoughts on paper, this really made me mad today. blah blah blah blah blah blah right and then and usually like certain journal entries like I always come out always leave it in the bank. Like i'm just not going to stand in a defeated place like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm going to i'm going to write out yeah it didn't make me mad but i'm not going to stop me. yeah It made me sad but it's not going to hinder me i'm going to use this as me ammunition and i'm a proven wrong, you know i'm saying sincerely and overcome. Some, like it just I usually like whatever it is that the situation is and how about and I usually end with something positive and overcome or sincerely victorious or sincerely whatever. You know i'm saying. It is a just, not just try, if it doesn't work we'll come up with something else, but just try, because you hold so much in your mind you got to go somewhere."
16245.0,Patient,"yeah I have a lot in my brain I gave even though i'm talking to you right now. You told me to write it down, and so I could bring it for you, I was so busy I didn't get a chance to maybe for next session that will definitely give you those. there's so much more complicated stuff down like my uncles and stuff like that that it's been I guess you could say, maybe from childhood. One, it is that i'm I might not be a verb right now, but I know some of those specific small factors are like pushing on on a limit like my brain."
740.0,Provider,Right it put an image or no. Right.
16245.0,Patient,But that's I never heard of that yeah but i'll do that.
740.0,Provider,"i'll get you a nice space, a little journal, you know, mainly type journey know what the liver covers and all that kind of stuff and nine a nice teen and. I mean take out of time, each day in journal I don't you know you can have like a routine some people turn on music some folks like candles or whatever. And then they just get in the spot, turn out they put they found it an hour disturb or whatever, and then they just they just write in a journal, and just kind of released it all."
16245.0,Patient,together.
740.0,Provider,"And I see it, can be about something or can be about nothing at all. It is a form of release and an outlet for you."
16245.0,Patient,"Well, I have a question. toys, my question is, if I am all of a sudden i'm not being more socialized as i've been before because I wasn't. right if i'm not socialize as much as before and i'm doing things that I like to do and I enjoyed doing it, but I spend most of the time at home and i'm i'm more like a nature guy so I love to go into the nature more separated from society manly. Is that a problem, would you call that a problem that you're not socialized to the person like i'm not saying like to be disrespectful or like I don't want to see a human being, or something like that, like, I want to come from them, but. It just I just don't want to deal with like a life situation kind of a thing of what's going on in the society that is being controlled by the government, blah blah, whatever it. is then really issue would you call it that, that could depressive issue or is that a real issue that can lead to more faster in the future if, like I don't do that. What would just."
740.0,Provider,"I would say that is not a problem right now, but he can lead to the problem."
16245.0,Patient,"No problem, so it shouldn't always like you've got to be just hating people."
740.0,Provider,"Because like no I don't think that you hate people unless you tell me otherwise. But what I will say is that once you start to isolate you'll continue to isolate because you'll see no reason. right because, mind you, it only takes 12 days to form a habit. Just 1212 days to form a habit so once you begin to form this habit your brain begins to adapt. And tells you like oh you, nobody will go by ourselves hey that's awesome a bad. thing I know. We are right right, where we are no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Mind you, it's not an issue to take time out for yourself. But it can lead to an issue. You have to have a balance. I don't care you don't have to be with a group of people I don't care if it's just one person that you hang out with once a week. once a week that's it as long as you are being social at least once a week. Because you don't want to go ahead."
16245.0,Patient,"So if I haven't so, for example, if I haven't been in contact with any of my friends for like maybe like I have a couple friends, I don't have that many friends, because I don't call it a real friends like it just like to. Two real kind of thing and to real friends that could be like mainly true friends that could be there for you. For those two people I haven't seen him for maybe like I would say, three months so and i've been just at the very beginning, I was struggling as seriously, I thought that i'm going through some problems that i'm having problems, focusing I guess. being stressed out anxiety and you know you name it and. But I haven't seen them so as does that mean like I already have it got into a habit of being isolated or is that mean like. that's what it is."
740.0,Provider,"Because, mind you. The more you expose yourself to some of the more year that. that's just that's just human nature. And so. And then, basically, you tell yourself we don't have to talk to them today. And then the next day comes. Oh one South America. And then, a week by goes by. i'm cool with not talking to you, and then a month, so it's. no big deal I don't have to. men to month basis, and then you go from I don't have to suit to I rather not. And then you go from our rather not to I don't want to."
16245.0,Patient,write yeah that's what happened. mm hmm that's right.
740.0,Provider,yeah sounds.
16245.0,Patient,"Like I have a need to see anybody. Like that that's how I am I. Why would, I have to go over what reason."
740.0,Provider,"You know, but it's because you looking at it wrong. You look at it as a need and a reason. But the way you should get the way you should look at it, if I may suggest you just look at it, as as as a. As something that you get to do. not something that you have to do. But I get to go out. I get to spend time with this person who actually wants to spend time with me who actually cares about me and I care about thing. it's a non Joe is it's a judgment free zone, we just going to go out we're going to have fun I don't have to think about my worries and i'll have to talk about in your House talking about there's. You know, everybody needs that person, you know i'm saying it could just be one person, but if you don't meet that person, you know i'm saying, and it is one of the things the reason why you don't is because you look at it completely wrong. it's not a necessity or an obligation that I have to do it no it's the fact that I get to."
16245.0,Patient,"know I mean is. I would they say it is it all started with, for example. not getting along with some people's conversation, or like I would see it as a problem. right will miss information getting bigger so information about whatever society going on, or like some of the friends are in some other pages there's things that they were doing, maybe, five years ago in high school. And in that terms, sometimes I find myself Okay, you know I don't match with you."
740.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
16245.0,Patient,"So i'm at the same time they're like Oh, why are you sensing us in the sense in your business, so I don't know like is. Or would that be kind of like Oh, you know what this he's wrong, but like sometimes like they do something wrong they actually do something wrong that is absolutely ridiculous at the age that they're about to do right. But I don't see it like anymore like I don't see them as a true friend sometimes. that's not."
740.0,Provider,"around with it, we are grow people. We got when we go in different directions and you go on one way and i'm one another way and we can, and that means I have you know, two people can walk together, except they be in agreement. So we don't agree now how are we gonna walk together and sometimes you add real people you mature faster than they do or you want more things than they want and you don't want to continue to stay with them, because they don't pull you down. So sometimes you got to remove yourself from me. However, you got to add, let me add that in there, however, I removed myself from the ones that I was with. so that I can be able to attach myself to the ones that I can look up to. Is not removing myself, so that I can stay alone. But you're trying to be a whole doctor. So that means I need to be networking I need to at least have me a friend that's adopt. Or, so this this this in the medical field but i'm trying to get to right. Now i'm saying it's been a network."
16245.0,Patient,You have to be social that's true.
740.0,Provider,We got to be the basis of friends that just means you are my network that means you know every now and then we can go out to stall books and we can talk in young saying this kinda like a mentor.
16245.0,Patient,"And that's how it was every day just going out and being more socialized but I don't eat something. In my brain to be okay being alone, I really don't have an answer that you know you know exactly what it is, but I don't know I don't know how it started, though, like i've been months and months and months, being okay with having no one and. mom and my girlfriend, and I mean being in my girlfriend too much of it is bad to so that's why a lot of contention to happen to because."
740.0,Provider,I want to focus with myself so much because i'm married and I wish I will say bye too much of you is bad for me. to another house. Can you move out.
16245.0,Patient,Just like you kind of have bounced will think like. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah girl friend, whom you love me you say you know what can you go home because too much in you, I just can't take it."
16245.0,Patient,No idea. That doesn't think it's the only person like I see when so. and
740.0,Provider,"So, and this is the thing. Is and one thing about it is you have to change. Because you have been hurt so much, then, once you once you. Experience that hurt it kind of stains your perception of people, and so, then you begin to stigmatize people based off of the people that actually hurt you. So then, you get with people with the expectation that they're going to do the same thing that the other people do. So, then, we have that in our minds, we say, well, I rather just be alone. So they're wearing a deal with it out. I have to go out I don't have to do this, I don't have to do and so it's more so, you have to be able to change, you have to be first off you got to forgive. And then, secondly, you have to once you forgive if you are able to change your perception and realize that not everybody is the same."
16245.0,Patient,"How do you how do you forgive. me i'd be happy to do that, but like, how do you get it off your mind."
740.0,Provider,How do you get it out of your mind you got to get it out to heart.
16245.0,Patient,How do you do that.
740.0,Provider,Let me go.
16245.0,Patient,"Do you confront the person is it is what it is, or you just."
740.0,Provider,"One of the things says this is that, in order to forgive somebody you don't have to let somebody know that you can bet you forgive them now, if you have all against them, then yes, you should go let them know how you feel. But you don't have to be around them to let them know that you forgiven them. If something that you do within yourself, mind you, it is, it is a, it is a an emotional thing, so you make a conscious decision within yourself to tell yourself, you know what like I i'm willing to look at you, as the in as an individual and not based off of your offenses. And then that's when you know you're ready to let go. Right well, you can when you can treat somebody is if nothing ever had."
16245.0,Patient,"You ever tell them should I ever tell them, for example, if I come from my uncle should I. Ask that got me really upset or."
740.0,Provider,"Why don't. Why don't know why, because you got resentments. And you hold grudges so you should. You should clear the air, but you don't have to tell them, you know what I forgive you. Because what happens is and one of the reason why they say that is because everybody that you forgive would not say i'm sorry."
16245.0,Patient,yeah they don't.
740.0,Provider,And so that's why that's why they say you don't have to tell people that you can give them because it's just the people who feel like they didn't do anything wrong and so that's why you always forgive for your sanity not for the sake. because everybody you're not going to get an apology every time.
16245.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"However. it's a release that you need from the hurt that you feel that would allow you, and they will help you see people not based off of the hurt that you experience from the people who, instead that's the thing. One of the main reasons why it's so difficult and one of the reason why you and your girlfriend but here so much is because of the fact that she's one of the closest people to you and usually it's the closest people there's to you that hurt you. Right and so, because of the fact that she's the closest to you at this moment, and it was the people that said they loved you that hurt you. And because of the fact that there's love there between you and her, but we always bumping heads, we just can't seem to get along So my question is is, is it really hurt or did you."
16245.0,Patient,"Do blue this is more me so. because she just have her own problems to. On a therapy as well, so that's what i'm saying like Sometimes I feel like I can really get help. Someone who's going to be more like on a different page. Now she has anxiety, I have anxiety to she's been diagnosed with ADHD I have been to so it's like she she has major depression from the past and he goes crazier than my story as just crazy with her family and stuff like that which i'm not really going to get into but this. that's why sometimes have to like she's jumping through sometimes because she sees a different."
740.0,Provider,"And you know the crazy part and I try to pimp it is I learned this before and I found it to be so true that you are who you attract. Their nine times out of team. Who, you are and what you carry you'll attract the same person. But it's true. Because the crazy part about it is if they commonalities they attract. Who I am and what I hold on to our track the same person and now look. yeah I got the same diagnosis. Right battling with the same stuff and we bump in his like this. So. A lot of times, I never said I was telling another patient this. Patient but another client is they. Sometimes, sometimes sometimes you have to heal separately. Before you can try to come together and be healthy."
16245.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"Because, to try to heal. In the midst of a relationship is too many triggers in a relationship, they can cloud, they can cloud your judgment and it can it can it can. cause the healing to be stagnated. Since you are in the relationship now i'm not having to break up with the greater than anyone said, but one of the things I will say, since you are in a relationship. It actually I mean it will help because it helps you realize what your triggers are and the thing that you need to work in the stuff that you need to work on. So you can use it as a plus. In this moment, however, the same time, you still have to make sure that you're not projecting on her and vice versa, and that she's not projecting on you. Because we still hurt by people who hurt us and you know what happens, they say hurt people hurt people."
16245.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,So just think about.
16245.0,Patient,"It that's true is is sometimes I feel like this is so easy to solve what is so complicated. Complicated sometimes I don't even have things that at that moment that I sometimes when I like sometimes I want to call you and be like hey, this is what happened, but sometimes there's so much little things that triggers. They just. Come back at some point. I just remember like parts of it. yeah you know. What triggers me the most in why all of a sudden from being an outgoing person and being happy and everything else, and then you got more. You know you get out of control, because that does what I do I know, like a little things to there's me."
740.0,Provider,No.
16245.0,Patient,"No schools triggers me everything everything somebody you know don't do anything right the way there were supposed to do. or somebody who's like getting at me and saying hey you need to do this, you didn't do it right, I just come up really quick and then I don't know like how that happened like over time just."
740.0,Provider,"It happened because of the fact that you don't like. You people telling you what to do, because you grew up with an uncle who always controlled your life. Right and so they're just that's how it happened."
16245.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"And then, since he steal presently in your life still trying to control your life, then that's not, then that means i'm still not free, yet. This is something that i'm going through you know i'm saying and he's controlling my life is really messing with me. And so, that means that I don't you know that's something that you don't like says you don't like him controlling your life and since you're not since you're not able to tell him. That you don't like him controlling your life, then you take out your anger on people who you feel are just like him trying to control your life."
16245.0,Patient,"Right, what do you call this the call this like. Is this some sort of abusive would you call the mental abusive or."
740.0,Provider,yeah mentally abusive emotionally.
16245.0,Patient,"Because I mean explaining my uncle is like parts of it is like he if he had problems with his wife and his sons and you know he made his sounds super spoiled and everything and. How many battles with his sons, but he himself like he just he doesn't see things that we should be seeing you know. yeah me coming here from other countries and to try to have a better life, and I say hey you know what I decided to go in the air force or in the rain. Something like push me to go for it that's a big surprise you know cuz I mean if I wanted to like be a soldier or something I could have done that in my own country as well you know i'm coming here for a better life, I mean that's another really good recommendation give you. Right now, so everything started from that point that I thought well there's a jealousy here that he doesn't want me to have something so in case like he sounds good. What a same time he's super nice he he I guess he helps out he donates I don't know he he on the phone he's very nice but, like the little things you throw out the the sentence is like at the same thing is he's like he's betrayed. Through the sentence with his nice words. What i'm saying, and those are the one day really triggers. And um. yeah."
740.0,Provider,So he's alive like is it like manipulation. You feel like you're being manipulated.
16245.0,Patient,"Violence that absolutely cool i've been manipulated. Because he did a lot of stuff for my dad I mean for us to be here I mean he became a cosigner for the House cars, because sometimes you have to support. But it's not like he's paying for this stuff living here right, but at the same time he likes to have things in our control, for example, he didn't he never wanted. My mom said okay it's you know we became the first time, we came to the United States, we stayed there for a year, with him, so we could. settle down and be each my mom does the terrible thing to do, you know it's going to somebody's house and get out, but my dad didn't. know you, you know he knows everything there he make sure, like you, guys don't screw up but we're so everything becomes like it started from my dad my dad literally permit him to do stuff on my dad really it's not a guide to really stand up or my mother and I."
740.0,Provider,he's a.
16245.0,Patient,"very nice guy educated, but he's not a person to see things and sometimes I tell him, you know what the broader problem. And he's actually hurting us emotionally, and you don't see that he's like, no, no, no, he had his own problem, and he just want to stick some beliefs, because he's he's broader. And he just want to believe that he's good and he doesn't have a problem so that's when everything started going crazy because he never wanted us to be sitting like to be independent, meaning. He always wants me to move out from the from the states like, for example, when I was applying for UCLA or john Hopkins. And, or like Stanford university and he said why don't you go to university of older now I don't know what the University of boulder is but the summary or can I searched above and he's super super. there's a lot of snow and the except basically hundred percent of students. It just he doesn't want me to kind of get in, but at the same time, on the other hand, and says oh my sure you study. Make sure you're like you do that, and he wants me to really work like do Labor works, so I get into a mindset of making money, and you know school or work and you do it together full time is not a really good option. So that's where all the tension and I told him, no, no, this is what I want to do and I told him no but at some point he always wanted me to be like. sometimes felt like I was a slave for your son, you know picking up at the school, sometimes I had to like get rid of my dates, because he wanted to have a relationship with his girlfriend so he he would bring his son to our House. And he will say Oh, this is just for one day, the second day third day he would stay here for one week. And he wouldn't even. And these are the things that I would go crazy about because he would ruin my class and i'll and it was a time that I couldn't say anything, because I was a teenager to. write something like that, and these stayed in my brain really bad and."
740.0,Provider,I wanted to.
16245.0,Patient,"get off, you know, like I don't want it here, but at the same time I didn't want to create a depression or a family. To get into a fight with him, because I know he's kind of person is going to say Oh, you did this, you know because he was the person who. really helped us, but at the same time he I feel like he didn't do to help for me he just did it for my dad you know he didn't come from the heart to do it for us. You know so. Things like that. And stuff like that."
740.0,Provider,"it's just it just the fact that. You grew you aged. But. That teenage version of new is still is still alive. and You basically colleges stuff that you basically add suffering to yourself, like reminding yourself. Of the things that he has done."
16245.0,Patient,"Well, you know I think is culturally to. Make from the Derby run ins. and culture is absolutely a disaster, you know where everybody thinks oh my God is going to become controlling you know, and then you cannot really say no to your family because it's going to count as disrespectful i'll over here. i've seen from my friends that they could easily see milk is something and then I learned from it and I felt like this is how it's supposed to be, you know when you're not comfortable. You say no to the person respectfully and they should already get the information that Oh, he doesn't want to do this, but he didn't."
740.0,Provider,know he stepped up.
16245.0,Patient,"And then the first time I told him no he just couldn't believe it and he started saying it and, after that, when I left the House because I was mad. He told my mom that you made him like that you made against me and that's when I really start going crazy like because whatever I have on like she's the only person who really defending everything like she speaks up even like that, at this age that I like and I have her back to."
740.0,Provider,But um yeah.
16245.0,Patient,"or like he would ask me like math problems and i'm a person, then I get anxiety, I cannot answer any questions."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16245.0,Patient,"Why albums complicated math problems in in a family gathering to bring me down. Yes, he was kind of a mathematical genius he was a businessman. So these are the things that he would kind of put me down in a spot to kind of be made fun of by the same time, I will see like he's really friendly the children was good, with his own son who's. You know, like I couldn't really understand why he's doing it to me just and then I found out that he you know he he's like a sick person somebody doing this. Now, like you got a lot of issues like, for example, for like having a lot of jealousy towards a teenager at that age. To not being able to like know grow yourself out of it and because he's so wanted to become a doctor and we are here to support age and he was in still middle school, while was finishing high school so. He wanted him to become a doctor and once everything changed, you know, and he couldn't believe that he's going to a film industry. And he he told me to force his son to going to like medicine, because they make more money, and I was like that is not true. It is a waste of time if he's not passionate for it, you know you have to really love for what you're going through it's not it's not an easy choice you might not getting everything. And he just the dust a point where he really called my mom and you said you know what I don't think rod knows what he's doing. So he maybe you push into go to towards physical therapy or become a nurse, and you know that's when I go man, I was like I don't want to be a nurse, you know who's he to choose my career. But two weeks ago, he said, oh, how are you going to take care of your dog if you're going to go to boulder university i'm like I did not apply to boulder I don't know why you can mention that these are the stuff that I can handle."
740.0,Provider,This manipulation.
16245.0,Patient,manipulation and I.
740.0,Provider,"Can just control, and so the thing about, that is, is because of the fact is, it seems like he's narcissistic and then he's jealous. And so, one of the thing about it is, is that at the end of the day, you're saying, sometimes. And i'm be honest with you and I know there's not a B, and I know there's not a profile but i'm taking some more and sometimes you just gotta let folks out. There, or maybe they're listening. This level style."
16245.0,Patient,But what should I should I tell him anything more like what what.
740.0,Provider,I know him.
16245.0,Patient,I.
740.0,Provider,"Know ignore right there may 1 off what he got this listen your ground me. You do whatever you want it to you, not a little boy, no more and see sometimes because of the fact that you're not their teenage the one or more, and that you have a mind of your own sometimes Akin they they. People in authority. will try to steal push your buttons and treat you like you said a teenage boy. Because they go based off of your response that's why I say, if you keep showing people your buttons they will impress them right, but a lot of times in a day he full of himself he's controlling and he's narcissistic. And he's jealous. And so, he still he still he doesn't like the fact that you're independent."
16245.0,Patient,You don't.
740.0,Provider,"Like the fact that he can't control, you know more. And so, of course, you're going to try to bring you down. he's gonna try to bring you down but guess what you got to make a video man. They yo i'm not like I know you're gonna say there's going to turn me it's not going to stop me. i'm not 13 no more i'm not 15 or more i'm a grown man, I know, who I am you can tell me what to do, you can run me you're not gonna play these mind games with me you're not going to control, my thoughts. I know who I am I know what i'm worth I know what i'm value, I know who i'm going to be in at the end of the day, once I make it. Once I make it. you'll see it to your own about our explanation you got a proven and nobody but to yourself, you even got to listen to nobody I know you do it out of respect, because you don't want to disrespect because of culture. And so, at the end of the day, if you feel like you got to answer the phone desk cool, but at the same time, I live folks time Bellamy, and I gotta listen. Right you think I let you think I ended up the phone on speaker before we didn't walk away. Have. You think I know how you think I, in turn, the volume down, while he was talking before the. have done it plenty of times. You saw this one here. And then i'll turn it back up So you see the top. And then I tend to make them and then, once it gets out and i'll say okay. You gotta do what you gotta go Joe piece right. You think I walked away I have you think I turn the volume down I sure did. I gotta go on my piece i'm not gonna be there suspect. i'll let you tell them America this. Is a what is because I gotta go on my piece I got stuff to accomplish you can get me like that no more you gotta leave me alone, and since I got it. And since I have to respect you as my uncle it says, I cannot I choose not to disrespect you and I got to answer your phone call because of culture and things of that nature yeah i'm saying that's co we could tell. where you can tell me that oh man I gotta listen. yeah it is."
16245.0,Patient,"Though is hundred century was just highly like you just like it's not just one person, you know, like my dad's side of family like."
740.0,Provider,You can do it all.
16245.0,Patient,"I can be just got my mother and I are constantly like kind of betraying on the back, you know, like facing nicely, but at the same time they're like shooting it and this like like stuff that they're being so like sarcastic sometimes like consenting sometimes it just still."
740.0,Provider,The same practice for him is the same fire back.
16245.0,Patient,"Right. because sometimes want to shut them up, you know just kind of tell him in the face, like you know what like kinda like a sentence feel like they don't see what they're doing wrong and I just want to tell them like hey you know what."
740.0,Provider,"Even after you say this they're not going to acknowledge it. write it out my job manager person doesn't change unless they feel like it's necessary for them to change so just because you tell them, there are many go and change. So your job is to go Joe piece your job you're saying is to move forward your job is to progress yo yo aim in the job of changing people your job with the changes. So, at the end of the day, these people are not going to change unless they see that as necessary for them to change. But if they don't see those necessary and a lot of times, a lot of times older people are you, you know, like I do all the people's best law family they stuck in a way. They feel like if anybody needs a Chinese you. win the thing about it is just what you said you right, I am changing. Which is why I want to talk. Because you're not good you're not spending so much names. you're not a part of my transformation, which is why I want them to you."
16245.0,Patient,"which I did I actually stopped talking to him and I feel great about it, but the thing is every time like sometimes even weiss's or something I haven't gone to his house, believe it or not, for one year and I feel great about. I can I. agree the well well sometimes when you have family gathering and they say oh he's going to come with his son and then or like my sister going to call from overseas. And I don't want to go, and this is my problem you know, like, I can confront them and it just like I don't want to deal with it, is that OK, you think. that's okay right Okay, so I always tell my mom you know what just tell them i'm not here i'm not going to work because they're like he's like crazy like he's I. worked my butt off, since I was like 1718 I started working at that age, while his son was still like you know living luxury kind of a thing, and he still has doesn't have a job and I kind of get why he's kind of jealous because he sees me independent mostly. i'm paying my own, you know from my own expenses my own rent my own my car I paid it off and everything, and you know, like at the same time, I hear overseas they call me they were like oh yeah congratulation you got a new car. happy that you kind of you know your dad bought it for you, like my dad didn't buy it for me like I don't know who you heard of, and then I hear that he says it is something like that. You know, to bring me down to now show like oh my God he's a hard worker person, you know that's what pisses me off the most to see like you know he undervalue me and my kind of my mother to not really working here while you're."
740.0,Provider,"working. Let me say this, can I say this i'm saying is don't sweat the small stuff. All your data, but today cool. Okay. Why, I got it, why not, why not approved you nothing. I know about it, why I gotta prove to you that about. Why it no point you believe my data about for me okay."
16245.0,Patient,But.
740.0,Provider,hey do me that's your belief and and i'm not at first off i'm too grown too busy and don't have time to be China a defending something that I bought so that you can so that I can change your mind. change his mind.
16245.0,Patient,he's not yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So, at the end of the day, you kind of sweat monster is small. You can't sweat smile stuff like that. Because when you start sweating the small stuff even she's gonna grow the business stuff and small stuff can start stacking on top of each other to the point to where you get pissed off in a bag."
16245.0,Patient,And then.
740.0,Provider,"you're going to find yourself, nobody who you got the fields that you know Barry. Not to your family nuts and nobody you ain't gotta prove yourself to nobody, the only person who has to prove yourself to yourself, you ain't got to compare yourself to nobody, the only person you compare yourself to as the US that you were yesterday, right. period I don't know, nobody you know, nobody knows."
16245.0,Patient,"Why do you. lose to get away like, how do you like, how do I not get matter where I, how do I, like it's just like that little thing like in my brain just goes off and."
740.0,Provider,"I think you have to you have to tell that something that you got to work on within yourself and it's just it's just really, really, really a part of anger management and really i'm finally getting to the point to where you stop giving your power over the people. Because that's what happens every time you get angry. You allow them to control your emotions and they take the power away from you. And so there's like no i'm not doing it no more and i'm gonna keep practicing and said I get better at it. But guess what happy anger is a secondary emotion, which means they went South there when when when they're when someone provokes you, that means you react to them right and a lot of times, people can feed off your reaction. To the point to where they want you to. So they keep doing stuff and it keeps saying stuff they know you're gonna react. I know how to get to watch this watch this. Let me just say some real stupid because I know he going to read. You gotta throw people off. Because they're used to they're used to the atomic bomb version of you. And so you got to throw people off if that means you got to meditate before you get on the phone with people if that means you gotta go to the gym if that means whatever you gotta do. Whatever you have to do to get yourself in a calming place and then, once you get your stuff and a common place you guard their place. i'm not gonna let you are nobody else coming in. And mess with my piece is my job to guard my piece, so that means you want to talk best co anchor listen. If that means you i'm saying you come up with an assumption or speculation are right there job he is he gonna do me. you're saying like honestly and I know that I shouldn't say this. I mean not that I shouldn't say Russia find a therapeutic way to say it, but I found out therapeutic way to say is i'm just gonna say sometimes you just gotta get to the point where you don't care. and got to know me hey my basis."
16245.0,Patient,"No you're right you're right they did the reason why I love hearing this is just because it's part of as part of the goddamn culture, you know, like you, just like."
740.0,Provider,"So, as they. Go toxic and yeah."
16245.0,Patient,"goes around and I can't believe, like he's been here for 36 years and I just can't believe it because there's so many people like him."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16245.0,Patient,"In this country when you come here you kind of kind of got to manage your weight to learn new things, instead of just staying in the same that darn country."
740.0,Provider,With the same well.
16245.0,Patient,"You got to kind of change yourself. he's still into that motion and sometimes my dad say Oh well, he's just into that culture, he can get it out just the way we are i'm just like."
740.0,Provider,"it's not you know they gotta they gotta they got a phrase and saying you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Right, unless you want to learn. All the people get stuck in a ways. Right, and so you can put and just like a stable phone, you can you can you can push nobody to change they don't see no reason to. invest the way he's been then that's the way he'll stay until he finds a reason but just because that's the way he'll say there are made you gotta be there. They should be shelby's you want to stay like this, I ain't gonna do me, though, because that's not the direction i'm going. So it's it's being able to build up. A bonus about yourself. But a positive boldness more so of you know, is it i'm caring more about myself i'm not i'm not going to allow people in their words to dictate me. And my purpose but i'm going i'm going to dictate me and my purpose, I am going to find, I am going to find. The fulfillment that I need i'm not going to allow your words to come in and to contradict my focus i'm not going to allow you to come in and hinder my direction i'm not going to like you to come in and take away my progress like. You know if i'm in charge of it i'm in control of it i'm not going to allow you to control me i'm going to control me i'm not a little more, no more. i'm not a teenager ignore a little more, no more like that's not that's not me no more and so just because you don't recognize it, it does not mean that that takes away any that takes it away from my identity, this is me. And you're not the little boy number and just because of the fact that he doesn't want to accept it doesn't that doesn't take away the fact that you're not a little boy, no more."
16245.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"So you have to come into a self assurance, you have to be assured about yourself, you got to have a self awareness and self assurance about yourself, you got to be confident enough in yourself to stand up for yourself right anybody who's gonna stand up for you. So you got to do it. Not in an aggressive way. But, in a certain way, and a confident way."
16245.0,Patient,"Right. we're saying is stores from the family, you know that staffing."
740.0,Provider,"is always from the family, always. And I found the free you can walk away from friends. But you can you can leave your family because that's what you that's what got a. And so it's kind of like oh i'm stuck with our home but, at the end of the day, job because i'm stuck with me I got food which."
16245.0,Patient,is really true.
740.0,Provider,For which I love you. I love you man I got a phone which. I can love you from my business. And agencies would have as.
16245.0,Patient,well.
740.0,Provider,I know I know i'm I guarantee that there's that there is somebody in everybody's family that they don't so we.
16245.0,Patient,were in it.
740.0,Provider,"doesn't take away that doesn't take away it doesn't take anything away from you that doesn't make you less than a person or that you no longer good or anything like that no that just means. That just means that you are um that that that that you don't you don't want people to add to your suffering more than they already have that just means like yo i'm done with it whatever you got to say about me keep it to yourself. like this is me i'm in charge of my journey is my turn it's my turn, like you, can't you can't show me I gotta figure out how to operate. I gotta figure out me for myself, I gotta figure out my own identity, you can't you know i'm saying you can't have people dictating what they think you should be no you got to figure it out. So, at the end of the day. You can you can UK you can keep talking but yeah I mean you gotta listen."
16245.0,Patient,"But. At the same time I got a I got to start a problem, like some some I start getting high blood pressure, really bad like I recently I like hundred 68 every night I don't know why I put that do you think that has something to do with. Like stress or something."
740.0,Provider,"Let this stuff go right. yeah let it go. that's true you try to convince yourself to prove it, the everybody is i'm going to show them why you are the waste your time and your energy, you are stressed so step out to try to prove something to somebody who, even if you show them instead I don't change nothing. have improved with it."
16245.0,Patient,Like tell them like you're wrong like that that's That was what I.
740.0,Provider,"What I you know what go ahead and tell them guess what it's telling. you when you say you know what your well and then hang up the phone. The present they don't see it, then you just wasted all your time, energy and breath when you could be using it for somebody else. You can be using it to study you can be using it go to the gym. You can be using it to have a date night with your girlfriend you can be using it to do something to better yourself as an individual, you can be using their time and energy and effort and attitude. for something more productive, so they can add to you and not take away from you, because every time you engage your angle, or you engaged in those negative emotions it don't add to you, it takes away from you. And that's why you so stressed that. I gotta go I gotta say she."
16245.0,Patient,"was good, thank you. Simple stuff but I guess."
740.0,Provider,it's the simple stuff and it's a simple southern be too hot it's just.
16245.0,Patient,All got added up.
