You know i've really. gotten, to the point where I am I isolated myself, which I know is a very wrong thing to do. and My. My basically my self care shoot I got my notes covered with my little setup here hold on. So i'm definitely feeling depressed i'm cutting down on my alcohol I stopped drinking mine is i'm definitely Oh, I know, and so i'm drinking something else that I don't desire as much."
226.0,Provider,Money what are you drinking.
17054.0,Patient,it's a one of those flavored self serve drinks that's five. When you call it. sighs. Whatever this strength is. yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,Okay. what's why that 12% 10%.
17054.0,Patient,it's 5% that's what it's 10%.
226.0,Provider,Know what's wine.
17054.0,Patient,Wine is 13.5.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so are you. feeling the effects of not having that alcohol in your system."
17054.0,Patient,Yes.
226.0,Provider,yeah okay.
17054.0,Patient,"You know I have. Some value from my my primary physician, but I don't like to take it, I don't take it when i'm drinking so. yeah I just I feel like sites in such a rich and. Isolated isolation and. My future is unknown, you know I live by myself and a 21 foot trailer by choice. I have no energy my self care which includes my body myself, my home my truck is. Is not not there. And I am on 40. milligrams. Of. Prozac Prozac. And we went from 20 to 40. But you know I. I could say this is all real all my health issues and stuff that's going on and and right now that i'm going to test for physical things. I guess I could say all this is related to drinking. But it's just that cycle, where I I it's it's just way to escape, and especially since I just made myself so isolated. I really am found someone who will be a wonderful sponsor. She lives in Arizona, but I guess I am at the point or i've been very stubborn and i'm at the point, though, that i'm realizing kind of that first step that i'm i'm whatever i'm helpless. All and life my life has become unmanageable. And that's. Certainly, where I am and I haven't really been willing to admit that. So anyway, my my mom lives pretty close by and ventura, and so I am going to go spend a couple days at her house tomorrow and Christmas so i'm not alone. But I really don't do Christmas that's the thing you know you got the pressure people getting you something, and you know I don't even do cards or anything so plus I am broke so. I guess I just spend $750 because my alternator broke and battery went out so boom there. $750 so anyways I says God I just need to get out of this rush. and i'm having a real hard time with it."
226.0,Provider,"So you know getting a sponsor and you know working out for step is a huge that's big. You know, so you know, look at your victories. So that's that is definitely. A huge victory. So let's let up let's work on did we talk about some short term and long term goals, the last time we talked."
17054.0,Patient,I know I don't think so.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's I want to talk about some treatment related. You know treatment goals, so we want to so you know have it be treatment related recovery related so. What is what's a short term goal like let's think of a couple short term goals, so these goals are to really give you something to work towards you know kind of keep you on track. To support your your recovery so what's what's a short term goal that you think you could accomplish let's talk about let's say to."
17054.0,Patient,to quit drinking. and
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so to quit drinking how let's. Talk about the things. That you're going to do to really try and support that so what's what's, the first thing you do just to try and quit drinking."
17054.0,Patient,"I just have to do it and. So I think it would be. You know, going to meetings checking them out."
226.0,Provider,yep.
17054.0,Patient,and You know just baby steps on getting my my self care back and to a reasonable place.
226.0,Provider,"So let's talk about Okay, how many meetings, a week, do you think you can go to."
17054.0,Patient,"I could probably go every day if I find the right way, I haven't had very good experience and it's a little bit why. i've gone to a before and I. various meetings, probably about a dozen times and I just none of them were very good experiences and I didn't really leave like feeling like I got anything out of it. So I guess it's someone said well and I think the last group, someone said suggested to me to do a women's only. that's I think I would lean towards that. But the one. that's closest to me and oh hi it's a mixed group."
226.0,Provider,"So what if we say, do you think five meetings, a week would be too ambitious right now."
17054.0,Patient,I I would have to go to one um but I. You know I think you're probably at this point gap five is. Five should be doable.
226.0,Provider,"So five things up. And then, so do you have a sponsor is this person your sponsor now."
17054.0,Patient,"Well, she she is for you know she's my temporary sponsor until I can find one locally, but she's got 26 years of sobriety and she's just a wonderful friend of my mom's and. very special in it, you know she's been sending me these little things you know motivational things and we've been talking and then I notice, I didn't care for her for her for a couple weeks I guess. We really can't you can't start being my sponsor until I stopped drinking. So. To me, the main thing is is the detox and you know I have considered and made calls and I have a one on one with Dr. Actually i'm getting the same. Next week."
226.0,Provider,Dr proctor.
17054.0,Patient,"yeah and he was asking if I was willing to you know, do I do a three day detox or whatever, and I i'd rather do it on my own, but I. I have to have someone around me I, because if i'm by myself. I don't have any accountability. yeah yeah yeah and anyway, my mom is aware of what's going on, and my struggles and she's been very supportive. And, as is my daughter, who she's 33 but she when she's willing to go to like in a me like a first, a meeting because she's been to them before."
226.0,Provider,So do you think that going to detox would be on your like a short term goal that you'd want to do.
17054.0,Patient,I I would rather not do that. And I know I know I can do it without. detox because I have i've clicked before is you know even. Last year I I you know just this past year I well I guess it's this year I. I stopped for 11 days and the withdrawals weren't you know i'm not worried about having a seizure. mild states in the morning. yeah I don't really drink more or less I drink the same and. Then you know the no appetite thing I have forced myself to eat. So you know I think I could do it with the support. Of basically my mom and my daughter at this point.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so detox on your own that's that's a that's a short term goal. i'm."
17054.0,Patient,"Like you it's what it from what i've learned it's like the hardest, is the first three days, and what I experienced is the first three days. it's the habit, you know that's The other thing that. I find is it's it's such a habit and."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
17054.0,Patient,"yeah I saw I need to. force myself to do things like this is one of them, I live in a beautiful recreation area with a lake and. I need to get out and walk you know not today because it's pouring rain, but. Right just just. Real simple things like that, because I just."
226.0,Provider,"So what's going to be important is that, after you detox that you have support from a and a sponsor because what you want to do is replace those times that you drink with a meeting. or replace those. Excuse me times that you would drink with a walk."
17054.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,or meeting up with some. sober friends.
17054.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so um. So it's about. Sorry um. Replacing. Another activity. A healthy activity, so do you drink mostly like when do you start drinking."
17054.0,Patient,"Oh. Well, right now, i'm only i'm only working one day a week so i'll start in the morning. and drink and and take a nap and then get up and drink some more so it's it's a it's always been pretty steady amount. But i'm noticing things like my memory is is being affected. You think even stuff like that so obviously diseases progressing progressing um. So yeah I mean yeah and I. I. went through about there were, I was falling down. that's bad and I actually broke a rib and a finger and going down my steps and. i'm sure that was alcohol related and plus I had two things in my hand but yeah that was not good. And then. I kind of went off track about what the question was."
226.0,Provider,So okay So the first thing is to try and detox on your own okay so short term goals is to detox on your own and then what you want to you want to do is to have meetings that you can go to every day pretty much every day okay. To get that support okay. And then also to find to find a full time sponsor.
17054.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"To help you so you know, this is a process remember Okay, so you know it's it's it's surrounding yourself with people that can really support you and know what your what's happened like really relate to what's happening because they've been. So when you find a sponsor, then you start working those steps. The steps steps will really help you to process some of. You know. The depression, the anxiety, the sadness, the guilt, all of the stuff that comes that's associated with alcoholism, or you know alcohol dependence okay. And so you really need to surround yourself with with a support team you've got the group on Friday, then you got your sessions with me and really the first thing that we need to get you know, the first thing that needs to happen is to have you stopped drinking like."
17054.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know so that's you know, really, you know that's that's where we are and I know like Dr pachter. I know that he's you know to kind of talk he's talked about it too um. And I think with the long long term goal is to just maintain sobriety. So you know, like right now we just keep it, you know we keep it super simple because we've got you know, the first thing that really. has to happen is that you've got you know, to stop drinking that's, the first thing that's gonna happen because yeah you're right what's happening like it's progressed to where it's affecting your memory it's affecting your ability to eat food it's affecting your balance now. get my yeah yeah. yeah so um. for health reasons."
17054.0,Patient,yeah yeah. And i'm i'm wondering i'm I would hope that. When I stopped drinking that some of the joy of life will come back right. and Have no joy I. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Well, we number, remember that alcohol is a depressant so it's gonna make you depressed so the lack of joy, the lack of enthusiasm or the lack of motivation is is most likely alcohol related. it's kind of taken a hold. So it's really difficult to have. Self care when you're drinking like so think about like you know getting up like start drinking in the morning and you just kind of drink throughout the day and in the evening you know you're not getting. nutrients you're not getting water you're not getting food, you know you're not getting all of the things that the body needs to stay healthy and you know stay energized. So you know it's not it's it's on looking at it on a couple of different levels like So if you continue to drink your health will just continue to. be an issue."
17054.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
226.0,Provider,"So. I guess my next like I guess it's like how like how are you gonna do it like how are you going to just stop because nobody's holding you accountable like, how do you do that."
17054.0,Patient,"Right, well, I think. Being at my mom's. would be good, and then my daughter when she can she can stay here with me and it's just you, and then you know, having someone I hadn't I don't know how to say it hold my hand. and So until I have that the last time I put those 11 days I was actually actually at my mom's and I was actually very sick so that's probably. But you know I. alcoholism runs in my family and on her side and she's she's good but. It just kills me that I had the grief i'm causing her and she has tried so hard to help me and make me happy she wants to be happy as an add on it's gonna try and mom and. But uh yeah and you're right that guilt it's a lot of guts. And yeah I just you know, keep doing the same thing over and over again. So. i'm. yeah so I mean my strategy now is. is even my mom's you know it's a hard time to quit. You know, internal and especially that I don't like to holidays and all the. commercialism around it, and then I need to once i'm feeling a little bit more. Self confident. Get out and find a job, but you know that my other nurse practitioner said it sounds like you get too much time on your hands, and I said I do because right now i'm I. Only have that job that's once a week and. So I need to find a job because plus any money right now i'm living off of my small paycheck and then I took out an IRA. But that's running low so i'm really getting to a place where i'm. My life is going to be unmanageable and a lot of people say think you know oh poor gone I lose you know, on a trailer and you know what happened to her, but really it was all I don't like the whole story, but it was all personal choice. And my mom bought me a beautiful. New trailer and you know I just been smoking inside, I never smoked inside but in so going inside because of the weather and. You know i'm just i'm disgusted about that and then i'm letting the trailer go and myself go I haven't had a shower and like five days. yeah and."
226.0,Provider,"Is that, because of the depression. Are you thinking, are you taking the Prozac are you taking those medications now. Yes, okay How long have you been taking it."
17054.0,Patient,"Well, we went from 20 to 40 milligrams. let's see about a couple months ago. My doctor said I could probably go up a little bit more or try a different one."
226.0,Provider,So if you're on 40 milligrams it's not working right. right because you've been taking 40 milligrams for a couple months.
17054.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,Are you drinking now.
17054.0,Patient,"No, I yes i'm drinking iced tea."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
17054.0,Patient,Okay Dixon is I love starbucks ice.
226.0,Provider,yeah is that the hibiscus.
17054.0,Patient,Know it's just a regular regular black but two pumps of classic so not. yeah I just I have one every day. Do you. Is a high visit someone good.
226.0,Provider,"This is good it's a little bit um it's not as it's has kind of a weird it's a little strong for me. But it's. yeah that one's not my favorite there's some other ones that I I use I don't go to starbucks anywhere I go there all the time, I used to drink coffee, but I stopped drinking coffee so yeah and Okay, how much and how many cigarettes are you smoking a day."
17054.0,Patient,i'm not a pack.
226.0,Provider,Okay. Okay. Okay. What is your partner with pachter next week.
17054.0,Patient,Let me have a look oh shoot.
226.0,Provider,"Okay that's Okay, I was just curious."
17054.0,Patient,"I have, I have it on my other it's January 11."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, not for a couple weeks."
17054.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so is your plan to just go down to your mom's for the holiday and stay there for a couple days or what's your plan."
17054.0,Patient,"Well, that that is my plan yeah so that could be a good start. At least the two days and. And then my daughter. is willing to come stay with me I she's got her own issues and so she a long term state is not an option it's trailer but she's very, very supportive of my sobriety and she went through a year and a half of teen challenge. Nothing and then. And and some other rehab stuff, but that was mainly related to opioids. So she seems to be doing pretty good she's she's got a lot of you know. Experience under her belt. But not as she would not be a sponsor for sure. If we can. We have our our issues and. But she is very, very supportive of."
226.0,Provider,Clean right now.
17054.0,Patient,She is on.
226.0,Provider,Right now.
17054.0,Patient,"In the box and. she's trying to wean off of methadone. And then she's she she was drinking hard alcohol and she really fell back. And she she's a bad drunk. And seven now she's just pretty much drinking those tell surfing that's what she said, you know mom if you're you know you're feeling like you need some in the morning, you know, maybe just drink one of those and so anyway she's she's wanting to just stop that too and. So. yeah so I have to be careful about that relationship. yeah she's got a real volatile temper and. When she mad. It she just rips me a new asafa patient. But then she she come over and be so helpful and I always wonder, you know is. He on drugs or not, because she's such a good, you know liar and she says she's not abusing she's taking her prescription as prescribed. she's all spawned by a van because she's got she does have extreme ADHD. So I just I, I think that what from what I gather, as some of the doctors that are prescribing these shoes they think that she was. shelley."
226.0,Provider,guidance.
17054.0,Patient,uh huh.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
17054.0,Patient,"yeah because it's like she has money as I go how many years she finally got a job so anyway there's a lot there's only so much I can trust her you know. And yeah I kind of allow myself to be abused, because I feel like I deserve it. yeah yeah. So um. yeah i'm sick and tired of it, am. I know i've had friends, you know, give me feedback I missed the sparkle in your eyes. You know I. You know my mom you know let's go to lunch, you know, and I don't want to go in I don't want to go anywhere I don't want to she goes oh go window shopping and look at jewelry. that's the most random thing because I don't even like jewelry and I don't like shopping. I have basically stepped foot in the store except the local market, I know I just don't I want Christmas to be over with the holiday be over. So I know I just you know. You got to get through this time and. You know I feel like you know I drink too numb what is right coming up to the surface. anger and. and So I feel it starting to come out, which is a good."
226.0,Provider,really good.
17054.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"it's not it's not going to feel so good, but it's actually really good you know all that stuff has to come up and it has to be talked about and processed and so you're not holding it inside anymore."
17054.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel you know over the year they have been a lot of counselors a lot three marriages. and So I have done a lot of counseling in fact that I had process, you know a lot of this stuff but, and you know childhood sexual stuff and. But obviously. You know i've got a lot more work to do. So um you know I might have to just be a wreck for a while and that's okay. Absolutely yeah."
226.0,Provider,You know it's kind of that same you know when things feel like they're falling apart they're actually falling together.
17054.0,Patient,like that.
226.0,Provider,"You know so it's kind of like you go through this process that you're going through. You become whole again. Because it's so easy to feel broken when you're. dependent on alcohol or dependent on drugs and. It has a way of taking over you know it starts out as you think being your best friend and then it becomes too much anime. Trying to constantly keep that at bay. And you know, the only way to stop drinking is to stop drinking."
17054.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"And I mean I do know people that have just kind of wean themselves off, but it's kind of rare. For that to happen. So I know that you wanna I know you want to detox on your own but. This becomes a little bit too much for you, I asked that you remain open to going to detox and now that's not what you want to do not saying that that's something that you have to do, but just remain open."
17054.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I have, I actually made some calls. Because Dr factor was going to follow up with me on that and that's not till January 11, and so I called. Some different places that take my insurance, and all I call like five places and they were all not taking new patients. So, then, I reached out to ventura county and they had someone call me that's in tarzana. Yes, wow. And, but there's supposed to be one local. one. And I know this sounds silly but you know I like I say I live alone, and I have my cat and. You know I can't leave her for seven days or. So that's why I always think I can probably do three days with a neighbor your boo boo good keep an eye on her. But I just feel like. it's I just need I know I can do it because i've done it 1000 times. smoking and drinking. Though I know I can do it. But I I really feel like just the no accountability, and you know my routine is sukkot get usually some wine in the morning and then go to starbucks. and get my. starbucks and peanut butter and jelly sandwich protein box. And, and then come back to the lake and just drive around, and you know that's kind of my entertainment for the day and you know I talked on the phone a lot to my friends and my mom. So it's not like i'm not. reaching out to people it's you know, I do have the phone, but I I just I live, you know it isn't a kind of a remote area so. I don't have TVs I don't watch TV, yes, I do I have too much time on my hands and."
226.0,Provider,"So maybe you know, maybe, something is like if you're not able to detox on your own like give yourself until January 11 and if you can't do it then consider going into detox."
17054.0,Patient,Okay. That sounds reasonable. yeah and I are you thinking like three days would be enough for.
226.0,Provider,Probably not I probably say seven days awesome.
17054.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"I mean so typically three days is like you're just kind of walking out of there still sick, you know, like but here's here's The thing is that there's medication, that you can take so you don't drink so maybe three days would work. And then you have, and then you know that you've got this medication that when you get home, you can take that medication and not really blocks that craving to drink and if you do drink you just get sick from it."
17054.0,Patient,Though wellbutrin.
226.0,Provider,naltrexone something like that i'll talk on.
17054.0,Patient,"yeah i've taken the one that makes you sick if you drink. Yes, and i'm leery about that one because. It i've taken that before and but now, with. code, you know all the alcohol or using on our hand and sapphire they say that you know you could get sick potentially for me even using. That stuff and having alcohol penetrate."
226.0,Provider,"i've asked if. i'd ask Dr pepper you know, Dr proctor would know that you know, maybe a game plan is if you're only comfortable going in for three days, then you know you've got some medication, that you can take when you get home like that's. You know. And I it works it works well for people it's workable from some of my other clients. So you know if you're worried about your cat. And you can find somebody for three days, then you know that's that's an option."
17054.0,Patient,"yeah and I know if it was seven days that. My mom would be willing to take her to her house it's just her boyfriend or partner or whatever. is really picky and so she has to stay in the back room and. It gets her, she jumps on the counter so what she does. and anyway it and plus it's just a trauma she's 17 so it's a trauma for her to. be transported and."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
17054.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm just not one day. give her away because. But no, my mom would do anything for me."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do this let's get another appointment and so are you gonna do group tomorrow, are you able to."
17054.0,Patient,say yes. that's Chris that's Christmas ears yeah.

226.0,Provider,"I know I got mine, a couple months ago, I wanted to be prepared."
