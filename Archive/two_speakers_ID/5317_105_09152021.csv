105.0,Provider,"See if there's anything you want to follow up on something you said in group i'm working on accepting other people's knowledge and try not to be right about everything certain people like my step dad since he's a. doctor I always try to impress him not when I fix my car on my own, but my ex girlfriend's family they're not very educated and they always say something wrong i'm always trying to correct them, but I feel like. A negative word afterwards not doing that makes me feel like crap or anything you want to share around that."
5317.0,Patient,"haven't really been around them, so I haven't like folk tried to to. change that yet so I haven't been at her house and like few weeks since I said that. that's what I was going to try to do just not let everything bother me when i'm over there, like whenever they like say stupid stuff. she's still say things or they're like really, really wrong. And they want. it's like pointless to say anything because they'll just be you know stuck in their ways. Even if I just show them like look I looked it up you're wrong."
105.0,Provider,yeah people don't really like to hear that they're wrong.
5317.0,Patient,"And I won't be it's not like i'm saying you're wrong i'll just be like talking about it, we like a subject they'll say one thing and i'll be like. i'll say something that contradicts it but not like i'm trying to tell them, you know that they're wrong. Like no that's not how it is so there'll be like telling me i'm wrong, you know."
105.0,Provider,"It doesn't sound like this much that's needed today, this will just kind of be a brief check in. let's put something together."
