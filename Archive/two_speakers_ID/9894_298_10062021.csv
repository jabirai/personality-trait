9894.0,Patient,"And once every two weeks, I think we change."
298.0,Provider,"Your therapist should be looking over that also to see if there's any things that the way you answer on the assessment tools, if anything is blaring that needs to be addressed that's. I know what. The that's kind of what the assessment tools are for right now i'm looking at your assessment tools and you're still showing moderate Depression and anxiety from my side of it.
