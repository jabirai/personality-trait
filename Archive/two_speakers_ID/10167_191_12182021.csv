Like a judge told me he said it's helped you get sober I was already when all that stuff happened to me like four months sober. Because I was like indicted.

191.0,Provider,"Well, does ibuprofen near take your stomach."
10167.0,Patient,used to.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have an arcane. Yes, okay so definitely want you to have it over the holidays, because you know but holidays is one, a lot of people. want to get high, and I share what my patients like this time of year I like to have my narcan with me when i'm walking around because. it's amazing how many patients have been in a position to say family members neighbors friends just from having just from Karen and arcane. So check your narcy and see if it's expired, because it does seem like it many times expired next year and it's important to have a current one, but you do have several refills okay. Okay, do you know how to use an arcane. Yes, okay. All right, that's good that's really good all right there any hospital restart er visit Mr county. No okay yeah. Oh Okay, and I just see in terms of allergies just penicillin any new medic medication allergies. No okay Dan. So It just seems like the past couple of months, I would say, from the spring forward you just been on this upward trajectory is like you something clicked. I remember. It clicked and and you said, this is what i'm gonna do it was like a light turn what do you think contributed to that light turn it on because I can remember almost like we can remember."
10167.0,Patient,"yeah it was it's all it's everything it's the whole treatment program it's going to meetings and everything but I don't. Anyone can tell you differently, like that I do meetings, every day, but I will call them in person i'll have time for that by doing my my zoom I do it like this, I do it i'm involved in a thing it's on Facebook. For just for today and recoveries are addicts are in recovery and just daily stuff like that. that's what I really committed to your recovery yeah that's what it sounds like that."
191.0,Provider,"made a difference, you know just medicine and that's what we try to encourage to don't just get the medicines medicines have a place, but you need a combination."
10167.0,Patient,"yeah yeah exactly so that's I just. Like How does it go like eventually. This medicine, I read you can take some people have to take it forever, but then just do these meetings forever."
191.0,Provider,"I know there's some people that are on the medicines, probably for a lifetime, but they can probably go down to a lower effective dose. And what I do, Mr Danny I don't force my patients, but I do share with the patients that I have successfully gotten a patient's off the medications and that. will work with you. And if you get to that point at the some of the research, I was reading you want to give your mind a chance to adjust because you know. No transmit like so I tell people look some of the research has shown when you've been on the medications I would say about two years, then consider weaning and try to do it at a time when you stable in your life you've got stable housing."
10167.0,Patient,"You know, yes."
191.0,Provider,"Ah, you know you've got. A relationship, you know."
10167.0,Patient,"The success stories that I watched and i've seen you know YouTube and stuff was three years that dude was three years I one guy that I don't know personally, but I know it's all story. And he did this about as over three years, and then they wind up interviews over 15 though so."
191.0,Provider,"yeah exactly so yeah so be on it for several months, a long time. And the thing is, is that you can come down like I had one person I know we have a provider, that I was working with talking with she. went her patients down by Point five milligrams i've worked with people point five, the most i've seen people tolerate us two milligrams and we tell people you you step down slowly. and A long interval so let's say if you go down point five, you don't go back down, maybe Point five again to about a month you give yourself a chance to adjust. That for a while, then you drop it down and while you're doing that you keep your therapy you keep. You know those positive things like what you're doing this, the content people places and things keeping that healthy. And even once you get off that medicine, I tell people continue with the therapy and the lifestyle changes and maybe you only do therapy once a week or once a month, but you've got that accountability. And if you and then have a safety plan always have that safety. plan and do it with your therapist okay."
10167.0,Patient,Alright sounds great thanks thanks for the help.
