298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have a psychiatrist."

298.0,Provider,"Okay, and are you currently taking the medicine that they sent home with you."
15095.0,Patient,know not today I didn't because I have developed a healthy distrust of medical professionals.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough um. let's see. Are you having any. cider side effects from not taking the medicine."
15095.0,Patient,"I think i'm having side effects from ptsd and panic. and Drug use past drug use. Okay, so I read it history."
298.0,Provider,um so the ptsd does it have to do with your last admission.
15095.0,Patient,"yeah partly. That has to do with a lot of admissions. To different didn't know what to do with me. yeah for several years, so i'm a little i'm a little testy in this interview. I want you to know that if i'm testy it's, not because I can't control myself it's because i've been. in and out of institutions that refuse to give me the reward of putting my transmits first so i'm wondering if this is going to be another situation like that or not."
298.0,Provider,You know what came to my mind was maybe they did that for billing purposes.
15095.0,Patient,"interest you think. If they did they had to tell me a different thing in therapy than what they told me on the diagnosis. And didn't maybe get to explain. That to me and it hurt my feelings a lot, because my pronouns kept getting dropped and misused."
298.0,Provider,i'm sorry.
15095.0,Patient,And people can find me vinson and bro.
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15095.0,Patient,"That I got put into the guys unit with other men. As, though."

15095.0,Patient,"And then they finally moved me into a women's unit, and it was called mariah place of bitterness it's the place for people who are like having active delusions. are very like."
298.0,Provider,Dangerous oh.
15095.0,Patient,But I was in the women's unit them and I was moved from the voluntary rehab.
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15095.0,Patient,"Where I had so much fun and was falling in love with my new friends. asked me trying to put makeup on and then triggering an episode that I believe was a ptsd episode. um that made me feel. delusional. Because i've had experiences with drugs that have made me feel that way. So my history is very complicated and part of what my concern is and this interview is feeling this institution out because if i'm going to be held somewhere. That doesn't think I deserve to be a woman, then it's kind of a waste of time."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So you. there's no there's no pressure to choose us to come on board for. Your mental health. there's no pressure. If you want to I do know that we have a therapist to work works. really well with an eye, and please forgive me if I don't have even the right verbiage to know what i'm trying to say here LGBT Q. yeah Okay, she she is amazing. We do have one therapist that. I I use specifically because of. The way she does she just she so amazing, so please forgive me if I don't get pronounced. problem correctly I don't mean to."
15095.0,Patient,It so.
298.0,Provider,How do I address you I know vinnie you said so.
15095.0,Patient,"yeah so to avoid confusing the medical professionals who keep not giving me them I say he they so that I don't have to step on anyone's feelings you don't want to say, but they they them is preferred. Okay yeah."
298.0,Provider,"i'm getting better at it, saying baby yeah. hey them okay. Are you feeling suicidal right now. Okay. Your admission to the hospital was it because you weren't feeling suicidal."
15095.0,Patient,that's a complicated question isn't it.
298.0,Provider,You don't have to answer.
15095.0,Patient,I prefer different question. i'm.
298.0,Provider,On this one so you're not feeling suicidal. you're not sure if you want to take any medications in the future. And you're not.
15095.0,Patient,"Right, I am sure no sorry i'm sure it will be true."
298.0,Provider,I love well your turn to.
15095.0,Patient,Have ADHD and I think it helps a lot.
298.0,Provider,I think it helps amazing wellbutrin. Do you need a refill on the wellbutrin.
15095.0,Patient,"Yes, please."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have any questions about transit don't will be a trend or lexapro."
15095.0,Patient,"uh yeah so uh tries it on I always forget to mention it, because one of the transfer public places actually introduced me to it, so I try not to think of them too much, but. tries it down does help me a lot with my sleep, so I would like to keep getting down to because part of the reason why I resort to drugs is because i'm trying to sleep, so I might as well use as a tragic."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I that's a nice combination and the lexapro is on such a tiny dose that. Is it even worth it. Meaning you question you asked us that you ask yourself the same."
15095.0,Patient,As myself these questions.
298.0,Provider,Okay gotcha.
15095.0,Patient,I made me feel really stupid.
298.0,Provider,"Yes, a pretty happy powerful drug. Why didn't give it to you."
15095.0,Patient,"Because I was in a state that was paranoid. Okay, I was saying things that didn't make sense to them. So part of the problem with that is that I speak in metaphor, a lot."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15095.0,Patient,"Because i'm an artist. And i'm an experimental person, and I have a very interesting past. That, if I refer to. Two people and they don't know what to do with me it's way easier to just say danger to himself danger to others, then, to give me the right pronouns and say what's really, in my opinion."
298.0,Provider,Your your paperwork is pretty. Vague yeah. it's just fake um so I don't know.
15095.0,Patient,"yeah they were getting the opinion that I was too high, functioning to be there. was my take."
298.0,Provider,And then. yeah you you speak very well you're very insightful to.
15095.0,Patient,me which makes me deceptive right because i'm so well spoken that I can seem higher functioning than I really am in a given moment so right now I feel high functioning.
298.0,Provider,And I know.
15095.0,Patient,"i'm not hallucinating other than the visual snow syndrome, that I have but I don't know if you know visual snow syndrome. yeah So if I had to look it up because it's apparently a rare disease and maybe lots of people have it and they just don't have the language to talk about it, the way I talked about it. But I looked it up. And I see visual noise. Like like you see on your computer screen. um and I believe I inflicted it on myself with with with bingeing specifically not just smoking weed doing a lot of drugs, at the same time, in an experimental way and doing damage."
298.0,Provider,"So would it be like remember you're too young but, like in the 70s, when the TV turned off at night time at like after midnight, the TV went and it's just static he."
15095.0,Patient,stuff and then you start seeing things in the static.
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah that is that what is it something like that.
15095.0,Patient,I think so. I think it's kinda like that.
298.0,Provider,And you remember them turning the TV off at midnight like nobody got any.
15095.0,Patient,To but I I have. I i'm a lover of old electronics and media. i'm 32 I look younger.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. um That was when we had rabbit ears and all sorts of things. Right yeah. Okay, as i'm talking to you i'm finishing up i'm going to write you a script for trust sit down and wealthy, a trend. You have the option and I don't have an agenda either way. I can give you referrals for psychiatrists and therapists I can invite you to come on board with our program unfortunately our program is pretty intense and i'm not sure if that's what you're looking for mm hmm Okay, and you don't even have to take referrals from me."
15095.0,Patient,I love I love the referrals because i'm having a nice talk with you.
298.0,Provider,"I don't make I don't you know I. I know I don't make it up. I know okay um. So. i'm just going to be asking filler questions, as I am writing your. prescription. Okay um. What are your stressors in life."
15095.0,Patient,I stressors panic. was a big stressor and panic can be induced by people acting like what I thought I was hallucinating so like.
298.0,Provider,i'm working I think people.
15095.0,Patient,"If I think people are spying on me. uh huh and then it turns out, they really are spying on me. And i'm doing drugs and there and they're acting like spies outside my apartment. It can make me see way more unstable than I actually am. And that happened and it was traumatic and it happened, more than once, and that no one's given me therapy for that, yet I had to. Protect myself from wellness checks and stuff from people with guns, because I was in my apartment smoking weed."
298.0,Provider,That was scary.
15095.0,Patient,yeah my mom doesn't know my personality that well so she thinks the way i'm talking to you right now is crazy. So that's why i'm so careful.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, and I can understand that, but I think. I can see both sides of the story."
15095.0,Patient,"If I were in your story well. kid who grows up in college and as an adult. away from her so if he remembers the kid the well behaved kid and she Oh, he would never do that and all i'm hearing is hee hee hee hee hee. You know what else she says. I wish I had a daughter."
298.0,Provider,Oh.
15095.0,Patient,So. she's not really the right person for you to be talking to.
298.0,Provider,that's hard.
15095.0,Patient,"yeah it's pretty hard. I, like my creativity like that i'm an autodidact I like that i'm well spoken, I like that I use in metaphors."

15095.0,Patient,"Things like. If you left me in a room with for long enough, I could get pretty good piano I think."
298.0,Provider,that's pretty cool. i'm gonna have to say.

298.0,Provider,I mean I I have learned to new things tonight that I never knew okay um I interrupted you and i'm sorry. yeah.
15095.0,Patient,"uh I love the parts of me that my mother thinks are the parts they're going to go away with medicine. My trans this. The way that I, so what she wants to go away or the episodes I had that were severe. And we need to talk about that right, but the problem is. In my view, were panic and ptsd driven while I was hallucinating in the normal way that people hallucinate when they do a lot of drugs. And my. These chuckleheads sitting behind me. reinforces my delusions where they are. bye. By being in one window as a hallucination and in another window really spying on me so that was stupid."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
