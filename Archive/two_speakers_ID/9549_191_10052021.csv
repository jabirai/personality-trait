It doesn't sound real like you can just be like there's no way that sounds real at iowa state it's the craziest stories that don't sound real that are the real stories this guy ended up having to more girls that he had come here from out of state, it was 18 and 1956. And they're 18 and 19 years old, he will read them to come up here and got them strung out on drugs and then from another state they don't know anybody.

191.0,Provider,"It should not, I don't think it should, but unfortunately I think the world really needs to come around to valuing women and how we think, but I think on the flip side. I think anytime a woman is with a man and there's any type of drug involve rape is rape could potentially become something that could happen to her because anytime the mind is altered people do things they don't they wouldn't normally think about doing.
