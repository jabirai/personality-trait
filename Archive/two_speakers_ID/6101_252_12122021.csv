6101.0,Patient,"yeah. The hon I guess probably everybody gets well, maybe not everybody, but I feel like the holiday time with the with the winter holiday time. yeah makes like added stress."
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm very much, so I think if you write. It down, even though I yeah even though i'm not stressed, I feel busier."
6101.0,Patient,And like. unable to keep up with all those things that I need and want to do.
252.0,Provider,"I get it, I get it just. You know, the only thing we can do is keep going right. put our best foot in front of the other. End don't allow for. The stressed, so to speak, it was funny because the other day I was listening to like i've been in that hole. it's Christmas time Oh, you know and then. They wound up putting music on and it turned out to be Christmas music. And i'm thinking oh my God, I do not want to sit here listening to kind of Christmas music right, but after an hour i'm seeing into it. And i'm starting to feel a little holiday joy."
6101.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,You know.
6101.0,Patient,"i'm like in a weird opposite mood of that like I usually feel like that i'm like Christmas music no holidays oh. I was wearing sorry, like the light just went out I don't know if the electricity went out or just the light. But I think it's just the light, because nothing else looks out. Was I saying. Oh yeah."
252.0,Provider,weird yeah.
6101.0,Patient,"But this year i've been all oh it's Christmas since before thanksgiving. And i'm like never like that so it's kind of weird. But then, at the same time, I told all my family members that i'm not participating and gift giving this year. And like that's a first for me, I always say that and then I always give gifts and then this year I was like no i'm not giving gifts to anyone, except my little brother and they were like okay that's fine."
252.0,Provider,Whatever you want to do.
6101.0,Patient,So I know. So it's just like there's a weird like I love Christmas but i'm not really participating in Christmas this year.
252.0,Provider,"I think, yet at some point you'll hear something that kind of sparks that. You know. Back in the groove of. of it a little bit maybe maybe not I don't know but I kind of hope so, you know. Definitely what I keep thinking is that it's the end of 2021. And next year is going to be way better. it's just you know what I mean i'm not accepting anything."
6101.0,Patient,So.
252.0,Provider,"that's exactly how i'm kind of viewing it like. life's gonna get better. Stress is gonna go to alleviate a little bit you know everyone's going to get used to code because it's been around all year right and. New strands are going to come out and we're going to accept it. Just the way it is you know acceptance is the key to all of our albums all of our problems, is what I heard right and recovery. And you never know exactly how that really affects things until it reset. Right."
6101.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,So you've been going to school and. doing your. Your education part you've been hanging out with the family.
6101.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't really been hanging out with my family that much. But every I think every other weekend i've been seeing them. Which isn't good I wish I could see them a little more often, but it's just kind of like busy for everybody."
252.0,Provider,In any new chatters.
6101.0,Patient,"here and there, but like. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,"No, not really I."
6101.0,Patient,mean not really. I went on two dates with this guy and then last night he told me that. He lives on his parents couch. And i'm ah oh. Okay.
252.0,Provider,"And why is that, why are you not so self employed."
6101.0,Patient,"I mean he's employed but from what I understand is that he lived at the Jacks and they broke up like a year ago, and he moved in with his parents and i'm like, why is it taking you a whole year and you're still living on the couch. Like what. I don't get it. And I didn't bother to ask, I was like oh uh. You know that doesn't sound like a situation, I want to be in. I understand. And i'm like yeah I don't really know what to do, from that point."
252.0,Provider,yeah What do you do with that information.
6101.0,Patient,I really don't know. I know when a data guy sleeps on his parents couch. Like it's just as accountable.
252.0,Provider,yeah I don't blame you.
6101.0,Patient,Because I don't want him to be here all the time and that's kind of like what i'm going into a desert like dating thing i'm like I have a new rule and it's like whoever is not only coming to my house like I will go to their house first.
252.0,Provider,And that's not really an option if he's sleeping he's.
6101.0,Patient,"Not at all. Like you're very nice, but what. I don't get a couch thing. I mean i'm not really talking anyone else, like. A conversation might start and stop very quickly and then i'm like Okay, whatever. And i'm kind of okay with it. yeah."
252.0,Provider,Do you ever get those. Cat fishers. That act like they're one person and they're really somebody else.
6101.0,Patient,"um. yeah. Like people are good at putting on a like a fake personality, I think people in my generation are really good at it, because, like We grew up with the Internet. But kind of like getting better at weeding people out quickly."
252.0,Provider,"Right, you know some of the signs right. Like if they tell you that they love you within one day of talking to yeah here's your sign."
6101.0,Patient,"yeah I don't get that I have, I have had one guy do that on a first date like a couple years ago before coven and I was like i'm never gonna talk to you again. Right. Like that happens primary."
252.0,Provider,run it's a scam.
6101.0,Patient,it's more like people like Javier who seem really nice and then they're not. Like I feel like that's more common is like somebody tries to put their best foot forward and then like. it's it goes away really fast and you kind of see like this mean or nasty or side of them.
252.0,Provider,"or somebody that that pretends to be an American. that's not. pretends to be like I had this one guy that pretended to be. This. Hot guy you know and i'm like there's no way that's him there's no way. Just just no way and. So I played into it right, I talked to them and talk to them talk don't talk to him and then he started talking like a foreigner. You know and i'm like whoa you don't you're not sounding like a South Carolina country boy. You know, like somebody from a different country. And then, then it hits you know if you want a video call then go get a Google game card. it's like hey get out of here."
6101.0,Patient,let's a Google game card.
252.0,Provider,"A Google game card, you can you go get them in any store and they're just you prepay for minutes. On a game it like adds it to your account on for playing video games online. Okay right I don't know what else scammers can do with them i'm sure a lot, but I was just like i'm you."
6101.0,Patient,yeah so did he look different or did you just hear his voice on the phone.
252.0,Provider,"Neither That was the thing he he tried to call me and I could never hear what he was saying right Shaw long distance and chatter you know it's like broken up, and then he video tried to video call me once and it was just this picture. No, I want to see the real deal well you saw me you saw me no. I didn't see you. Then he turned around he. took a picture, and I think it's photoshopped and he put on the piece of paper in front of them, and it said. I love Rebecca chickens and the date. Now i'm looking at it and the fingers are a little bit shadowy something like photoshop that that's not even real right. Come on you're going through an awful lot of trouble to convince me you're somebody's not."
6101.0,Patient,Right people do that I don't understand.
252.0,Provider,"I don't either. doesn't make sense to me like just move on down the road go, you know but i'm finding that it's out there a lot. You know. What is this no get away. Someone out of the blue, you know, wants to be your friend on instagram or Facebook and you never seen them before and have no idea who they are. You know. yeah careful, there are some scammers out there."
6101.0,Patient,Oh for sure.
252.0,Provider,um.
6101.0,Patient,I don't really ever run into those people myself.
252.0,Provider,you're lucky.
6101.0,Patient,I think that. I don't know. Maybe it just depends on like the dating APP or the region or like. I don't know i'm interested in like a very specific kind of guy so I feel like I swipe left on like a lot of guys that people usually swipe right on. yeah like guys that are average I guess. are like I swipe on the quirky like weird artsy guys. And I feel like they're often less time. Less times they are scammers. daya yeah. But you never know.
252.0,Provider,Wars.
6101.0,Patient,yeah. I don't know online dating is just like a kind of. hit or miss deal.
252.0,Provider,I bet in 1000.
6101.0,Patient,I would just that one. I wouldn't bet so much.
252.0,Provider,"yeah that's why I knew that you. were engaged in online dating and that's why I wanted to ask you, you know because it's crazy This is like something brand spanking new to me, and you know."
6101.0,Patient,"yeah i've talked to probably like okay so me and my best friend and he we both that online dating at the same time, and she finally like met a guy and he is her boyfriend and, like most of my closest friends have met their boyfriends online, which I find interesting. But like i've literally talked to like hundreds of people. On online dating and it's like only now, am I figuring out like Oh, this has to be a boundary this has to be a boundary with online dating to like. it's been a very slow process."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, I went not us plenty of fish. No. No, I put myself on bumble."
6101.0,Patient,"bumbles weird like it's good I feel like, but then, a lot of the times, at least for me like if I go on a date with someone I talked to him bumble, then I don't ever go on a second date with them."
252.0,Provider,yeah I deleted the APP. No.
6101.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"No. I, so I deleted it I said no i'm not doing this, this is this is too much for me I can't I go on overload you know, like. I don't know I, like my piece right and I guess it's okay being alone I. don't want to have to deal with all the drama that some. I don't know it's just weird. To me."
6101.0,Patient,"yeah some people are willing to put themselves out there very, very quickly, and it is like almost feels like drama in the in the first conversation."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Very much so, and I was staying away from the ones that instantly wanted to talk about naked pictures or. No. Yes, you're. You know what I mean, but I couldn't find. I just felt like in the in the short time that I. was on there that I couldn't find anything that was real like. People just meeting you know at a grocery store or you know some place doesn't happen like that anymore. You know."
6101.0,Patient,"No, it doesn't. I mean, for some people, it is."
252.0,Provider,My cards. But. So you found out this guy sleeping on his parents couch. Is he saving money to buy a house or something.
6101.0,Patient,"I haven't asked him any questions today. i'm just like oh no like. Well, I already like he's really nice and he's funny but like I i'm bothered by his grammar, which is something like so small, but something that like really bugs me since i'm an English teacher. And so i'm already like I don't know if I can deal with this like i'm gonna have to teach the sky better grammar. And he's shorter than me and i'm already shorter kind of person like. So it confuses me I could feel myself like drawing my stature down and like putting myself in words to make myself smaller. personality wise like he's very, very nice and, like, I can tell he's like a very loving and kind person. And so i'm not like being trying to be judgmental or to like hurt his feelings or anything because i'm sure he's already insecure about living on his parents couch. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,I don't know.
6101.0,Patient,I barely even like socializing and like I don't like to bring guys into my room that much like this is my room. And i'm like i'm.
252.0,Provider,I space.
6101.0,Patient,I don't really know how to navigate it sometimes.
252.0,Provider,"Well, I agree with you because. You have to have your own space, you have to I do do. yeah space."
6101.0,Patient,"And I guess that's probably why I don't like that he lives on a couch like in a living room because he doesn't have his own space. So if I can't go over to his house and like get acquainted with his space and how he, like lives in his space. Then he's always here like if he want, if we want to hang out and he's always here i'm going to start feeling like. i'm protective of my space or kind of like. Why are you here all the time kind of."
252.0,Provider,smothered a little bit.
6101.0,Patient,yeah so I already know these things about myself and i'm like that's why I don't keep pressing play and i'm like hey did probably not gonna work until you have a place of your own.
252.0,Provider,And what that's what you're gonna tell them tell him that's not what you have told him that.
6101.0,Patient,Oh no I haven't told him anything yet i'm still figuring it out. dating isn't really annoying.
252.0,Provider,So. Are you looking at.
6101.0,Patient,"Nothing I was just thinking of like my parents lately because, like my parents, you know they both have been married twice and both of their marriages have lasted like years. And they never really had to go through. Online dating or dating new people all the time. And i'm like. What is that, like even I have friends like my best friend JESSICA has been with her boyfriend for like almost nine years. And i'm like Okay, how did you do that. I don't know how some people can fall into those patterns of like long term relationships and then like I would like a long term relationship and it's just this constant pattern of one day one day two dates. can't even get to a date stop talking, you know what I mean. it's too much."
252.0,Provider,"It is too much. I feel yeah. um I think that at some point I don't know, maybe the whole visit some point, somebody comes along that's actually real you know and. puts his best. I don't know. I just think it's a lot of work."
6101.0,Patient,yeah. A little too much work.
252.0,Provider,yeah a little too much for me definitely um. and your anxiety and depression how's your moods been.
6101.0,Patient,There okay.
252.0,Provider,"No, I mean."
6101.0,Patient,"No. I felt depressed I think a little bit like because of how much work i'm doing and I don't get paid for my work. And so it's just like that kind of compounding feeling of like I go to work I don't get paid I work after school like be. Like go to bed. And then I get up and I do it all over again. yeah that I was feeling depressed for like. A little while, but not enough to like. You know i'm pretty good at working through depression. And still like working and not letting it disable me."
252.0,Provider,yeah good.
6101.0,Patient,And I haven't really been feeling anxious at all.
252.0,Provider,Good.
6101.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"that's really, really good so you're in your mental health has been stable."
6101.0,Patient,"yeah taking my meds regularly and. China really like balance things like make sure that because I have been working so much, I was trying to be like more aware of like okay well i'm not going to do homework. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, or you know I don't feel great right now so i'm going to let myself rest instead of doing homework like. yeah really putting boundaries around the amount of work that I do outside of the school."
252.0,Provider,Well that's good.
6101.0,Patient,yeah. So it's been really helpful.
252.0,Provider,So cares important.
6101.0,Patient,"i'm just like having awareness of my moods i'm not like I was trying to mood journal for a while and I just can't really like keep up with it or make it a habit. yeah so now it's more just like a. Like a self check in. Like how do I. How do I feel, what do I need, what do I want to be feeling instead and how do I get there. kind of stuff."
252.0,Provider,that's still that's still Problem Solving right it's not sitting in the problem it's really trying to figure out how to get to the solution of what's happening.
6101.0,Patient,"Right, so I feel like that's been going well, as far as like. process. Like you know, the process of taking care of myself better. yeah I do find myself asking. myself. Like frequently. Like could this turn into a like a bipolar episodes and I still don't know what that. A couple weeks ago in group I was talking about making a like a plan. For my step mom in case I felt bipolar again like manic I mean manic I mean. But like i'm having a hard time making that plan, because I don't know that I will recognize mania in myself. When i'm manic."
252.0,Provider,With the people around you would.
6101.0,Patient,"yeah but the point is to not let myself get there. And so, like i'm like is the map is the amount that i'm working of work that i'm doing right now going to push me into a manic bipolar state. That and then i'll ask myself, like. I mean it's not sustainable, how hard i'm working right now is definitely not sustainable and I could potentially. I think become manic, but I also don't know because of my lithium being stable like will I hallucinate again. I don't know. These are just all these thoughts and questions related to you know that general idea."
252.0,Provider,"Well, I think that if you are self aware of when changes happen within you then you're going to be able to recognize it right off the BAT and. I do know that if you put too much thought and effort into it. You could possibly make it come going to happen right and so just knowing when you're overworking yourself. Right backing off making sure your self care stellar. Right, making sure that you're doing what you need to do for you to be healthy. I think all of those play a factor in and taking your meds, of course."
6101.0,Patient,"I think that becomes a problem is that I do overthink it and, like I worry about it."
252.0,Provider,"Well, I think that again don't overthink it, you know, because we can put ourselves in that State not even realize it, but just be self aware, for you, you know. Knowing when. Your sleep goes a little haywire or you know something's happening that doesn't feel. Normal. don't know that's what I think. You know. you've been trudging right along for a long time. You know you've been working your butt off and school in 100%. And you've been walking through it consistently. Without any issues. Remember that."
6101.0,Patient,"yeah. you're right it's, just like the pattern of like it's like it happens every two and a half to three years. And so you know, maybe i'm almost a year and a half after my last manic episode and i'm like oh no like now i'm moving closer to a new one and I. I don't know I don't want to."
252.0,Provider,"Well, and it necessarily doesn't have to be. It really doesn't, but if you put all the energy into it and all that fear fear driven thought process, then you could bring it on right. And so, do you better to say you know what i'm doing everything in my power right now to live the best life I possibly can, for me. and stay in that mindset. Be self aware about how you're feeling. You know if you start feeling strange, you know when something goes haywire with us mentally or emotionally we we start knowing it right and that's when you get your alert up. But if you put so much focus on, you know I got another year before it starts perking up. it's almost like we create that."
6101.0,Patient,"I wasn't necessarily the one who thought that to myself, it was like my roommate and my step mom. And my dad like for some reason, all at once they all wanted to talk to me about the time that I was manic, what do you remember what don't you remember, and then I was like oh my God like I forgot so much of the things that I did and. Like. I don't know ever since they started talking to me about that that's when the thought started, and I was like Okay, why did part of me wanted to be like, why do you guys want to talk about this like I don't want to talk about it it's traumatic. yeah, but it was dramatic for them to."
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm identifying that I don't think honestly i'm having if you look at a different point of view. You guys both it affected all of you guys and it should be something that you guys discuss it should be an open book that you guys are able to talk about, because how can they help you best you know what I mean, how can they be there to help you if it does happen again. You know what I mean and it helps them get off. What happened last time, because if it happens again, it could be, if it does, it could be a year, two years, five years 12 years you just don't know. What you've got to make sure that you're doing is that you're putting your best foot forward you're very self aware and that you're taking your medication, you are, you know eating as healthy as you can you're getting enough rest, you know. you're doing all of those things that you need to do to stay level and balanced."
6101.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely get more rest than I ever have. that's good yeah and I don't and I really like going out that much, but then Sometimes I get that like itch and i'm like Okay, I have to."
252.0,Provider,"You know yourself better than anybody. You know, when you need sleep, you know when you need to eat, you know, nobody else knows it better than you. And you know, supporting one another through it listen, I know that it was you know traumatic for you, just like it was for me. And I don't have these memories and you know these things about last time what I know is that if I start feeling different i'm going to come and tell you guys before it gets to that point. that's what I can do differently."
6101.0,Patient,"Okay yeah and like essentially like that's the plan, because I can't really come up with a plan, except for like. I don't know. I don't know what i'll do differently until I do it. And the last two times I just got I let myself get so sick I had to be hospitalized you know. So, to prevent that from happening. I just keep doing i've been doing."
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, and you're doing amazing."
6101.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
252.0,Provider,You know and that's what you got to remember. you're doing amazing.
6101.0,Patient,Oh yeah I don't think i'm doing I don't think i'm doing bad like. I feel like i'm healthier than i've ever been.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6101.0,Patient,But like I mean I could be healthier in general. Everybody could. But like I don't know mentally. i'm like way better than i've ever been.
252.0,Provider,"I think, so I mean, I really do as far as as long as i've known you, you know where you're at you're in a level headed. You know state you're able to manage your depression, you understand it, you know when it comes your your anxiety, the same thing and you're pushing through some of the toughest life stressors there are. school. You know, getting through school. So don't focus on what could happen. Right or what has happened. Just kind of support them and let them know that if I start feeling changes, this is my plan. But I don't want to I don't want it to be something that you guys are afraid of let's just be happy and live every day like we happen. You know. What I definitely think. We overthink it and it just turns into this big huge fear that the doomsday fear you know. it's going to happen anytime anytime you hear a cop, you know what I mean and you don't want to live like that."
6101.0,Patient,Now I really down it's annoying.
252.0,Provider,"Very much so so don't. y'all know if anything starts changing or you go into a manic episode because you'll feel different, and the first signs of it you're going to tell them and you're going to go and get checked out and see if you're in a manic state, I mean that's all you can do."
6101.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,But until then don't overthink it live do what you're doing because you're doing freakin amazing.
6101.0,Patient,Thank you.
252.0,Provider,Okay.
6101.0,Patient,All right.
252.0,Provider,"So, which plan for Christmas."
