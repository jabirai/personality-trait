For like um. For psychology I was going to school for like substance abuse counseling and. I ended up just like I was always relaxing you know what I mean like I was always like at that age in my life, like, I was always like trying to like go to meetings in Chicago. And like going like the a and a scene and stuff like that, but it never works like it never works for me, so I was just like all right. Like i'm just going to keep on going on these benches, which was stupid, but you know, like addicts like they do what they do just to feed their addiction, you know and. I was out of control, but then, then I going away actually like saved my life like. Like I told you, in the first time I met you guys like. I was telling everybody, I was like that's that changed everything like maybe I had to go through that to become like who I am today, you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah definitely. No, was it. Was it heroin was that the main thing. yeah it was heroin okay. yeah yeah I mean it probably did save your life."

13226.0,Patient,"I am a girl Okay, yes um I was supposed to get off. Early discharged because I was doing really well and stuff like that, and then I got in trouble I got in a fight with someone because my friend, like they stepped to my friend, and I was at I skateboard. And I was at the skate park and we were skateboarding and just hanging out and they tried to like jump my friend, so I like jumped in and started to fight and i'm the only one that got charged because of. He ran away, and then I took the charge. Okay, so i'm fighting that right now, because there was kind of a self Defense like the guy swung on me and tried to hit me. And I just stuck up for myself and father he's the one that called the police, but I didn't because I don't believe in calling the police, I thought I told him I said listen. let's leave this between me and you, you know what I mean, and he didn't and then I tried to ask the police at the time when they arrested me I said listen, can I press charges as well. Because he fought me too, and they said no it's too late, so I talked to my parole about it, they said, you know, like you have a history of like not not they said that you have a history but. They said it's not that big of a deal because it's a misdemeanor. So they said that. I could fight it and still get off early."

I you know i'm real nice he's nice to me, he was gonna let me off if I beat the case i'm taking it to trial because, if he said that if the kid that usually if the guy doesn't show up, then you know, some people just don't want to go to court so like tesla right."
304.0,Provider,"or whatever, no case."
13226.0,Patient,"it's just a fight like it's. it's like if you were at a bar in like maybe you I don't know in your husband or whatever, and like someone stepped to you, and he fought him just to defend you. You know what I mean like it's similar situation. yeah but."
304.0,Provider,"it's like a bad or you know, like a misdemeanor."
13226.0,Patient,"yeah but it's still it's still shitty because I have like a past and and I should be I should be walking away from situations, instead of like drawing into them. Which is hard you know."
304.0,Provider,"Well, looks like kind of just put that on something out and that you're aware of it. And that can be something you want to work on, you know and we. talk a lot about emotions and thoughts and behaviors and how those all meld together and just. You know, reacting, we can all react right and. In violent ways, but we want to respond, you know, take a deep breath walk away verbal you know, whatever it is versus yes, especially just so that you don't get in trouble. yeah Okay, and your kiddos so you have twins."

So my my problem is is that. I have to like take away my past. and tell him, you know you got to tell the. teacher instead of handling it yourself, or whatever, but at the same time they're doing well they're doing really well and. yeah."
304.0,Provider,"yeah all the kids to I mean kindergartens, a big deal anyway, but if they weren't. yeah home on and dependent make you know, and now this is their first yeah. Being away from home so."
13226.0,Patient,"yeah. they're they're definitely a little homesick like when they're home sometimes they don't want to go to school. You know, because they want to sit and watch TV or whatever, because that's what they've been doing during the pandemic and stuff but I don't know it's it's it's all good it's just a transitional period so they'll they'll just."

13226.0,Patient,"yeah but there's also like the same like. I don't know how to explain it there's like the same kind of concepts in a way, but it's not as serious but yeah she's from Egypt and. She came here and yeah we're still together and she's always been along with me through everything so she's really laid back you know, and I actually had a girlfriend for very long time before it within my addiction. She was um. How can I said she's actually she went to the Adler school psychology for substance abuse counseling. And she liked it that, because you wanted to try and like save me in a way um but it didn't so and like went downhill, you know what I mean like she thought she could save me but no, you can't save an addict if they're not willing to change their life."

It actually like flew by because I was in school, I was working when I was there and I was actually trying to like build the life, so that when I came out i'd be able to like so like since I have so much such of a background. it's hard for me to find like a normal office job or like you know at the border trade, like passing tickets for traders, or whatever you know something like that that I did before, before I got locked up. But um now, I have to like build my own business."
304.0,Provider,Right. And you're thinking it's kind of just based on the weather and.

I just I don't like construction, I wanted to get into the Union they hire felons but I didn't want to get into the Union because they hire you, and then they they lay you off to collect unemployment for winter, you know, so you work when it's warm. And then. And I need to work, like all year round. Right so."
304.0,Provider,"At least you could. Get the unemployment and not just get seasonal employment but yeah sure okay well so so yeah Adam like I mean definitely that's something you're working on, but as far as like your recovery are you feeling. Good you've been on suboxone already for a little while before you came to break, are you feeling pretty stable with that."
13226.0,Patient,"yeah I am I noticed one thing, though, like I do get your take on it, I get your double. Okay, and I told Dr Steve. On that, I would like to when I met him we spoke for a while and I told him my situation and I also told him that I had been on two mil up to eight milligram films which is 16 milligrams.

You know, or I."
13226.0,Patient,"Did I. saw my old therapist she does private practice now, which is kind of a bummer. because she was working through an agency or whatever before and clomid and then coven hit and I guess I kind of dropped her because I was just I felt Okay, and I was like it's all good. Every month. And then, and then I was like okay like I actually need her. like to talk to her it's it's good to talk to her."
