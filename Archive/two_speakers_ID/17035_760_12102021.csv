760.0,Provider,well. hi how you.
17035.0,Patient,"doing well, thank you, how are you."
760.0,Provider,"doing good. doing good. But How has it been since it's been about a couple weeks, I think, since last we met so. In this time, have you been. um we talked about."
17035.0,Patient,"All things considered, pretty well i've definitely had some days, where I felt like I wasn't in control of my emotions and add symptoms and things like that, but otherwise been doing really well and I think I finally worked out, they say, I hope the right medication dosage and. Things like that."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's starting to get better, more effective for you."
17035.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely I started taking the 30 milligrams as opposed to the 20 milligrams of the Admiral instant release and it's been. Only a few days on it and usually, when I up the dose a few days of really great relief and then it seems to taper down i'm just hoping it doesn't say for now."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so we still still uncertain because it's so pretty. Okay, all right. Okay, well, so the purpose of today we you know it's kinda is to work together to create a treatment plan and. So that we can focus on the areas that we're going to work on now i'm looking at depression, anxiety. Your cannabis use and other stimulus abuse. So are those areas you want to work on."
17035.0,Patient,"The cannabis use I don't really feel like I have much to work on there, the other stimulants use I wasn't quite clear when I was answering the questionnaire I just meant the prescription adderall but i'm taking. Aside from that, and I apologize for that misconception."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay. All right, okay so right now is the depression, the anxiety. And the chronic pain."
17035.0,Patient,"yeah well chronic pain is it's kind of a lifelong thing that i've been dealing with it it's not something that's really at the top of my list of like Oh, I need this taken care of the biggest one actually for me that I didn't hear you touch on was the ADHD."
760.0,Provider,symptoms okay.
17035.0,Patient,yeah I think that's the one that actually is debilitating for me.
760.0,Provider,yeah we talked about focusing on your goals that was one thing that we were going to talk about was I didn't make a note about that.
17035.0,Patient,"Size i'm the worst with prioritization time management, and I feel like i'm missing something in my brain. Being able to prioritize normally being able to look at a you know, a list a to do list that i've over extended myself with them and be able to say, oh no I really don't need to do this i'm trying to get better at that, but i'm. it's almost to me unrealistic how bad I am at that and I almost feel like i'm trying to do that, but I was never taught how to do it properly."
760.0,Provider,"Do you do you think you have a perfectionist IQ side to yourself that you want to free up and take care, all these things and make sure, everything is like perfect or neat you. scribes."
17035.0,Patient,"Okay, absolutely when we talked about performance anxiety, first of all i'd never heard the term before, but that would just like resonated with me, so much so. You know, one of my big OCD kind of. traits is that when I see a problem they have a very difficult time resting or kind of calming my mind until I figure out a solution for the problem of."
760.0,Provider,"You know plan for solution which which kind of probably brides the anxiety to. be kind of unreal to be unrealistic about what one intends to do, I mean you may have the best intentions to want to get this done but there's this other side of you over here that knows that's really not realistic, and so that creates this like. You know, huge cycle yeah it's been turned out, I never thought I had anxiety, I never even would tell somebody oh i'm an anxious person."
17035.0,Patient,"And it took meeting with the psychologist for the first time to ever seen no not only ADHD you also definitely having. And when I started kind of keeping that somewhere in the back of my head. it's not that you know I started noticing it more whatever, but it was very clear to me that that's something i'd almost kind of grown up thinking was normal and put in the back of my head and ignored and. It didn't really I felt like it didn't affect me in the present moment type of thing. Okay, but the worst that my expectation, you know, like, as you said, having expectations of yourself that lead to that dangerous cycle, the more a. State in that dangerous cycle, the longer i'm in it the worst I feel anxiety wise and I definitely agree with you that that anxiety is very likely a big big component of it is, and you know the inability that knowing that i'm unable to do the things i'm overextending yourself with. Some some form of them."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm thinking. And i'm just going to make a suggestion, if you don't need a lot my suggestions or it doesn't work for you. I want you to feel free to to say that, because at the end of the day, this is not my treatment plan, although i'm helping you. Focus what you want to do at the end of the day, it's your treatment plan because it's your life and it's your goals and. So. i'm going to make some suggestions and just feel free to express if you disagree or don't like something or maybe I misinterpret something. I want to be corrected in that, so I want you to feel free to do that so with That being said, i'm thinking about doing working on some cognitive behavioral stuff. You know what that is right."
17035.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely i've. tried very, very. Basically brushing on it, but nowhere near as much as they should."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and because it's kind of like a cycle, we have you know, we have our thoughts and and then because we're human beings, because we we develop we are kind of habitual. And so, even our thoughts can become habitual and the ways we like to do things, and so our thinking is kind of a driver that causes us to feel certain emotions, either on the pleasant or the unpleasant side doesn't matter. And then, based on that we. Choose behaviors, and this is kind of like this cycle and then, when we get stuck in a rut it just keeps feeding on itself and it gets growing and growing and getting bigger and bigger so part of cognitive behavioral therapy, would be to. kind of look at that, like study on that and. be open to thinking in different ways, or just kind of questioning oneself. A little bit, and you know of course that's what the session you're not going to be doing that, on your own obviously i'm going to be doing that, with you, so you know if your ADHD and you're wanting to focus on your goals is important to you then. You know that would be something that I would like to start with. Based on what i'm sensing from you and the way your way you're sharing with me right now is that, am I reading that right."
17035.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah I think that's a great place to start with, and I think that's one of my biggest priorities and goals right now. is to really stop myself, because I know a lot of times when I get into that ad ADHD thinking that i'm feeling like almost irrational type of thing. And I were a rubber band for a few months, just trying to kind of like snap it whenever I felt myself going through a stream of thoughts or losing my train of focus or. Whatever and I helped it helped tremendously. And I found the. Longer I weren't the less affected head for some reasons."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, maybe you became kind of desensitized."
17035.0,Patient,To it exactly I almost didn't really. stinger hurt anymore or anything like that.
760.0,Provider,I think sometimes I think. human nature responds better to positive reward.
17035.0,Patient,I would agree.
760.0,Provider,"You know that. You know. It could be a reminder, but I wouldn't want it to sing. Because there's a part of us that wants to rebel. When when we're being punished, you know, even if it's if i'm the one that's doing the punishment to myself, you know, so we can work through that. i'd also like to add to the list. Maybe not right away, but working towards looking at some of the irrational thoughts kind of taking a look at that. With that in mind how would you feel about doing a homework assignment."
17035.0,Patient,i'd love to.
760.0,Provider,"To prepare for the next time we get together. I would want you to. I don't want you to feel like you have to act on all of this, but if you could maybe write down some of your long term goals and then maybe some of your shorter term goals. And then maybe do some journaling on. How. You know what your mind what you know how you want to execute on these, what does your mind want to do to execute on these, so we can kind of discuss that and break that down."
17035.0,Patient,That sounds great.
760.0,Provider,"And then I also want to work on looking at the perfectionism side, do you think you've always been a perfectionist person."
17035.0,Patient,"Was I had the upbringing, for it my mom was owner of a very large educational company."
760.0,Provider,"And oh that's yes Okay, so you were kind of. As your questions that way. that's right you you shared that with me so yeah so that's that was kind of instilled in you, so do you think you were like that from like a very, very young age, like elementary school or earlier."
17035.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it was. Absolute excellence was expected of me, since as long as I can remember, probably a kindergarten level even. Yes, I was being put into. math competitions at nine years old and getting scolded when I got in a second, so I was. You know I brought him anything anything less than an a minus was not acceptable else, so it was a pretty pretty strict."
760.0,Provider,"yeah we talked about that Okay, so what are some of the things you say to yourself. about getting these certain tasks."
17035.0,Patient,You know I know that okay so right now it's I guess the best way I can perceive it as a bad habit bad pattern that i've fallen into in terms of overextending myself for not knowing how to manage my time. But I know very to think it's a mindless thing like it's like an unconscious thing they.
760.0,Provider,Believe do it.
17035.0,Patient,"genuinely believe Simon I put you know let's say I know I always put too many things on my to do list for the day and then I have you know. You know I know I need to take I know it's unrealistic I know it's there's no way i'm going to get even a small amount of those things done, if I don't be more realistic about it and kind of. Really. You know downsize and things like that, and then, when I look and try and downsides to schedule I can't my brain just does not see a difference between the things on there it doesn't see prioritization it doesn't see. One is being more important than the other, it just sees Oh, you must do that it has to get done those things are things that must get done and I can't decide which ones need to get them more and why and, for some reason the mind the you know the. The thought process that goes into that, for some reason escapes me i'm not that it's you know I don't know how to do it, it just doesn't happen."
760.0,Provider,"And what do you think is going to happen if you make a mistake or what's going to happen to you what's the worst that's gonna happen to you that if you do things out of order and maybe do the fourth thing the fourth most important thing, instead of the first most important thing. What is."
17035.0,Patient,"That the semi semi questionable, you know life situation that i'm already in they based on my own kind of. You know, decisions is going to get even worse, and I, you know I live under kind of pressure to I don't know I don't want to say. Not yeah I always feel like i'm kind of under pressure and not to fail, you know that I always have to worry about succeeding and. constantly be anxious, or you know, whatever about making sure that i'm not. setting myself up for failure or doing anything that could cause us to you know go lower on the totem pole in life, so to speak, and I don't know if that's i'm sure it's from my parents and. Trying to impress them and I, you know the the way I kind of left my parents household when I was very young. Was them telling me you're never going to make it as anything in this world you're not worth anything because you're not finishing your college degree until you have. The piece of paper you're not going to succeed at anything in life, and so I kind of left it in the sense of i've always been since 14 years old and that mindset of. You not proving necessarily to them, but almost proving to myself that whether or not i've got that piece of paper that I can be a success, and unfortunately. various factors, making things a little bit difficult than my life and for decision making on my part that's been kind of a little bit of a battle with myself to make sure that i'm staying afloat and also not Oh, you know. I don't know how to. continue that but it's."
760.0,Provider,"financially or having we talking basic needs or. Maybe just. desires, you know there's certain things that we have our basic needs are food, shelter clothing. Medical there, but then we have other like more altruistic needs like the need for socialization and getting out and maybe some time traveling or spin spending time with people we care about and. That requires money as well, so. When you're talking in these terms are we talking about the most basic core needs, or are we talking about the."
17035.0,Patient,"yeah it's a financial, primarily, and you know, we had a couple of periods, so my fiancee and I have been. with him for 11 years now and. we've had a call where. We went you know we were homeless for a little while at a time there was there was a month, where we slept in our car for a lot of it."
760.0,Provider,And you had you were working on a home loan to right.
17035.0,Patient,Right yeah right now we're working on a home loan.
760.0,Provider,that's still in process.
17035.0,Patient,"In process it's one of the more stressful portions of life right. yeah we we ended up getting final approval from the mortgage underwriters our lender congratulated us and said can't wait to hand you the keys and then four days later, I thought they were just finalizing the closing documents of loan fell through. yeah and so we're now currently. 61 days into a 30 day close and we're paying daily rent reimbursement and where the only reason we're doing that and trying to stay in this game is because. The minute the lender sentence that email saying you got it this, this was a week after the initial underwriter approval so. When he sent this final underwriter approval we were already kind of leaving the game to remove the last contingency so we went right ahead that day and remove the loan contingency that very night. And unfortunately if we aren't staying in the running for the House, we risked card security deposit which my parents, help us with the down payment. Luckily, and so the deposit was fairly substantial we probably could not rebuild very easily from that and your future and with a baby literally do any day now. We yeah we're trying to. we're trying to. Make sure that we're not staying in that place it's too small for us or not ending up in the worst situation where we have to move in with mom or grandma in a one bedroom. apartment you know, in order to effectively save quickly to. redo the process."
760.0,Provider,yeah that's a lot of pressure. Be yeah I can see that that's that's kind of an immediate need.
17035.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Even Marcel because of the little one on the way.
17035.0,Patient,"yeah and it's just honestly like i'm used to hurdles and everything like that I expected it obviously going into this process but. The way it presented itself, it really did up read a lot of our planning and it ended up you know, putting us. position where we're spending up front and extreme and a half thousand dollars and potentially up to 16 17,000 losing out of the deal in terms of settling for worse loan. And daily rental reimbursement an extra month that our current rental law. But that I expected it was just the way that it's presenting itself like right now, you know the lender shirts, whatever happens, by the 17th you will close. No matter what that was already, but you know, I was astounded i'm like, why is it going to take us longer to get a non conventional loan and conventional loan. Supposedly easier to get more expensive and level blood, he said no, I just want to be 100% certain that I can get it for you it'll probably be earlier than that so now we're getting you know down to."
760.0,Provider,December 17.
17035.0,Patient,"yeah we get seven days left I haven't signed any closing documents get nothing like that, but I was supposed to be getting closing documents for the last three days and so always kind of says it's the way it's presenting itself where they're really like worrying me now and, like. It should be fairly simple and straightforward just a waiting game type of thing, but in reality it seems like they're still experiencing, whatever hurdles, they are in the background and not being very straightforward about it with me so i'm just sitting there. praying for the best. Marketing doesn't fall through a second time, God forbid."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17035.0,Patient,"But that that's the worry that i've had in terms of the House with everything else, things are going really well, I mean we are a little bit i've been having a lot of anxiety because we very last minute late in the game decided to potentially do a home birth, as opposed to at a hospital. Oh, my goodness. That carries implications beyond what I can describe obviously so it's been a little bit stressful trying to adapt to that, but I also have to you know kind of consider my fiance's wishes and make sure that she's in the best position she can be in."
760.0,Provider,"And does she do you have a plan B, if something were to go wrong, I suppose that she would go to the hospital okay."
17035.0,Patient,"So, luckily where we're at right now we are literally walking distance from the. county hospital. I wouldn't want to end up at the county hospital, by any means, but life threatening emergency obviously we're two minutes away cars gassed up and ready to go. there's a hospital in between the one that we're registered at if it's non life threatening emergency, but we need to get there faster that's eight minutes away and the hospital, they were registered at is 18 and a half minutes. it's it's doable and we're obviously ready to go, so we don't need to call an ambulance wait if we need to have. Supplies we're working right now tirelessly to get this amazing midwife covered through our medical insurance. Some it'll be amazing if we can manage to do that because they just recently started covering that kind of service, and that would be your night and day in terms of being able to do it at home or not. yeah okay fiancees determined to try and see how it feels at home and proceed based on. i'm sure to support you every step of the way, no matter what she wants."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right i'm."
17035.0,Patient,"Sorry, to go this."
760.0,Provider,"No, no it's that's that's good if you're dealing with a lot and it's important that you get that out, you know that's that's a lot of lot of pressure you're under so. So the other thing that we can talk about i'm talking about the anxiety. you've been going to groups now right. yeah at least one group at and how. Are you."
17035.0,Patient,"I love them actually i'm so grateful that I found this particular place for psychiatry because the elements that i've gotten the psychology aspect and the group therapy sessions and it wasn't expecting you know I also see a psychologist outside of rate heart health and so. supplemental freemium that's been really cool to be able to see. You know more than one practitioner every week that's really, really."
760.0,Provider,yeah and then you see them in the group. So what are some of the coping skills that you're learning in in group. I think we talked a little bit last time about mindfulness.
17035.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,What are what are the coping skills you're learning.
17035.0,Patient,"You know i've I just only finished my second group but i'm definitely learning when it comes to being more aware of what's going on in my mind and being able to. understand when things are random or intrusive or not really rational and go kind of take a little extra step to stop those thoughts and I think that for me. You know I used to complain to my fiance and her mom a lot that I would have. As a child, I would have all these very negative thoughts random negative thoughts people dying gory stuff and the world type stuff randomly popping i'd be a happy go lucky child, you know not that. I consider myself as a great chat that so you know things considered, I was kind of wondering where they were coming from, but I was having no trouble. stifling those feelings and just going to melt there you know when when it came to. feelings that wouldn't like thoughts that were not oh like crazy in your face terrible whatever I have trouble stiffening those feelings because they're not as in your face like oh that shouldn't be. Something you're even thinking about, or whatever you know, like if you're thinking about death earlier whatever you're kind of able to say oh you're you know 30 years old way thinking about this now shut up and get back to life enjoy the present moment."
760.0,Provider,up the simpler stuff for me is a little bit.
17035.0,Patient,more difficult to.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, what does slow down and and. Okay, so it's."
17035.0,Patient,"really been working on and that's honestly a skill that the group is really kind of made me fortify, even though I was working on that before. Okay, really."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and that's a process that's that's like a it's like a practice it's something that you build it doesn't come all at once, and you know and we're not going to. You know, even if you're practicing mindfulness for years you're still going to find your mind is going to kind of ruminate and. I always like to go back to the non judgmental side of it, and when I catch it i've kind of learned how not to beat myself up over that because I messed up my mindfulness practice. So yeah so that's something that I would like to work on as well kind of goes hand in hand with the other stuff because I think when we're feeling anxious or. Certainly, when we're trying to plan we're not really in the present moment, and you know you know we're thinking about the past, or maybe in your case, maybe it's more often worry about future, at least not at least right now. So, taking the deep breath and being in the present moment. Is it is a good way of doing that so okay so working on perfectionism. Focusing on goals mindfulness practice how about relaxation activities how good, are you at that is that something you want to work on."
17035.0,Patient,"i'm pretty wonderful at that i've been lately i've been getting into meditating a little bit more and really get excited. You know, coming myself down at the end of the day, and even in between certain stressful parts of the day. I try to kind of focus on the self care a lot, right now, because i've noticed that that's directly. I tried for a long many, many years I was so focused on taking care of the people around me that I completely went to self care and when it's not important you're young you're strong whatever. And then, of course, start noticing that it's taking a tool it's now i'm trying to make sure that i'm taking care of myself just as well."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, but also with the chronic pain. Or the health issues, you know, using mindfulness and meditation can help it's not going to take away pain, or anything like that, but it can help you manage the stress of dealing with that. So."
17035.0,Patient,"that's actually been tremendous for me because I had a long period of time, where I didn't even realize where you know I just felt pain from all areas in my lower back and I didn't really have any. mindfulness to quantify where exactly it was coming from what I was experiencing I couldn't even describe the pain to a doctor or any. You know, physical therapist because I didn't I just told them I have excruciating pain in my lower back from here to here, but what kind of thing you know throbbing aching burning whatever for some reason it was. wasn't until many, many years of having that pain probably almost six seven years, having that pain, before I started being able to understand that I need to quantify where it's coming from how it feels all those different things, and the more I started focusing on that the less it hurt. Because my mind perpetuated the pain is going oh your lower back is hurting everywhere in your lower back is going to hurt it's just something you're going to get used to. Instead, now it's you know i'm I know it's very specific points in my back that the pain is coming from i'm kind of able to go. You know my mindfulness I don't want to sit keeps the pain down because it keeps my bullshit meter of you know you should think from going off maybe. you're experiencing more pain than you actually are, but that I feel is one of my you know big like I I drive myself into a hole with anxiety sometimes Dreading. Dental procedures and things like that that really aren't. A big deal or whatever i'm sitting there constantly playing them out of my head and."
760.0,Provider,"I always think of the worst case scenario, and then we get to the situation and it's really not that bad. i'm sorry i've been specially when it comes to the dentist."
17035.0,Patient,"was the biggest devil's advocate in life, and so, unfortunately, developed that the trying to break that habit as well."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all right, so it sounds like you're already doing that and. insomnia. How has that been."
17035.0,Patient,"A lot better actually so it's been since I was a. Little kid I remember 1011 years old, I was already enabled to sleep and even after exhaustion physical activity to the extent of multiple class sports class in a day and whatever. And when I started using cannabis at a very early age, it was my kind of saving grace with that and didn't have any issues within Sonia until I started taking adderall. With That being said, it was rough for a little while that was also kind of the little battle my fiance loves to fall asleep with the TV playing and I can't stand sounds more like. Now we're kind of on the same page unless she says, you know i'm enjoying it, but the last one, the baby gets there, there has to be a separation of day and night, obviously, and so. she's going to you know turn the TV off at a certain point at night after the baby gets there so she's enjoying a little lesson so then."
760.0,Provider,"Your day and night is going. back to my room, but I figured it's no need to make it worse by having a TV on through the day and then through the net. Okay, all right Okay, but you but you were sleeping better so that's."
17035.0,Patient,"Much either getting a better. term to really maintain good habits, to make sure that I see."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so it seems to me that you're. The main thing is what we've already talked about the focusing on the goals and the at the ADHD um What about the depression, how we, how is that."
17035.0,Patient,"it's not serious at all for me honestly i've never even noticed it being like a very I know it's there obviously I know I get my depressive moments, and whatever amount of them i'm like almost irrationally kind of upset about things that. shouldn't be upset about, to the point where it's making me feel like life is you know not as great as it actually is, but that's not something that I can't shake very quickly or that. really affects me in such a negative way, so I. really want to be clear that I haven't you know do experience that it's not. Definitely that's something I haven't been able to manage, in my opinion, fairly well."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. How about is there any health habits that you feel you want to change or or where do you where do you feel you are at with that."
17035.0,Patient,"I would really love to improve my diet i've been trying really hard years of you know, I was raised on ramen noodles and hot pockets man. said that that's the diet for you and that's. What I had long story short i've been ever since I met my fiance who was very much into the holistic. Lifestyle yes, you."
760.0,Provider,Should you shared that yeah.
17035.0,Patient,"yeah so ever since i've been trying to get better and better, and I mean I for a long time, I felt like a lot of I knew a lot of my issues with my stomach and discomfort and whatever came from not eating breakfast in the morning. Never eat breakfast in the morning, so very recently. The first psychiatrist that I met with the prescribed to the adderall and says, you cannot think this stuff on an empty stomach. It was getting by that time I already knew how bad breakfast was affecting me I was trying to get it in it. As much as I could, and it was working out to maybe once or twice a week, if I was lucky. The minute that I started taking adderall I tried to say like hey This is my one chance to you know light a fire under my butt, and so I nowadays I try to make sure that I don't take the medication. Until I eat. And I know how bad I get when I don't take the medication and so it's been very easy for me to actually make an everyday habit out of breakfast so for the last I think four or five months definitely been eating breakfast every day. Okay it's been kind of a little bit monotone lot of the but that's breakfast what."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
17035.0,Patient,I feel.
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes we fall into like a rut with breakfast because. You know we're in a hurry and and then we eat the same thing and oh I don't feel like. Eating this, but at least you're eating. Exactly Monday. Okay, so."
17035.0,Patient,"So that's the only area of diet that you. know I mean now that I eat breakfast a lot, I feel like we're eating just non stop. I always joke that I want to be more towards the vegetarian side type of thing that I want to eat more Greens more salad more, and then we end up planning ourselves at burger joints or state houses or whatever, or you know preparing the same type stuff at home and it's, not to say. That i'm you know terribly disappointed with myself, because I made a lot of progress but. In terms of my health, I feel like that's the area where i'm still really struggling, because I feel like my stomach is a very good picture of what i'm doing and it's not feeling all that all that amazing on a daily basis."
760.0,Provider,So do you So how do you cut back on me do you try to like make it a habit like maybe a couple days a week to eat vegetarian all day or.
17035.0,Patient,"I mean, I would say just eat more salads to make a more habit of getting more vegetables at the grocery store and trying to focus on being. Vegetable centric for as many of the meals, as I can just you know, actually, instead of just saying and doing it type of thing, because I know, realistically, what I want to do in terms of improving my diet, but. i've been saying this for not a short period of time."
760.0,Provider,"Okay well there's this other things i've heard people do things like meatless Monday, for instance. And it's got. One day, out of the week, which is the first day of the week so it's kind of easier to you know. Make that your meatless day. And maybe do some I know you're probably busy, but you know, try to find like one or two vegetarian options, I find I like to find things on YouTube because I like to try to work on my diet as well, and so i'll go Google some recipes on YouTube. And, and you can find some really good. vegetarian options. And a lot of lot of the recipes some of them are kind of complicated but there's many things that I find online that are like really quick and simple and you've got these these little videos and I find a lot of good stuff like that."
17035.0,Patient,And no youtube's a blessing for that.
760.0,Provider,"yeah and I, like this one particular website, although it's not all vegetarian they do have a lot of vegetarian food and it's called the Mediterranean dish and so it's like Italian slash Greek type food those. Things so it's like very healthy like you know, olives and olive oil and those kinds of things and there's a whole bunch of vegetarian options on that website."
17035.0,Patient,Definitely check it out.
760.0,Provider,"yeah so so you know so maybe I don't know if you like, the idea or, if you want to think about it, to maybe one day a week doing vegetarian, since you brought up."
17035.0,Patient,"That see. I mean that sounds great I think it's definitely a great goal to kind of quantify seven tray randomly sporadically throughout the week to substitute wherever I can try and keep veggies, but I think just saying like hey. One day, at least devoted entirely to vegetarian at least it'll start, I guess, a trend or an upward cycle of some kind."
760.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17035.0,Patient,Go throughout the week try to you know stick stay good where we can but. At least one day will be in.
760.0,Provider,"One day. Is a step, because otherwise you know we get in this. Going back to that perfectionist stick mindset like oh i've got to be it's like an all or nothing thing. For you. that's good practice for you one day a week so that means you can eat meat six days a week."
17035.0,Patient,"That was just the then I don't drive myself crazy thinking Oh, where do I need to you know, be better or whatever, in order to meet my goals."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and sometimes change happens gradually you know, sometimes you know we get overwhelming we get overwhelmed. And then I don't know, maybe we just get like super frustrated and then we just like throw in the towel and and give up and. then go back to square one, so it's better to take a step in this direction and kind of give yourself time because you do have a lot of. Change positive change, and a lot of stress on your plate and little things little ways those little things will make you feel good to know that every Monday i'm eating or you pick the day and i'm eating meatless one day a week. And then, over time, you might find it it just naturally goes the other way and you just you can you can grow it from there, maybe when you're starting to get some of these problems resolved, you can kind of grow it from there, maybe take it to two days a week or whatever."
17035.0,Patient,"and see that'd be really great I feel like you know, taking the mind of the same way, how I you know constantly beating myself up about breakfast. My psychologist at the time was like no you can't decide what to eat for breakfast every morning when you get up, you have to have one or two staples that you get up every morning, and that we don't. Put your mind to to shame, when you wake up every morning honestly I don't know if it's based on the person or whatever, but. For me just getting up in the morning, starting, not knowing already Oh, I have you know this particular dish i'm going to go and start making know, while still half asleep, for some reason, having to think about what I wanted was so much of a mental chore that. drove me into. Not wanting to have breakfast into being happy about the morning and to be grumpy already wrong side of the bed thick thing that really was a daily occurrence so. Even something that's simple with changing the small habits, like you said you know just this Monday tip thing one less thing I have to feel like i'm accountable for you know not eating fish. mm hmm."
760.0,Provider,"yeah yeah go go find some of those websites and then I i've been wanting to check out because I was watching on the TV, the other day. Paul mccartney's daughter is a vegan I did not know that I guess they're all vegans and she's she's a chef and she has a channel. And i've been meaning to check her out as far as her dishes but so you can go all the way with her with complete vegan I don't know if that's what your goal is but can't hurt."
17035.0,Patient,"Definitely up in the goal, but as far towards it, as I can give you know, the more the merrier, so to speak, yeah. I definitely love my meat, I definitely love my animal products, to a certain extent, but I would prefer happy animals, I would prefer as much plant as possible okay."
760.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, so this is another suggestion I have I haven't had a chance to check her out yet, though."
17035.0,Patient,"Right. We kind of try to look up recipes I tried to free 10 day, the other day, for the first time in my life and and split it up, so I don't know what I made but long story short, I ended up trying, a lot of things and then realizing oh 4am in the kitchen. it's discouraging but I gotta keep on pushing into like maybe."
760.0,Provider,"Maybe watching a video sometimes if i'm on certain I like and leave the video on my computer. I might pull my laptop put it in the kitchen put pause. or i'll make little notes, and you can watch them do it. Another way. visit it's yeah if you can learn how to do that, perhaps, perhaps the the perfectionist excited you. Sometimes i've noticed that when I prepare a new dish I kind of I might mess it up a little bit. And then, and then I think Oh, I think they can change this one little things, but if i'm so focused on all this is all messed up and then I just throw the recipe out i'm back to square one, so. You know, I think that would be one thing for you to look at is that you know people human beings, we learn a lot through making mistakes, you know and and if I beat myself up every time I make a mistake that really prevents my learning from that. That would be one thing that I would encourage you to look at."
17035.0,Patient,"That makes me that that's very understandable and I really do need to work on beating myself up a little bit less about the simple stuff I I feel like. I feel like for me, one of the things that I really actually have a problem with beating myself up about is thinking that i'm I constantly have this thought that i'm missing some sort of frame of mind or thought process that normal people might have in terms of. I always feel like i'm missing big picture stuff that anybody can see clear as day that the minute that I am showing a mirror or told by another person or anything like that I go. No two year old in their right mind could have missed this it's like the most basic element of whatever concept its burden. And I feel like I do beat myself up about that a lot, because I almost feel like it's a chemical issue or like you know, like a nearly balance issue what but it's very frustrating that that's occurred."
760.0,Provider,"I think, Daniel is what happens is like the human brain is really only capable of focusing on a couple of things at once, and so. If i'm focus on these two things and let's say they're negative maybe it's some perfectionist its side of myself and i'm all i'm thinking about i've got to figure out what to eat for breakfast, for instance, or or this then there's all these things going around that you. Because we don't see things like that and and. My son showed me this video, the other day, which was really kind of interesting. about it kind of shows the way the mind works in the end, if you bear with me i'll get to the point of it is this video of. These people shooting basketball shots and the narrator asks the audience okay look at all these different people and count the number of free free throw shots that they make. And so they so you're busy counting watching you know, looking at the numbers but they're all wearing their basketball uniform and you know how many did. You know number five get on you did number six get and etc, and then, when the so this goes on for a few minutes. And everybody makes their shots and then at the end of the video the narrator comes back and instead of asking you how many shots did you know number 10 get he asks you how many of you saw the gorilla. And in the background of the of the of the basketball is this person in a gorilla suit running across. And a lot of people don't see it because they're so busy focused on this number and how many shots they don't see that. And so. In cvt when we're when we're being perfectionist it and. that's why you're not seeing because your mind is focused here. Does that make some sense to you."
17035.0,Patient,hundred percent the computer also slows down when you open 50 tabs of once.
760.0,Provider,"Yes. it's completed, we can. We can process the computer unfortunately about."
17035.0,Patient,This and I know I know the cycle i'm putting myself in I put too much on my plate that I get upset that i'm putting too much on my plate when I do it all over again. Okay.
760.0,Provider,"Well then, that's. Another thing we could add to this mix would be working towards some affirmations to kind of lead program some of that. Because you're not going to just stop being a perfectionist that person you're you're going to need to replace that with something more healthy. And one of the best ways of doing that, in my experience is an affirmation and in the affirmation can be something that I think several times to the day for the day. Or you know, or sometimes even if i'm alone, I may say it out loud, because that helps me process that a little bit more, because, as many times as I say it that's kind of a rewiring process i'm rewiring my brain with that more positive more balanced way of looking or believing or thinking. Excellent so nations going to add that. as well. So. you're going to work on. The goals, make a list of goals. In. The next in the next two weeks right. And just I don't want you to start executing them any so much because I don't want to I don't want to be continued to feed the perfection is stressful side, I just want you to kind of process what you're thinking, and so we can talk about that. And then the other thing i'm going to ask you to do is to. start looking for some positive information affirmations that you might like. It can be anything you know it can be anything. And, and maybe i'll see if I can find some for you to especially on being perfectionist stick. So just does that sound like a good area to get going and just start."
17035.0,Patient,"Absolutely absolutely yeah I know for for a long time, I was repeating to myself, you know don't worry for don't give five minutes to anything that you won't remember in five years. In terms of worry and I was repeating that to myself for a while and that was very, very helpful and kind of stopping that negative train of thought that really is there's no reason to be."
760.0,Provider,yeah you can you can say things like I have everything I need. Everything is going to get everything how about something so simple as everything is going to get done everything is going to get done in the proper time those kinds of things because. You you bring that would be more of a mindful statement that's actually a very good one yeah like yeah.
17035.0,Patient,Good them its proper time.
760.0,Provider,yeah because that takes away your judgment and the time.
17035.0,Patient,Absolutely tell.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17035.0,Patient,"I really appreciate that that's that's a lot of really good things for me to to use and i'll definitely work on that goals list. Okay, maybe next time we can get a little more insight."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and Andy do you are you able to go to the virtual clinic and set up your next appointment."
17035.0,Patient,yeah sure absolutely.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and yeah go ahead and do that maybe for two weeks from from today. perfect and and I hope you have that loan approved. By the time I see you."
17035.0,Patient,Thank you enough for that we'll. have some good news to share.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, Daniel."
17035.0,Patient,"Well, it was a pleasure. Thank you so much."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good seeing you and I look forward to next time."
