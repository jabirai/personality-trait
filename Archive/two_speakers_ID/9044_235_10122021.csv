Have irregular brain activity just from the autism so it's been a big to do, trying to get like an eight or 12 hour sleep study done."

9044.0,Patient,Fine yeah.
235.0,Provider,"So I wanted to have that checked out also. And that could be part of the sleep study. Plus, you know it's good to know if i'm. If there's stuff going on, because I don't have a spouse that gets a stop snoring or whatever. other type of things if i'm you know. So it's good to know, and then I could put that in you know the whole va process and they've been a blessing, believe me, it's really good to me i've been thankful so, by the way, what about your son is thinking about the service is he still is it's is that still on his radar."

9044.0,Patient,yeah.
235.0,Provider,At least he wants to be a marine biologist not a navy seal you know.
9044.0,Patient,"Know right oh my gosh. I know I know. But it's pretty it's been crazy around here we we've known for a couple years now that we wanted to buy a different house, we wanted to sell our. house and buy a new house in this House came on the market and it looked like it was going to be a really good deal my husband ended up knowing the people that were selling it. And long story short we've been the last two weeks we've been trying to get our House ready for sale and putting offers in on how on this House and it's just been kind of crazy all out of the blue so."
235.0,Provider,"Well it's exciting, at the same time is. It what are you guys getting a four bedroom or."
9044.0,Patient,"Well, we need a technically, we need a five bedroom, but we can do a four so."
235.0,Provider,double the double the boys up.
9044.0,Patient,"yeah that's what we do now, but we don't my daughter has a room. But it was it was a small office is what it was technically supposed to be when we bought the House, I was going to turn it into a walk in pantry because that's right off my kitchen. yeah so it's not very big like it would fit like a twin size bed and i'd be about it. But she hates it, she has been scared to death of that room, since she came home from the hospital she's never slept in there."
235.0,Provider,So she asked the phobic or something.
9044.0,Patient,"I don't know what it is, I don't know but she's scared of that room, so there is no she sleeps in her bed in her bed, is in my room."
235.0,Provider,So okay.
9044.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. yeah so we're looking what we will settle for a four bedroom but we really to give everybody their own space at this point, we need a five bedroom."
235.0,Provider,"what's on the market, where you guys deserve deserve."
9044.0,Patient,"it's not it's not good, because we need the school district, that we need to be in as one of the most sought out school districts. And so, when houses pop up not only are they you know way overpriced but they're selling we looked at a house it had only been on the market for like three days we looked at it. The third day it was on the market and we talked about what we wanted to do and by the time we got back to our realtor about it, it was sold. Like that quick. So it's hard to find one and we thought that we had so we put an offer in the lady long story short, the lady talked with my husband and made it sound like she was going to work with us on the price and. We put an offer in and we didn't hear nothing back our realtor heard nothing from them so we're like okay well we'll up the offer and see maybe the realtor just didn't give it the time of day I don't know you know because we did come in pretty low. So we we upped our offer by 25,000 and they countered the offer yesterday, we got an answer back and they countered, it was full asking price so they're not even trying to work and houses at worth what they're asking not at all."
235.0,Provider,"Woman yeah that's that's really a tough one, I mean duh. I know it'd be a homeowner and just in a market that is totally a seller's market it's tough, I mean you're selling hopefully you'll be able to get. You know premium, but then it just washes out to what you're gonna have to pay it on the other, unless you guys get a fixer upper and those are going to be those will be spending your husband want to go in and you know redo a fixer upper what."
9044.0,Patient,"that's kind of what we did here um it wasn't the best, but I am I am on my appointment, please go, I will talk to you in a moment i'm sorry."
235.0,Provider,i'm sorry.
9044.0,Patient,"No thanks I will talk to you in a moment. you're not going you're not I love you goodbye sorry. My my six year old. But when we bought this House it wasn't in you know, we had to do a lot we had to rip up carpet, we had to tear down walls, we you know we redid the bathroom when we did a lot of stuff. And my husband is okay to do it again, but I don't want to do that again. I I understand you know, wherever we move. there's gonna be stuff to do to make it our own you know it might need fresh coat of paint or new carpet and i'm okay with that, but to go all in with like what we even did here I don't want to do that again I don't."
235.0,Provider,know.
9044.0,Patient,I don't have energy.
235.0,Provider,"Did you guys do that, like five years ago, or what."
9044.0,Patient,"we've been here, it was six years in May."
235.0,Provider,"yeah so that's real fresh and you know you don't have the stomach for it. Exactly, and then the boys are the boys up, for they kind of like dad are they kind of enter. handyman stuff and. Bring stuff."
9044.0,Patient,"The 15 year old is the the the almost 14 year old he says he is But then when it comes down to it, you know yeah you know how they are. So I don't know I just I fell in the pit of my stomach that the House we put the offer on I just there was something in my stomach telling me that this wasn't the one. Go so."
235.0,Provider,"don't fall in love with any piece of property. No matter how good it looks don't let it on you. You know just be good steward of what you where you have and and and if it's not you know just stand pat right now, where you guys are at it sounds like you've got a functional place i'm sorry your little one you know can handle the you know the well."
9044.0,Patient,"we're moving forward with After talking with the realtor and stuff yesterday. we're going to go ahead and continue to get our House ready to sell we're going to get it on the market. And if we get a buyer before we find something, then we'll just make it contingent upon us finding a house, you know, obviously we only have so many days to do that, but i'm here hey like he said there's new houses popping up every day so."
235.0,Provider,Will you will you keep them in the same school. or when.
9044.0,Patient,"We open enroll to the school that we're at now and so we're just trying to move into the district, so we don't have to open enroll anymore. Because it's like a it's like a 15 to 20 minute drive depending on traffic. Every day."
