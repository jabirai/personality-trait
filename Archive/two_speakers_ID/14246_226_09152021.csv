226.0,Provider,an internship.
14246.0,Patient,yeah so. I really like. pretty much focused on like the biggest building something just kind of like trying to do like prioritizing.
226.0,Provider,Right.
14246.0,Patient,Just really what needs to get paid and okay hold off.
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely. Have you called any of those people that you owe money to and just said hey can I get on a payment plan here's my like I can give you money, then, on this day, have you have you done that."
14246.0,Patient,"Is a couple that i've tried but pretty much you talk to them and they're just like. Okay, I need you, there are like 500 angels have hundreds, a day to day. is like a cat."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like a lot of them are credit cards."
14246.0,Patient,"Oh there's a couple that are credit cards, one is a vehicle. And then. that's basically about it. Two more."
226.0,Provider,"Okay it's mostly credit cards and then your car right. yeah okay. So the credit cards can wait, you know they it gains interest, but you know you want to make sure that you have a car so that's going to be your priority that's your payment that's your priority payment and then the credit card, you can pay off over time."
14246.0,Patient,yeah that's what i'm trying to do right now.
226.0,Provider,Okay remind me where you work again.
14246.0,Patient,Great now we're just started a new company or ws or something like that.
226.0,Provider,And what do you do.
14246.0,Patient,"Well, right now, I just send a big all phones to to the bars and stuff."
226.0,Provider,Data right. Okay yeah i'd like you do the deliveries for that stuff right.
14246.0,Patient,Now I just didn't didn't put it on trucks.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, do you like it."
14246.0,Patient,"yeah it's pretty good decent paying jobs, a lot of work, but you get four days and then three off so."
226.0,Provider,"Okay alright cool. So do you are you starting to see some money come in, I, are you feeling like you're gonna be able to get caught up."
14246.0,Patient,"kind of and then, once I do I think it's like two months or three months, then I could go full time with them and then they'll give me more money so. I know that will make the difference. Because an extra $2 so. No."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so finances, what else what's like a secondary stressor."
14246.0,Patient,The second area things thing that truly stressing me out is. pretty much like the fighting with. With my girlfriend pretty much. it's. getting better but it's still there and then i'm the type of person whenever that starts arguing just walk away I don't want no.
226.0,Provider,So what do you guys fighting about.
14246.0,Patient,"This I don't know she's still mad about everything, not happy in anything that I did so sheets like uses a law, and those are a lot of my face. And then she dollars, just to call me a drug addict so she said, seen stuff like that are talking about that Mr Turner walk away and it's even more mad."
226.0,Provider,How much time do you have.
14246.0,Patient,"Honestly, I. Think it's only been a month, maybe."
226.0,Provider,"So issue trying to see she needs to know that she can trust you that's what's happening right she's she's. Just. she's angry. Because of your past us, and she probably has fears that you're going to relapse again. So what's the best way. To deal with that you have any idea."
14246.0,Patient,"I don't I really don't even know I tried not going to her. Her dad's anymore, because their brothers there and that's where you see the loss I try not going there. i've tried not going down at all. yeah i'm trying to like on Friday to take them all out to go do stuff again."
226.0,Provider,"yep that's right that's good. So she needs to she's rebuilding trust that she needs to see that you're making efforts and that you're staying clean to remember this is a process so remember that you know, trust is broken, you know with any kind of addiction any kind of heavy using right. People you know things happen so people lose trust and then you have to spend time regaining their trust and that takes some patience. And that just keeps that takes doing what you need to do to stay clean and sober and so as long as you're staying clean and sober things tend to work out really well. it's when you keep slipping or relaxing then it gets a little bit it's challenging again, so the goal is to you know attend the groups attend the sessions with me take the medication. Work stay away from people that used to use with stay away from situations that are triggering. And and be really aware of what your triggers are so do you do you know what your triggers are Do you know what triggers you to use."
14246.0,Patient,And pretty much like the plays. They give I go back home. As I know it's there. yeah and then pretty much like if it's around me are like if somebody says really talking about it that's why Whenever she starts behind me and bringing it up and. It it'll it'll tend to do to.
226.0,Provider,"Have you astronauts bring it up, have you."
14246.0,Patient,"have told them, I told you that the triggers me, but then the PowerPoint she's really mad, and she isn't as like i'm aiming her for my mistakes and i'm glad."
226.0,Provider,That makes her. Long have you guys been together.
14246.0,Patient,10 years.
226.0,Provider,"Oh yeah okay. Is this a pattern, this is what happens when you use and she gets really mad search using it against you and."
14246.0,Patient,"It has been it's just like pretty much recently. don't know if they getting better bodacious. Like, even though their day I came from work and all those sleep in I think of Friday. And they sleep you when she got home, and I think she thought I was I. yeah but she pretty much like walked in the door, and I started yelling and."
226.0,Provider,So she under stress she experiencing stress.
14246.0,Patient,don't know honestly. I guess i've been so worried about myself today honestly don't even know.
226.0,Provider,"Maybe after maybe it'd be nice to ask her, but that workout well if you said hey are you feeling stressed."
14246.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I never. Really asked her."
226.0,Provider,"So it sounds to me like she's got some some stressors going on, just like you do and. it's nice to be able to support each other, you know just to know that you're there for each other and that you guys can talk about it, and so, if you don't talk about it, then. It builds and it builds and it builds and then you start you know say thanks you don't mean start yelling come in with an attitude you're mean to everybody that's not. that's not fun, you know that's not that's not how you want to live right you want things to be. calm and harmonious and cohesive and be able to share information and share how you're feeling and talk about what's going on. Because when you talk about things and that's where you come to solutions to get answers like so like for me like now like talking like asking okay like what's your biggest stress what's the biggest bill it's not me being nosy. me engaging in conversation with you, so I can help you like prioritize some of this stuff right so that's what I mean like just having conversation like we're having right now, you can have that with your girlfriend. that's going to help build the trust it's going to help build the relationship again and it's going to help you guys, be able to support each other when it gets tough. So, have you ever had that kind of interaction with her was there ever a time when your relationship with her was supportive like that."
14246.0,Patient,"I guess probably when we first got together, then, after that, and it just like kind of faded away yes."
226.0,Provider,So it wasn't just one thing that created like. You know miscommunication or maybe a little bit of a divide.
14246.0,Patient,But i've never really been one on like talking it's just it wasn't I wasn't raised that way.
226.0,Provider,So just that yeah does that feel weird for you to do.
14246.0,Patient,yeah. You don't. really deal with my problems and stuff like that or though with they. pretty much say we just the way I was raised as we just move on pretty much like the next day we wake up and. start talking again.
226.0,Provider,"So you can do that that's awesome like if you can just like yeah you know we forget about it, you move on, you know that's good that's healthy. But you want to make sure that you're not pushing feelings and emotions down that aren't getting addressed because that's when that's when you get really angry that's when the resentment happens and that can create a relapse. So you know stay clean is it's not just taking your medication as prescribed. are showing up to group and showing up to these sessions is about really trying to figure out like what triggers your relapses and what triggers these feelings inside of you. So when you can identify that then those feelings don't feel so heavy and you don't need to use over how you're feeling. yeah so um and it's also you know yeah you've got to stay away from people that you use with or people that trigger your places there you were used to use that will trigger you to us again for sure. you've got to stay away from all of that stuff that's really, really important you don't want to have anything to do with that you know you want to keep your life really simple. and your focus is on your sobriety your family and go into work and you just keep it like that, for a really long time three months, six months, maybe a year. Okay, and then you just slowly start to pay things off you slowly start to feel better mentally and emotionally you feel stronger you get some variety, under your belt right so as long as you stay on track to stay clean and sober. Good things are happening i've seen it time and time again like it's amazing. So. I mean, I know, like last time when we met you know you had said that you're just tired of using like you just don't want to do it anymore creates a lot of problems."
14246.0,Patient,And yeah.
226.0,Provider,And the financial problems that you're dealing with now are probably a result of using in the past. yeah. Because when you're using your bills aren't getting paid.
14246.0,Patient,that's where most of it pretty much piled up.
226.0,Provider,"So you can get yourself out of that debt, you know, and you can get all that stuff paid off. Well, you can people do it all the time. That you just have to chip away at it, you have to stay committed. So one thing I want you to start your to focus on is like how like what what kind of feelings come up for you what what kind of emotions come up for you. don't you start feeling again okay like what is, what is this feeling represent like Am I angry Why am I angry like feeling depressed Why am I feeling depressed. yeah and my happy like what just made me happy what makes me feel content, what makes me feel connected but makes me feel good about myself. Okay, when you start thinking like that, so we can kind of talk about that talk about these things I want you to get I want you to get back in touch with yourself because. When anybody's using drugs you're just numb. So it's. The way of numbing out so you don't have to be happy oh so now it's getting familiar again with your feelings. Alright, so anything else that you wanted to go over."
14246.0,Patient,"And I was wondering. Who. Is the group on Fridays at this open to anybody or. i'm going to try to make up for one day. Okay, wait till Monday afternoon pitcher do full group for."
226.0,Provider,"You know what you can just go back to the virtual clinic and tell him that you want to make up the group on Friday and i'll let Dr Solomon no okay yeah you can do that. OK, and then let's reschedule for you and I didn't meet again okay. Okay, I wednesday's typically good days."
14246.0,Patient,Oh wait Wednesdays or Fridays are Mondays.
226.0,Provider,So let's do Wednesday. Wednesday September 29 at 11.
14246.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,will not work for you.
14246.0,Patient,Yes.
226.0,Provider,"Okay perfect. Okay, any other questions for me."
14246.0,Patient,"Oh, not at the moment."

226.0,Provider,yeah that's okay you're doing great you know you're doing great it takes a little bit. To kind of get the hang of it with all the. You know the meeting links and all of that kind of stuff.
14246.0,Patient,"yeah and then I think. A I thought I was gonna have everything like. emailed because when I first started, they have like a bunch of emails about every meeting I had and stuff like that. yeah. I started deleting stuff to think because I didn't want to get like flooded and. yeah so getting up run stuff and."
226.0,Provider,"i'll go back now and write down. On a paper okay cool. All right, well, it was good, seeing you."
