12606.0,Patient,"Overall, mental health needs um. yeah. I mean, I guess there's a huge need. In my life I need to address some stuff. As of recently, though, it seems as if, like the leads right the issues that I have had to contend with. i've gotten to a point where they've. impacted. Like how I express myself. i'm like more prone to anger now than I feel like i've ever been in my life, you know, like announcer like a victim of bullying now up until like I don't know like even a few. When you could even say was like in my master's degree right with some of my professors kind of even last year right my PhD degree and. yeah you know, like it's it's got me to a point where. i'm reacting more than I am anything else now granted i'm reacting in situations where i'm justified and just reacting stronger than I would like to react. um."
540.0,Provider,"explain the situation, a little bit more."
12606.0,Patient,"OK, so the big reason i'm here today is because I got a break up with my girlfriend like three weeks ago and I, you know, like before, when I was setting up these appointments I wasn't able to get here because of obligations and. And like just really like being overwhelmed and a lot of capacity and so it's like man at the end of this, I was like I gotta go. So you know give you an example, more extreme example from the last argument. To even today right so like in this argument. In my past life, the last department I lived at where we were dating she didn't live with me, but like she would come over. I realized I had peeping TOMS they would watch me work out and just looking at my window and having like three times. with varying different windows and the other side of my apartment complex, to the point that I was just like okay well if I really want to be private I should definitely close my clients because somebody can see in here right and being the. Nice boyfriend that I am I told my partner like hey maybe a little bit of jealousy, but I feel like this is totally rational. This is like hey if they're checking me out there definitely check you out so you know if you're gonna walk around in your underwear naked like close the blinds or put on a pair of my boxers or stick figure it out right. yeah um. which she always thought was like a mechanism of controlling I don't even know she would always argue with me about it, but like you wouldn't go too far, just like a simple request and drop it. Fast forward to the now apartment that i'm in we're moving in we lived together for like a week and a half, and you know, like honestly, we were having arguments and we were at an impasse. Maybe I was seeing things that aren't necessarily there Maybe she was we weren't an ability to talk about it. Things are tense right like we talked about how we had big arguments and we either need to figure it out, or like. We needed to break out and there wasn't a whole lot of figuring out anything as much as it was like. You know, like threatening the relationship which more came from me. Directly I don't know like she was doing some things that no idea what she was doing, and she couldn't justify them are like tell me what's happening so it's like well anyway so. I get out of a meeting she's laying on the bedroom it like in our laying on a bed in her underwear on our phone like not really about anything like our stomach shoot no idea what was going on in the room. And i'm looking into like what he does like i'm still my phone I look out the window and sure sure there is a guy looking through our friends at us. You know, originally like I didn't see like an eyeball so like like talk about infinitives I have no certainty that that individual is actually looking in the mud. It really looked like there was a person's head there, I saw some movement like they backed up like oh shit did I just get caught and then they like did some like weird little shuffling. To kind of like hide in the background, I don't know. that's what it seemed like anyway. And so it was just like holy shit there's somebody looking at us through the fence and she was like what I was like yeah check it out and she wouldn't. And I was like no no seriously look. And she was like now, and I was like well Fuck now I gotta go talk to the neighbors so it's going to go over there and talk to the mother trucker excuse me for my French. And, and she like whips back at me she's like are you mad at me and I was like. Well yeah little bit because we talked about this, and this could have been all mitigated and now I gotta go talk to the neighbors. And the during the Kate course the entire arguments kept pointing back to. Your mad at me for creep looking through the window and i'm like no i'm mad because we talked about this, and now I have to go talk to the neighbors because there's a great way through the window. And I know there's creeps that look through windows yeah i'm a 13 year old and I saw like a naked my girlfriend or like in her underwear I would have looked you know, like that's just I mean maturity levels right."
540.0,Provider,yeah so you're you're thinking of the preventative things that could have been done personas yeah.
12606.0,Patient,"And then it's turning into an argument that lasted for an hour, but she kept literally like. 100 times 200 times I don't even know is sick circular as I can't believe you'd be mad at me this guy. And I was like no no i'm not mad at you, for the guy mad at you, because you didn't do anything about it when we talked about this before and now it's a big deal right before it wasn't a big deal close the blinds now it's I gotta go talk to the fucking tree that lives behind us. And she started interrupting me she just wasn't hearing it. Not she's being malicious. made this explicitly clear, I know you know what we were arguing about, but even after the hour afterwards, she didn't no fucking clue and pointing back to the same thing. And she kept interrupting me and eventually like I started raising my voice she started raising her voice, she was just like you can't talk to me like this, this is disrespectful. i'm just like well we're going to talk about disrespect but then I like got down on my knees was like i'm begging you to please let me speak because we're not hearing each other, you have no idea what i'm talking about and we can't argue about two completely different things. And she interrupted mean that's I got up and immediately got ramps back up to about 95% and I never it got to a point where it's like Have you ever been like so stated that you just felt tension in your head. What is like. That angry. I got so angry, I had no tension, it was literally anger moving through me like my blood vessels had dilated I never screamed at somebody oh screaming I never screamed at anybody before my life and. Eventually, I was just like if you interrupt me again i'm gonna break up with you, and she kept doing it, I let it go. And then, like two or three minutes later she kept doing it like over and over and over that's two minutes and I was like you're going to interrupt me again i'm going to break up with you, she didn't even Let me finish that's like get the Fuck out right now. Just kicked her out of our Martin. And now we're kind of talking but like what's more important to me well, I there's some shit obviously that I was like bottling up a lot of it has to do with reciprocity."
540.0,Provider,"So it explained to me more so, you had the peeping TOMS and your old other apartment and it didn't faze her so it didn't it didn't faze her at all. Oh really okay."
12606.0,Patient,"I mean it's not like, she would launch her shit right in front of the window, but it was like she was capitulating or at least meeting needs somewhere, you know, like put on it let's give you a like a. Like a nightie your son, you know, like yeah yeah like a slip you know, whatever we'll figure it out and nothing no compromise no nothing I only gave her two options like both of those lines are put on pants I don't give a shit. But I was like figure it out, I just don't want people looking at you. And she would always say like it's the same as a swimsuit now it's just like now i've seen you in a swimsuit and I can control myself as like i've seen you in your underwear and it's way different story like it it's different. every man."
540.0,Provider,Man yeah.
12606.0,Patient,"You know, like we don't men don't go to swimming pools, like their strip we go to strip clubs like the strip clubs, because swimsuits are different than underwear and. I feel like that's just nonsensical, but it was not to her, and that was like a huge struggle anyway, that was just one thing, there was other stuff that I thought I don't know. She has her own trauma I realized, though, that, like every time we would have an argument she just wasn't hearing me. I was touching on trauma she didn't even know that I need to talk to somebody else to realize that like she was shutting down and like getting put in a childlike state because of sexual trauma that she had as a child. And that's a completely different thing completely understandable that point like I didn't even know I thought she was just being malicious and recognizing now that like. You know, like i'm tech i'm afraid of spiders and if somebody who's like john you get a spider on you i'm a freak out right as opposed to like. Oh, what was that don't worry about it, you know. And I effectively said a Vanessa you got spiders all over the place here, you know. And that's not cool. that's not right and. I mean like random I didn't know. But it doesn't make it any more appropriate right."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean I guess that that can make sense, so she has sexual trauma from her past so her childhood, so a lot of times when you have that sexual trauma away. it's kind of like controlling your body, too, so if you're able to not necessarily flaunt your body, but having that control over it, and that scenario, it can I mean so that may be her grasping on to the control that she does have in her mind over her body and. So that may be what's going on her end."
12606.0,Patient,"She and I thought that was the case, but I don't even you know, like you know that's like at that some aspect of boy tourism right like that's what that is um. And I thought that might have been what happened what's happening, and maybe that's a piece of it like and that i'm not okay with right like okay if that's what it is cool like there, there are kink groups for you go figure that. you're going."
540.0,Provider,"To find that there's something there and then working through it and if you're not willing to work on it, then."
12606.0,Patient,"yeah you know, like in that's not something I want to do, but it was always she never knew she never knew she'd never knew and maybe a little a little bit attached it because there were moments, where I felt like she was being somewhat opportunistic you know, like. How can you be aware of the you know, like her sister brought up one time that something like will creep interrupt and she was thinking about going. date with this older guy and event and Vanessa immediately realized like now he's a weirdo you shouldn't go on a thing so it's like. You know she knows this stuff exists, but like you know how do you not know in certain contexts, but I mean I guess you know nobody's perfect right like i've been on before and I was the previous to it and I, I see this should all the time. i'm also like hyper vigilant that regard. Like i've been bullied like I said a lot i've been taking advantage of a lot like had stoner druggie friends in high school they're all dead snail one from somebody so. Unlike my dive like I don't have childhood sexual trauma, but like I have childhood trauma. And from my parents and so like I recognized very quickly that like even the people that are supposed to be closest to me. Can not necessarily have your best interest on it all the time right like nobody's perfect and i've i've learned that like I don't need to hear to anybody like my respect goes my respect in my loyalty goes as far as my principles right. And I know I just as far as I know where I can trust people in certain spaces right, you know, like. i'm not going to put a pill bottle and for my dad expected not to take one like a kid needs candy, but I can trust him with financial receive advice and like solid relationship as a career advice and I love him to death, and if she's like I don't know. She she's like. all or nothing she told me explicitly once that like i'm not going to assume that men are interested me right off the BAT and I was like Vanessa I was like you're interesting. Aside from your like your looks she was gorgeous was like is it looks you're interesting, I would just assume that everybody thinks you're interesting there's nothing wrong with that. And men for men to also be attractive for women right like we went to a party, I get invited to a party like that day, I asked her out we've been talking and dating for months. And I got invited to a party in the sequoias and I in the subways but like at an airbnb right outside of the sequoias and it was just like a ranger right like I we brought copious amounts of weed there was booze people to mushrooms, it was great time. I started feeling some fives I was like man there's a lot of guys. You know vibe and on Vanessa there's a lot of girls vibe going on me and there's a lot of girls vibe on Vanessa there's a lot of guys might be yeah and I just got the sense that it was a swinger party and then I saw these motions like. Like I don't even imagine like my waistline is like right at the bottom of this screen, you know, like we're in a hot tub at some point, if she sits away from me sits next to somebody else. But like say this is the side of the screen where like we're almost touching. Her in some other guy are really close to the point that, like you know it like I would know But aside from that. This guy was like hovering his hands like over her waist in the water, so weirdly close to her legs and her crotch that I started freaking out, I had a panic attack like had to go inside and started playing. And I was like whoa this is cool the girl saw me like Johnny what's going on, and I was just like she's getting hit on like there's something happening there and I don't know to do they just looked at me they're like just go grab her. So I did I literally threw her over my shoulder and I was like sorry boy she's mine. And then we went and had like got intimate whatever else went back to the party. And then they were like predatory weirdly in like we both blacked out what I understand and I trust people there nothing happened, but they had a fucking orgy that night and I. I told Vanessa was like there's some vibes going on she's like you're just being insecure then found out from the woman who organized the party, a week later, that there were fact wasn't or tea, and that was the plan. Though i'm a lot of the anxiety that I felt my relationship was tied to okay like what is mine security and what am I seeing the cheese just blocking whether it's for trauma or consciously. It like that coven are being taken advantage of in other spaces, including academic spaces right like I had I had some shitty, for I had one shitty Professor that recently added other shitty Professor that tried to failed me in a class and didn't have any right to do so. And i'm in the i'm in the process of like filing agreements with my university to figure that out um but."
540.0,Provider,yeah man i'm starting to get. more about that sorry yeah So what did you go to your What did you go for a PhD So what do you have PhD was.
12606.0,Patient,"i'm getting my PhD in education really yeah but it's not like i'm not going to teach i'm not going to work in a school, I went to study something called collective impact and the only way I could see to do it is through schools so."
540.0,Provider,"All right, so education. All right, and so what happened with your professors exactly."
12606.0,Patient,"day one okay so like there's two instances right one last year, where I took a class and the first day professors like john you're brilliant you just need to slow down like just sit with the information. By class, for he told me don't ask, he would be shunned like criticize my questions in class and I tried to ask them he wouldn't even answer them at a certain point, like later on the Semester. And then, when I would ask to go to his office hours barred me from his office hours it's like now, and I thought I was going to fail the class, so I wanted to drop it get a full refund. And I had to negotiate with university where they only gave me half my money because it was actually like it can't borrow me from office hours that's not how that works. So that's his bad I shouldn't take it full refund. And dig. Myself, where where."
540.0,Provider,Where are they gonna where are they in letting you take full refund or.
12606.0,Patient,"know that I was told, so the dean of students told me explicitly john you would be lucky to get a quarter of your just even a little bit of money. And I realized that the dean of students is not a student advocate as much as they're a political tool to smooth over relations between the university students so she was never advocating for me to begin with, and I only know that because of recent, and this is. separate from the right yeah there was a professor, who, and this almost made it to the news after like George floyd and everything Professor. gets feedback from their class and a student was just said quote. I feel as if the burden of learning has fallen solely on the shoulders of students. it's a fair comment, especially anonymously to put in feedback that's made for the Professor. He took that anonymous commented posted it on social media for him and his like network on social media to just shit on and obviously that blew up because people saw it. But that's not nearly as bad as a professor scolding you openly in class or in you from your their office hours and that turned almost turned into a complete lawsuit where the university spent like $60,000 on dui trainings and all that so i'm looking at this situation like. But me yeah um anyway there's another situation so that was last year there's another situation that this last semester, where I was in a race racism class and I, I actually did quite well, like all my students are all of my colleagues and my class loved me. You know, like, I was the only white male us that's fine it's not an issue, but my Professor despise to me because I would ask questions like. Which definition of racism or we're going to use, no, no that's not like a mean you're like what What do you mean what kind of racism there's a lot of different kinds of racism and there's a lot of researchers that have done sociologists that are defined it like which one's the best. You like is it. The internal colonialism, is it is Marxism is it a so racialized social systems is it systemic racism micro aggressions like all of these things all it's all of us, but not one researcher, not one theorist has all of them as a definition. yeah and so like which one we you like, which ones appropriate which context, do we need to talk about that I was asking questions like that, and my Professor was not happy with it because she didn't have that kind of dialogue repaired. And so, where I want to study something called collective impact, nobody really knows what that is because it's not really well published and it's not really well defined it's very new. She told me, you cannot write about what your dissertation as well, which is not good advice it definitely against university policy to. And so, for the longest time I was struggling just to try to like get my thoughts on paper. And she would not meet me in person to talk out my ideas, and so it was like one proposal for a paper after another, after another, after another, that she just completely failed. And at the towards the end the class she was just like I think you're not going to pass the class so here's the deal you do this list. of things for this paper and i'll give you an extended period in the class speed write your paper sounds good, I did all of those things and I got feedback from the writing Center all the stuff I did all of it, it was a great paper great proposal for a paper. and You know, like, I sent it two weeks before the end of the Semester and she sent it back to me then 1130 1130 the night, the grades were do saying that she. failed me, you know I didn't do. Anything that she asked and i'm just like well that's bullshit because the writing Center said I did everything he wanted me to do so now it's us versus you. And I was told by my advisor who's also trying in political force of nature that I should never retake her class, because it would be seen as a threat. And now how the Fuck am I going to get like if I wanted to leave this institution that obviously doesn't want to foster me well. I have an F on my transcript who the Fuck is going to take a PhD student with an F author transcript. that's impossible that's never going to happen so they've effectively like barred me to the space and i'm $230,000 in debt now which i've just learned means I have to get my PhD or i'm never going to afford a home. So, like there's all of these existential things that I feel like i've been forced to shoulder and partially I don't have tolerance for it anymore and i'm starting to realize that i'm a lot more of a quick."
540.0,Provider,fact my yeah that's why you're reacting and now.
12606.0,Patient,"i'm but it's like even in class today, like, I had a you know it's a great class i'm taking a behavioral economics course to like position, all of this stuff in a different light. and And at some point, like there's a concept that like i've learned in my undergrad so I got an economics degree for my bachelor's. And I learned something they're talking about this behavioral ECON class that they know about and i'm just like hey So this is the thing they're just like you know what the endowment effect is."
540.0,Provider,i'm sorry what what.
12606.0,Patient,"Do you know the endowment effect is. No yeah if I were to give you this water bottle whatever you would like you would value it more if it's yours, rather than if it's mine that's all it says. And in behavioral ECON they don't know why, but like they like they think guess right they don't do great research because it's economics and I was just like whoa how about social desirability. And they're like wait How does that play into that somebody has something if something doesn't. And i'm just like because somebody has something which is desirable and somebody doesn't and I was like How does that make any sense and this guy didn't my Professor just kept shutting me down over and over and he was just like well like Why would you put what are they both have. That like would say that that's the that's social desirability thing, and I was like well the endowment effect was like the fact that. Like that's The thing is, like it says that one person has something the other other people don't and that's the contrast. And I pointed at when I said that I was like well isn't that isn't that the endowment effect and I, like everybody to tell you, like got a little excited but, like, I never had a response, like that any of my classes like before I would clam up I get ready to be quiet. And this time I like. Come on bro you know, like and I. I said it like eight times and i'm starting to realize that like if I feel like I have to repeat myself that that is a telltale sign that i'm about to get to a point where I should separate myself. Oh you're kind of like hitting your threshold."
540.0,Provider,"And this, a lot of this maybe like the reacting maybe because it's also in all these other circumstances, you haven't been heard out. So now, you have to I mean raising your voice more often, which maybe you didn't do before and doing things now, you may be reacting because. It wasn't working with not reacting, so your body may be saying Okay, you know what if someone's not if someone's going to listen to me, I may have to let them listen to me. and get louder and louder so but understanding your threshold and being able to Okay, you know what walk away and learning those techniques for you."
12606.0,Patient,"I would love to try to do that I don't know how to do that, but our."
540.0,Provider,"Time time it's going to take some time and it's also a lot of these things you, you have to feel what's going on, you have so much stress on you. With everything going on with school you're you're in your PhD program so I mean that's going to be just. Everything is online for you right now, so you know that you have to complete the program but it's also you have these things that are just like pulling you, in turn, you apart each way. And, but understanding that you don't have to fight this fight alone, and maybe you do have to go to the board you're doing the right things and you're doing the grievances and. Unfortunately, those things will take a little bit of time, but you can do you do the best you can, but you also you may have very, very high expectations on yourself to get things done right now, too. So it's going to take time now."
12606.0,Patient,Have a whole lot of time.
540.0,Provider,"So. Making sure you go to your advisor your advisor who's going to help you the best way that they can, and I mean it's not fair that all of this is being put against you and you're doing absolutely everything you can. But counseling so working through all these emotions getting them out here may allow you to not have to get it out on the outside other places, so you may be able to just kind of. lash everything out with me and then be able to go through your daily activities and not snap so easily because you're getting it out. That makes sense. But you're welcome you're welcome, and I know I mean, I know that, so I know we are running out of time, but I do want to be able to learn more about your childhood so. Maybe next session we can start talking about some more of that, and do you want to try to do I know you're busy with your PhD do you want to do, like the every other week counseling like the twice a month or what."
12606.0,Patient,let's do this every week i'm. prioritizing my mental health.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good alright so that's it. All right, you're welcome, so let me try to see does this time work for you."
12606.0,Patient,It should yeah okay.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so let me see. Because we should be able to do this time, each week. Alright, so if you're up for those of you like they do you want start with like our sessions and then eventually when you want to start slowing it down, we can either do bi weekly or we can do like 30 minute sessions yeah sure okay alrighty. And what time is it for you right now. me seven alright, so we started this at. Alright, so you want to do 630 each week or would it be easier for you to keep on like a like a seven o'clock or six o'clock."
12606.0,Patient,Okay okay.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so we do will shoot for 630."
12606.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,"So temporary Wednesday. Sure alright perfect alright, so what I want you to do is so obviously you have a lot going on with you and your girlfriend ex girlfriend I want you to try to I mean you work out right so that's an outlet, you have."
12606.0,Patient,I quit for a while i'm not gonna lie i'm trying to get back into it there's like a little. After We broke up where I just didn't do a whole lot anything is to is to cook meals for myself all the time for like two weeks after we broke up even like recently right like. I We broke up on I don't know what day it was it's like two two and a half weeks ago at this point. And like I may be made two meals for myself and then like had a meal or like a half a meal a day for like two and a half weeks so i'm getting back into my routine it was just really destabilizing. yeah.
540.0,Provider,"For sure I mean you, and I will talk a lot more in depth about it, but I can see where a lot of the circumstances on your end I mean you had the peeping Tom and then all of a sudden, you guys move, and then you have another incident. Where it's not that it couldn't have been I mean anyone can look and somebody is windows and that's not right on there and. But it's also I mean we should be comfortable in our own houses, but also being cautious of Okay, if our windows are open and we're walking past the room and we only have. No clothing on or a little bit of clothing it's common sense that someone may or will look at you. So I think that you and I will talk more about it, but I see exactly where you're coming from. And and it's also a her on your end to i'm sure, from where like you come from like a concern point where not only that we're looking at you, but i'm sure they were looking at her that you're kind of you have that roles, like her protector, as the her boyfriend. So you and I will talk about that more, though. All right, but I do see where you're coming from and because, in your I mean on your end you're you're you are her protector, in a sense, so you're losing control over the situation when she's not taking a little bit of your advice for those circumstances. Alright, so Wednesday is 630."
12606.0,Patient,Yes.
540.0,Provider,"Okay perfect all right, but I want you to try to work out a little bit more this week. If that helps out with the anger."
12606.0,Patient,"For sure I really appreciate it, thank you."
