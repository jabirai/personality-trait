298.0,Provider,"Thank you. um you know i've been thinking what are my strengths like what what do I have to offer the world. And it's hard for you to think of your own self like what do you, what are your strengths it's just really hard to come up with that. And then I remembered that my children have identified my strength and I didn't even see it my children say if they were to describe their mother in one word, it would be cheerleader. They see me as a cheerleader and i'm like well then maybe that's my strength is that I do see the world very optimistically."
10225.0,Patient,You do yeah cheerfulness is the word that came to mind. Talking about that yeah yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Well, and it's Nice that my kids see me as that way i've absolutely loved. Having them as teenagers, because even though I had five teenage girls at once, I see it, and I saw it as an opportunity to make a huge dent in the world like i'm creating little adults."
10225.0,Patient,Did you and I love it. Did you have quintuplets or just five in a row.
298.0,Provider,"No um I gave birth to three girls and then somehow things worked out, I mean, I know how they worked out and we adopted to foster."
10225.0,Patient,Children oh great good.
298.0,Provider,"And they were. All right, in the ages of my biological children so. Now. I have, I have five girls and i'm about to have my first two grandchildren and i'm so excited."

298.0,Provider,need yeah.
10225.0,Patient,yeah it's.
298.0,Provider,"It makes me wish I had more I mean I have. Sometimes I think I have this opportunity with all these bedrooms you know, should I do it again, are you yeah obvious you really, really like children, I do."
10225.0,Patient,It so you you you actually want more.
298.0,Provider,"than you have would, but I have this but i'm 50 now and. You know I did, I have a career and would it be fair to any child."
10225.0,Patient,yeah that's a good point that's a good point.
298.0,Provider,"And I kind of feel like this is where this is where i'm being called to right now, and this time of my life is you know, working with mental health and the way that I see it. This is my personal thing is. This is, this is my time to shine we need we have coated right now we have so many sad people, we need more mental health people than we've ever needed. It anytime before."
10225.0,Patient,"I agree it I, and I don't hear much about it being addressed as as a problem and it's it's it's a building problem but it's also kind of a hidden problem you know if the. focus is on. The disease itself and preventing the diseases disease itself it doesn't nearly you know you don't nearly hear as much about the isolation that really can cause mental health problems, along with the other aspects of coast Kobe."
298.0,Provider,"You know you don't hear about it, but I hear about it all day long."
10225.0,Patient,"Well, because you because you're. Gambling field right yeah yeah. yeah and so. It. In order to get funding, you know, the general public needs to understand. That real you know and that's that's why it's I think it's important that the mental health aspect be focused on. You know, you know kind of up there with the with the physical disease consequences."
298.0,Provider,"I think, but I don't have any proof of this, I think we're headed for a mental health crisis right now. And the reason I say that is what COPA did is all those providers that were on the edge of retiring they did it over koeppen like for psychiatrists and stuff so we've had an influx of people who lost their providers and the waitlist is just incredibly long. yeah. They just lacked providers."
10225.0,Patient,that's something I I haven't heard of my therapist retired at the beginning of the year and i've had been seeing him for 10 years and I wish that I still could I didn't realize that there was this coincidence of so so there's a vacuum kind of mental health providers.
298.0,Provider,it's big it's it's so big that it's getting bigger every day that the retirement rate is just off the charts they don't want to learn the new way of seeing patients cope ID they already are entitled to to retire. So they just have and so they've dropped their case loads back on. The insurance companies and the insurance companies are. Not doing the best by their patients so they're just scrambling to find something.
10225.0,Patient,"I had no idea that this is that there was a vacuum of this is yeah, this is a really bad combination of circumstances."
298.0,Provider,"It is, it is a some people ask why do you work so hard and i'm like I don't think you know realize how much need there is right now I mean granted I can't fix it all, but I can't do my part."
10225.0,Patient,"You can't and you're doing probably more than your part, you know I don't know you very well, but you probably are doing more than your part. But unfortunately you're there's a minority of people like you. who have the energy and the the know how. And the care to go the extra mile."
298.0,Provider,play if we could find him we'd hire him.
10225.0,Patient,"yeah well, maybe I don't know it's that's going to drive the price up to mental health care uh but hopefully."
298.0,Provider,"Like you're gonna have to compensate it somehow because I run into everyday people cannot afford our prices. For what their copay is, and so I keep bringing down their requirements for our program because I feel bad for them, because. there's not a lot of people to choose from, and I don't want to lose them out of the program but the cost is prohibitive to do the Co pays for everything that we asked for."
10225.0,Patient,"Are you, it does this include people who are on medicare copay."
298.0,Provider,That that's it now it's it's it's either.
10225.0,Patient,"up. or down, where the The co pays higher."
298.0,Provider,"yeah yeah whatever plan. That they have, and I know that our company is working hard to get me in network with a lot of places, so that people don't have such a high Kobe."
10225.0,Patient,That well that's that's great. It is walnut creek the the main office okay.
298.0,Provider,"yeah walnut creek, and so I hold eight DEA licenses in the United States, so I have eight different states having said that California. can be such a challenge to get licensed in that. that's where the biggest need is right now, because even though we may have people coming down the Pike that are licensed in California, it takes months six months eight months to get license that. it's just California it's where the need is right now."
10225.0,Patient,"The biggest it's ironic yeah California is by far the highest population. But also, you know that applies to everything law degrees, I mean you know marks everything California is more stringent as. far as as far as and takes longer to for qualification I don't know this is going to cause them to back off a little bit, but."
298.0,Provider,"yeah, you would think they would get a little easier."
10225.0,Patient,"well. yeah yeah that's but that's politics it's there's going to be this lag. Anyway, I hope you know I just hope I can hang in there with how it's going to work."
298.0,Provider,"I do, too, I want you to hang in there, you can do this, I want to encourage you, that you know you're not alone in this where we're all trying."
10225.0,Patient,yeah I know I know.
298.0,Provider,So how is your medicine working for you.
10225.0,Patient,"Well it's it's I think that that i've found. I think it's everything's okay I I always wish I had access to more valley and simply because now don't get me wrong. i'm sticking rule about I don't once in a while I take more, but then I I compensate by you know conserving. On some days, and you know it's. That thing but it, but the problem is that that I have to go through the and the anxiety that that causes. But I think I think you know, in general, so right now. it's pretty well balanced, I wish you would consider upping my volume, but I know well, I wish you'd consider it. I."
298.0,Provider,"hear you so. you're at 30 milligrams top doses 40 milligrams for the day, my concern is, this is a drug that you can build tolerance to yeah and and. I don't know when that day is going to come and I don't want to get to that day so that's why i'm like unless you tell me, you were almost in the hospital, but even then i'd have to say. let's be super careful."
10225.0,Patient,"Okay now gabba penton does that. Is that, in the same category."
298.0,Provider,"You know, as a controlled MED."
10225.0,Patient,"Well, no, no, no, in the way it behaves you know, like you say. You learn tolerance build up yeah is there a you know what is the what's the Info on that as far as you know."
298.0,Provider,"And I don't have patience telling me i'm not getting information, saying that it's easy to build tolerance together penton. yeah i'm. Having said that, you're at a top dose."
10225.0,Patient,I know.
298.0,Provider,and
10225.0,Patient,I know I.
298.0,Provider,"got a shirt. yeah I had a situation that this last week that made me so sad a patient was really stressed out and. They went past their dose and I ended up sending them to the emergency room because i'm like if you went past your dose and you were at the top dose something must be wrong. Well, she had a horrible experience in the emergency room the doctor was mad at me because we're like we're in the middle of a pandemic. And i'm like yeah but what's wrong with my patient that they that she she he's meeting so much like what why what is happening, so it didn't turn out good."
10225.0,Patient,"Did you. join up you don't have to deal with the ads What did you find the reason, did you find the. source of the problem. Or was it just that that that was what was available for her to resort."
298.0,Provider,"yeah and she she used her supply in three weeks, instead of one week and."
10225.0,Patient,"So what the. Really, you mean in one week instead of three weeks."
298.0,Provider,"She know she was one week short so she if she. got and so that's what held. that's what the problem was I couldn't give any more because she was already at Max dose and my hands were tied. It and she would have been out but but. I was tied, so it anyway in an evolved, a lot of people to figure out how to help her and she comes from an area where she doesn't have good access to care I don't think she'll ever misuse the gabapentin again."
10225.0,Patient,Is it is gabapentin is the withdrawal from gabba penton as bad as withdrawal from value.
298.0,Provider,But it's still you.
