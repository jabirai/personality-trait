527.0,Provider,Okay.
14889.0,Patient,"i'm really snappy. Like I like chase loved ones away kind of being. mean Okay, maybe forward and honest but overly direct and. Just feeling."
527.0,Provider,"Just feeling like on edge and irritable a lot. No, no, I feel, articulate and clear."
14889.0,Patient,But. It seems to be chasing loved ones away the time where I need to be holding them close.
527.0,Provider,So where do you think the miscommunications going or what's happening with that do you think.
14889.0,Patient,"I don't know I think i'm just. i'm. Maybe i'm like less tolerant or I feel more honest and clear, so I give a little too much info. And it turns out to be critical or judgmental info. And then."
527.0,Provider,With them or with you.
14889.0,Patient,know with them.
527.0,Provider,With them.
14889.0,Patient,"They say it. Then I kind of chase them away. I mean I can't tell maybe i'm being mean because i'm not feeling good. Okay, or. You know I don't know okay."
527.0,Provider,So what do you feel like you want to focus on for today to. kind of work on some goals for yourself and maybe. start to work on improving some of these symptoms that you're struggling with.
14889.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm not really there, yet I haven't really. thought about goals. Okay, I think, maybe it. You know I want to be better. I don't want to meet the surface. I don't really want to go to group anymore."
527.0,Provider,Why is that.
14889.0,Patient,Is that really helpful not really tori. I feel like it's not really good for me. And I don't want to wear the group down. But if you're not participating you're not like really. There then it's probably better to. be there. But no part of the diagnosis. it's a group activity. But. I can't can't stand it.
527.0,Provider,"yeah, that is, you know with bret Hart that that is part of part of the therapy processes that you do your group sessions and your individual sessions and then your medication appointments as well. You know, certainly that can be reassessed, I mean you can always talk with your prescriber but I know that they like to see you actively working on your treatment goals in all aspects. Before they look at reducing the frequency of of group sessions to but I mean the minimum that people have to come to group. Is once a month, I mean you still have to have that connection to be part of bright hearts Program. You know, but that's I mean that's something certainly you know if we're seeing some progress and you're working on things that. That that can be a discussion at some point, too, so. So there is some you know some flexibility with that. But let's let's kind of get back to you like what what we want to focus on Jason with our sessions, because you know this is this is your time to you know challenge things to work on things to you know. dive into dive into treatment issues you know just one on one. So I mean if the goal is, I want to feel better like what what does that look like."
14889.0,Patient,"Well, like this thing with chasing people away right loved ones. Okay, I think, is it a side effects of the medication or was I always an asshole and then anything well. kind of both because maybe in the past, I wouldn't have it would have been able to filter more of that stuff. But I still would have thought it."
527.0,Provider,Okay. So chief do you feel like working like on communication skills for yourself like what like being more assertive. With them versus you know more aggressive approach.
14889.0,Patient,"yeah sure they'll. be a good resolution to the thing we're talking about. Because I don't think there was a lot of aggression and what I said but. I think it was honesty, but then I think just sometimes."
527.0,Provider,"Do you think, maybe sometimes it's like the tone or the approach. That may be the that plays into that."
14889.0,Patient,"um, no, no, they don't I think it's the content. Okay."
527.0,Provider,"So, give me a recent example, something that like that that you feel like it didn't go well or or maybe a situation that you need to address, and you know, in the next day or so that we can maybe role play or come up with some some ways to approach it."
14889.0,Patient,"So my friend sherry was supposed to visit. And we stuck on the phone a lot when we when I started taking the medication. We really abruptly stopped talking on the phone a lot. It shows kind of like what what the Fuck and it's like well. If you eat you eat too much when we're talking on the phone and that person's me out. was like i'm available to talk on the phone, but now that you're on West Coast time we sincerely just weren't we're playing phone tag too much, and it was getting annoying. easier when she was on East coast time. But, like the reason I gave her was because it grosses me out that she was eating on the phone so much, and I could hear it. And it's true and it's always bothered me. But. Finally, said it, and finally chase away. And she was supposed to visit and stay with me for a little while. And I think the small part of me didn't want her to. So I also the actions clustered in. Saying that she gross me out and, like the difficulty in setting that. Time and date to talk on the phone kind of drove her away."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14889.0,Patient,"On a time where she was visiting supposed to come stay with me. And then I told my mom that you know she violated my boundaries and I don't feel respect by her and I told her that i've always felt that way, even as a kid. She was just calling to say hi. But she did do those things when she was at my house recently and I wasn't able to stay in the moment, so I said it now on the phone. This is like clear to me, and it was still have been bothering me."
527.0,Provider,And this is with your mom so the two separate ends instance okay. So what what was mom's response.
14889.0,Patient,"Thanks for telling me. But it was also it was in this way, where it's like oh i'm used to dealing with you as a crazy being like this person, so let me just accept it, I don't think she understood it. and I don't really think that she listened, but she said that she did."
527.0,Provider,"So how long have you let's go back to you, your friend. sherry is that. What you said her name is sherry. So how long have you guys been friends."
14889.0,Patient,Since about 2012.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so long time. So So what do you, what do you want to talk, I mean what do you want to say to her."
14889.0,Patient,I don't like you.
527.0,Provider,Why don't you like her anymore. Like changed her shifted.
14889.0,Patient,"and less tolerant of her interests I feel like she's always judging me. Like I do the wrong things that she has this like impatient kind of. response to whatever i'm doing wrong choice has an explanation. sense of their solicited sometimes or unsolicited. But. she's got really upset about my breakup. I think she was like taking my ex's side, even though she doesn't even know my ex. was really judgmental during the breakup also are like critical of my ex and made it hard for us to be together. Because I like just pick and poked it details and stupid shit that shouldn't be an issue. What I was telling a friend what's wrong with the relationship, and then a friend told me and like oh Jason you're fine, this is all you have to complain about. it's not these aren't even real things. Everyone deals this, this is not a says that mean, you have a bad relationship. But I was taking it like. The end of the world, but the end of the relationship. But there was so meaningless to this Fred. To me, they were like everything. Never breaking this up. But really i'm the one that broke us up so i'm. Just sick person hard to be around."
527.0,Provider,"So what So where do you want to start just kind of working through things for yourself, like the negativity and and. You know struggles within your own self like where would be a good place to start. Because it sounds like that's that's a cycle, you would like to break for yourself to be able to have healthy relationships with people."
14889.0,Patient,"Definitely. I just don't know how to answer the question, but that would like to start. need help."
527.0,Provider,"So what would it be like maybe to do just kind of. A self inventory of yourself like make a list of you know all the negative thoughts and feelings that you have about yourself and maybe where those came from, or are those things that you are, you know. Where the things that you, you know have. gathered from relationships or situations that you've experienced that come into play of you know kind of formulated how you feel about yourself."
14889.0,Patient,yeah sure I mean that sounds a bit expensive but. I don't know I wouldn't like. yeah do you want me to like physically write that list.
527.0,Provider,"Sure, like not right now I mean that's something that maybe you can work on him, you know, to bring to our next session but. yeah just turn it kind of given that thought to you, you know to how you know how you've come to the beliefs about yourself at this point. You know, and really you know and then part of that will begin to kind of dissect apart and look at you know, are these rational beliefs or are they irrational beliefs, you know, are they my own perceptions that I have put on myself. You know, or are they. or they true beliefs about myself, so we can maybe kind of challenge, some of those things but yeah I think just exploring just where you are at you know right now with feelings about yourself. yeah and you know part of it is looking at, you know how does that help me by pushing people away like. You know is that, am I self sabotaging myself to get better."
14889.0,Patient,Do you think that's what it is.
527.0,Provider,"No i'm just you know that's just a question to kind of think about you know, am I. Am I pushing people away because that's that's easier and better, because then I don't have to be vulnerable with my emotions and kind of protects myself from relationships are being hurt or you know, having disappointments, which happens in relationships with people. And sometimes it's you know when we're feeling bad about ourselves, you know we we sometimes you know not not necessarily realizing we're doing that, but we we isolate ourselves and and keep a distance and. From people and not allow people to come in and help or support us."
14889.0,Patient,Via she was like the one that I went to for. The last year and a half or so a lot on the phone for help. Especially with the failing relationship.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. sounds like she was a support to yeah. And was offering some. You know wishy offering support that that you weren't ready to hear or. was difficult to hear. because sometimes that happens, you know if people are trying to give up a perspective outside of the relationship, you know, obviously, she wasn't in the relationship with you so she didn't know all the ins and outs, but."
14889.0,Patient,"You know, sometimes it's hard."
527.0,Provider,To hear a different person perspective on things to.
14889.0,Patient,"You yeah I mean I think she said a lot of things that I didn't want to hear that were. True. You know I wanted more closure and she was like you have to just get used to not having. You have to get used to not knowing and having the answers that you want and. She was very uh. She was growing impatient to like I was really. kind of stuck on the relationship and she was kind of like. Just gotta move on. Now it's like. Too much. So amy and I would go to her, because they knew, she was like you know spiritually and psychologically, you know the was doing the most work for herself."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14889.0,Patient,So I wanted to work with her specifically because. she's just seemed to know.
527.0,Provider,"I mean, do you think it's a friendship that can be. salvaged."
14889.0,Patient,Maybe. changed her flight and went back home instead. I don't know let's talk about with you. Really don't.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I mean, I think you brought up some good points, as far as you know, kind of focus what of you know, wanting to feel better I mean that's a goal and that you want to you know start changing some of those negative thought processes for yourself. and establishing better relationships with people. I mean, I think those are some pretty good goals Jason, what do you think."
14889.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"and, obviously, you know the medication part as far as managing that and if you are seeing improvement with symptoms, with the medication as well, so I think the combination of the two."
14889.0,Patient,"I don't know that rich has opinions but weird like at night or one of them has been like at night when they feel really tired. Okay, a medication that ticket it. I like."
527.0,Provider,The murtaza pain you take at night. yeah yeah.
14889.0,Patient,"Like I should go to sleep after. But I have this weird side effect now where. i'm extremely tired. or one of the good asleep but i'm also energetic and hot. Like I feel physically. And they can't go to sleep without. Opening the window turning on the stands and same time I can't breathe, I feel like I can't breathe, in particular through my nose. um it's very weird thing but it's like. feeling so tired like you're going to black out, but your body still wants to be moving. Okay, so as you're late, no."
527.0,Provider,"Okay when's your next appointment, or do you have one scheduled, so that you can talk about your talk about these symptoms, because yeah I definitely. want to make sure you're not having like a side effect of medication over at something that's going to wear off, you know as you get used to it, or you know those would be good questions to talk through."
14889.0,Patient,i'm already used to it more or less I think i'll just opening it up to the psychiatrist next.
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I definitely would do that and just kind of keep keep monitor and making notes of things that you see you know particular patterns or feelings that you're having with the meds or. You know times of the day, that are you know, maybe more bothersome so yeah definitely keeping track of that. Okay. So what's your plan for today, are you are you working now or what's going on."
14889.0,Patient,"No, I gave up my life. This is a bad decision, but I did it. No friends, no work no money. kind of bad. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. But it should work, it should get money. need stuff."
527.0,Provider,So where would you Where would you start as far as looking for work.
14889.0,Patient,What friends to. want to. I want to have people that care about me that I care about.
527.0,Provider,"So maybe the first step is starting to take care of yourself. You know, so what what kind of structure can we start implementing for for your day, you know as far as you know, getting up at a regular time and. You know, getting some nutrition and maybe looking for a job. You know, because part of part of depression is kind of pushing pushing yourself to do things you know, even though it's it's challenging and difficult because staying in bed or isolating just feeds into those negative thoughts and feelings and behaviors and keeps us kind of stuck."
14889.0,Patient,yeah isolated a lot.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14889.0,Patient,it's what I do.
527.0,Provider,"So what's one thing you can do today, that would that would support your. You know, a stepping in a different direction for yourself."
14889.0,Patient,going to walk.
527.0,Provider,Anything else.
14889.0,Patient,The next words that.
527.0,Provider,Is there any interests or jobs you're thinking about.
14889.0,Patient,"I started my own business, not that long ago, but I haven't been putting the work into it yeah. yeah and i'm not paying myself. Because i'm not returning the profit that allows me to pay myself. not yet, at least so. To put some elbow grease into that. which has been quiet for too long."
527.0,Provider,"Alright, so it sounds like we've got a couple things to. Work on yourself, then. As far as just kind of internal work doing some journaling with the with the negative thoughts and feelings. So that we can begin to explore that. Is that feel like a at least a good place to start you know it doesn't feel too overwhelming to to start with a couple things."
14889.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good good. So one of the other things Jason I wanted to go over with you as well, is. The satisfaction surveys that you guys do. So. When there's lower scores on them we get noticed that. to review them with you guys, to see if there's things that we can do better or what's you know driving those survey scores, so it looks like. There were some lower scores, as far as like just satisfaction with the program and prescription management. see if there was anything else. And so yeah mostly just kind of overall satisfaction with the Program. So is there anything. You know anything that can be different to help improve your satisfaction or. You know, things that I can put in, as far as feedback or."
14889.0,Patient,"yeah when I first started, I was beating my manager was a woman named carolyn. Okay, she gave me a lot of misinformation, which has been disappointing. Okay, you said that there was a chance that I could cut back on group therapy after one month of participating participating. And now tanya doesn't want. It saying that that's not necessarily true. So. i'm a little bummed about that if it's kind of a it's kind of a lot. And then you know, like the medication gets refilled at the last minute, so i'm always like. Panic like okay there's one pill like why don't you send it like a few days earlier, so that I have a couple of days window of a timeframe. Go pick it up. Like I don't think this is a feasible. These are using drugs like i'm not gonna do anything with three extra pills it just gives me. More flexibility on one pick it up."
527.0,Provider,sure.
14889.0,Patient,"Or to like catch anyone. And you know I gave blood once but they haven't done bloodwork sense. So I wonder if blood work is just not necessary. Certainly no one called me to tell me. What the results of the work, work. or even if they're finding that fine. wonder if any even looked at work. When I asked about the blood work, nobody give me any information. OK so maybe the flow work. it's pointless and that's why i'm doing it again, or maybe the medications that were assigned to me don't believe it fire it I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I was gonna say I know some medications require bloodwork just to make sure it's in the therapeutic dose range. But yeah that would be definitely a good have you just done it one time, I mean Have you had to do it again."
14889.0,Patient,We were just once.
527.0,Provider,"yeah that might be a question to see if there's any if you are going to have to have any follow up with your lab work or. Blood work or anything. No, but yeah I would definitely I mean the psychiatrists would be the one to review that or medical a medical person I can't necessarily do that for you either Jason."
14889.0,Patient,"Well, these are reasons for this quarter."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure. Do you have individual sessions with tanya.
14889.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Like like one on one okay. Okay. yeah so one of the things I mean, obviously. You know, like we talked earlier, as far as the group frequency, I mean that. That kind of just a review, I mean that that kind of focuses on how your how you're doing and progress that you're making in your individual sessions and in your group sessions. And so, those are those are some factors that play into. When group can be reduced the frequency. So I would say, you know if you're you know, I guess, I would encourage you to you know find what fits in group for you and participate and then. You know, obviously I can update tanya on how we're doing in our individual sessions as well, so that she can have an idea of what you're working on and progressing with your goals during our sessions to so that can be something that we can work on."
14889.0,Patient,yeah I mean whenever you feel there's enough to share with her and talk of lucky. yeah I would love it I just don't.
527.0,Provider,"So let's do this let's go ahead and get some appointments scheduled for November Jason so that we can. get those on the books. And then i'll let you get back to your day. So go here to. your appointment calendar. What let's see I was looking to see what do you have groupon. tuesday's okay. Alright, so we'll have to stay away from tuesday's. Alright, so let's look.
