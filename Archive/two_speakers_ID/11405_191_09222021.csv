I know she's a lot of good information to. yeah I know let's see here yeah i'm gonna miss her yeah so what else is going on, I know I see you in group do you get anything out of the groups or how you feel about groups. To participate, it looks like you've had how many therapy appointments just one senior therapist wants. Okay. Okay, so you did the bps and you did one individual therapy okay all right. One individual therapy. All right, then let's see how this going for you still not doing any mayors, how are you doing without meds. Right, because I know we talked about. i'm going strictly from memory here in terms of like marijuana use any slip ups or usage of any type of drugs. Okay, so when you say no you're saying no marijuana how about alcohol any slip ups on alcohol. Any opioids are stimulants like crystal meth cracker okay. Okay, any slip ups on any party drugs or create them or nerd pills of muscle relaxer sleeping pills. Okay, so no almost no slip ups so what's got you motivated to not use, I mean what is it. Like. bunch of. Smart. Like even do anything as stupid as like. You know smoke weed or anything anything because. I would fail, a drug test for my probation officer like I could risk having. A felony on my record permanently what they're going to. yeah. I agree with you, how do you think having something like that, on your record would impact you. yeah you're so right so i'm i'm happy to hear that you're really thinking about things really thinking about things, so I know you're working how's work going for you. You like your job. Well you're doing remote catch me, what are you doing man. Okay. Okay yeah and I hear you can you can make some good tips to really cover some things to. It what are your plans for school because I know you're we've talked about that in our call you have some plans tell me tell me about your school plans. still just waiting to finish my probation and then i'm going to focus on okay it's just. do too much. yeah sounds like you're. yeah sounds like you want to have some balance and not get too stressed. yeah because sometimes if you do too much that can kind of backfire. Definitely so and what what were your plans, because I remember you telling me that you have goals and dreams and things that you want to do so what's one of the one of your goals if, when you go back to school or once you're off probation what's your go. Someone. that's another reason I. Make sure that. The record for me getting in trouble, be completely sealed. yeah. yeah you've got that taken care of. So, are you trying to do CSR thing like. forensic pathologist or crime scene investigation are you thinking more direct patient care what were you I mean so many medical fields medical billing. Okay. yeah. there's always a neat like you can one thing one of the reasons I went into medicine, because I thought about music and teaching and those all things I still love to do and law. But I said when Madison there's always an even if you're not working, you can use that skill to take care of your family help other people you there's never an not a need for Madison you can go anywhere in the world to help somebody. yeah so no i'm out there with you definitely yeah it's a great feel so were you thinking in terms of being a nurse or medical assistant a phlebotomist or you just kind of gonna see where it leads a doctor or nurse practitioner. yeah. yeah I think that's a great idea, and you still really young to I didn't start Medical School and tell us like 29 or 30. And I wasn't out practicing medicine, you know finishing up residency and everything till I was 39 but I mean I had I had you know, had done a lot of other things and. hit finished college in where I was doing a lot of research, I was working like a research scientist investigator research investigator. And so i've done that, and dustin teaching, but you know I didn't get on track to just really do medicine until I was much older and and it's just amazing you um you know, and I will certain about what I want to do before, this is my to do it. yeah that's a big deal that's good to. Know Okay, and let me if anything comes up if you ever want to talk about you know what people doing if you can always ask me to okay. Oh, you welcome. Okay, then let's see here. let's see so you Karen tensely looks like you're on point with that. terms of doing what you need to do. And it looks like you're seeing your therapist twice a month right is that how after she wants to see you Okay, then, so let me add that, so you care intensity you're definitely doing it any takeaways from group. and Oh definitely and and sometimes I like I listened a lot, too, and you know that one of the things that i've noticed is that it is just amazing. What people go through, and what relationships and with you know so much of you, I mean you know, every time that I listened to a group I realized that. So much of the strengths and the positives that we all go through has just about everything to do with relationships and who we have in our lives and it's just so just a good reminder all the time. So yeah so yeah any kind of see that and I actually read something one day, but this was talking about marriage, but I think a lot of people have relationships fiance's and. Significant others in their lives that it's like a marriage in terms of how much time and money they spend together. They have houses in their each other's name but I read something one day and will say you know your happiness and. And what you feel has so much to do with who you married to and and that also extends to your relationships be at your fiance boyfriend your female friends and it's like it just reminds you just, we have to be so wise, who we let into our life. So it makes a difference. yeah so any any concerns there are you being careful in terms of work, who you let into your life or, as was it Tara off to say as who you who you allow to come to your identity. Okay, so yeah. yeah so very just being very careful so it's always just a really good reminder. yeah Oh, my goodness, you got to be so careful yeah I am i'm definitely seeing you. yeah or your friends sober how's that working for you.
