Yes, yeah kids to come from bad parents and bad parents can produce good kids does that make sense.

You I did everything that my father didn't do my father walked down on me I just made sure my I never did that.

177.0,Provider,"After trauma. And like we'll talk about in group those childhood experiences it's it's not like solely based on the parent like you said right um but there's so many different influences that can lend to the outcome, or in the behaviors that individuals to later in life right."
12755.0,Patient,"Well, I got two boys my my youngest is a mama's boy. he's the more psychological damage, one that this whole separation hurts because he he I have grandkids now from him but it took him 30 years to settle down because he used winning up so bad, and because of what his mom did you have said he never trusted women. So he was just. Using john way here his other brother. To carry on. yeah he had bad part he got we relationships carry the map for a long time, you know. Never you know, but the younger brother, he has psychological damage from separation because her mother just decided to do our best to knock them out one day. and watching either live or 19 years old. I had to take it take it out. But yeah it's all good I. We talked a little bit today you're getting me loosen up so."
177.0,Provider,"You know I want to encourage you that even though there's a lot of decisions that need to be made you don't have to make all those decisions at once. You know prioritize which one, do you think is the most important. Right I don't want to make sure i'm clear the decisions that you're. trying to make is where you will go. yeah with that major decision comes the impacts of that so you want to still."
12755.0,Patient,"The first day here. i'm not knowing if i'm here my brother's House I got things around me before I get apartment i'm gonna be alone, the telephone line. idle hands are the devil's hands. yeah you know. I understand was i'm not gonna put. myself on that toaster yet it's. gonna say. grab do hot rail or something. i'm speed free."
177.0,Provider,"Right in a nice little glitchy some type of freezing it's been raining a lot here but. What I want to add is that also. You know, you mentioned that you've done a lot for your kids and wondering when is it going to be kind of like a separate page so maybe there's also something to consider that you have to prioritize what's best for you at this point. And sometimes prioritizing what's best for you. doesn't necessarily mean it's what's best for your child."
12755.0,Patient,"With the long term, it can be beneficial for your child. Yes, I do. I speak to my children way too much content."
177.0,Provider,"away, you can be there for your son emotionally and mentally but it doesn't necessarily mean your physical proximity to him, because you being there for him. Now plays a role in your mental and emotional wellbeing."

177.0,Provider,"Well, you also play a role in that."
12755.0,Patient,If you choose that the best place for you to be right now.

Especially in my bros thing or my brothers neck of the woods, because there's no don't let your brother command he'll pull you down shit man. No yeah i'll never yeah I don't take me down the i'm saying, and I want to make him look good and putting on a pedestal we're now with my sobriety Stephen.

177.0,Provider,encouraged.
12755.0,Patient,"us to stay in the fight and fight for what's right fight for what I want to do, and whatever kind of find out you just glanced over days. I can get a nice apartment I did a nice place for a buck 55 and as low below $500 a month and what they told me, I had to do was I just had to call and find a vacancy. Yes, and for a one bedroom and usually with the hud in the valley it's reaction, all these apartment complexes worse with the local hud year so having me on the phone and calling for bigger see on these apartments I could be one two to three days is your feet.

177.0,Provider,"What I want to say is that you have the courage there's still that fight in you so just prioritize and lily way out the pros and cons right but there's stores that are available to you right so there's housing that's a possibility for me that's available but it's that European alone. So maybe maybe now is not the time. And that's Okay, because you talked about intuition, a lot here your intuition will let you know when it is the right time."
