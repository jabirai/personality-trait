760.0,Provider,Before we get started um I wanted to ask you if you can let me know what it is you want to get out of therapy.
16431.0,Patient,"And I want to get feeling better emotionally, because I am. depressed and panicked and I have tons of anxiety."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and Is this something that you struggled with long term or short term, how would you describe that."
16431.0,Patient,"i've always had like anxiety for some years now and i've had some depression, but I had covert in September and my doctor things that gave me a form of ptsd."
760.0,Provider,hmm. Okay.
16431.0,Patient,So i've been.
760.0,Provider,Did you have a bad experience with call it.
16431.0,Patient,I actually had a mild case I am recovered at home.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16431.0,Patient,But it really traumatized me.
760.0,Provider,"Did it create a lot of. Fear of uncertainty, what during the process when you were sick, not knowing what was going to happen to you."
16431.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I had anxiety. Everything crying and praying and having Friday every day I just rock back and forth on my bed. I didn't feel better for a couple of weeks, and then I started feeling better. And then. That was like September 20 I was diagnosed and then. started feeling better and then after that you know I had my grandson's birthday party on. And I did Okay, I mean I was still tired, but I mean I was around people. I had went to a couple of stores, I was fine and then I developed, while I was sick I had gastric bypass so i'm not supposed to take ibuprofen, but when I was sick I was popping them all the time, with my other pills so. I missed it myself. is really bad acid so. I started getting some throat irritation and It reminded me. Of what I had coven so it freaked me out again because I thought the code was coming back and then I feel like this ever since. i'm paranoid I don't want to go outside. I wear a mask inside my house around my family because i'm so paranoid I don't let my kids go outside. I don't go into any stores like curbside pickup. I go to get like a rapid test, like every week. Sometimes twice a week because i'm just so. afraid of this virus now okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Sorry, no you're fine with this with this session is for."
16431.0,Patient,"i'm having a lot of trouble sleeping. I only get about three hours of my I have a lot of trouble falling asleep staying asleep I wake up really early in the morning and I can't go back to sleep my mind just keeps. All these weird like thoughts they're not bad thoughts, but it's just like so many different thoughts, you know i'll think about something for like 10 seconds and then like another thought comes in for 10 seconds and. You know my mind, is just all over the place and i'll try to like concentrate on TV and just listen to TV and it my mind just keeps jumping around. I wake up with anxiety like I wake up and i'm shaky. it's terrible."
760.0,Provider,So you're under this this causing a lot of stress a lot of worry.
16431.0,Patient,My hair is falling out. I worry all the time.
760.0,Provider,Are you taking any medication for your anxiety.
16431.0,Patient,i'm thinking. 20 milligrams of select so once a day.
760.0,Provider,And when did you start that.
16431.0,Patient,"i've been on that for years. But. I used to be on boost bironas well for my anxiety, but my cardiologist because I have benign palpitations he said that. It would be best if I wean myself off the boost bro. Because it can make your heart work harder. And maybe cause more palpitations and since I have chronic anxiety and panic disorder every time I get palpitations it freaks me out to. So I was trying to wean myself off this alexa before I got Kobe and I was only on like a half a tab. Every day that I went to every other day that I almost stopped it, but my doctor said that be in the situation that I had since I had covert she suggested that I get back love this alexa. So i've been to full dose for about a week, though."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it hasn't quite had a chance to like re accumulate up in your system fully then maybe right. Maybe yeah okay."
16431.0,Patient,"But I still you know I i've dealt with anxiety for a long time, I mean it's like I said it's never been really like every single day. For the past few weeks, my insomnia, is really bad i'm tired all the time, I have no energy because i'm tired i've lost 30 pounds. I lost about 18 or 19 when I had co written and then just you know because of the acid of the anxiety I just don't have an appetite."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So you're not eating well you're not sleeping well. how's how's your exercise, are you able to maybe burn some of the stress and anxiety with any form of exercise, or you don't feel up to that physically or. me on that."
16431.0,Patient,"I don't really feel like it because I don't have the energy because i'm tired, but. I mean, I do like walk around my apartment I mean not as an exercise, I mean I just like walk to liberty and walk to the kitchen walk to the bedroom I stay in my bedroom a lot. um I kind of always have, though that's just kind of what I do I just hang out my bedroom."
760.0,Provider,So it's fair to say that this whole experience with the pandemic and this whole experience of having had coven is kind of increased those tendencies and those symptoms. So bear to say okay.
16431.0,Patient,"If I would have never had code I don't think I would be like this. My family keeps telling me that i'm you know i'm super paranoid they're telling me that you know. And i'm like you know what i'm not being paranoid because i've had it you don't understand, unless you got it, you know."
760.0,Provider,"And you said you've had a mild case. What were some of the things that happened to you, with your mild case that. Was there anything that you can point to that made you very fearful just beyond the uncertainty of it."
16431.0,Patient,"The part that bothered me the most I think about it was the lung soreness because my doctor said that sometimes you're the. lining of your lungs gets inflamed so like if I took a deep breath that would hurt. It would feel sore so that's kind of the part that may be scared me the most, I think, but even though I could still brief fine and I bought one of those oxygen sensor thanks for your finger in my oxygen always stayed you know finding everything. And you know just because. The news and stuff has you so afraid of the death, you know the death rate of it, and they have it have this horrible horrible virus, but my doctor said. there's millions millions of people that have you know recovered from it, you know and it's just mostly people that have bad health that don't do so well with it and."
760.0,Provider,Mostly or elder.
16431.0,Patient,"yeah they said that you know. it's just you know it had me scared and. You know i'm just super afraid to get it again my doctor said that you know after you have it, you have antibodies for at least three months i'm partially vaccinated now i'm supposed to go next Wednesday for our second dose okay. But even then like i'm still. i'm still paranoid i'm freaked out i'm not like."
760.0,Provider,"Does it give you any kind of relief, the idea of becoming fully vaccinated. So, no, no, so it's the same anxiety that you're going to carry okay."
16431.0,Patient,Because you know they're say that even fully vaccinated people are still getting coated so.
760.0,Provider,"yeah what they say that the the chance of the virus, it reduces the risk of serious illnesses what I understand. Right yeah so. yeah a lot of the doctors are saying that this is like something that we're going to have to learn to live with is what they keep saying. it's kind of. But, but you know people are getting better they're getting they're getting. people that are getting vaccinated are doing okay most mostly so. Okay, so you you're struggling with a lot of that do you watch a lot of news."
16431.0,Patient,Not anymore.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good cuz yeah if that's if that's setting you up you want to turn that off okay Okay, so how about um any family history of mental health."
16431.0,Patient,"um yeah my one of my i'm the youngest so one of my sisters has a bipolar and depression actually two of my sisters do. One of my niece's has depression. and One of my other sister she won't she don't want to go to the doctor get diagnosed, but we think she's bipolar because of her mood swings."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right okay and and and right now, who do you live with."
16431.0,Patient,My husband and I adopted my two grandkids so I have. Okay yeah.
760.0,Provider,"How old, are they."

16431.0,Patient,"yeah my grandson just turned four at the end of September, and my granddaughter will turn 11 on December 20 Okay, but i've had them, since my grandson was one week old so he calls me mama."
760.0,Provider,So you basically parenting more than brand parenting. yeah yeah. So what happened that you what what was the situation that that caused you to adopt your grandkids.
16431.0,Patient,"Because my son and the mom they were on meth and you know when she got out of the hospital with him with the baby she didn't want to cooperate with the authority so they took them and then they didn't want to classes or get clean, so I ended up adopting them in January of 2020. Okay yeah but I got them on October 4 of 17."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how is that for you, being a parent all over again to your grandkids how was that."
16431.0,Patient,"um I mean it's. it's hard and sometimes you know, having a you know I raised a newborn again and i'm going to be 50 in April, so I mean sometimes it's a little stressful because you know kids are kids and I have a four year old running around now and has a lot of energy. But I mean I love them, I mean it's their mind so. I like when they play together, you know it makes me happy when they play together and not fight together."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so. kind of mixed. yeah something that you expected to be happening to you at this stage of your life. Right yes okay."

760.0,Provider,mm hmm do you do a lot of that since the pandemic or is everything kind of shut down for you.
16431.0,Patient,"um well, we were we were doing you know some barbecues outside here and there, we did go camping earlier in the summer went fishing a few times, but since I got coven I have done nothing."
760.0,Provider,"hmm. So you just kind of stay home. and stay in your room, a lot of the time and. And how do you deal with the kids when you're in your room, do you come out and check on them are."
16431.0,Patient,"or not. i'm not in my room all the time, because of the kids you know I do about the living room and set their why they play or watch movies, or something. or sometimes we'll hop on my bed and watch movies or they'll play on my bed they'll color and. You know play with his dinosaurs, or whatever you know so we're back and forth. Okay, but when my husband's home like now he's in the living room with the kids because he likes to watch his shows on the living room TV and I watch my shows in the bedroom so the kids are just back and forth."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and does your husband work. Yes, okay all right. talk to me about your your self esteem."
16431.0,Patient,As in like.
760.0,Provider,"how you feel about stuff, how do you feel about yourself. I feel."

760.0,Provider,"Okay, this year just kind of like ruminating and staying in that thought and and because of the virus you don't feel comfortable going out. and What about getting outside with the mask outdoors."
16431.0,Patient,"No, because I live in apartments so sometimes there's people walking around and I told. My doctor like this is what I see like when I. look out my apartment. I see like though you don't have a show those red coven sports."
760.0,Provider,Like on them yeah yes.
16431.0,Patient,"I like a picture of them everywhere so it's like i'm afraid. To go out and walk around because i'm afraid that, like if somebody had it. Like their sports could just be like flying around in the air. And then I could contract it again, even when I go like what I do have. A walmart curbside pickup and i'm on my way I don't roll down my windows and I have my. visit set on recirculate I don't have fresh air coming in there and sometimes if I do roll down the window little bit. And somebody passes me with their window down or something I rolled my window up or if I come to a red light if somebody comes next to me under windows down I roll right up."
760.0,Provider,"So it's constantly on your thoughts, is it constantly in your thoughts when you're in your House versus being out of the House it's like. let's go in the House."
16431.0,Patient,"I feel safer in my house. me and my two kids just went and got a rapid test earlier that you know we're all negative but. I just you know I just because my granddaughter's in school so. A lady that what are the teachers helpers had tested positive and she left on Tuesday. So i've been really freaked out so as of Tuesday. my sister lives in the same complex as me just to you know few doors down. And I had my granddaughter I was so freaked out I had her go stay over there for a few days, because my great niece. They go to the same school my granddaughter's in fifth grade and the other girls in the sixth grade, and you know they get along their best cousins and so. I said either you're going to stay home or if you're going to go to school, you have to go stay over there for a few days, to see if you develop any symptoms. Because i'm that paranoid, and so that's why, today, I took her to get tested, because you know that was today is Friday. You know I don't think partially vaccinated I had a conference with her teacher today for teacher said that lady was only in there for a couple of minutes, she wasn't near my granddaughter everybody had on mass and then all the kids went out to go to pee and then the lady left. So she wasn't even around her that long, I mean she was even like near her anyways. But still I mean my mind, is just going all over the place, you know thinking about that and i'm even after the Christmas vacation because you know they have this new variant mill i'm going to i'm going to put her in independent studies. Because I have a family, one of our friends. Go with Papa baby, please. One of our friend's daughter, she is in college, she would be a teacher, so I asked her if she would tutor my granddaughter and she said yeah she gave me a really, really good rate, so I told my granddaughter that I was going to have her. I was going to have her come out of school after Christmas vacation because they're expecting you know another surge after the holidays, because. everybody's going to be gathering and doors and everything and then, with this new variant they don't know anything about it yet. You know she's not happy about that she likes to be in school, but I told her it's just temporary till we see how the numbers are in schools and. I said, you know you gotta let grandma give grab a time because you know i'm still paranoid, and I don't feel comfortable and I don't want you to get sick again, you know your brother's only for he can't get vaccinated so we have to try to protect him as well."
760.0,Provider,"So she had it as well, your your daughter."
16431.0,Patient,"yeah we all forehead it, I mean my husband he got a rapid tested, and it was negative, but he did have some symptoms, so I think it was like a false negative he had like sore throat, he was tired and he had like a cost so i'm like if we all had it then most likely you had it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay it's possible, especially since he had some kind of symptoms. Exactly all right. Okay, and talk to me about how okay you Leo you already talked about that any other health issues that other than the coven thing that you're recovering from any other health issues that you deal with."
16431.0,Patient,I had your home a tradable.
760.0,Provider,All the heart palpitations yes okay.
16431.0,Patient,yeah I have.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16431.0,Patient,"i'm just taking multiple all for those for the palpitations. I have to have my gallbladder out soon, because I have it's my gallbladder is inflamed a little bit, and I do have gallstones. And lately i've been feeling a little bit of fullness over there, my doctor did some blood work I got the results today. And my light pink. was a little little little bit elevated but she said she wasn't worried about it because everybody's like pieces a little bit different. said I should get my gallbladder out, I was going to get it out before I had coven. And then I got Google I couldn't get it out, so I called the surgeon office. Today, and they said that they would try to steal the me for like January or February."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16431.0,Patient,"And then I had like I said I had the gastric bypass in 2017. yeah and then. But other than that, I mean I have like you know, like some arthritis and stuff like that, but nothing major."
760.0,Provider,"Okay well um I hear you it's easy to be traumatized we posted i've been myself traumatized to a point with coated before I worked here, I worked in person. and I it's kind of hard, because I could feel my own mind at that time. want to go there with the fear of covert because I went there before the vaccine, I was doing that, from the time while I was working from home for a time right when the shutdown happen because i'm also in California. But I kind of learned to make peace because I noticed that the more that I stay home. The those kinds of fearful thoughts, the more I think about it, it kind of feeds what i'm feeling and my fears and then it leads me to stay home and isolate and this is like a like a. Like a triangle of you know thinking emotions behavior staying home and it's like a ruminating thing it just keeps going and going and going, and the more I feed that. Then I noticed, you know my own fears. kind of start to take over with that. I was able to kind of make peace with it by like applying concepts like understanding that you know everything I do in life is a risk. And then there's certain things that you know we can't control and I keep thinking I can't control call that I wish covert didn't exist, I wish life had never. Gone where it went and I truly wish that but I was able to kind of continue working and made peace with that because it was outside of my circle of control. So what I focused on instead was being super vigilant with the mask and being super vigilant with you know going, you know, avoiding going places I didn't need to go for a time until I became vaccinated. Things like that, and I have to tell you Brenda I was exposed at least five times when I worked in person by co workers and and patients that I was working with that later came back, one of which had even been in my car. And I never developed coven and I wasn't even vaccinated but because of my vigilance, I was like like that so i'm telling you this story. Because I know It just seems that you're you're kind of ruminating on that and the more you feed it, the bigger the fear gets. And if this just keeps going and going and going, then what you're doing is you're you're basically living in fight or flight over something you have no control over."
16431.0,Patient,Exactly.
760.0,Provider,"And so, part of the healing process would you know my suggestion to you for your consideration i'm not going to force you to do anything but just to kind of reconsider that. And you know he you know, for me, I felt such peace of mind when I was fully vaccinated. And I just I got the boost like. A month or so ago right right as soon, because I was, I was in line because I was a healthcare workers, so I got it in January of this year, for the first time, so. You know i'm telling you this story to kind of get you to consider what what are some of the behavior change changes, you can make, and you know, because you can't control the virus. And I agree with you it's really important not to be not too careless or to take like risks, I mean I go I go to the market, I see people in the market with their little babies no mask and I just. I can't understand that, but I can't control that so I go to the market and I don't have a mess now i'm here at home working now but but I don't ever leave the House without it either. Even when I go on a walk I take my mask I may take it off if i'm walking and nobody's around me then I put it back. But I could feel there was a tipping point with the virus, where I could have gone that way and allowed my anxiety to spiral, and so what is some of the little things do you think you could do to work on that a little bit."
16431.0,Patient,I don't know.
760.0,Provider,Maybe maybe we could try some mindfulness activities to.
16431.0,Patient,"Read on that. i've read on it and i've tried to like meditate and I just I don't know how I don't know what to do, the only thing that I really do for my anxiety is I try. Because like I said i'm not new at anxiety i've had this for a long time, but you know, sometimes I have bad panic attacks, you know i'll get palpitations with them my face gets red and hot and sweaty and they just come whatever. Now it's it's it's not so much panic attacks it's just anxiety, where I have it in my chest, I feel nervous i'll get some adrenaline rush, I have to keep moving. You know, I have to shake my feet, you know and i'm just like you know my muscles are tense and i'm you know I wake up with it and i'm you know i'm a lover lover logical person, you know i'm a pretty bright person and I tell myself, you know. Where you know what it, what do you have an anxiety for like you're okay. Your home, you know you're safe. You know nothing's going on, you just."
760.0,Provider,"there's there's nothing to interrupt you, but there's there's cognitive thinking, but emotions are irrational. Right. And it's never a good thing to try to deny what we're feeling. it's it's kind of learning how to cope with that did you did you have traumatic experiences growing up any any abuse or. know anything like that so so the anxiety."
16431.0,Patient,"comment on. It came from, I actually don't because my mom and dad they never thought they'd never hit us they always provided for us. i've never been sexually abused i've never been abused. I just I don't know where the anxiety came from. I know i've had it for years, I mean it might have been just built up stress or something i'm not sure I don't know but."
760.0,Provider,You have a fast paced life at any point in your life earlier when it started. A lot of.
16431.0,Patient,"Work and. I was, I was single you know, I was you know. Try to hold a job to keep my place to take care of my son, you know."
760.0,Provider,"My favorite single mom for a while, when you were a while I was yeah and."
16431.0,Patient,"I didn't I wasn't a single mom tell my son was in the second grade and then me and his dad split up and then you know, had a few boyfriends but then now i've been with my husband now we've been married just for a few years but we've been together almost 16. But that's even longer than I was with my son's death because you know, like, I was young, when I had it but. I don't know I actually don't know what caused the anxiety I think at first started out with social anxiety, I would go to church and I would feel weird I was still like kind of panic all these people around to the noise and everything like that. And then, sometimes when I went to the grocery store, you know, like they're kind of warehouse looking they're real big and so. Big open and the loud noises and stuff it would like freaked me out, so I did have kind of like social anxiety I think they call it a generalized anxiety and fear and then. Now, sometimes I just i'm by myself, I mean even before covert I would just be by myself and I would just like start feeling like a little off and i'll get like a adrenaline rush and I start feeling jittery and scared and you know what heartbeat and fast. And I just try to breathe, through my nose and out my mouth and just try to calm my body down i'll try to like focus on the TV or focus on something so i'm not focusing on what's going on with my body. Okay. So sometimes that helps a little bit sometimes it doesn't okay."
760.0,Provider,"So mindfulness can be meditation but it doesn't have to be there, simpler forms of mindfulness exercises and it is a practice it's not. You know it's not something that you're going to be good at instantly it's it's something for you to kind of evolve to work towards and if meditation is hard for you there's other ways to do it there's like a moving mindfulness there's a body awareness mindfulness. And then there's even like a call 5435431. You know, five things that you see. for things that you feel not your emotions, but like will you physically feel like right now, I feel the arms of my chair and I feel my sweater things like."
16431.0,Patient,"That I read on that too, but I heard it was 333. Like three things i'm seeing. Here, and still."
760.0,Provider,"are so there's there's probably different versions of it in. The part of the what of it doesn't matter it's it's to you know, because when people you say you think you have ptsd and if you do have ptsd, then what that is is a kind of a. Brain response, where you're kind of, even though the trauma is over, you know it's it's a few months behind you now your your brain is still kind of in that state. For example, so and so. it's like being in the past and mindfulness one of the main principles of mindfulness is to be in the moment, and so it kind of took to help you get out of that past trauma or fear or anxiety, or whatever you want to name it. So that would be one suggestion that I could could make and then perhaps another thing. Maybe not until you're vaccinated fully like what the second vaccine plus two weeks. Maybe plan an outdoor walk. put on your mask when you walk out your door, and so, when you go out your apartment that's like a hallway that's indoors is that what I."
16431.0,Patient,"know when I walk outside it's open. To the complex it's totally open and stuff but. You know there's kids and there's people, and you know other people they take walks in the evening or you know I live around a lot of Asian people too, so the older people they'll come out in the evenings and take little walks and stuff you know, and you. know some of them, some of them do, and if they're not around nobody they don't, but if you know there's two or three of them walking together they'll have a mascot and you know stuff like that some of the kids wear masks some of them don't. I just you know I don't I just feel like i'm too close to people here, even though. You know. I may not be i'm not sure I just I don't know, but you know, a couple of times we did go to this little park that's not too far away, it has a little pond and you know my husband likes to fish. And so to the kids so you know I would set in my little chair, and you know, I was still have my mask on even though we're outdoors but I mean it felt good to get outside you know we stay away from people way away from people. My husband Sometimes I feel he gets a little. annoyed maybe because i'm so panicked and he's like he tells me he's like you're fine now he's like we had it, you know we're better you're over it, you know you're fine he's like so stop thinking he's like the more you think you're going to drive yourself crazy."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16431.0,Patient,"boy yeah it's easy for you to say because you don't have i've already had chronic it, you know anxiety and panic disorder before all this happened. Yes, you know now that this happened, you know it just rubbed it up a few notches, and so I told my. son and I had it like the worst out of all of us. You know, he had a very, very mild case my granddaughter she said she just felt like tired and like maybe a headache a couple of days. Because you know kids do better, and my grandson he just had, like some sneezing and some mucus on his nose and like a mile fever. But I had like diarrhea I had headaches, I had body aches I was super weak, I had the lungs soreness. And all the anxiety and stuff like that you know."
760.0,Provider,"And you couldn't go anywhere, because you had to isolate because you had coven. And so right ruminating just started from there, and it seems like you know, the goal is going to be to how to how to break out of that gradually in a way that isn't overwhelming to you."
16431.0,Patient,"I wish my husband would understand a little more cuz he's Latino and you know they always have. Lots of parties and you know gatherings for every occasion and so. You know his life he's used to be an out and stuff and so sometimes you know, I just want to stay home and I told him i'm like don't go anywhere I don't want you to go around those people. Like you know what if you bring something back to us, or you know so sometimes I think it gets a little annoyed because you know I want him to stay home all the time he gets really bored. And he wants to go do something so you know, I just wish to try to. He doesn't get mad, and he you know nothing like that he just told me like you need to like stop thinking about this stuff you know he's like you need to like do something and. And so I just wish, he would understand some more like kind of. Where i'm at you know. cuz. I mean, he supports me, you know, like. he'll say you know if you don't want to go, you know don't go he's like but try not to think about stuff you know. Last week, and."
760.0,Provider,"I think people people that support us like that sometimes they don't understand the science behind dealing with trauma they don't understand it. And they just kind of relate it to their own experience, and that may feel like in on some level, you may feel Okay, he doesn't understand it's not making your advice it's not really helpful to me I wish I could think stop thinking about it, maybe kind of thoughts. So."
16431.0,Patient,"When I said I said because he had a really super mild case. I had it worse than us, and I even talked to my sisters and stuff I said, you know i'm pretty sure like if I didn't have it so bad, like, I mean, even though it was a mild mild case. If you didn't but my bad I don't think I would be this way, like the long sword is hurt you know it bothered me because I was scared but my doctor said. You know I wasn't the only one, a lot of their patients that had code, at the same time as me was going through the same thing you know somewhere saved somewhere different there's different symptoms somewhere very similar to mine. They said that what's happens because it's a respiratory virus so. yeah but it just really scared me, you know you never know when you get it you don't know where it's going to go, you know and all you think about dying and you know what I have my kids and you know so. I was just to their house that we stress it out, but I told him I said that's because you didn't have it as bad as me, I think, if you would have had it as bad as me you wouldn't you would understand more you know. And then my my nieces and stuff they're like you're worrying too much and i'm like I have a right to worry i've had it, I know how it can make you feel you guys haven't had it they're vaccinated but you guys never had it so you don't understand. Okay, so I mean they just let me do my thing they're like Okay, you know. stay in your House, you know, whatever if that's what you want to do you know it's fine you know, but you know they said you can't stay there forever you got to. Live your life you don't."
760.0,Provider,"say that it does become like a self fulfilling prophecy so you know I you know, maybe starting to plan some more fishing trips, or maybe just a walk and. start thinking about how you could start pushing yourself a little bit to get out of that anxiety. i'd like to do some mindfulness things with you, and if meditation is hard for you, maybe we could do some meditation together on our next session and maybe give you some of the easier ones to do on your own."
16431.0,Patient,"Yes, because I want to get better."
760.0,Provider,"You have to start changing the things you're doing. The things the things you're thinking and working on that, and it is a gradual process Brenda."
16431.0,Patient,"My said she said. it's still new you know she said I just got diagnosed on the 20th of September but that's not since what I recovered recovered like two and a half weeks later, so she said it's still new. it's just like I just need a little time and I said, you know my anxiety and my depression has gotten slightly better I will admit like I think it's a little better. I haven't really cried like this for like over a week now."
760.0,Provider,you're getting triggered with my questions.
16431.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean you know I feel better talking about it with somebody that stands. But um it was just last week. early last week my grandson's beast and I started crying and Kevin by room. Because he seems. Like he's like calm down it's just a sneeze he's like we always sneeze here they're not like I know i'd be like, I know, like my grand said, like every time he walks out the door he'll speak because it's like a mild allergy or something i'm not sure, but. he'll sneeze by me he'll be leader like I said we come to my bed or we're going to leverage to be next to be played on his tablet or something if he'll speeds, and I hope. All up you know with my basket my granddaughter she's like grandma really just like you're overreacting she's like it's just a speech and i'm like I know I know. But it's just something."
760.0,Provider,"I automatically you. know you know, but your emotional response to feel something different. So so. learning to cope with this emotional response to get to the point, to get that worked out, so that you can start to use your head a little bit more. To help you kind of dig out of this, the symptoms that you're that you're going with that's that's what i'd like to kind of work with with you that sounds blood."
16431.0,Patient,"Okay, I went to get my blood drawn that I put two mascot anytime I go to where I put on two bass and it's sometimes I even do that with my shirt. I mean it's crazy. Okay i'm really afraid of this virus."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I guess, this mindfulness sound Okay, that we could try that next time okay."
16431.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"All right, um have you started your group your groups, yet."
16431.0,Patient,"No, I believe it's all like the 15th or something."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay what you've been assigned your group, you have to check when."
16431.0,Patient,Maybe the 15 I do have an appointment. it's like the 15th or 17 something like that.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16431.0,Patient,"Oh, the lady did send me the appointment I just haven't been to it, yet, so I don't know what it's all about."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, now, I just want to know if it's set up, because I know. there's a process to it, I don't schedule appointments but but i'd like to. Do you know how to contact the vc to schedule an appointment, or do you want me to have your care navigator reach out to you."
16431.0,Patient,If you can have the care navigator reach out to me.
760.0,Provider,Okay i'll do that.
16431.0,Patient,"How many times, I see you per month."
760.0,Provider,"Probably twice monthly I think that's what it is okay all right. Okay, so just start thinking about that maybe start journaling about your feelings, a little bit. And let's talk about it a little bit more, I mean next time and and then we'll practice some mindfulness and give you some skills to. to manage this anxiety and this worry. I mean it's to a point it's a real worry, but sometimes we can take a real worry and we can blow it up to, but the but the but the emotions don't know the difference. Right okay."
16431.0,Patient,Do you have a quick suggestion like what I could do to get better sleep.
760.0,Provider,"Better sleep you turn off everything no caffeine, after a certain hour you turn off all the the."
16431.0,Patient,"You don't want to. sleep with my TV on, but I have for years and years, because when I fall asleep I try to listen to my shows you know that kind of puts me to sleep before all this."
760.0,Provider,If that's not working anymore.
16431.0,Patient,"No, because when I sit there and try to concentrate my mind just races through other thoughts okay."
760.0,Provider,"Try it without the screen try to turn it off try to turn the TV off they say that that's not the blue screen, especially the great big TVs they make nowadays are not good for for sleep. Try to turn that off. Maybe try to do some physical activity to burn some of your anxiety. Certainly. Well, if you think about it when when we're feeling anxious when we're, especially if it's a heightened sense of anxiety, you are putting yourself in fight or flight. and fight or flight means the the. The cortisone and the stress hormones are surging through the brain. With the intention of protecting your self preservation keeping yourself safe all that's the whole point of it. So when we sit and this is surging and the anxiety is building, and this is something like coven I can't control there's nothing to do about it. And I don't exercise or do anything like that, then it just kind of ruminates, but when we do physical activity, especially when we're feeling anxious at least you're burning some of that. That those hormones, because that's what the body wants to do it wants to do physical activity fight or flight right, you know if you think what fighter flight would be like running away, you know kind of thing and so moving I don't know. You know you even if it's in your own some setups maybe some push ups I don't know what kind of shape you're in but against the wall, how are you got to do. Or maybe even just some you know leg lifts and swing your arms just burn some of that activity try to try to make yourself a little tired. Then, and then we'll we'll learn about mindfulness i'm going to probably give you several activities okay to practice and give you, because then you there at home might as well might as well use that time to practice something different just got to change what you're thinking. Okay okay. Okay, all right, I hope this helps Brenda."
16431.0,Patient,Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"glad you glad you did Okay, we call it is got to get this anxiety thing."
16431.0,Patient,So that when we hang up i'll just wait for my coordinator to get.
