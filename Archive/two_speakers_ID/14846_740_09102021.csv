And I love my job. Which is weird you know because I love my job, but I I just I lost it I freaked out and so that's what basically that's what's making me seek therapy because. Some you know, obviously I know i'm not right, I can tell the depression is back, I actually did I didn't even notice that it was back until I really stopped in. And I was like wait a minute like you have you know you don't want to do anything and I, and I thought it was Maybe it was being lazy or I just didn't even think about it. But no, I actually I have been i've been like this for months now they're like right just just the desire of just the norm is not there and I just thought I was being lazy and I didn't even realize it so much time had passed by where I was feeling like that.

740.0,Provider,And what are some things you want to work on why you're here.
14846.0,Patient,"i'm. For sure just anxiety i've had it since. i'll tell you like this the earliest, and like that I was like holy shit I had really bad anxiety that I can remember when I was a kid was because it was the first time that I had my own room and I was eight. And I remember that I had, and I have i'm a super neat freak i've been any freak since I was a child, like literally a child. to the point where my cousins are all hey let's play meet and card isn't made you know, and I would have she knows i've had hard OCD just for a long time since I can remember, and this is the earliest, I remember having OCD and being any freak is I had little mermaid sheets. Right and I was all excited so it was like my first time I had my room, I remember that. My first time I have my own space, because I never had my own space. And I have my own room and how my bed, and I remember, I had little mermaid sheets and my room was impeccably neat and clean and freakishly just organized and weird and I remember, though, that i'd say if I was chewing on my bed. And I was going to go get something from the fridge I would remove the creases from my bed. Even though it's going to come right back and sit on it. Really yeah and like for sure that is like the earliest like that I remember having that hard OCD like cuz I mean therapists in the passive told me that i'm a neat freak because that's a way of controlling my environment. And it's due to anxiety and i'm like oh that makes a lot of sense because, since I was a little kid for some reason i'm like. Cleaning crap up and and yeah I just remember that I would and I, you know i've Personally, I think I was like wow that was freakin weird like I was going to come right back to that bed, but why do I. Remove the creases and here's the thing i'll find myself doing trying to do that now, but then i'm like what are you doing like stop it's not important just stop you know, like it doesn't always have to be like a freakin home catalog. Because I find myself doing it now like i'm like Sam i'm chillin and i'm going to remove the crease like what the hell, are you doing like no stop."
740.0,Provider,"There, like a compulsive behavior. You know, like wrinkles."
14846.0,Patient,"I just don't like mess it's. So funny. yeah I don't like mess, but the and here's the thing, though, like I I don't like mask but I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable either you know, like I want people I, and I always anytime someone's leaving my house, I was. Because there was like holy show your House is really clean i'm like dude, but please make a mess, because I didn't have something to do you know, and then, but the thing is is."
740.0,Provider,awesomely my commercial I have something to do.
14846.0,Patient,"yeah like to do and then like although you know I don't I don't judge people either like because I, you know we moved around so much and most people are you know they're messy so many people are messy some people or dirty some people are cluttering some people are all of the above. When like I you know I. I think, good for them, they can relax The thing is, is, I can relax and I know that and that's the reason why my house is always so neat stupid me."
740.0,Provider,Along with it.
14846.0,Patient,that's not. My friend said.
740.0,Provider,"He just as long as. It doesn't affect the it's one thing to be me, and you know as women, sometimes you'd like things in a certain place. And then, when somebody picks it up put it back down to the same place no I didn't put it over there, to the right right here in this spot where I had the first understand because I got a hood so obvious but. As long as you're not compulsively doing it. Like, to the point to where is like. you're kind of pushing yourself over the age to try to get out of rank."
14846.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,yeah.
14846.0,Patient,"I think it is compulsive because the thing is, is, I feel like it'll almost make me late for stuff."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, get it is. yeah."
14846.0,Patient,"that's okay yeah. Because, because the thing is, is, I will not leave my house a mess. I will not leave my house of there's a spoon in the sink. Like everything has to be perfect in its place before I leave I walk out the door. Like and it's not like i'm going to have anyone over or anything, or I don't know it's just I I I just noticed that everything has to be exactly in its place, if I leave my house. And the thing is is I you know it becomes a problem, because then it may, it would, at first, it would make me late for work and then some like okay so either I stopped doing it, or I wake up earlier guess what I prefer to wake up earlier. cool so it's done, because if I leave and it's not done it bothers me."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14846.0,Patient,"um so yeah anxiety for sure, just like I said i've had anxiety, since I can remember, and also trust, I have a really hard time trusting people."
740.0,Provider,"So we have anxiety, we have. proposed the behavior we have trust issue."
14846.0,Patient,"And then, just and then just when the depression hits just you know. it's all about coping mechanisms yeah I just. I I I need I just you know."
740.0,Provider,Are you anti anxiety group.
14846.0,Patient,"um I, so I signed up with you guys on the first when my insurance hit. Oh yeah I literally called 9am. And I was going to do a group meeting on Monday, and I was, I came, but after being on hold for 20 minutes we found out, it was Council. So so would have been it would have been my first one. And, but I plan to go on Mondays I believe it's with Sharon. Yes, yes and 9am so yeah I am planning to. To do I, because they asked me if I wanted to do just one on one or i'm like i'll i'm willing to do all of them, because I. i've never done the group I haven't done the group one since I was a kid I remember my mom had me in some group, like teen teens I was a crazy ass teen so like from hell, you know and um so I remember trying to do group there, but that was a last. minute so I told her, I was like can we do just anything that I would i'm Donna do anything because I don't like feeling like this."
740.0,Provider,"Let me actually and after this one we're going to wrap up but. What are you going to do about your job, are you going back or are you just going to me like i'm done with it, and then they have you decided what you're going to do."
14846.0,Patient,"I don't know what I want to do, of course, a huge part of me says Fuck this and I want to go, but the thing is is I love my job, I really do love my job. I I don't know I don't know and the thing is is I I literally don't know I wish I I wish I was sure of what I wanted to do you know because I know, deep down inside, regardless of what I choose it's going to be alright, but I still can make up my mind. I just I it's like I don't want to leave I don't. Like i'm like I should leave and then I don't want and then, but I just I don't want to either because I i'm i'm a compulsive person or when I want to do something I just do it. I say what's on my mind I do, what I want I don't you know I don't i'm pretty sure of myself but for some reason. When it comes to quitting my job, which everyone tells me just quit your job, but your job because it's been since for like I said, the last couple months I start talking about work and I start crying and i'm and everyone's like you have to quit and I just I don't know why I."
740.0,Provider,"Listen everyone. was right when I gonna pay your rent and. Food and everybody is paying for your life. And both campaign for your water so that's not that's not the case, because a lot of times and and you have to be careful in regards to listening to people when they when they make recommendation, but then they go to a job and they say."
14846.0,Patient,yeah and then they do the same thing and they're like miserable and i'm just like well why don't you.
740.0,Provider,"But see it's one thing about it, the thing about it is it's not about changing your job because Everywhere you go you're going to encounter a stressful situation. Right I just I just got hired on here right but I had left the stress a stressful situation and then entered into another one, but it's a good stress it's not a bad it's not bad stress, because this is something I like to do. Right Cosmetology is something that you like to do that. Even though the environment can be stressful, then that means take our time after work to make sure that you're catering more to your mental health. So they you know you cater more to yourself doing relaxation techniques going for walks doing what you need to do to care for your mental health. Because it doesn't matter where you go, I mean if you're if you're focused with Cosmetology Cosmetology alone like I see out it. out a fingernail polish up there, and out of the kind of stuff behind your Michelle. So they'll if you don't if that's what you if that's what your focus is is this if that's where you're living in a desk while you're driving it is going to always be stressful you gotta learn how to code."
14846.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Right, and so the people telling me good quick good and did you do today bed, I can do you go to your job, and its base right and they used to say out of fire. And my thing is, I see if you love being a Cosmetology teacher if that's your passion is this your desire but you're in a stressful environment, you know i'm saying and then these you got to open your mouth and say something you need to communicate properly blow out is not proper communication. know what that is is that you allowed us to build a and they you just blurted out and went off on everybody. Based off of your own builder. Right and so therefore you're saying that means. That in proper communication because i've been stressed, I have not been handling my stress or catering to my mental health like like i'm supposed to. You know i'm saying, and instead of there, I have a last the environment of my work environment to get the best of me to build up frustration, to the point where now I have had a blow out."
14846.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So your question is that you have to decide, is that either either you're going to find something else. You want to quit altogether. or you're going to have to learn how to cater to your mental health. To be able to handle and maneuver through stressful situation when you are in stressful environments that doesn't matter what you do, you have to be able to take a few minutes to help, let me tell you some when i'm off the clock i'm off the clock. Okay, when I get off their five they say. No five. map and get up at five right if. You click on basically i'm out right i'm not taking this home right because, again, I have a family and so do you so what they do this will you take your job home you i'm saying, then that means you projected onto your onto your your significant other. And that's what happens and so death, I fear. No, you know i'm saying so my thing is, I see if either is so stressful to where you can't live with it. or. You or it's just the lack of being able to cope indicated to me to have to be able to properly deal with district, day after day."
14846.0,Patient,"yeah. that's exactly what happens because the thing is is a. I can't stop thinking about work I haven't been there in two weeks, and I am still thinking about it."
740.0,Provider,yeah I think.
14846.0,Patient,"I would like, but the thing is is i'm like stop thinking about work relax but The thing is, is I wake up, I think about it, when I wake up, I think about it, when I go to sleep I think about it when i'm in the shower I think about it when i'm driving, I think. it's so annoying why I can just clock out like how you said just clock out, I cannot clock out and and. it's yeah i've always had that good stress, but i'm like it's just like oh my God I don't know what the hell. It is yeah it's like it builds up it builds up and builds up and I just blew up and then that's the thing like I feel like I want to take some time before I make that decision because exactly how you're saying I can go anywhere. And then it's you know it's always going to be some type of hectic stress and or situation and the thing is is it's like yeah I don't want to do something rush like leave because I really do love. Teaching students, I never I never thought I would get into it, I never I kind of just by coincidence, I went in there. And I never thought I would fall in love with it and I fell in love with it and it's it's the most it's it's very self you know just you know. It rewarding as well you know, to see the growth and all that and and it's just I think that's what it is to it's just I just I love, seeing that growth I love I love turning a nervous Nelly into somebody with confidence, you know and. It just and that's the thing that's i'm like I don't know if I want to quit because I don't think I do, because I think if I wanted to quit I would have already you know what I mean. And so that's why i'm just like okay. But I need I definitely need some time because I can't I you know i'm like I can go back there and I can."
740.0,Provider,"And i've never known what to do, you have to do this. Because. If you need time then that's what you communicate. You know just go off. And then walk out. Right my mom used to always peach peach of NASA burn your bridges, because you never know when you're gonna need people to be."
14846.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"You may need a recommendation. And being they're going to ask you, where did you get last work, and so the people are not going to just remember your service they're going to remember how you went off. And they never again."
14846.0,Patient,"Oh they're going to remember that, more than anything."
740.0,Provider,"aggressive, so what you need to do you know what you need to do, but what I would suggest that you do i'm a manager it just in regards to just properly communicating calls calling the President, the official the manager, whoever this is over the school first you apologize. For your blow out let them know the truth under severe stress it was very unprofessional unprofessional of me and turning the right now, I do not have any intentions of quitting have ever I would like some time. And then exilim if they would grant you their time. They may actually how much time, you need that's something that you have to figure out, but at least properly communicate with them. And let them know."
14846.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,So that's that's that's what this part of the. that's a healthy direction to go to starting. And then the rest will figure out. As we go along.
14846.0,Patient,yeah okay.
740.0,Provider,"Well, we call it was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to working with you, and is there anything else you would like to add, or anything else that I may. become efficient."
14846.0,Patient,"No, no good you know good advice I never thought of of of communicating with them, you know."
740.0,Provider,We don't work on it yeah.
14846.0,Patient,"I mean cuz I usually do, but I feel like they just don't listen. Like they just they just don't listen to turn around there is ridiculous like ridiculous i'm the I know almost seniority to go on there no one else has been there long as I have everyone else, no."
740.0,Provider,"Well, like I said, even even, if any, even if everybody else cannot take it if this is your passion and this is your desire, then that means you have to be the change that you want to see in the environment. Okay, and the best way to be the change that you want to see is actually is actually labeling that within your own within your decision, and what you do, on the day to day basis So the first thing to do, of course, is the columns to say and so apologize, because it was unprofessional. I mean, even if you felt like you had every right doesn't matter, it was unprofessional you i'm saying, and so it just one of those things, and then, once you apologize they you express your knee my knee currently right now with that I need some time. Okay, and. And just take it from there, and let them know they currently right now that you have no intentions of quit. quitting you just need some time to take some time for your mental health and. Try that. I will let me know how those. And I will see you basically every other week. and hopefully i'll be able to singing group as well."
14846.0,Patient,"Okay. So um can you should I call back to you know because they didn't They explained it to me, I already forgot, but I said."
740.0,Provider,your father were to call them back again.
