15816.0,Patient,"um it's just like. I feel like it's just random thing like sometimes it could be something that like. I it's going on with sometimes it's just like thoughts that I get like. Look past week, this weekend like your head um I went to Tracy with my mom to work and, for some reason the night before I just I couldn't even go to sleep, because I just like. Thought like I just had the anxiety that I was we're just going to die on the way and I just it's just like I can't stop thinking about it, and then the day after that. I had to go somewhere else, and I just kept like for someone like I just was sure that I was going to die if I went there like someone was gonna kill me and it just gives me like. This is just like if I get over an anxious about one thing and it just progressed to like another thing just randomly."
298.0,Provider,Do you know why that might be something. Is there an underlying stress going on.
15816.0,Patient,"um I know that this year, I feel like it's gotten worse I don't know if it's because I mentioned to my therapist I didn't have a baby this year and. I feel like my anxiety has gotten worse, this year, like it i've always had suddenly variety and like kind of like feelings like that, but I don't remember it being this bud."
298.0,Provider,"Okay um. Are you nervous, are you breastfeeding."
15816.0,Patient,No i'm not.
298.0,Provider,Have you tried any medicine to help with that.
15816.0,Patient,No i've never tried medication.
298.0,Provider,Are you open to trying medicine.
15816.0,Patient,"um yeah i'd be open to it, I mean if I can, if it's like something that I it's comes down to it, I would, if I can like do it through therapy and other things, first I would like to try that but, in the UK."
298.0,Provider,I think you're ready for medicine. Do you want to try it.
15816.0,Patient,yeah I would be open to try it.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm not i'm. I am not sure which one will work here's the premise of how the the medicine works is we give you serotonin in your brain serotonin helps with your moods helps you have less anxiety. It helps with your memory, it helps with sleep if there's a whole bunch of things that when you put more serotonin into the brain. It helps with that. My recommendation would probably be to start with, and so loft at it tiny, tiny dose if, after four weeks it's a you know in two weeks, we can go up. Even a couple days we could go up, can you tell me a little bit more about your moods what are they like, are you crying are you what's going on mood wise."
15816.0,Patient,"yeah usually I feel like I cry a lot during weeks it's not I don't think all the credit every single day but it's definitely like my moods I also feel like i'm just more. Very irritable and sometimes like I was um I noticed, I was just at my baby was born like i've never felt like. That connection to maybe like once you start it's like really hard she starts crying like it's just like I just feel like it's like anger and like four months or just it's just."
298.0,Provider,"Okay well bear with me as we try to find the right medication and and for you, but what we can do is kind of take that irritability away take that feeling of doom and gloom like something bad's going to happen. A medicine that probably is a good starting place is zoloft, the problem is that you have serotonin in your stomach as well as your brain and when you give a serotonin medicine, it can kind of upset the stomach a little, but it goes away. So if you can just kind of our through it. It works better. If you let me know if you have any negative side effects, do you have my email address."
15816.0,Patient,um I don't think I do.
298.0,Provider,Now I give it to you.

298.0,Provider,"And so. After one week you feel like I I it's working, but I it's not doing that much, and I don't have negative side effects, then you can take two tablets. Okay, and you know get back with me and say hey I went to two tablets or i'm staying at one tablet yes it's working on my anxiety i'm starting to you know, things are starting to lighten up on me that way my irritability is getting better. Are you having any suicidal thoughts."
