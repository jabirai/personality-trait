8958.0,Patient,"I, no, no, no, oh no I have way more details i'm saying what's the last note. In my one my wonderful moving situation, so my lady went out of town like. She was gone for like almost like two weeks, so we can have. And like she came she came back like on Thursday and something and, like, I had the kid. So my my in laws were having a yard sale on Saturday so like the House is right next door, so the kids were over and like. hey we're kind of in and out a little bit, but like their kids like not too much, I always told her like i'm gonna have the kids over this and that so like on Sunday she's like. Well i'm just not comfortable with the kids being here and I don't want them here like this and all of this, like crazy stuff and i'm like Okay, well, we talked about this, you know. It i'm like Okay, if I haven't here all haven't like in my room or you know I kind of like told her you know we'll just be in and out, and you know i'll try and make it work and then, so the next day, I was like making. dinner, I was in the House, less than 15 minutes with Aaron and she came in, while she was there and then she's like. Well, this isn't working right in front of Aaron and pretty much tells me that i'm kicked out then material comes in the House and goes mom has dinner ready and she's upstairs and she leans over the balcony and screamed at him get out of my house. Like screaming and he's like well now he's six but he was five years old she's screaming over the balcony and he doesn't know anything that's going on. So he's just standing there and then she's like he's so rude he's just standing there and i'm like. Lady you're screaming at this kid that has no idea get out and he's like what what he just walked into his mom's House like and I was like no i'm sorry like I don't know what's going on, but I can't have this situation happening so right now i'm living at my mom's house. actually going really good."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8958.0,Patient,"yeah so I don't know if I told you before but, like me and my mom kind of decided like moving in with her was not a good idea, before."
252.0,Provider,"They tell you that, before."
8958.0,Patient,"No oh oh just kind of like my drinking kind of stringer relationship, a little bit and."
252.0,Provider,Just like.
8958.0,Patient,"Bad choices and just like stuff like that, but now that like i'm in recovery and stuff my mom's. An Allen on in kota for like a long time so she like sees that i'm making progress, and all this other stuff and, like our relationships like evolved and kind of in a different spot now, so I was a little bit nervous to ask her to move in."
252.0,Provider,Like she has.
8958.0,Patient,"This is the House I grew up in and everything and there's plenty of room here but it's just like so I mean everything, and I mean she would never like. not let me, you know what I mean, but so we kind of made it like a little agreement you know. Not definitely like long term, you know i'm still going to be looking for something, but you know she's cool and then and then we've been doing good and it's nice for her to be able to see the kids so. everything's working out pretty good with that I am sort of still looking, but then she also said, like oh don't worry about like a couple days later don't worry about like you know, trying to move out before the holidays, because it's like to you know what I mean so. we're kind of setting a realistic. realistic time frame, instead of like. So that sounds good, moving on the living arrangements my jobs going amazing. I passed my six. Month sobriety and last. Know day one day 189 today. The not drinking going fine not not a problem on that tip. The husband situation is not that great but communication is. The hardest part right now i'm just like trying to communicate like with the kit with about the kids and what's going on and. him not like wanting to tell me what's going on with him or what he's doing so it's just really hard that's a hard part for me. yeah and then like the school and i'm still doing like a ton of stuff for them, but then. he's like oh yeah you know they live with me and they're doing all this and then like now so like sunday's usually my day to hang out with them like after I get off work I work during the day, but yesterday, right yesterday was whatever Sunday was. I mean like call them and i'm like Oh, what do you guys have to like what are the kids doing after I got off work and he's like oh we're gonna go hit some balls at the driving range from like. Granted, he was working on weekend and that was like he's only tend to hang out with him, but i'm like. This is normally like my time to hang out with them, so I don't know, we need to probably like make a little schedule, or something for that, instead of just to make a schedule for. So i'm just trying to not let his problems like bother I mean like his communication nonis like bother me and just kind of like go with the flow and. figure it out, because it's not working, getting frustrated about all the time because."
252.0,Provider,doesn't change.
8958.0,Patient,"Only like certain things, you know that I could say like. once in a while he'll you know say something that's like. He asked me about Oh, are you working on Friday and i'm like Oh, why like he's like Oh, I have a catering on Friday. And I wanted to see like what to do about my tail and I was like oh like thanks for asking me first, because the past two weeks he's had catering he's just like asked his mom to like watch my tail. And like he see he sees that I have to work or whatever, but he couldn't be like oh i'm going to be home late, do you want to get it, you know what I mean it's like. yeah so i'm like oh so I made like a comment like oh thanks for asking me first and he's like yeah always and i'm like. Well, that hasn't really been the case so i'm like trying to throw in like my niceness but you know what i'm saying, because that wasn't like me, it was, and then I just went to something else you know what I mean. yeah I didn't like to dwell on that and I don't know if it's like that, like. it or not, but I just like without like getting mad and just being like Okay, like the communication isn't working, then, if I just say that then he'll realize like Oh, you know, maybe I should make sure to ask her."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8958.0,Patient,Does that make sense is that. Like something that's like.
252.0,Provider,"yeah you know it is I. If I was in your shoes, I would be very, very direct you know."
8958.0,Patient,"Sometimes yeah like I wasn't trying to be mean like I was just like saying it but not start a whole conversation, where we have to get into it and then it brings up an argument. yeah so i'm trying to get his."
252.0,Provider,You know his communication style better than I do right.
8958.0,Patient,"yeah it's not really existing. condition communication styles like tell me like what what I need to know what I need to do, unlike pretty much like that's it don't don't give me extra information like. He doesn't want to know the whole like backstory side story like just like give me like this much that's it like you know what I mean that's his community. Like if you start telling too much too much into the story you like will be all like already like not listen. So I already know that part so that's not hard to. to worry about that, just like that, and then other things he's just like I don't so. Last night, like when we were talking about this about oh about Mateo I was like Oh, you know, he was talking about this catering, on Friday, he had this like big catering this last weekend in. pebble beach, and like this nice fancy wedding and that he had won a couple weeks ago and I was like oh how's your catering go he's like oh we're good so like. Last night we've been like a perfect time to be like Oh, how was your catering, but then like when I was talking to him, and we were talking about his other catering, I was like. I didn't even think about it, but I was like that would have been a good time to ask him, but then i'm on the way home, I was thinking about that, like Oh, that would have been good 1010 but i'm like you know I don't even care. I know it went good because it always goes good you know what i'm saying like things happen always all the time, like you know what I mean if something goes wrong, you just figure it out and fix it. But i'm like you know, like I don't really care if it didn't like you know what I mean, then he knows that i'm like still. Interested so, but it was still like I was it was kind of like a. I was proud of myself known them for not really."
252.0,Provider,Right.
8958.0,Patient,"For maybe realizing that I did that I didn't care about that, like just certain things i'm like I don't know if. Like someone someone one of my friends asked me, the other day, like so like what are you hoping for, like in this like. And i'm like honestly I don't know if he came to me right now and said hey you know i'm sorry for being such a jerk do you want to get back together, I don't really know if i'd want to he's like. i'm a totally different person, but he is to like he's liking things that are like like I never even knew any of this i'm like Okay, are you just trying to just be like a totally different person like. I don't know his clothing styles change a little bit like."
252.0,Provider,Who are you.
8958.0,Patient,"yeah it's kind of weird. My my Barber my other therapists thinks he's having a midlife crisis or. Whatever. But i'm like. I don't know it's just like. Just weird and he still like always on his phone like I don't like I I tried to be on my phone like for a while, just because i'm like Hello everyone else's on their phone for a long time, but i'm like this is boring. I don't care about that you know what I mean like once in a while I can be like. Oh i'll just start looking for nothing but i'm like this is, I just wasted like an hour doing nothing."
252.0,Provider,Right right.
8958.0,Patient,yeah. I like trying to figure it out like how I guess I just don't like watching like videos i'm not.
252.0,Provider,i'm not on to.
8958.0,Patient,"My son is like infested it. But i'm like yes i'm like I don't know he, like fucking I don't know I just can't i'm like and then i'm like I don't care I don't care like what he's doing. So, but then he's doing all this other like she went to the brewery with his brother, the other day, but then he's just like oh like so I take my tail and leave and then like. I get back to the House and, like he's not there and it's like 888 30 on Friday and i'm like hey like where Where are you like, I gave me a bath and like we're back from the pool. Oh well, I didn't say Where are you I said, like Oh, what do you want me to do with material, are you going to be home soon, I want to leave. And Aaron wants to go to his cousin's House so he's like oh yeah just leave him with like the back door neighbor like i'll be home soon, but so like he didn't tell me he's going anywhere like before I left you could have told me right. He had already left like Sony he doesn't want me to know any details like of his life like what's going on, like he's trying to keep it a secret. Like he will be like oh like you know anything that's going on, like those catering, like the past two weeks materials fun tonight at my mother in law's house, but he didn't tell me, and then I I could I could have gotten him and I had to like run around to find him like in the next morning. Because I didn't know he was spending right there, so I go to like I went to their house, I went to like you know what I mean i'm like I shouldn't have to like find my kids you should just tell me where they are. I don't want to be. I don't feel like I should have to call him and be like hey like where's you should be like Oh, especially if you know that you're working. And you mean like i'm his mom you know what I mean it's just like that's just the frustrating part it's like for me that's like you know common tends to be like Okay, let me just tell her. But it's like he's like let me like let me, let me hide you know what I mean like I don't want to know."
252.0,Provider,"I don't need to tell her nothing, because then i'll have to explain where i'm going I don't want to know."
8958.0,Patient,"But I don't care where he's going that's the whole point, but he doesn't he doesn't get that because he still thinks that like he has no idea like how I feel about him or any of that. And like we don't like really talk I come in the House like in the morning to get the kids and i'm like Oh, and so I had my tail homeschooling all last week because he had his runny nose after his birthday. So he had to get up. and say home. That was kind of crazy. So. So yeah like I come in the House so yesterday morning was his first day back at school, so that was like a week off getting them back into his routine I was. I come in the House in the morning and he's just like sitting on the couch drinking his coffee and then i'm like oh like I just say hi and he just still sits there and doesn't say anything I just go get the kids ready i'm like. hey. You know so it's like we and i'm like okay cool I can pick the kids up today. So my schedules on the refrigerator so he knows, like everything that's going on with my life."
252.0,Provider,yeah he doesn't offer the same thing.
8958.0,Patient,"Not at all Oh well, he I know he has a catering on Friday. Well that's the thing yesterday, no I know he told me that's that's a plus he told me. So I so um and then, this morning I was like oh so his material going to be spending the night at your at your bonds house on Friday, because I can pick them up after work or I can just. Like i'm having be at my mom like my mom said she could help me why he was at work so. And he's like oh I shouldn't be home that late i'm like Okay, well, I was just wondering if materials gonna spend the night of your months. Like I just changed it back to like you're going to spend the night over there, and not because I don't want them spending the night i'd rather have them spend the night with me and he's like oh no I shouldn't be home that late i'm like okay cool. And then that's it like I don't like it that's all I have to say. So i'm also trying to like limit my conversations with him to what needs to be."
