527.0,Provider,that's okay yep i'll wait a second.
14662.0,Patient,"Okay i'm gonna mute my microphone. Okay i'm all checked in. Perfect cure the paperwork. I was on hold for a while, so I just decided to go ahead and join the same link as last time."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, this will be my link."
14662.0,Patient,yep.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, exactly well good well how how things been going tell me last spoke."
14662.0,Patient,"Sorry i'm trying to i'm sitting in a new spot so i'm trying to adjust. To the most flattering angle. You know I it's it's been OK. I started, I met with Sean tall, and she put me on. five milligrams of. lancer olanzapine olanzapine I think generic for."
527.0,Provider,site practice I practice up uh huh.
14662.0,Patient,yeah um. And I started that just this week. Okay um. So I met two and a half milligrams right now and then we'll step up to the full five milligrams next week.
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14662.0,Patient,And I haven't felt much of a difference. Yet.
527.0,Provider,For okay now okay.
14662.0,Patient,i'm not not that i've noticed um I. I still I was initially hoping to return to work next.
527.0,Provider,Week okay.
14662.0,Patient,"um but you know, I was, I was, I guess, having panic attacks about that my my wife. My wife and I talked about it last night and. Okay, she was kind of a good sounding board and saying you know, are you are you sure you really want to go back. Well you're. you're kind of a mess and you know it might not be the right time."
527.0,Provider,What was the push for you Eric I guess. I just.
14662.0,Patient,"I feel incredibly guilty for. Okay, taking. The time off from work, and you know not not being there for. The team, and you know all this stuff keeps piling up, which is i'm sure. yeah um but on the other hand, you know when I think about going to work and I have a pit in the bottom of my stomach and. It kind of sends me into a depressed mood that you know lasts for her three or four days, where I just don't want to get out of bed Sharon. hey you know I think I have to admit it as whites usually are she's. And it might not be the best."
527.0,Provider,"The best time. To go back what I mean is there the ability to like go back in at a slow pace slow, you know, like maybe. Two days a week. or like is it could you come up with a an option for like a transition plan for work, I don't know but i'm just curious."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah I had. thought about that I was actually thinking about going back like 60% time. So, three days a week. But um. The the nature of the job, and I think this is kind of what led to my downward spiral, to begin with the nature of the job is such that it's it's really hard to keep those boundaries, I mean it's a it's not a eight hour day, five day a week job it's you know, a 60 hour a week. Seven days or 66 hour week, seven days a week, job it's one of those things. um it's hard for me to disconnect. Friday and. I think that's part of the reason why, over the last year or a couple of years, my depressed state has gotten worse and worse and I. kind of felt fallen off the wagon of taking care of myself mentally yeah um I did speak with my boss, I met him for lunch last week. Just to. talk with him about it, and he was very happy to see me and very anxious to have me come back. But when I mentioned a part time schedule, he is he seemed to kind of back away from it. I mean, he didn't give me a definitive yes, you can do that he said basically well you know you're you have to do what you have to do to take care of your. which you know kind of I guess that's part of what was what was sticking in my craw and I was obsessing over. Share over and over again, I still kind of em i'm. Sorry, I don't yeah I don't know about about work about."
527.0,Provider,about taking yeah.
14662.0,Patient,"That part time schedule i'm just afraid it's gonna it's gonna take over everything again, you know yeah."
527.0,Provider,Is this a job that you want to stay in here.
14662.0,Patient,um.
527.0,Provider,"I mean I don't know if that's been. kind of you know filtering through your head to where you and your wife have had discussions you know, is this the best setup for us or."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah I. I don't know that it is long term, something I mean i'm i'm close to retirement. Being able to retire. So not not retirement age necessarily but. able to retire. Sure um and I was thinking of doing that, at the end of our fiscal year, which is June 30 so June 30 of next year. Okay um. You know I. I just I don't know if I can, I think it's a matter of whether or not I can hang in there, I guess. and tell me um. I don't I don't know. It took a lot for me to to you know go out on leave and and put the brakes on everything. Sure, and."
527.0,Provider,"Yet we'd have this what would have to shift or change. to ride out the last one, is that what nine months eight months. And not just like get by but but be able to feel productive and confident and you know my motions are managed, but like I feel like i'm in a better balance to you know go the next eight months. Like what would have to shift."
14662.0,Patient,"and change thinking with. It has been an exceptionally hard year. For a year and a half, all the way around because of you know everything. But it work, they also. They made some leadership decisions about installing well replacing all of our electronic financial SIS and the electronic says, I mean even like our space planning system everything all at once and everyone's struggling with that and I think that's like a. that's an that's a major source of stress for me. Because for. More than the last year we haven't even had any real financial reporting capabilities and i'm a finance guy so. You know everyone in my department is that all the Faculty I work at a university all the Faculty are looking at me like you know you know where's our reports on our research funds and all of that, and we can't we can't produce those. So that's a long winded way of saying you know that would be."
527.0,Provider,That needs to be.
14662.0,Patient,"The thing to have. To have efficiency back in our financial operations. or financial reporting capabilities. But that's. I I don't I don't see that happening anytime soon. Okay um. I mean they've they've actually told the Faculty that it's going to be like another year before everything is cleaned up and all the reporting is done um. that's. I guess that's pretty specific and more of the general terms of you know, would it would it be like a four day a week schedule or three day week schedule or two day a week schedule um. I don't know I mean i'd like to be able to go into work. and um you know do do my best within a certain schedule. Okay necessarily saying exactly eight hours, but within a certain schedule. Sure, and then be able to disconnect. When I leave so bit you know the cell phone doesn't rain or the text messages don't come in. Or you know people don't email me at 10 o'clock at night expecting them to answer. Okay, I."
527.0,Provider,Just don't really have in those earlier boundaries for yourself in relation. To that okay gotcha.
14662.0,Patient,"And I I. I don't I don't know if that's a realistic expectation. You know, when I think of the level of the position i'm in that's just that's just part of it, I mean you're you have to be on 24 hours a day, seven days a week there's always something going on in. that's why. geez i'm getting anxious just."
527.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. Well, my thought is is that is that expectation there because it's assumed that's what you have to measure up to like has that been like the expectation. kind of. put out there, that this is this is your role this is there's no boundaries or limits like what happens when somebody does set a limit like you i'm in bed at 10 o'clock like what if I don't. What happens if I don't respond to that. What what would happen Eric if you didn't respond to an email at tax or a text message."
14662.0,Patient,"I. well. I guess I I it's not an official thing but it's like a pure pressure thing you know. You don't want to be right exactly. Right slow to respond. Right um or you know you don't want to be the person who can't. Supply that answer to the CFO when he wants it. Or the controller when she wants it. You know I. I mean, I understand, really, the heart of your question is Is this a is this. A. level of expectation that's that i'm putting on myself, or is it something that's really part of the job. I would say yeah, of course, part of it is is me just wanting to perform well. Sure, but the other part of it, as well as just i'm. trying to get everything done that needs to get done I just I. I well when I left work, I was getting about 600 emails a day i'm sorry 300 emails a day and I was having I mean just that alone could take up."
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say that sounds like a whole day work right.
14662.0,Patient,"There, yes. I mean, actually, even if I like did the math on it at one point, it was like if I spend five minutes on every email. That right it's gonna be more than an eight hour workday just to gather the middle yeah um. I. I just I don't. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Realistically, do they need more staff."
14662.0,Patient,um yeah we do. But we also need more funding to be able to hire more stuff.
527.0,Provider,Sure sure so.
14662.0,Patient,"I can't i'm responsible for the budget, so I can't. I can't be in the negative, you know."
527.0,Provider,Which is what makes it probably more challenging and more pressure on everybody because.
14662.0,Patient,yeah there.
527.0,Provider,There are restraints have enough bodies to produce the work that needs to end accomplish the work that needs to be done.
14662.0,Patient,I mean you asked me a little while ago if I wanted if it's a job I would want to stay at and. You know i'm I guess the visual that comes to mind is me jumping in a car with you know and just like driving away from the whole thing.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14662.0,Patient,"But on the other hand, I can't do that i'm you know also responsible for my family and. My kids and you know. gotta have income."
527.0,Provider,so sure yeah.
14662.0,Patient,So I don't feel like just handing them my two week notice is is an option.
527.0,Provider,"Is there something is there other opportunities available for you at this time, or like what I mean, even if you stay till June like what's your plan at that point to transition to another. Or look for a job in in this next few months."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah um I was actually thinking of retiring. i've actually been looking at online programs to go back and. Maybe get a master's in psychology. Okay, try and become an lcs w or an MFA. Okay, like that. But you know that's that's about as much of a long term plan, as I have. Okay."
527.0,Provider,"Do you feel like if you could set some parameters with work that that could help the next few months, like if you, you know sat down with your boss, with a plan of you know here's here's what I you know here's what I feel like I can. Do to be most effective for this department and, in my role but and and I understand that. You know, you may not agree with the limitations are the boundaries that i'm setting, but I want to propose this as an option, you know is that you know, can you work from home any at all Eric like to. decrease, some have."
14662.0,Patient,been doing the last year.
527.0,Provider,Okay. Okay it's really so you don't have to go back into. The Office when you return to work. i'm barely.
14662.0,Patient,"yeah I don't I don't know that they. have finally implemented the return to work. Playing OK OK back onto campus to work from campus okay. um that's kind of one of the things that was going on, when I initially went out Okay, but. After the last year I I actually prefer going in to the office and working in the office at home i've got little kids and it gets. me a little bit too much. Sure i'm with. Trying to. I don't know. be there for them and. work at the same time."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm sure they don't understand that's working right now I can just pop in the office, and you know bogyman. yeah yeah. yeah question dad I need lunch, you know."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah which you know I I yeah I don't blame my kids for that at all, but that that's part of being a kid I just don't know."
527.0,Provider,"And I think. yeah and I think you know I think it's hard to manage with most of us, you know, working from home. Because there is that expectation Oh well, i'm at home, so I can go just shoot another email or I can answer this real quickly and i'm but i'm still at home with my family, and so I think sometimes those lines get a little blurred. For us, that work at home me included, you know I certainly I tried to put some parameters on my time and but you know. Work on the weekend there are many projects, you know that so but. What do you think that might help as far as. You know if you could go into the office and work, you know and could you make note to your faculty or your employees that you know here's when i'm available, you know Monday through Friday, or you know if it's. You know. Like i'll answer text messages up until a certain time, like. Do you think that could even be proposed of any sort of way with with your boss."
14662.0,Patient,um.
527.0,Provider,"You know, and even have it in your email at the bottom like these are my you know I will respond within after this time within the next 24 hours or."
14662.0,Patient,"um. Yes, I can propose it and. He he may approve it, but. What I worry about honestly is I mean if i'm getting those 300 emails a day, people are going to not email me because I stopped working at 6pm. Right. If I 7am to 6pm. And then that's it i'm not going to be on email i'm not going to respond, the emails are still coming in. So, then, the following morning they're all still there. demon answer. Plus i've got the regular whatever 300 emails a day that that come in um. And that's what I. that's that's where. I guess, I have my own issue cuz. I i've always been able to handle."
527.0,Provider,"yeah but that's a lot herrick and it's always going to be there that's the thing like I think you're realizing gosh this is this is always going to be here and I finally like i'm exhausted I can't keep up at this rate anymore. yeah yeah there has to be a breaking point. And this is it. And, and I don't know how best to manage that, because you know other than putting some parameters that yeah you're right i'm still going to walk into work, the next day and work any work leftover from the time i've left."
14662.0,Patient,With we're still going to be there yeah.
527.0,Provider,"But it's but it's going to be there, even if you shut your computer off at 10 o'clock at night, you know it's still going to keep coming in. Right so it's you know. Can you ever get ahead of the job. And and where's a realistic goal for myself in that. too to be able to take care of myself."
14662.0,Patient,"I. So I don't feel like I can ever get ahead of the job, and at the same time, it feels like that's a failure."
527.0,Provider,"what's everybody else do Eric. Like that it's not just sustainable I don't think. You can they ate you know, surely they have to recognize that and maybe they maybe they don't I don't know I mean."
14662.0,Patient,I. yeah I don't I don't know that they do. Or you know. Does anybody else does anybody else have like limits or boundaries that they set for their work time and family.
527.0,Provider,Time and.
14662.0,Patient,"You know that's the I guess the difference between I don't be disabled blue blooded or hoity about it but that's the difference between a leadership position, and you know, a worker position. Share you know. I don't know what i'm trying a frontline person. Be you know they. It is, I think, easier for someone who isn't a manager who isn't responsible for a department. To say yeah five o'clock that's it i'm out of here and i'm not going to think about for the rest of. You know, for for me. In my position. And there's I don't know probably 13 other people in the same position that that I in. Every university. it's. You can't just drop the balls right, I mean you can't you got to keep them in motion. So. I mean everyone is complaining about it. Some some my level position is called business officer. At some of the business officers have left. A few other management level people who've been there, a long time, like, I have, I mean i've been there, close to 20 years. A few of those people have retired. Some of the even the tier above me those people have retired. You know and. Jesus. yeah I mean I don't think there's any deny that it's a screwed up environment, to begin with. Okay um. But I have a lot of trouble. Not internalizing that. And you know I still have the expectation that. I wanted to do the best job that I can do it."
527.0,Provider,Right and.
14662.0,Patient,"Have everyone be happy with you know the work that i'm pushing that. So I I don't know that's that's where I guess I get. caught up in the cycle of you know, trying to run as fast as you can but."
527.0,Provider,Right right.
14662.0,Patient,You could never get ahead of everything that's coming in the door.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and things are adding your control, like you, you know you are trying to do the best you can with things that aren't working or functioning in the way that they need to be either, so you definitely have. limitations of what you can even and capabilities of what you can do at this point, it sounds like you know and and those things are out of your control like but so. You know so trying to separate those out from you know internalizing those as a reflection of not doing the best that I can well there's barriers in the way for you as well."
14662.0,Patient,Right.
527.0,Provider,Right and until those barriers are fixed or moved out of the way it makes it challenging for you to be able to get done what you need to get done and so where where can I land with knowing that i've done the best that I can. And still be okay within myself. Knowing that I could be you know I couldn't be doing better if these things were functioning for me. And it doesn't sound like that's going to be happening anytime soon So how do I function in a very dysfunctional environment.
14662.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
14662.0,Patient,"yeah so I. I have the option of extending my FM la for another month. and using up. This the last portion of if la. or returning to work on Monday with a modified schedule. I know if if I just returned to work without some some some sort of change, I mean i'm gonna i'll probably fly along fine for a month or two, but then i'm going to be right back."
527.0,Provider,Right exactly. To where was.
14662.0,Patient,I don't know. What is it.
527.0,Provider,"what's it mean to take another month for yourself what would it mean for you. How do you want to use that time to be productive for yourself, I guess, is what my Maybe my question should be."
14662.0,Patient,"Well, I think that's what i've been. Trying to do over this last love is. You know, go go into therapy and. Try to adjust my beds, to see if there's you know, a better combination. To keep me out of that depressed."
527.0,Provider,Space yes.
14662.0,Patient,You know other that you tried to do the things that I know are helpful.
527.0,Provider,Like yeah.
14662.0,Patient,Totally yeah writing my poetry.
527.0,Provider,"So, can you be okay with taking another extension. Other not in Madrid complete dismal failure Well, yes, and not going down that. That self loading path for yourself, I guess, is what my because i'm not sure that you're ready to return to work. I think you know that to. You but it's. it's being okay with that and knowing that i'm using this this added time extra time to continue the work that i'm been doing for myself."
14662.0,Patient,"So. I guess the question that keeps popping in my head is okay so. If I take another month off that one you know, then what happens at the end of that month."
527.0,Provider,I don't know we don't know what you're gonna be like in the end of that next month. We can walk off all day.
14662.0,Patient,that's what I worry yeah yeah that's true that's a while. yeah.
527.0,Provider,"I think it's just, we have to deal with day today like what can I do today that's kind of helped me work through this internal struggle of feeling good enough and knowing how to set some limits and boundaries for myself, and it may cause some riffs it may you know it. Is it worth that is it worth you know negotiating some some some limits for myself, so that. I know I can do the best that I can in this amount of time. and recognize there's lots of barriers in my way from really being as effective as I, as I want to be yeah. Because i'm sure if things were working better. You wouldn't. probably be sitting here."
14662.0,Patient,"No, I mean that's correct. yeah well yeah."
527.0,Provider,"I mean there's no because what's the normal amount of stress on a job you know we all have. Work stress, but when it gets over into the amount of stress that's debilitating to us then that's a problem yeah."
14662.0,Patient,"it's it's certainly a major part of the equation, I mean I know i've. struggled with depression my whole life. Or at least since my teens when I look back at it. You know it wasn't until my late 20s that I really realized it started going to therapy getting help getting beds that could take. So. I guess. What I want to do. Sorry."
527.0,Provider,that's all right Take your time take your time at all right.
14662.0,Patient,"So I 50 word right now. The last three or four years i've been at this depressed slump. I just wanted to stop yeah. Just. i'm tired of. The constant struggle. It hasn't always been that way, so I know I can get myself pulled out of bed."
527.0,Provider,what's different about this episode for you. Eric what's different about this time.
14662.0,Patient,"It feels like nothing's help you. Like you, like beds i'd be. War Prozac. And then. added the bupropion which seemed to help for a while it in Dallas seems like that doesn't work so now we're happy to let the site practice. Okay, and. You know it doesn't. mean that it, you know by by writing journaling by poetry it's it's. it's not providing I don't feel like it's providing that. sense of. Quiet or solace or you know. I guess I don't I don't know how to recharge my batteries. it's like the things I used to do to recharge my batteries. A good one my. psyche or my emotional level back to. It just. doesn't seem. Like it's working."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, what do you think's getting in the way. Do you think, work has gotten in the way of that. i'm. And i'm not playing. All but I am not putting all the blame on. On work, but if that was different. Would, would you be able to recharge better."
14662.0,Patient,"Maybe. I. Work takes so much of my time I I know that's why I had to even to to focus on my bed to help I had to stop work so that I could figure out a therapist to go to figure out, you know, a psych."
527.0,Provider,person.
14662.0,Patient,"To go to for the bed adjusted. So yeah it's it's I. Think without the pressure of work be there, it allows me. The. More than type I guess the mental capacity to. focus on okay what you know what am I really did, how do I feel better yeah. You know I should have grabbed a box of tissues before."
527.0,Provider,Do you want to go grabs them. yeah you can go grab them oh yeah.
14662.0,Patient,Have a fresh box.
527.0,Provider,"There you go. And you know I just think about the last three years to Eric like we've all been like there's. Work stuff there's coven stuff like you've. been really kind of isolated at home too i'm guessing and so. You know we've had a lot of contributing factors to really escalate depression symptoms, in the last three years for. For a lot of us too, so I think there's."
14662.0,Patient,yeah I guess well. I always think of it as being like the year of Kovac right but it's going to be almost two years.
527.0,Provider,or yeah I know exactly oh.
14662.0,Patient,"I think it was around. Is when I really started feeling this way and feeling like my depression was getting worse and I think that's the that's what I first added the bupropion to buy. Okay buddy meds so. I don't know I guess that's three years yeah 20 to. But yeah you're right it's it's there's there's been a lot of extra. stuff it. Just generally globally in the world that is. Contributing. So. So i'd like to put it all on work, but I guess I can put everything. You know. Work is that the only. depressing thing in my life I guess."
527.0,Provider,So tell me a little bit about how long you've been struggling just with that that internal self confidence and needing to.
14662.0,Patient,"I don't know, since I was probably well. Probably since I was like 13. or or younger, I mean it's. it's just something that's. always spent there. So. You know I tides have done better with it than others, you know. When I was in my early 20s I was the. Happily narcissistic. Like most early."
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say you probably had some coping mechanisms or Defense mechanisms to mask and manage that pretty well for yourself.
14662.0,Patient,"yeah Oh, who did. It wasn't until by later 20s that you know I. mean I think I told you about my. Close call with a suicide attempt. You know that was the. breaking point or the the rock bottom point at which."
527.0,Provider,I.
14662.0,Patient,"I released, you know. Something isn't isn't right. And I gotta. I gotta get some extra help."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
14662.0,Patient,So. i'm not sure where we sold without I couldn't last we treat the pot.
527.0,Provider,that's okay. yeah we were just kind of just. kind of the trajectory of your just internalization of lack of.
14662.0,Patient,"You know. yeah so it's something i've always struggled with. You know, at times, it's been. Sometimes it's been easier than others. You know this is, I think the. The most depressive episodes that i've had since I turned 18. his bed by late 20s now. So. that's. It I don't want to slip back."
527.0,Provider,In right right right yeah so. what's your journal journaling and poetry like at this point. Any any themes or.
14662.0,Patient,"No. I, I find it hard to get motivated to even to do much righty. You know by journaling is usually just you know. thoughts about what's happened to the day or what's going on in the world. By by poetry. could be anything. You know what I used to do was you know sit in a coffee shop, but just kind of walk people watch it."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14662.0,Patient,Good or later inspiration would cup lightweight. You know it's it's harder to how to feel that inspiration. And you know it's probably a couple of times a week that I write. It you know it my peak I was doing that every day. But it's. Heavy with kids you don't have as much time as you used to.
527.0,Provider,anywhere sure.
14662.0,Patient,"But it also. having trouble like could it get put my thoughts stale done but paper just knowing what to. What to hurt feelings winter right, I guess, more than right."
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and what if we worked on just journaling feelings and you're like just going internally in inside you not outside experiences or what's happening during the day, but really just reflecting back on yourself like what would that look like."
14662.0,Patient,Would you say what would it look like. i'd be. Like what.
527.0,Provider,"Would it yeah what we do, what do you think it would be like to write like. From from your inside out. Now."

527.0,Provider,You know okay okay.
14662.0,Patient,"that's not necessarily bad of. You know, I think. I do need to write war, because it helps me process by oh feelings. But. So when I say it would be negativity of the page that's not necessarily bad. Okay, that."

14662.0,Patient,"Probably sorta i'd be it's it's not something that i've ever really stopped it's just something that i've slowed down or at least that's what I told myself, so you know I think you're. you're kind of putting out the idea that I should probably journal more and more honestly about my own internal stuff and yeah I would agree."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14662.0,Patient,"it's not something that I think i've ever stopped doing it, but it's something I definitely need to do more. Okay, or you know, make a concerted effort to. Take an hour each day."

Be purposeful in that moment, you know if you have time at the you know, during the day and hey i've got like 10 minutes. i'm just going to kind of reflect on myself for the next 10 minutes and do some writing and then, and then I can put it up, you know I i'm you have so much pressure on yourself to.

14662.0,Patient,"yeah it's. Something I could have been I used to carry my journal around with be in my back pocket. kind of that's what I would do. When something struck to you or you know what I felt like I had something to say or right, I would just take my journal out right if. I guess the IV there's no reason why I should. start doing that again. You know, some people I Journal in my back pocket that just. Take it out whenever I."
