724.0,Provider,"we'll talk. You and I will talk twice a month. And then you'll go to group once a week and then we'll do other stuff as needed as it comes up you'll meet with like. physician probably Dr Lund. either in the group or, in addition to the group depending on if you need medication, or if you need extra services. stuff like that you meet with case management, it really just depends on what what you're what you're looking to get out of treatment if you need a lot of stuff if you need referrals and. If you need lots of counseling like all that stuff will provide based on like your request make sense."
13972.0,Patient,yeah yeah I almost winning got drugs yesterday because. I couldn't get my box and he was we wrote it for Friday and I barely got it yesterday so yesterday was Tuesday. It was rough man I I luckily I found a strip I had kind of.
724.0,Provider,"Did you run out or was there, not enough for what."
13972.0,Patient,"yeah well I ran out and last meeting you know, Dr Lang wrote the prescription on Friday, but then it wrote into walmart and they would didn't want to give it to me. And then uh it was just a household they had to call, and all this stuff and then like then they wanted me to pay and have the money as like as 100 bucks I was like this super just go get some dope and yea high, as I was getting sick already. Right that's not what I want to do you know, but I don't know if you ever been sick it really sucks and."
724.0,Provider,"yeah now i'm working in this field for over 10 years now, so i've been exposed to it, I i've seen what it does to people when they get dope sick and withdraw and all that, and all that stuff so I know exactly what you're talking about. i've worked Inpatient services drug court. probation outpatient methadone or suboxone subby tags, you name it I pretty much run the gambit on on treatment level so. yeah i've worked in completely asinine space programs have worked in medication assisted program which is that's what this is, you know you get. medication, on top of therapy i've worked in the setting where you'll get anything and all you do is get therapy and like they are controlled correctional setting so. i've seen all sides of the coin."
13972.0,Patient,"The thing is that you know we get dependent on was the pin on heroin and oxygen then. They give you some box and I never took it till now, and it seems like the withdrawals a stronger, you know."
724.0,Provider,"it's good nor candidate. So and it's pushing out any a list of opiates that you have leftover in your body so which is probably why they. They typically will start you want to low doses of boxing because they don't. They don't know what you got on board when you come in, so they don't want to put you in like a when they would call precipitated withdrawal so it's like sometimes people come in. And they'll take like a decent dose and all of a sudden they're just they're out of it because, like it goes instantly into and they're they're withdrawing. And that's because the narcan in the body of the dark and that's attached to the suboxone is blowing out all the opiates that shouldn't be there and that back that gets people all kinds of. stages of duress so, which is why they'll start you on a low dose and then you'll feel some withdrawal symptoms. should be minor in theory but everybody's subjective, so it really depends on the individual and then taper you up. To all more stable dose so where you're not having any cravings and any withdrawal symptoms, or anything like that, but they can't it's dangerous just start somebody out on like have relatively high doses suboxone because. They just don't know what you got in you and it gets dangerous makes."
13972.0,Patient,me to to per day so. that's a low those.
724.0,Provider,Well what's the milgram to what two milligrams a day.
13972.0,Patient,Eight milligrams in two strips a day.
724.0,Provider,So 60 milligrams total a day. yeah yeah I mean that's yeah that's not relatively a low dose that's that's a moderate dose so. yeah because.
13972.0,Patient,"You know the doctor. told me not to do what I was doing, he was taper myself and just doing. One strip a day. Taking a half and half instead of taking to. You know, and he told me not to do that and, as far as advice and it just it kind of I think it backfire because I was there, I mean I was getting pretty sick already and. Just like at that point, where I was like you know I mean I didn't have my and then I couldn't get it, so I was like I was already debating getting going getting high."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you're gonna you're gonna want to be careful with that, though, because again you're you're going to have leftover suboxone in your system and there's going to be narcan and so when you start using you're going to put yourself in a withdrawal state. That, nor can in that suboxone is a huge determinants of built into turn to avoid like illicit us so you just got to be careful man. I know it sucks and if you were taking it as he instructed and you're getting sick, but you weren't getting sick when you were kind of like managing it yourself. Right. yeah so maybe maybe try to do a little bit of both try to try to manage it yourself, maybe take a and it wait a while unless it was too strong was ate too much for you in the beginning."
13972.0,Patient,"I don't think so because I was, I think I mean I was a young, towards the end I was, I was doing a lot of heroin so. I think they it was good, I don't know it's all new to me man, but I just it kind of sucks because I, you know, I was good, trying to get Ahold of you guys and I just didn't know what to do now. Nobody had enhancers you know i'm like I can't get my medication and my insurance is technically from Washington, so I think that was the issue. They didn't want to cover it, but I I just got it somewhere and I didn't use so."
724.0,Provider,"Good all right so here's what I would recommend or encourage. You know your body better than anybody So if you take a and that holds you over for a period of time. hold off on the follow up those until you start meeting, like you, first until you start feeling like you need that follow up that second dose for the day. You know, be like don't don't be like our i'll take eight, when I wake up and then at two o'clock i'll take the other eight you probably don't need the other eight at two o'clock. But you might have the other eight at six o'clock so just see where you're at see where your body's at and then do it that way, so you get full coverage. I don't know what how how much of a spacing you were doing between doses. But if you can take one of the good for a while don't take that other one and two absolutely really start to feel like you need it because. You don't want to you don't have to push it too much right so. Your body will dial in and then you'll figure out, whatever your routine is and again communicate with a doctor be like I tried that I didn't feel too well, so I tried to space it out a little bit. A little bit more and that seemed to work or it didn't work either way like just try to gauge it, you know what I mean."
13972.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,That That would be my recommendation all right.
13972.0,Patient,"You all be honest with the I don't want to be I anything I if it sucks day I mean kind of needed and, yes."
724.0,Provider,"We do because you're you're having withdraw your body is chemically dependent on it right, so what happens is that over a period of time of using. Our body has opiate receptors naturally Okay, so you think of like a cup and our body so visualize like a like a wineglass almost. The natural step is that we have in our body is so that we know. When we're injured and when we're hurt so stubbing your toe socks it hurts in the pan, only last a little bit, and then it eventually goes away that's your receptors kicking in and being like Oh, this is what's going on and releases. chemicals and it's like okay cells down when you break something you're like. Something is clearly wrong here and the pain is excruciating Okay, so that that lets your body know that you need to seek help or get something fixed thinking like video games having like a. Pure play HALO call of duty it's like an over shield that's the receptor so once that goes down and you start taking damage and your body knows something's wrong what happens is when you start taking painkillers or contacts or heroin whatever it is. As that chemical comes in it fills that cup up right you don't feel any pain, but then, some of it spills over and it falls down here. This is where the euphoria it comes from, so now the body's like oh crap I feel amazing this stuff is awesome. I don't hurt anymore my legs broke, but I feel like I could walk on it so i'm going to walk on it. But the brain knows that you're still injured, so what happens another Cup is made right that's why the next time it takes more to get high. Right, so that that fills up you're still injured and the brains like Okay, what are we doing so another cup gets made. And then you take more because you need more to get high and you keep doing it so, then you got cups cups cups of coffee, so you have too many pain receptors now developing your body. So then, what happens is you hit a ceiling effect you can't get any higher you've maxed out your receptors is no more getting high when you use it just strictly using to maintain. Because when you don't use those receptors like Oh, we don't have to be here anymore we're going to die, and we die off and when they die off you get dope sick. But everything hurts you got too many receptors right so as those cups go down you start feeling like shit so what What do people do they use again. And then they hit that ceiling and there's no more high just maintenance with suboxone does is the same thing it's called again partial. agonist it will fill up that Cup, but nothing will spill over there's no euphoria you don't get high, but you don't get sick, but it tricks are receptors and the thinking that you're okay. And then, when you taper off a little by little, those cups will break down, but they break down in sections not completely so now you're not dope sick when you're coming. In boxing if you completely stops officer boxing the same thing it's it's going to crash down and you're going to feel like crap. The trick with suboxone is slowly tapering yourself off and managing the medication to how you feel right so over a period of time three months, six months, nine months, whatever it is. You can break those glasses down it'd be like I kind of feel a little crappy but I like i'm like 95% I can go to work and I have to worry about sneezing or shedding my pants okay. But you'll taper down a little little little little and eventually you get back down to your baseline where your body is supposed to be right. Neither know when you're hurt so that's the medication does it fills up that cup it tricks your body into thinking that you have your receptors being full but there's no euphoria you're not sick and then just start managing it down okay. that's what it's supposed to do make sense. yeah alright, so I know that you're eager because you don't want to be doing anything or potentially having to rely on anything but the truth is, is that you're chemically dependent. Which means it's not up to you, it doesn't matter what your willpower is or what your thought is about. The subject it's not up to you know your body needs that that chemical to be able, just the function daily, just like an alcoholic. You know people don't wake up overnight become alcoholics when they stopped at their bodies like we're used to having this and functioning, now that we don't have it, the body starts to break down, you know, which is why they continue to drink because they don't want to feel sick so. You need to work your way down from a biological standpoint it's not psychological yet that's later, you know what I mean. Seeing behind the curtain as a narcotic user and knowing that there's something out there, that makes you feel. Nothing and everything all at the same time that's the mental trick that you'll have to deal with, for the rest of your life. You know anytime you get really hurt you're like oh there's something out there, that I could take and I won't feel shit but but I can't because that's not for me anymore right that's the mental part right now we're going to deal with the physical part makes sense. So don't don't rush the process, you know what I mean and don't it's definitely better than heroin what you are substituting one for the other one is way safer. way safer Okay, and eventually you won't need that anymore either, but for the time being, you need to get medically managed and then come down alright. So today we're going to do an assessment. And we have about 30 minutes so i'm going to try to move through it quickly to get some information out of you. it's going to be on your biological history we're going to find out if you got any medical conditions that you have currently or in the past. And then, anything that your family might have it's hereditary potentially passed down to you will go over psychological history, so any kind of mental health concerns. history of self harm anything like that that you've been diagnosed with or hospitalized for or things that run in your family would ask about that. will do demographics, which is like your name your date of birth, some basic information and make sure that everything lines up here. we'll go over your drug history so like when you first started using how much you use the last time you used if you ever overdose we're gonna ask a lot of questions so i'm. trying out not to get hung up on the responses too much like a lot of times i'm just looking for I did about this age. yeah by have this, this is what I take up we don't need to unpack any real luggage right now we'll do that later today is strictly the assessment, so we can develop like a treatment plan to to get you like the best level of service okay. All right, so if you're ready to go. state for the record state your name and date of birth."

If you truly do have a chemical imbalance, or you have an attention deficit disorder taking Ritalin right will balance you out so people that don't truly have that they take Ritalin they're you know they're off to the races right so. that's probably why you don't have like a negative reaction to it we're kind of just it like you said balances it out, it allows you to sleep, so this probably probably related to your chemistry okay. um.

724.0,Provider,"I don't know if in California, are you on state insurance or now you're you said Washington right. yeah like Washington state. yeah okay i'm on the east coast, so you have to like bear with me i'm not too familiar with all the California regulations. I know that we're up from if you're on state insurance CVs and walgreens and all those pharmacy stores, they gave you an arcane if you asked for it. So it just it might be similar on the west coast Sue so that might be something to look into all right. um. what's your longest period of sobriety."
13972.0,Patient,Say 20 months.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long ago was that achieved."
13972.0,Patient,That was in. 2017 to 2019.
724.0,Provider,And how did you how'd you obtain that.
13972.0,Patient,was because I was in prison.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. The next section is going to be about medical concerns do you have any physical medical concerns currently."
13972.0,Patient,"yeah. I think well my arms seems like my. Worries to shoot up in my arms right here, like my forearms on top, I think. i'm not getting blood on my hands, and I think I screwed myself up because I feel like my bloods not circulating and sometimes I wake up they're numb. yeah so I because my hands i'm having this problem with the wake up well it's usually before right so before I get into a deep sleep I wake up freaking out because my hands in my my arms are like numb, so I think it's because I, my circulation so."
724.0,Provider,It could be that you could have nerve impingement send your neck you ever have any neck injuries or back injuries never.
13972.0,Patient,"Had a back injury, when I was in middle school."
724.0,Provider,"Sometimes, like nervous nerve injuries and, like the non numbness and tingling air connected to your spine they're connected to like. You know the the neural network that's in your back and in the back your neck, you know what I mean like sometimes like the disc will bolger sit on the nerve shut up down cause numbness and all that kind of stuff. So it could be that it's probably related to you know shooting up and having collapse veins do you have a primary care physician. you're going to want to get one, are you trying to transfer it to California state insurance."
13972.0,Patient,ID so eventually yeah I it's kind of up in the air and now.
724.0,Provider,i'll call back to Washington state.
13972.0,Patient,yeah I kind of have to. Go take care of my. My probation stuff girl.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. And you don't have primary care there right so. No primary care at all okay. You may want to if you're up in the air and whether or not you're going to stay in California, or if you're going to go back to Washington state. I would at least start utilizing the insurance that you have currently can maybe lighting up a PCP so you can get in BC even if it's. Not in person, and they do it over telehealth at least you can show them and explain what's going on and they might have like something they can do for you, you don't want to delay that for too much longer all right.

Like a like a dishonor badge you know what I mean like depending on whatever your life events were going on that. That you ended up with a diagnosis, it was probably wanted, but it doesn't mean that it has to be forever Okay, so we just want to know what's going on, like based on your history there's no judgment Okay, especially like in this field there's absolutely no judgment. So there's no shame. How long ago were you diagnosed with this stuff."

724.0,Provider,"And you have 90 texts that 90 day it's a crisis hotline right. Obviously, if you ever have thoughts about self harm, you know what I mean always call 911 first one. You could text 998 and talk to a crisis counselor and then I want you to write this telephone number down. You, let me know when you're ready. it's gonna be one 802 738 to five five. And then you can always reach out to this agency, you can try to reach out to me there's always there's. i'm not gonna say round the clock clinicians but there's always people here for the most part, you know if you're in crisis don't hesitate to reach out before acting on anything silly, especially if you're coming from a place where. Drug induced or you're feeling like it's. you're feeling hopeless anything like that, in time, you feel like that reach out first, because a lot of times like they're intrusive and impulsive thoughts and we can kind of work through a lot of that stuff all right. um do you have any like any other like family members or friends that you could reach out to anybody that's like any homeboys anybody that's like dependable for you."
13972.0,Patient,Really.

13972.0,Patient,"At the moment, okay. know why people think like dying, the best thing, and I think it's a good thing, not necessarily a bad thing."
724.0,Provider,"But life is a good thing too, though there's two sides to that coin man so. yeah any any history of trauma physical abuse emotional abuse. yeah I mean you're you're incarcerated i'm sure there's a lot of a lot of trauma there that we could probably talk about."
13972.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,I will tell you.
13972.0,Patient,"So when you're young missing a big boys prison, and I know that the team captain."
724.0,Provider,"I am, I wanted to say that I specialize in trauma, but I i've worked in those settings and uh i'm a military that i've been overseas i've did two tours in Iraq. So when like when people want to talk about you know trauma and stuff like that and grief and seeing things that most people don't see or most people don't have to deal with. I find that I can be somebody that people can talk to and relate. So if you ever feel like during our sessions that you want to talk a little bit about it, or just listen or whatever it is like. i'll be more than happy to talk you through some of that stuff and just give you some perspective and some insights all right. i'm currently what's your living situation like. pretty good, are you renting or like. out surfing renting. Do you live with anybody. yeah Okay, do you live with."

724.0,Provider,Okay.
13972.0,Patient,All right.
724.0,Provider,And this is your second go around so you kind of know what to expect a little bit right.
13972.0,Patient,"not really no no. I was just I was in prison, most of his life grown up so it's like I really don't know you just turn 15 so. yeah I don't see a must, I really wasn't in his life at all so. yeah technically it's going to be like first first time or the. Whole faggots be this kid's life that's the goal. yeah."
724.0,Provider,"I mean your watch Star Wars or anything like that so so like what like what did yoda says like there is no, there is no tries to do or do not. know I mean you're already doing it you're doing the right thing and i'm you're trying to make a difference, trying to better yourself, so you can be a better person, so you can be. A better dad that's one of the most Honorable things that a that a man can do you know stepping out and do what what's required. that's important and even though you might have a strained relationship with your son doesn't mean that it always has to be like that you know you can prepare some of that stuff to even just a little bit will go a long way. Those are the things that's worth living for so earlier when you said checking out is easy it's not a bad thing, it is a bad thing when you have people that will love you and you have responsibility you're bringing life into the world it'd be counterproductive to go the other way. So those are all good Those are all good factors I know it sucks right now, you know I mean, I know that you for sure I don't even have to. Give me about the Tongue, but I know you've been through some shit Okay, but just because you've been through some shit doesn't mean that it always has to be like that. We can probably agree that the hard stuff is behind you now, at this. Point things should get start getting easier for you."
13972.0,Patient,I hope so.
724.0,Provider,Hope is a good thing to have hope will motivate the hell out of somebody.
13972.0,Patient,yeah no.
724.0,Provider,"So I don't want you to feel like you're you're helpless helpless people don't ask for help. I mean you're doing all the right shit. it's okay to be vulnerable and it's okay to the beat yourself up sometimes when you're doing the right stuff. You got a birthday coming up, so you get a nice little fresh start for the year you're literally what. Should your your about a week out from turning what 41 4040. yeah 40 is the new 20 baby like. you're not I mean so you'll look 40 you're good i'm 3939 yeah so. there's still a lot of a lot that you can do and provide give. And don't forget that."

724.0,Provider,"it's some of that you know what I mean like you can't you can't take all the you can't take all the hits man like. yeah, but you have a skill set and a blue collar skill set so you're going to be able to find employment that's always going to be around we're always going to need painters are always going to be plumbers always going to need cooks. So, like the job market is. prosperous. lucky with trade school so don't don't sweat that detail too much all right, not right now I know it sucks but. we're gonna we're gonna get you squared away. You know how does, how does one o'clock your time."

13972.0,Patient,All right.
724.0,Provider,yep so 1pm.
13972.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"All right, so you, you made a major first step in the right direction, this is, you know this is like Level one outpatient it's not iot. You know, so people that come here they do it on their own free will, most of the time and that's a huge step for somebody who's struggling with addiction, so a lot of people will just. Stay stuck you know I mean, so it takes a lot of balls to to walk into and sign up for a program like this, because all the programs are impatient they're often court mandated or forced into. same thing with the iot a lot of times, people are forced into that. So I always gave guys and girls whatever walk of life, you are when they come into the programs like this, I applaud them because it takes a lot of cards to do it. So you're already you're already moving in the right direction, and you know 30 days from now you'll be squared away with the medication for sure that's typically how it works and then. off to the races on everything else alright. So. i'll see you at a week just about go to your groups, if you don't feel like sharing don't share listen take something away from it. The doctors are there, the prescribers we're going to be in that group so if you have medication issues or concerns. talk to them about that there try to schedule an appointment for a one on one with the provider, if you need it don't don't hold back don't be shy don't do anything like that you're in you're in the program now and you if you need stuff ask for it. All right, you'd be good man."
13972.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"i'll See you in a week. For transcription That was the bios like social for Fernando quavis you see it for opiate addiction, as his primary he is polly sub dq age and so he's been using methamphetamines IV used in the past 30 days same thing with about the opiates. medical history currently he's got a history of blackouts history of overdose times three.

His mental health is not particularly good is as no medication and he self reports to be diagnosed with depression, anxiety ptsd idiots the and potential schizophrenia due to hallucinations auditory and visual. He has been hospitalized in the past for it and multiple suicide attempts in a lifetime 12% self reported and then of most reason a tab within 30 days which required some hospitalization he tried to overdose on a bunch of federal. currently has a limited support network so his safety plan is made up of suicide hotline the telephone number, the text number he's got our contact number here. Some protective factors that he has in place currently his girlfriend who's been with for about a year he lives with he's going to a child, on the way because she's four months pregnant. He didn't self enroll into the program so that's a that's a positive. But he is moderate risk for substance or sorry for suicidal ideation based on that history, so we will continue to monitor he has significant risk factors so we'll continue to monitor him on a weekly basis i'd like to see him. weekly until he stabilizes on his medication and then potentially gets wrapped up with some psych meds as well and that'll, be it on that for now we have a follow up appointment sorry next Wednesday at 1pm Thank you."
