14327.0,Patient,"A internal terms of so in terms of mentally i've done a lot better just a little bit of advice and thinking about kind of those factors that are like causing the I guess distress mentally. Just kind of helping to find root causes and start to delve a little deeper and care little more. yeah, however, on the other end physically. I have a shoulder that. was in. Basically I was too big and maybe my mother didn't want to get a C section, and so I got stuck in the birth canal shoulder got messed up and or I already told you."
740.0,Provider,Right i'm only telling me that I just showed me and doing.
14327.0,Patient,"So as of like. Last week. It has begun to Poland my both my spine. The left side of my shoulder it's I don't. I don't know that I can physically, you know move around too much anymore."
740.0,Provider,Are you gonna go see a physician or anything.
14327.0,Patient,"I have a primary setup for the 13th it was supposed to happen, last week, but I couldn't find the place and."
740.0,Provider,i'm sorry.
14327.0,Patient,you're flying by I love kids.
740.0,Provider,"He decided he wants to wake up out of the sun. So today what I wanted to do. I wanted to do a safety plan with you today I didn't do it, the last time, so I have to make sure I do it with you today. I want to do a safety plan with you today. And then. let's just take a meeting and then uh just to kind of talk about you know what are your plans are in regards to how you're going to maintain your mental health. I know that your physical health has a lot to do with your mental health so just in regards to you know what are your plans in regards to. in regards to your physical health, how are you going to you know what what are your basically. Basically, you know, the thing that you're The thing that you are going to be planning to do. Just to make sure that your mental health is up to par I know that they showed it has a lot to do you i'm saying with with. Mental health can you do me one favor can you say you. Know pounds oh sorry. Okay. I appreciate you so much i'm so sorry."
14327.0,Patient,you're good.
740.0,Provider,"yeah Polo. ready to eat. Alright, so we're back so again, I said we're going to do safety plan so we're going to go first and then just kind of figure out a plan of how you're going to manage your physical health moving forward. Okay, so i'm going to share my screen, and this is something that we are going to do together. um So the first step is messily identifying your warning signs so basically any kind of warning sign that can then when you mostly what you're looking for, excuse me, are things behaviors thoughts images mood situations. That you that you know that it's going to lead you in the direction of wanting to commit kind of self harm or any suicide attempt or anything like that. So basically says one in science thoughts images moves situation behavior that a crisis, maybe development so what's your first one inside."
14327.0,Patient,"i'm. Sure, I guess, it would be. It would be kind of a I begin to disconnect from reality. that's generally how manik manik states will start is it's like. I don't recognize reality for what it is anymore I kind of get lost in my head and so that's kind of a sign, but at the same time it's it's very it that's one that's it's very hard for me to identify until it's way after and I will typically like. I won't think about it and i'll just lose out of my brain like i'll never remember that moment until its product."
740.0,Provider,Okay. what's the second one.
14327.0,Patient,"i'm. See. Just from there, it would be. I guess, this is the noticeable one, it would be when I start to disconnect from other people, because one thing I do very often is kind of. passively learn people because i've no I noticed a lot of behaviors and things just kind of identifying who they are, and. Ultimately, trying to do or be and if I stopped doing that and can't tell what someone's like it literally it's like a five minute process I just never know and if I can't do that all of a sudden it's very bad luck that's a very exciting."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you have a third what happens after they."
14327.0,Patient,"Have extreme. I guess extreme cases of. A total lack of energy. I guess I. accumulates with withdrawal, but i'm not with I withdrawal for a lot of different reasons, that is, like the third and final reason that's like if I like lose all energy and stop doing things that's just. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so we've identified the three warning signs now. we're going to identify coping strategies so internal code my strategies things that things I can do to take my mind off my problems without contacting. Another person relaxation technique relaxation take me through the activity grounding listen to music, whatever they are so. For the first one inside we have disconnected from P for reality now recognize a reality for what it is anymore. We have disconnect from other people, we have extreme case of a total lack of energy, so now we're going to come up with three coping strategy is basically they can help you take your mind off your problems with that contact somebody else, what do you think you can do."
14327.0,Patient,"A. So i'm going to be honest, I really need help with this, because one of the biggest reasons that the first thing happens the disconnect from reality is because of my shoulder. And that's kind of at least I like I try i've tried like you said music i've tried getting my mind off it's literally just. Like the pain doesn't really subside."
740.0,Provider,So basically the first could should be. What treatment for your shoulder.
14327.0,Patient,"Actually yeah that makes sense. I can, I can choose."
740.0,Provider,"So. In the meantime, before you get treatment for your shoulder. What can you is there anything no took the bait. Are there ways that you're able to cope with the pain like until you see a provider, because I know usually you miss your last session, so we have to we have you you're gonna have to make another way So how do you usually cope with the pain of your show what do you do."
14327.0,Patient,"So that's kind of where the first issue comes into play. And kind of disassociate. from reality, I kind of withdrawal into my head a little bit just to kind of ease off of it, so to speak, i'm kind of in a almost dreamlike state for a bit. Just like that's that's, the only thing that seemed to help. But when I get when the payment becomes too much that's when the first warning sign happens of I cannot recognize reality from my disassociation, so to speak."
740.0,Provider,So let's come up let's see what we can do.
14327.0,Patient,"Oh i'm sorry if that's too loud, by the way."
740.0,Provider,"I don't hear anything. So. Okay, let me see. China see if I can come over with. Some coping skills, we can, maybe go over."
14327.0,Patient,ya know take all your time I recognizes a really big issue that's why I appreciate your help period like it just.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so. This is what i'm saying it says tips on coping with chronic pain first it says to manage your stress it says, emotional and physical pain are closely related. and persistent pain can lead to increased levels of stress learning how to deal with your stress in healthy ways can position you to cope. more effectively more effectively with your chronic pain, such as eating whale getting plenty of sleep and engaging and approved physical activities are all positive ways for you to handle your stress and your pain. Another one says talk to yourself constructively positive thinking is a powerful tool by focusing on the improvements, you are making the pain is less today than yesterday. Or you feel better than you did a week ago, you can make a difference in your perceived comfort level, for example, instead of considering yourself powerless. And thinking that you absolutely cannot deal with the pain remind yourself that you are, that you are uncomfortable but that you are working towards finding a healthy way to deal with it and living a productive and fulfilling life. Another one says become active and engaged distracting yourself from your pain by engaging in activities, you will you will excuse me activities, you will enjoy. will help you highlight the positive aspects of your life isolating yourself from others fosters a negative attitude and may increase your perception of your pain. Considering consider finding a hobby or pastime that makes you feel good it helps you connect with the family member or friend or other people via your local community groups or the Internet. The next one, it says find support going through the daily struggle of your pain can be extremely trying, especially if you're doing it doing it alone. reach out to other people who are in your same position. And who can share and understand your highs and your lows search the Internet or your local community for support groups which can reduce your burden by helping you understand that you're not alone. And then, lastly, consult a professional if you continue to feel overwhelmed by chronic pain at a level that keeps you from performing your daily. routine, you may want to talk with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist who can help you handle the physical and psychological repercussions of your condition. So. What do you think about those those those tips. or they liked it."
14327.0,Patient,"I like um so I personally am kind of a really big introvert. So, as far as the withdrawal ones that's just kind of something I do as a person that helps me because I just lose all energy, but I do like the. The hobby and I, like the stress management, I think those are two are very realistic that I can absolutely like I control my diet right, so I can absolutely start to. Get myself back alignment that way."
740.0,Provider,"Alright, so we're happy we're happy, what interests you the most."
14327.0,Patient,"It would have to be something that only that I, so this is kind of an irony, but I absolutely hated the way I wrote up until this point, despite what anyone else tells me. And so that's ironically, one of the few hobbies that I can do is writing was poetry books, whatever. That can help sort of suppress that that issue."
740.0,Provider,"that's a really good happy so writing. that's a good and so like. All like what you said in regards to like poetry, or even with journaling and things like that Okay, so the other thing I like what this one say in regards to when it says talk to yourself. I, like the other thing, where it says talk to yourself constructively, what do you think about that. When it says stuff like it says, for example, instead of considering yourself powerless and thinking that you absolutely cannot deal with the pain. Remind yourself that you are uncomfortable but that you are working towards finding a healthy way to deal with it and living a productive fulfilling life, what do you think about this."
14327.0,Patient,i'm really so that one was one. whenever I hear like advice I categorize it kind of as something that wouldn't really work for me or something that I think. Is outside of my ability right now I I view myself as a realist I might be a pessimist but I really can't like speak well of myself I don't feel comfortable doing.
740.0,Provider,"Oh wow so what's another charity, we got writing. Whatever you think you can do."
14327.0,Patient,The Internet support groups sound like a good idea.
740.0,Provider,just talking to people yeah.
14327.0,Patient,"At the very least that gives me more options, you know. So I really like that one."
740.0,Provider,"One more. Do you have another hobby that you like Oh, you know what What about something that's relaxing what is something, what are the things that you do to relax."
14327.0,Patient,I love listening to music. really like stretching.

14327.0,Patient,"Oh. I guess i'll have to get a very we used to have this massager basically I could you know press on it. I could use for like five minutes at a time, but. It helps so much, I have to get."

14327.0,Patient,"I think the most The thing that is most worth living for is. I guess that's really a hard one for me. it's always been people like others in my life, but I realized that's not a foundation that I can work with. And not going to help me. I will say. have been able to have a relationship with you know who I believe God is, I think that that's a very wonderful thing to me it's probably something that you know I can just wake up and kind of talk to him and gets me through it. But even in terms of like because people always like Oh, you know technically you're Christian, so it should be, you know the Church, or whatever it's like. No that's not right."
740.0,Provider,Right just fit. Perfect see. What we're going to market for today day. I think. yeah you save it. nothing's clicking. On my work as a.
14327.0,Patient,save this one.

I know right Okay, I appreciate you so much, and again I do apologize for the distractions today, Lord have mercy. Okay. What did I miss. It. Can you hear me. OK cool good. All right, so let's talk about your plan to kind of treat this physical health. What are the plan."
14327.0,Patient,"So diet and die was something I immediately thought of. And that's something I want to change, but at the moment I just need to get a little bit of finances going, and then I can. change that so that's kind of a backburner thing but, like my number one priority because i've been wanting to do it for ages. sleep I didn't even think about it, but yeah you're right that's huge, especially in the way I can deal with the pain. And I think that. The only reason it's tough, for me, is because i'm a night owl like wholeheartedly."
740.0,Provider,Like yeah.
14327.0,Patient,I could be exhausted and 11 o'clock it's boom I got energy like I could be up with the rest of the night.
740.0,Provider,Oh wow.
14327.0,Patient,It just like it's just a complete switch like and and i'm like articulate to it's not just oh i'm awake it's I I can actually function during the day I get really tired really fast and like just lose a lot of mental function.
740.0,Provider,"So. Are you going to make another appointment with your physician, or what is not what you're going to what are you going to have about that."
14327.0,Patient,"Oh, I already have it's on the 13th. it's my primary."
740.0,Provider,"And if the primary like does that person, they also know about the show to injury, they are men know your history your background so."
14327.0,Patient,This is the first time i'm getting my own physician.
740.0,Provider,So this first appointment.
14327.0,Patient,Like i'm excited so excited.
740.0,Provider,"To see. I was trying to see if I could find some more thing in with coping skill, because. I realized it's so important. To have."
14327.0,Patient,Absolutely.
740.0,Provider,"I think. I think what i'm what i've been at this that's something that i'm going to put for my homework if the five. More cognitive skills, something that there's something that we can and there's nothing much you can. Do it well, if you find any new ways to cope any new habits, to develop I know a lot of times we can basically kind of gifts up and doing things how we do things and being accustomed to a certain routine doing the same thing over and over again. However, I want to, I want to see if you're open to trying or developing new head."
14327.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. So that's something that I will they will they will continue to discuss, as well as. Being able to identify new things and resources in your area they can help you. That can support you basis not help you, but they can support you, there can be. A better be a lifeline for you, basically, they can really help you out I think Community support is very, very, very, very good because and even with the article, the paragraph that I read you know, to identify that i'm not the only one going through these. And to be around people who are dealing with the same challenges. And the fact that you know they've been able to live with it, just as long as you have and that's something that you have to give you so critical okay look is there hey. And that's why that's why I had mentioned the last paragraph is because I understand the reason i'm comfortable for you, but at the same time you're living with it. Right you're but it didn't it hasn't stopped you from developing as a person, you like to say, being able to join the military and things of that nature you're saying that it didn't stop you, you know i'm saying so, you know a lot of times, you have to be able to. And that's why I say I know you know, being a pessimist can be so good, and can be so difficult to break. You know, but at the same time, sometimes we have to really identify things to be grateful for. Right and so there's something about that I would challenge you to do. Things you like to write. A part of your writing I would encourage you, every day, so at least be able to live three things that you're grateful for every day. For."
14327.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that yeah i'll can turn."
740.0,Provider,"On, and so the next time we meet will go over those things. You don't have this we don't have to share what they are, unless you wanted. But we'll just kind of go out we're just kind of go over like how did you know, we were able to be consistent, had it makes you feel good to put you in a more positive mood. stuff like that. Because a lot of times you know we have to be able to get out of out of the Funk. And it's tough. it's tough I can't imagine the stress we're dealing with the injury, how we can be because you know, this is something I have to live with. And so you know, since you do have to live with it on a day to day basis, I understand that sometimes that the pain can overwhelm overwhelm you so much, you know it's hard to be positive in a painful situation. However, we're going to work towards being positive and feel until you're able to get the help that you need because I realized and just like with the with the article is say they are part of the physical is the mental. Right and so to be healthy mentally maybe even allow you to be able to cope better and manage better with the pain that you feel until you're able to get it completely treated. So that's what i'm gonna work on you, you have you have a vision for the physical side but we're going to work on the mental side and to be healthy mentally stuff because, like I said I can't imagine the pain that you go through, however, at the same time and know that. you've been able to live with all this time and. It has not you haven't missed a beat and it has not stopped you from living your life and for that. That I mean that's amazing you should be proud of yourself i'm proud of you fit it I think that's amazing and so so that's something they will continue to work on, do you have anything else that you want to share anything else you would like to talk about."
14327.0,Patient,Trying to think here.
740.0,Provider,"It was not on this topic, it can be whatever."
14327.0,Patient,"hey I was trying to I know, there was a couple things I wanted to bring up at some points of the week, oh i'm so i've kind of. i've identified why become addicted to certain things. And, like the root cause of my addiction typically stems from. Like a. it's the bad form, I guess, you could say when I want to withdraw of when I like when I do not want to deal with something it's just sitting on my mind. I become instantly like addicted to whatever is currently giving me, you know a good feeling so like it was it was a sugar for a long time. And that drinking. Just a lot of those things do you have. Any like tips for how to kind of. break out around or, so to speak, when when that there is just an issue sitting in my mind, because, like I I try the you know the stress and music and just distraction and it's. One thing that I don't know why i'm really good at it's identifying problems and it. makes me want to fix them, but I can always. And so, when I when I want to fix the problem but I can't that's when I start to like find a cope with. addiction just whatever is whatever is around."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, one thing I would suggest, and the first thing that came to my mind was you have to talk it out with somebody safe. Because saying your own havens dangerous. Right, especially if you already have force if you already have for coping skills and that's not a strength of your. The best thing to do with the pocket talk it through with talk it out with somebody. Because you want to get it at. You ended with talking it through with somebody you're a with the Harry you ever say here, for your sale. But then you're also able to be able to give the advice from someone else you i'm saying and then talking, I will people either make you feel better you know because it's like a release right if they use a bit better. There are saying with is getting it off your chest right, and so it makes you feel better and so that's what I was saying, I bet with. i've been around addiction for a little while um and we used to encourage people who who who were addicted. To substances mainly. To obtain a sponsor and to go to meeting. Because been having this report is significant i'm telling his life changing the way of the House report, you know i'm saying and there's one of the thing is one of the things that you. That you will literally gain so much exposure. you're learn so much from other people, especially because. It says, because of the fact that you're able to vote you're able to basically be able to communicate in a just free environment because everybody is going through the same thing. No one's going to look at you crazy because they're going through it to you know i'm saying, and so I think communicating about it again with a safe person or MSA group, and you know say in a safe environment is really, really important to Harvard that in your mind. And I that's why you that's why you drinking. You know that's why you became you know and and and because it doesn't help the harbor in your mind right, because if we know that we're going through challenges we can't save our sale. Right. You can save you, you can save you from you. know I mean you just can't and so that's why it's really, really important to have people around us and iron sharpens iron. And so it's so significant. To be with the half people are shopping you, you know i'm saying and to cultivate you, you know, and for us to be able to freely, be able to express yourself and what you're going through. And so that's the other homework assignment. You gotta find you a support group."
14327.0,Patient,i'm a support group.
740.0,Provider,gratified forgot to be virtual all over face to face you gotta find you a support group.
14327.0,Patient,Okay i'll put that down in a journal i'll find one.
740.0,Provider,"yeah so that is just be my suggestion for their for their battle you got to talk to somebody you got to speak it out, you got to talk to somebody about the challenges so whatever the things that go through your mind and and, of course, we know that it has to be somebody's face. Because I never want you to I never want somebody to trigger you, to the point to where you feel like well there was a waste of time. They made me feel worse than what I started with, and then you know because, believe it or not, people have a pivot to China, maybe go, you know people have a tendency of push you over the edge. And so that's why we have to be able to identify who am I safe people and that's why we did this, he playing to identify face people in safe places in space environment people I can contact. You know, and so i'm happy that you have there, I want you to be able to utilize it will your brother and sister gives you that option you I got 1000 don't take that option talk to them. don't marry that don't put this down and or a minute i'm not saying nursing, no, no, no, no, no, take the sign out the door. Open up the door and say hey can I talk to you have to go get some stuff off my chair, you know just nice it just needs to throw some match. Right and there's your letters in between sessions, because, like I said I wish, we can talk every day, but we came, and so the important thing is to have those people land.
