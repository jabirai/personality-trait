13714.0,Patient,Hello.
462.0,Provider,"Diana, how are you."
13714.0,Patient,"Okay, how are you."
462.0,Provider,doing good Thank you. How has everything been since last week.
13714.0,Patient,For the status quo. Multi month.
462.0,Provider,same yeah.
13714.0,Patient,I don't have a ton of privacy right now.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, I was gonna ask that."
13714.0,Patient,"Is in the other room with this headphones and but it's like. Anyway, um. But I I appreciated being able to get all that off my chest last week that was helpful."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. It didn't know that's important that was a lot to hold on to for so long, all to yourself."
13714.0,Patient,"i'm just curious if you had any thoughts, since you had some time to mull it over."
462.0,Provider,yeah um you know my biggest thoughts were just how can we create safety for you. You know both emotionally physically in the circumstances that you're in and the setting that you're in and within with what's within your control if that makes sense. So what do you think about that.
13714.0,Patient,"i've been. Trying. i'm. Just like. Primarily, a lot of avoidance."
462.0,Provider,What does that look like.
13714.0,Patient,"A lot of like. it's not always intentional, but my my sleep schedules, I mean it's kind of always been all over the place and i'm kind of used to that. and You know I find that like. I need a lot of alone time anyway, even when i'm not in this kind of a situation. In this, just like makes it a lot. more necessary, so I end up staying up late after the sleep and. And then. have noticed, and I, and I don't like this isn't intentional but. Some sometimes. i'll go through a phase where, if I have a meal or i'll have a crash afterwards, that is just impossible to resist and I just pass out for an hour to something like that. And I don't know why that's happening exactly i've asked my doctor about it and. i've got an answer actually have an appointment, I did make an appointment with my doctor to see about upping my antidepressant and I that's in place. And i'm going to ask him again, I guess, about the passing out thing but um. But. You know. Being asleep feels like a relief, a lot of times. and I can't remember the last time I had like a solid like eight hours or whatever like i'm i'm lucky if I get six most of the time and then lately like it's just been so all over the place, I got I got two hours last night, maybe. So i'll probably end up passing out again next time I eat. yeah I don't know what's happening there it's just it's it's weird how. Like because my sleep schedule is always like for years and years and years and years and years, been just kind of flexible and all over the place and i'm used to it, like, I have a lot of experience with like resisting you know that call. and You know. kind of compensating I guess with caffeine, and just kind of sucking it up a lot and, if I have to. But this is different, like this post meal thing. is different it's like. I don't have a choice you know i'm just."
462.0,Provider,"On so maybe it's a blood sugar thing or it could be a mix of that and just something emotional because, like you said you're not getting much sleep sleep is kind of an escape from. Reality for you, so it could be a combination of those two things as well."
13714.0,Patient,"I guess yeah I i'd be curious what would be happening, if I weren't dealing with that on top of it. So anyway um. Other than that, my. If I had. To meet if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic that would help because it would be like Oh, I can go out and do something."
462.0,Provider,"You know that was another one of my thoughts is just building social support of some sort I know and the pandemic it's really hard, but even online communities can feel like something. You mentioned a supportive boss, I believe, is is this boss aware of anything."
13714.0,Patient,"um she was really there for me when I was going through all that stuff with my sister. She was just. She was incredibly supportive. And I honestly I feel like indebted to her. And I really, really don't want to burden her with anything else right and honestly, I think it would also feel awkward for her in this scenario, because she also knows okay. Sure yeah. And it's also just a very like tough thing to try to explain to anybody really."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it is, it is really tough, especially someone that you're working with, even though it sounds like they're very supportive."
13714.0,Patient,yeah I just. I would be really uncomfortable conversation. um.
462.0,Provider,Is there anyone else that you feel like you could possibly be comfortable having that conversation with.
13714.0,Patient,My therapist.
462.0,Provider,that's great yes that's a good.
13714.0,Patient,I it's. it's always been easier for me to share certain types of things with people that I don't actually know and don't actually know me that well I don't. I know not everybody's wired that way but it's it's easier for me.
462.0,Provider,"ya know it can be easier to just have that sort of non judgmental neutral party here it. Just as far as you building a little bit of support, because, as you said, all of those months without therapy being on your own it really built up."
13714.0,Patient,"yeah. once in a while I think about like I don't know. trying to find a way to talk about it anonymously online or something but. I don't know it just it feels like it would take so much explaining like who's going to want to read pages of. I don't feel like. The nuance would get lost, and a lot of people would. Probably just to now, or like start. I don't know probably start offering suggestions that I either have even thought of or can't do, for whatever reason, or like which is you know understandable it's human nature for people to be like well what, if you do this, you know, but like i've been in this situation. for long enough it's like I can't imagine anybody being able to offer anything helpful i've even just like listening, you know men right."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so what to you is the nuance of the situation, so you said you feel like typing it out the nuance would get lost for you what what is what are some of the nuances."
13714.0,Patient,"Just all of the different factors that make it. Like really. Tough to get out of. I feel like i'd have to explain. Just all the sides of the box that i'm stuck in and. Some of that's hard to go into without like risking the anonymity that I would require to talk about you know. Just it seemed like. kind of a daunting prospect to try to. explain all of that and not get like hyper worry about it, which is a tendency that I have. So I just I ended up getting just too daunted by the whole prospect and I just don't do it. it's just it's easier to just have this kind of a conversation. And like. I had group last night and. Like they're. You know, a generally supportive crowd but I don't really know any of them. Is. I end up just saying you know that my whole life is tough and leaving it. Like I can really go into it yeah."
462.0,Provider,"So you feel like this in general is something that you just can't talk to with anyone, whether it be online people in your life. groups or. Beyond mostly just me."
13714.0,Patient,"Like the people that. The people that know me personally, and you know care about me I don't want to burden them with it. You know, with with something that like. There isn't a great solution for right now, you know I don't want to. Okay, definitely can't tell my daughter as wonderful and supportive of a human being, who she is that is absolutely not something that she should be like."
462.0,Provider,How old is your daughter.
13714.0,Patient,"she's 25 but. I. Just I cannot. I cannot share this with her, and I should not, I firmly believe I should not written her with this stuff it's just it's too much and it's not like appropriate. And then there's my other sister the one that's not. severely mentally ill. But she and I have never been like super close and she moved across the country and. Definitely don't think that she would really understand. hey you know. we're just really different people she and I. and Most of the stuff that we. connect on has to do with like you know family stuff that we're both familiar with you know. Like our childhoods were not great, so we really understand each other on that score. But. We grew up to be very different people and have very different interests and very different like. understandings of the world and navigating relationships and stuff and. I just don't see her really. Being able to wrap her head around this situation. and she's across the country anyway so. don't really feel like I can tell her either so. anyway."
462.0,Provider,"So not feeling like you can really talk to anyone about it, what about just starting to get involved in things out of the home not. With the purpose of talking to anybody or even relating about this issue with anybody, but just to start to kind of build up your own stuff your own activities and get out a little bit I do know it's tough with Kobe but is there anything that you have in mind."
13714.0,Patient,"there's this some. This. there's this gig. This. gig based thing that somebody I know has been trying to get me into. That would require like just very brief contact with people it's. long story short it's kind of kind of adultery situation. It would require borrowing his car until I can afford my own. But. For some reason, like the paperwork and behind the scenes stuff with that has been like moving like molasses, and I checked in it again yesterday, and she said okay well, let me find out what's going on what the holdup is so. we'll see when that gets rolling but, when it does have a lot more like out of the House time for sure right."
462.0,Provider,that's something in the future that's possible.
13714.0,Patient,You know. i'll be i'll be alone in the car a lot and. i'm fine with that.
462.0,Provider,yeah that's actually not bad that's some good so care quiet time really yeah.
13714.0,Patient,"I did not like. My job is on hold for now, you know my regular like. I don't remember what we've covered and what we haven't sorry but I poker dealer and. You know that's obviously a massive risk, as far as, like all of the paraphernalia that goes along with that, with live poker dealings Those are all term vectors and they don't really get sanitized and some of them can't be sanitized because of what they're made of and stuff."
462.0,Provider,And right.
13714.0,Patient,"And plus you know people sitting around a poker table is not really social distancing so like and then they're there for hours usually so it's like it's just all of the worst things independent Mike. And so. that's almost entirely been on hold for last two years. and My my job that you know with with my boss, that I love she she found a way to transition a chunk of our business to online, so we use we use zoom and our own like proprietary poker software and we basically host like team building type things. And and that's you know, been a really good things been really helpful to kind of make up for the loss of the live income but it's still like it's not full time and. And you know it's work from home, which I I like I appreciate that. But like. If it weren't for the pandemic, I would also be. out in the world, you know working name my regular poker dealing too so. It just feels like. too risky to do anything else. Unless like. Unless I can find a way to you know earn a living without. You know, taking too much or like why this gig thing seems like a good idea, because I basically be like I walk into a place i'm there for less than five minutes and then i'm gone. You know I can wear my mask the whole time I don't really have to interact with people very much so. But the rest of the world like hey you know I don't I don't feel safe to like go wander around the mall or. or. Anything really. Even just like going the grocery store it doesn't feel safe. hasn't two years. So yeah it's like really hard to come up with anything to do out in the world. And I would be okay with that if. If my home life for better. Because I know that pandemics been really hard on a lot of people who are wired differently than I am, but as far as like the social interaction part of it. was kind of. It wasn't that like wasn't really that different you know I i'm kind of a homebody anyway. And i'm an introvert and so like for a lot of people I know it was really hard to not be out there and like interacting with everybody, and you know being extroverts out there in the world and, for me it was like. This is fine. Everything else sucks but at least that part of it. was a way."
462.0,Provider,For you yeah.
13714.0,Patient,"But. But not having my own space that's like just for me whether it's my own space time wise or energy wise or or like literally physically that part is. I honestly feel like. The biggest thing I can imagine being good for my mental health and I felt this way for years would be being able to afford my own places, just like. Nobody else just. That would be awesome."
462.0,Provider,And what would that take. Being able to.
13714.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. But first I need a car. And the situation with my sister going off the deep end, a few months ago was actually very expensive because. I ended up having to cover. A lot more rent than I expected because she stopped paying rent. And she acted like. I mean honestly she she didn't even. she's came across as like very entitled about the whole thing and like she didn't even like acknowledge that anybody was going to have to cover rent for her. She didn't like acknowledge that she hadn't paid it she didn't acknowledge that. My other sister and I had both like. Really dipped deep into our pockets to help. And, like the only thing she ever said along those lines was like something about expecting us to just you know. be a sister or something like that, like because that's what sisters do and it's like Okay, but like. You know it doesn't mean you get to be like super rude and entitled and. Not even acknowledge the things that people have done for you. And like."
462.0,Provider,Where does that stand now like where is she what she doing.
13714.0,Patient,don't know. She hasn't like. She hasn't responded to my tax.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so after all of that, then also she's now, am I yeah."
13714.0,Patient,"And I basically I expected that to happen, because she was so angry about being hospitalized again. yeah you know she her, she has the nsf knows yet she will never be able to recognize what's actually wrong. she thinks, you know she's she's she thinks everybody's after her all the time she's got that error annoyed. schizophrenia. and She will probably spend the rest of her life feeling resentful and angry towards me and our other sister for having hospitalized or twice."
462.0,Provider,it's hard to receive that backlash when you were trying to. Exactly support and did like you said digging deep in your pockets. yeah and the emotional. support that that takes to yeah.
13714.0,Patient,"It was extremely hard. extremely hard. That was a. hyper stressful situation. When it happened last year, the first time that we had to have her hospitalized because of how bad her clothes nations and delusions got. Like I. My anxiety was through the roof. Because of her behavior and. And every day like not knowing when she was going to come back from the hospital like I I. I didn't know when she was going to return and I wasn't. able to deal with her when she did she returned kind of unexpectedly. And I wasn't prepared for it and. I just I kind of panicked. and One of the really. profoundly supportive and helpful things that my boyfriend did, for me, was I I called him up because at the time I was with both my sisters in the place that we all shared. And I called him up and he said. I can't stay here, I cannot handle like I can't I need you to come and get me and them. And he. instantly like he was like okay i'll i'll be there and i'll come get you and. I wasn't even like able to think that clearly my like my anxiety was so high, and he came and got me and he was just like 100% there for me. On that occasion, and I really appreciate it. it's one of the few times that he's been able to completely set aside all of isms stuff because that's how much I needed. I needed that PIC support. But it's it always takes a crisis. To get the right right."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you know just one thing that i'm hearing is that year 100% there for him you're hot, you are 100% there for your sister in that crisis of hers right, but then."
13714.0,Patient,Especially as I could be.
462.0,Provider,"right as best as you could be, which is all anyone could ask, but then you really don't have any one that's 100% there for you, unless it is again big big time crisis, which is a hard place to be."
13714.0,Patient,"The only person that I feel like would be would be my daughter, but again I can't I can't do that turret can ask her, but you know. If. Like I had to basically like. because she like it's her nature to want to be that for people. and her dad picks advantage of it, and he doesn't understand it. Right and so she grew up not. Not right away, realizing the appropriateness of that and I had to kind of like deer her away from that over the years and. For a long time she was like no, I want to help tell me what's going on, I want to you know, like she was really like putting herself out there, which was really sweet, but I was like. I had a really hard time explaining her you know cuz cuz don't understand that, like. Like that's not the role that you're supposed to occupy you know you're not supposed to be emotional support for your parents. yeah so um. I feel I feel like we've we've navigated that hurdle, though, and she's at a point now where I don't know what her dad is doing, you know at this point, but. I feel like she and I at least have established like some healthy. understanding and boundaries about stuff like that okay."
462.0,Provider,Where does she live.
13714.0,Patient,Chicago okay.
462.0,Provider,"yeah all right, so not nearby."
13714.0,Patient,"And I would really love to visit her and seeing her in two years and. We both really miss each other, and we would love to have some time together and it just feels terrifying to fly right now. And I would also feel horrible. got her ill, because I brought it into her home and she works from home, so you know her contact with the world is pretty limited also. And, on the one hand i'm really glad because I don't want her to get sick, but on the other hand. she's definitely more of an extrovert than I am, and she is lonely in Chicago because she moved there like six months ago. She grew up in the Philadelphia area with her dad and. She moved to Chicago for work, but she doesn't really have like a support system there per se."
462.0,Provider,"Just her job yeah hard to start over, especially during a pandemic."
13714.0,Patient,"yeah and her job is primarily worked from home, especially right now. And you know there's good things about her being there because she for the first time in her life has like some distance and independence from her. Less than healthy life in Philadelphia with her dad and her grandmother. But yeah she's really lonely and I we both wish that like we could ever visit and I don't know when it's gonna happen it's neither one of us feels like it's safe right now. That sucks but she is probably the person who understands me the most kind of like anybody. and I wish that I had like that kind of understanding and support from like a friend, or something, but I just don't and I don't. not feel like I. Could at this point like it's really i've never been great at. Like maintaining friendships. ever have a problem with like. out of sight out of mind kind of and it's not on purpose it's just. it's just the way my brain works. and I have to make like a. concerted effort to not let that affect you know, the fact that my daughter is also out of sight and I have to let that also be out of mine, just because i've got other stuff that's like right in front of my face."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and that could be a goal right there is just to kind of find ways to focus on the relationship with your daughter, since you do feel supported by her and mutually so. And that may be a long term goal would be to visit her you know and in the right time and the short term goal could just be to try to maybe set up more video calls or start. Something that the two of you can be involved in virtually."
13714.0,Patient,"yeah I mean we do have like our phone calls and our our. facetime or or zoom sometimes what have you, but like. The last couple of months in particular it got really hard, because this situation was stressing me out so much that like. And I didn't want to tell her about it, you know. So I I found myself kind of avoiding talking to her a little bit, not all the time, or anything but like. I just didn't want to let on I don't wanna I don't want to worry her and I don't want to accidentally. say too much, and I. And she knows me well enough to know when i'm not saying something and I didn't like I felt, too, I felt like an like a raw nerve, you know I felt like really just like. To to expose into raw to. To risk it, you know. But hopefully being able to have. Like the one on one therapy appointments will help kind of. get some of that off my chest so it's not like."
462.0,Provider,me worrying thing to note is just that you didn't even feel well enough to talk to your daughter and that's yeah that's pretty serious.
13714.0,Patient,"And thought of it like that, but yeah. So I feel like if. She knew. She would not be happy with me. don't think she would understand. i'm. Just like, why are you putting up with that."
462.0,Provider,"And what are some more of the factors that are keeping you trapped obviously you mentioned concerned about his retaliation, and things he said to you that he would do if you did, and the relationship one other factors are keeping you trapped."
13714.0,Patient,"financial ones. Because like. In theory, you know if I could afford it. You know I could potentially get my own place and still technically, you know be with them, you know, be able to maintain the relationship in order to the voice of the disastrous consequences. And that would feel a lot safer because i'd have my own little safe space. and I just keep trying to put away and just keep trying to find a way to make that happen so far away from it right now. And I have to get a car. Which means I have to. Hopefully, get this gig thing I told you about going, but that requires having a car which means, I have one have to borrow his, which is another reason that."
462.0,Provider,My cells financial. Concerns about the repercussions.
13714.0,Patient,"Some days. Some days it's just feel so impossible. Yes, I feel very much mercy of. His. mood. Like. I never know if it's going to be a good day or bad day never know if it's gonna be a good hour or an hour, because it could be a good day turn into a bad one, was."
462.0,Provider,"walking on eggshells constantly that's you gotta have your nervous system, pretty jacked up. yeah do you practice any type of relaxation."
13714.0,Patient,"um. I think I mentioned last week that. I. Use distraction a lot. I try to just get my mind off of it, you know i'd rather. play some games or watching TV or. Read on my phone you're speeding to get my brain off of. These things. And then you know, and then the moment. My attention is. it's just. it's just all there all the time. So i'm just. i'm constantly doing this like. This delicate pepper my time and my energy. Before I got on the antidepressants it was. Even worse, just because it was like. I couldn't even. Do much as far as like the distractions because I just didn't like. and have the energy or desire to do anything at all, except lay in bed and just not be a lot of. Lisa."
462.0,Provider,yeah so there's some improvement there and the destruction techniques seem to help get you through the days.
13714.0,Patient,marking time.
462.0,Provider,So what would you say is the goal that you could. or something you'd like to set as a goal for. Between now and the next time we talk or over the next month or so in general.
13714.0,Patient,"Well, I have my doctor's appointment on Thursday and i'm hoping that he agrees to up man I depressant. And I guess the. Next goal is to to get that gago is telling you about. I mean I I supposedly I have it, I just they just haven't done all the paperwork or something."
462.0,Provider,"Is there anything else you have to do, or could do, on your end to make it happen speed it up."
13714.0,Patient,"No, I just like I said I just reached out to them again yesterday, and I was like what's the holdup."
462.0,Provider,"find our that's good good Okay, so the gig and then I think last time we talked about just. Using those distraction techniques, taking the time that you need by yourself, even if it is at night when he's sleeping. But just really soaking that in and giving yourself that time, like you said you're doing a delicate tap dance and tap dancers need to stretch their feet in their legs and all that you know."
13714.0,Patient,"it's it is, it is delicate because, like if I do it too much, then he starts to reset."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
13714.0,Patient,And then that causes a problem.
462.0,Provider,"Few things to to work on and to think about. And then just something that I offer you know any patient that's in a situation like yours or similar is some hotlines for domestic violence emotional abuse, just to have on hand, do you have a safe place where you can store those numbers. go hand them off to you and then again, if anything, were to feel really scary at somewhere, you can go also they have chat lines online where, if you just need really needed to talk to someone, it would be you know at least a well versed professional."
13714.0,Patient,"Okay. I called the. The California warm line when it once. More than once I have gone for a walk around the neighborhood so I can do that. it's. You know it's it's pure run so it's not like you know, there is just a lesson."
462.0,Provider,"Exactly yeah. And that's something good to have actually yeah. So the national. National line is 800-799-7233. And then there's another one through safe horizon which is kind of like a Community based Program. it's 806 to 146 73. And again that's safe horizon, they have a chat as well, so if you wanted to chat or like you said, take a walk outside make a call you have those resources now in case of. A time when you feel you know really scared or. Just needing someone to listen."
13714.0,Patient,Because that last one also like a national mine.
462.0,Provider,"The last one is. it's a Community I believe it's kind of like a nonprofit and so, but it's pretty big so they've got their own 800 number safe horizon."
13714.0,Patient,good to have options.
462.0,Provider,yeah it is exactly.
13714.0,Patient,to know if. You know if those are also like more of a pure and kind of a thing and more of like a professional level kind of a thing.
462.0,Provider,"i'm the national hotline should at least I doubt it will be fully you know licensed therapist, but it should be well trained people, and then the safe horizon, they should at least be in some type of training so. that's something they would know how to respond react, create a safety plan listen, you know."
13714.0,Patient,"Well, thank you for the for the options yeah. If possible. We deeply appreciate still being able to meet weekly if we can you know it's not always how bright heart knows things but yeah."
462.0,Provider,"let's see what I got next week i'm pretty sure I am fully booked already, but let me see if there's anything. So I have a couple of options. One would be a half an hour appointment next Thursday. Another would be I keep you just on call and if someone cancels or no shows, I can just kind of message you and you can join, but again that's last minute or I have the following Tuesday the first full hour open at 2pm."
13714.0,Patient,What time on Thursday the 27th.
462.0,Provider,I have a. 5pm.
13714.0,Patient,I can do that.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so we can do half an hour at 5pm and then, can I just put you in for the following, Tuesday, at 2pm."
13714.0,Patient,"Yes, okay so Thursday the 27th at he said five right. Yes, and that's going to be half an hour on. February 1. yeah can you happen to okay."
462.0,Provider,And then that'll be standard 15 minutes.
13714.0,Patient,Thank you.
462.0,Provider,yeah and have you been having any suicidal thoughts.
13714.0,Patient,"Not nothing is like serious, just like idol like just like. it's not as bad as it was. Before I got on antidepressants is just mostly just like being an escape you know."
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so some thoughts they've gotten better any method or plan that you intend to work towards."
13714.0,Patient,My plan is to get my antidepressants.
462.0,Provider,"And that's a good plan so we'll we'll keep that on your goal list and kind of keep following up on that. Alright Diana while i've got you in for next Thursday, so I will see you then."
