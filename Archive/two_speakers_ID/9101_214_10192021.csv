And i'm done i'm tired of being angry i'm tired of being. Everything. I do to try to provide for everything that I do i'm tired of it. And you take care of me."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so that was extremely assertive how you gonna make it happen."
9101.0,Patient,I don't know.
214.0,Provider,yeah I know.
9101.0,Patient,"Yes, I still have to take care of my children, I still need to take care of my household."
214.0,Provider,Okay.
9101.0,Patient,"i'm about ready to go run into the Everglades and see if I can live off the ground, live off the land."
214.0,Provider,"I don't know I, I do not think you can do it."
9101.0,Patient,right because i'm a big baby when it comes to.
214.0,Provider,"No, no, no. You are so angry and I don't want to set the world it's not fair to put the world in this, I think this is all about what you think you thought you haven't done, I think your your your effing anger is really. About you believe this. Some competency that you. And and and I can't tell you I haven't met a more genuine. Actually passionate man in a long time and in i'm not sure why we can't get through this together and it's stumbling me too. You know and it's almost like you know. i'll use the word purgatory your stock man you can't go up and you can't go down but wherever you're at as hell."
9101.0,Patient,"And nobody around sees it. Is a competition to see if they can do worse than I am and tired of it. I want to feel bad for a little while, and I want someone to help me feel better."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but, but what what, when you say feel better and i'm not making fun of you and don't don't think like minimizing or i'm just dismaying you make you feel better like. I can't take away your pain unless you're willing to work through it."
9101.0,Patient,"i'm very willing to work through it, I saw the frustration on your face we finally hit something with me last meeting and you realize oh crap we're done we're out of time you didn't like it and I felt a sense of. hey that's the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life. I mean somebody actually wanted to say, I want to stay a little bit longer you just needed a few more minutes."
214.0,Provider,"I know. I think what we have to figure out is. Why isn't Okay, just to. be a potato picker why isn't it Okay, just to wash windows why isn't it Okay, just to drive a Jaguar like where. Where the where, why do we have to meet. That today it's just not reasonable to be mad."
9101.0,Patient,Because we're 23 years. And my oldest will attest to this. I was held to a standard where everything was on my shoulders to protect to make happen. And I come to find out. After a bit of time through my divorce. She left me for the six the fair that she had on me.
214.0,Provider,"Well, could have been worse, it could have been the town's."
9101.0,Patient,"Yes, but six is a little bit heavy to."
214.0,Provider,"Timothy her not being faithful to you doesn't mean you're not a good dude it doesn't mean you're not good embed it doesn't mean you don't provide. love and compassion don't don't you ever ever question you don't have the capability of making someone feel good, this is a woman that didn't know what good was, for she went around to try to find it not, because you didn't."
9101.0,Patient,Did I did everything.
214.0,Provider,"I know that too messy, but I am i'm validating you to tell you, you are a great man, do not let a woman who doesn't know the difference between right and wrong say you're no good. And every time something you know you know about how people try to change truths, and you know use certain words and certain certain sentences in their favor and without reading the whole thing you're you're in the rabbit hole, let me give you a rope and come on out man."
9101.0,Patient,"It just it just starts me back the reason why I was so angry putting that note in those. meetings. Is are those those reports, was what I came home after dealing with her, she makes you feel so inadequate as a father. I introduced my 16 year olds to sushi and they love it. And before we left. We actually need some well as demons do we usually gorge ourselves with it, and we all got upset stomachs. And once again she's freaking out about how big the boys sick and you know, we need to evaluate whether or not I want you to see them anymore they're 16. You know, leave alone. and tired of it, and also from a perspective from a preacher. You know that his first Ministry. Is this family my 16 year olds are not where they need to be on their walk to the cross, and I am scared to be looking at God that way."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, well, let let one speaking about him, we need to put him in a different. step for a moment, I want to just say this too i'm trying to provide you confident and I guess i'm not doing a good job of it here's the thing if you won the lottery with $5 million. And you gave your kids 2.5 each your wife would said that's all you're going to give them."
9101.0,Patient,That is the true statement.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, if. If you all of a sudden were called by Joe Biden. To corral the United States for some unity and future in a religion in a belief. That can provide hope she would say that's the best job you got. God came down and said, Timothy I need you to come up to heaven for a minute to be my right hand man, I gotta take a couple of vacation days. The wife would say. that's the best you can do he's never gonna give you anything. So when you're thinking you're not enough, it really wouldn't matter what enough would be. She would say wouldn't be. If she's upset about an upset tummy. that she thinks this is a parental issue. From a woman who you've said something about previously that did something I don't think you're in question about your parenting skills."
9101.0,Patient,And a good day.
214.0,Provider,"you're more than a good Daddy you're a good man, a good person, a good friend, a good father. Do not let one person blow you out like a candle you got more gusto than that for certain but here's the thing she can cut you would hurt tongue like a razor blade that's our problem."
9101.0,Patient,yeah yes.
214.0,Provider,"This the Tongue literally. Is figuratively, one of the strongest muscles when it's used with venom."
9101.0,Patient,described in the Bible is sharper than a Jewish short.
214.0,Provider,"So, whereas our shields, whereas our Armor what do we do."
9101.0,Patient,You hold it up.
214.0,Provider,"To us, to four years they're going to be on their own. me live at home, but they're going to be of age to vote of Asia join the military of Asia do many things that they don't need to listen to anybody to. So you know you got a small bid you got anywhere between 24 months to you know 36 months you'll be out on parole and no one has to see the warden like you're at the tail end of this man."
9101.0,Patient,"Very the problem I have I don't know if you realize what it is, I don't know if i've said it before they're both autistic."
214.0,Provider,"autism doesn't mean they're not good kids it doesn't mean. strive it doesn't mean they're not going to be successful doesn't mean they're not going to have partners it doesn't mean they're not going to go bankrupt it doesn't mean they're not going to steal a candy bar they're like every other child, they just have. One more penny in their basket. that's it."
9101.0,Patient,"Right and I need to find a way, because one of my other frustrations is not just the mother that cannot be down. Cavan will send me a little note I want this is usually something small and with my limited income, I still get it for him every time he says, and he didn't. never asked me for anything, and I have to reach out to him i'm getting your brother something, what can I get you I tried to be fair."
214.0,Provider,I got it.
9101.0,Patient,"But then, on the other hand, every time I do do something for Kevin he turns around it starts blowing the crap out of me like his mother does and i'm like where the hell is this exists."
214.0,Provider,"Ah, you just had it. Right like your mother apple tree."
9101.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"visit listen. For today you go and you have to see the Tigers from the window. In 24 months 36 months you'll be allowed in the den with the Tigers, so if you need to go in and talk to your children, which will be men in a different manner and get them. straight line you have plenty of time Timothy this you're not running out of time actually you're gaining time because they're not going to be under her control you're actually going to be driving the vehicle soon she won't and let me tell you something she seen it the way i'm. telling you and she's making life hell on water for you. For these last couple years that's going to be that way."
9101.0,Patient,"I had to have a hard conversation with her for the memorial she wasn't invited because of what she had done to me and under her oldest son, there were a lot of Members from the church and quintin for one. Had. disliked her attitude toward me and. Because of that she was not invited to his memorial meaningful until we're very close. But Clinton and her we're not. He disliked it, and so I had to have a very strong conversation go, you know the reason why you can't be there is twofold one your oldest son despises your attitude and despises you to you were not part of winters world. They don't want you there."
214.0,Provider,"Timothy I just want to say something i'm validating in here and everything you said i'm gonna give you a little step back shane important. You don't need to tell her why she's promise you don't give a shit you can't tell her why she needs to change, you don't give a shit you can't tell her why a whole congregation things she was the issue is that any other thing you will not enlighten the woman. You will not change your vision. You will not change your process, but I know inherently, this is what you struggle with like why the frig can't you just wake up, for the moment. Why can't you see what i'm trying to tell you about our children, why can't you see how you are, but she definitely has a voice about everything about you. Right, I know."
9101.0,Patient,"I mean aq coming to the fact that even the stuff within the school district that she's having to deal with. She should have taken care of it, years ago, and now it's coming to the head where kevin's not may not be allowed to graduate with a diploma but with a certificate of completion. That they just gave him because they just felt sorry for him, he said, on the other hand, also might also get a certificate because it's just they're just going to push them through. And i'm like Why did you not see this years ago that's what your job was supposed to be you took him up here you to go away from me any took to a place where doesn't have doesn't have helped for autistic children. right they don't know how to do with autism."
214.0,Provider,"I I get you but you know you just hear me out. Because I am with you, I am walking with you. You are not. Anxious can't fix this film nope."
9101.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,"You can move forward from it, and I think this is inherently as i'm listening today we're getting stuck in the rearview mirror thing."
9101.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"And yes, yes you're right I shouldn't minimize it and, yes, I can't tell you just like take a rag and wipe it off, I get it, but as long as you keep looking at it, this is what's going to keep you in your purgatory. You can't change anything in the past, my man, you can only do what's best for the future, but if you're incapacitated in deflated nothing's gonna happen that's when you're gonna kick yourself in the ass again today and eat them all, but that's what's going to happen."
9101.0,Patient,So. The stuff that's happened in the past. But why does it feel like it still comes up with something as as a situation in the present.
214.0,Provider,"Because there's. there's an attachment, you should have done something with the school, and now they only get a certificate, so the future turns his back to the past. As if we could go back and say Okay, we can we change all these years we had now like we're getting. we're using we're utilizing the information of today to blame the past about someone doing something, but it's in the present and we're keeping that in the present if it wasn't done we can't say anything about it now. We can bitch and moan about it, but we can't use this emotion and this energy as if we can change it."
9101.0,Patient,"Because I can tell you right now she had an example before leaving the twins. of why she shouldn't be doing what she's doing, because when we homeschooled the oldest one he resents or for it, because all she did was handing them a syllabus. and never greeted his homework never gave him an idea of what it was passing never helped him out with it, I was the one that did that."
214.0,Provider,"Can you take a moment for a second, I just want you to take a breath for a second. we'll use the one I said, if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle."
9101.0,Patient,ever heard you say before.
214.0,Provider,"So how is this helpful today Timothy. You see me, are you right you, you are, you are 300% right."
9101.0,Patient,yeah but.
214.0,Provider,"How does it help you now. You know figuring out in discovery in a murder trial that someone actually kill somebody because all the evidence doesn't change this person that. Right it just makes it fact, but what do you do with facts you can't do nothing with them, so what i'm saying is yes you've built up a dossier about facts and and they're clear and their precise and the blame goes to the responsible party, but you moving forward today. can have that attachment to those facts because it's you that suffering."
9101.0,Patient,Is.
214.0,Provider,I know.
9101.0,Patient,And I don't want to suffer. Right. I want to take some of these meds and make them go away because I don't want to be on them. I know how to do my. own power.
214.0,Provider,"The only way to be under your own power is to have another reckoning of you know what I need to do what I need to do and I need to get into a structure, and I think that's too early."
9101.0,Patient,I almost want to have a lieutenant Dan episode.
214.0,Provider,You need a little cat and Dana now.
9101.0,Patient,Know lieutenant Dan did. Remember numbers company was up in the crow's nest ruben that God during that hurricane.
214.0,Provider,right and it just hit me come get me.
9101.0,Patient,"i'm added everything up but i've looked at it, I go why they, why did you let this happen."
214.0,Provider,But you know God doesn't work this way. This right god's doing.
9101.0,Patient,Right it's my own pride.
214.0,Provider,Okay. Bingo ding ding ding.
9101.0,Patient,"imma imma call it watery. Okay, what is what pigs do."
214.0,Provider,"I I I. I had a phenomenal Korean law enforcement and the only reason I would bring it up as I hadn't reckoning. I left corrections to. Police department to be a training lieutenant and enforcement of unique contracts with the county long story short, my job was to get rid of about 25 offices, which was successful on my part, I went to a meeting in the chambers and someone said to me. Can I told you from and i'm like yeah okay what's up he goes, you know I just wanna let you know that. Before you walk in a room everybody feels your presence and i'm like shit I love that you know, a year later, I thought about and i'm like I never wanted to be the guy that put fear of God in anybody. Right that's what I did. that's what I did I actually became Lucifer to a certain extent in meaning, what I would do is I would get you one way or another, there was. Every person is fallible I will find it so my point being is I started to reevaluate certain things about myself that I needed to change, and what I decided to do is, and these were my mantras many don't make excuses make modifications. You know if I can't if I can't get in this door figure out another one that's the windows closed figure out the rooftop and I started to believe that really inherently My big problem was me. And I wasn't seeing it for what it was, and it was it was my transformation that Aha moment why I decided to whatever whatever I was, I was leaving behind I was becoming something new. And they have and I needed to because my sanity wasn't there my vigor to screw people was my success, what a terrible thing that was for many years for me. So what i'm saying to you us freedom now is about okay I got to put up with her for certain amount of time i've got to figure out how to be ginger but be effective i've got to figure out how I need to have this stop impacting my health because I need to be around from a boys. Right you just kind of got to change the cogs to still work together still get the right time, but put them in different places."
9101.0,Patient,"Right. It is when something i've been dealing with for a long time the other terminology, we used to use was yet or rearrange the buttons."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, it ain't that easy, but you know what. you're sounding like you're ready to rearrange buttons."
9101.0,Patient,i'm ready to take the buttons off and be numb from the neck down.
214.0,Provider,"I don't want to see that I think your greatness still hasn't common I know that's hard for you to understand right now. Somebody puts you on a detour because it was needed, and someone will call you back. When it has to be. In the interim, you have to deal with life on life's terms."
9101.0,Patient,don't. I can't rush it that's my delay of gratification kicking in.
214.0,Provider,Right.
9101.0,Patient,Because i'm tired of feeling this way.
214.0,Provider,you're tired let's make the change.
9101.0,Patient,How do you stop being tired. Take a nap.
214.0,Provider,is just a psychological thing they tell us that we need to be tired. it's just my belief. I hear people all the time I ain't got enough time and i'm like. You couldn't even live in my. world we mean again.
9101.0,Patient,I do seven.
214.0,Provider,"hours a day was standing on my head like and I work out, and I take care of my family i'm not bragging I don't have a Cape I make shit happen, you know why because I want to make it happen."
9101.0,Patient,"That anymore, though."
214.0,Provider,"But you're not me and Greg and i'm just saying there comes a time when we say. And I always tell people I got this so much time in 24 hours I can't believe how much time I have like when you talk about like you don't have you don't have a quarter of what I gotta do. But my point being is if you're really into changing the buttons you'll change them and you'll see how beneficial. things become an accuracy becomes because the things we used to say, we needed we eliminate and the things that we didn't want we now incorporate, and that means you either give up sleep. You give up some video games you give up TV you give up friends i'm not talking about you, personally I don't have friends, I don't have TV and I love video games, I give up all that nonsense to do what's important to me and my family. And with that that provides me the greatest satisfaction much better than a weekly paycheck. What I had to get here i've got. How old, are you. 48 so i've got 11 years on you. So Rome wasn't built in the day. Right, you can do this, Timothy but you you got to actually take your hands on the back of your shirt please have a seat and say okay. where's the smallest start because that's what i'm doing i'm going for the smallest style i'm not going for the biggest one i'm going for the smallest one. Once I get down when I go for the next moment and then i'm going to go to what's the mediums the mediums then i'm going to go for the what's the long ones, and then i'm going to go for the hail Marys, but if you don't start with the short ones you can't get."
9101.0,Patient,i'm thinking with the small ones are.
214.0,Provider,"Love yourself because you're a great guy. That would be a small one. yeah cuz you don't like you, but that's because someone tells you, you know good."
9101.0,Patient,"As a true statement I know. that's a good one. we're not going to have two meetings this month, you know."
214.0,Provider,I know that.
9101.0,Patient,"I seen it so my. anxiety, be a being in the Green is not going to be waiting at all."
214.0,Provider,"I wouldn't even worry about that. Okay, we gotta do we gotta do. I will see you on November 2."
9101.0,Patient,So the goal is to. myself. that's little. anyway.
214.0,Provider,So see now you speaking my language.
9101.0,Patient,Okay. Do a Bush.
214.0,Provider,I bet I look forward to seeing you.
9101.0,Patient,Take it easy.
214.0,Provider,Are you too bye bye.
