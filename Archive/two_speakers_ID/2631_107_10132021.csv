107.0,Provider,Hello.
2631.0,Patient,how's it going.
107.0,Provider,"pretty good, how are you."
2631.0,Patient,Good actually better now I ended up Thursday right before the end of the workday broke my phone.
107.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
2631.0,Patient,"It took me a while to get another one I got one yesterday because my bank got bought out so on Friday at two I didn't know this, but they were going to close early Friday to start transferring the process over. So many my debit cards nothing no account everything was frozen I tweet to. Action to take over, and then I had to set up a new account wait for my debit card animals, it was a hassle but I finally got it taken care of which is good."
107.0,Provider,"Well, that sounds super stressful so that explains why he didn't make it to group last week."
2631.0,Patient,"yep hi, then I didn't have everything like. These new phones are awesome they do so much, but now that you don't memorize anything no numbers so everything was saved on my phone as far as calling, like all zoom. I don't I don't need to type the numbers in there already in there you just find the name and then just click it so no way of getting it, you know I just said, all right i'll wait talk if I buy a phone and i'll go from there."
107.0,Provider,"i'm just making a note in that in your appointment, so that I can alert Dr Solomon did you already let him know."
2631.0,Patient,"Not him personally, but I called him last night. To the office bloody called the virtual clinic to let them know what had happened, and that i'd be there, this Friday."
107.0,Provider,"Alright perfect. Well, that sounds stressful what happened, did you just like drop it or something or was it exciting was an exciting break."
2631.0,Patient,"No usually put my phone in my front pocket and I thought it was the end of the day, basically we're cleaning up, I thought it was over, I was about to get ready to walk to the break room to pull myself away. So I have my phone in my hand and somebody called and asked if I could help, so I put my phone in my back pocket and it fell out of the back pocket somehow from walking I guess the movement it my phone is kind of big and then, I have a. Like a really good phone protector, so it makes it bulky, and so I guess just from that it kind of just worked its way out, and I just I just heard the fall, but I didn't stop to look, because I was working once I was done, I picked it up and the whole screen was gone. But the screen was bad enough, where like I couldn't actually like even swipe it to answer it I can feel it I could hear it. Because it's finally just gave up, I tried, I tried everything I could make it work it didn't I just to the right fine. well."
107.0,Provider,it's amazing how dependent we are on these dumb things.
2631.0,Patient,"yeah and then, in my situation for a very long time, when I first got out, I always have cash on me and then I finally let. My bank convince me to get direct deposit because they were offering some deal where they were giving you like 300 bucks when you on your first deposit or something like that, and I, I always preferred to get my cash and then I. Keep like let's say $100 $20 putting in my pocket and the rest went into the bank. And with direct deposit i'm just I don't need to know more i'll just set up everything I had to do everything, because of the bank situation start getting bought out, I had to. Remember, because I should have done this before I just i've never gone through this, but my everything that I had set up on auto pay my car my. Everything I had to redo it, but I didn't I had to if I would have known that this was going to happen, I thought, everything was going to transfer and I would hold this."
107.0,Provider,"And because even mean at the Bank, they would just for figure it out oh yeah sure."
2631.0,Patient,"So if I would have known that I was not to read manually do everything I would have gone before my bank account closed I would look and read written down everything that's automatic I mean I remembered everything eventually. Well, because those things have been on there for so long, like my spotify forgot about that little Dean, yes. yeah learning experience, I guess, I wasn't ever really I didn't do this much the banking thing so."
107.0,Provider,"Oh man. Well, life lessons."
2631.0,Patient,yeah i'm learning.
107.0,Provider,"Oh man that's not fun well I guess it's better than it broken it wasn't stolen or something so you didn't have to go through the hassle whatever all that would be I guess My point is that, so it could always be worse, I guess. Oh man i'm sorry Eric that sounds super stressful."
2631.0,Patient,it's over it's over now. I that that was one of nesting I gotta worry about now.
107.0,Provider,"yeah totally and I will oh that's going to do was just gonna let Dr Ellen and elevate your. Goodness well so some life lessons and all of that, I guess. But it sounds like he handled it all right yeah."
2631.0,Patient,"I mean, I was limited to what I could do, I had no choice but wait till Tuesday, so I just kept it in layton."
107.0,Provider,There you go.
2631.0,Patient,"To work, I thought the story on the way home picked up the phone and came home set everything up."
107.0,Provider,And yeah well hopefully your did you get insurance on your phone.
2631.0,Patient,"yeah it came was like a little a think goes like a two year something like Daddy I didn't actually have to pay for it, I don't know if it's. Through. When you up but two years is plenty of time if my phone last actually."
107.0,Provider,now also have different expectations about these things and we used to. There it is.
2631.0,Patient,that's true.
107.0,Provider,"Well, so um. So that was certainly a little bit hectic this job you've been at this job for a couple of months now for."
2631.0,Patient,"Yes, since the beginning of the year, I started at the end of January oh."
107.0,Provider,"Why did I think that you change jobs, I guess i've got my brain skirt around so."
2631.0,Patient,"How are you liking, the shark green jobs."
107.0,Provider,Aha okay. um how is everything going with the job.
2631.0,Patient,"Good I like it it's a. it's close for me it's like there's traffic, because the construction, but it's really not that far away, I, like the people there it's a good job."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
2631.0,Patient,And the main thing.
107.0,Provider,"And yeah, how is that going because that was kind of hectic for a little while."
2631.0,Patient,"Good that's why I left my other job and came here because they. This place is just seven to 330 you know if you can stay extra and you want to they'll allow it, but it's not asked or anything like that so at 330 you can clock out and go home, which is what I needed I needed a place where we have a good time."
107.0,Provider,"yeah totally. And then, how was school going."
2631.0,Patient,"Good my started last month I started died only took one class because of the covert being the vaccine thing only took one class. I started last month and it's going good so far that online, so I mean I just check in on Monday and see what's there for the week, and if it's a lot I figure out how much I have to do every day and."
107.0,Provider,Then.
2631.0,Patient,turn it in by the end of the week.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and. And then probation where we at with that whole situation."
2631.0,Patient,"it's over 100 and I got off yeah and August, they finally let me out."
107.0,Provider,wow that must have happened like right after we met or something cuz I don't I think you were okay.
2631.0,Patient,"yeah well I bet right like sometime in the middle August I don't remember the exact date, it was like around the middle August sometime."
107.0,Provider,You don't remember the exact date I feel like that would be something I would have a huge celebration about but.
2631.0,Patient,"I was happy don't get me wrong but it's just like. A lot God i'm more you know, it was a big weight off my shoulders, but. yeah and now there's less things that I have to do, which is nice."
107.0,Provider,yeah what.
2631.0,Patient,"School is still takes up a lot of the time after work and work, you know all morning i'm at work, and then by time I get out if I have a little bit of time before I have to get to homework and all that, and then I get up early so. Nothing really changed, other than there's less that I have to do now, which is good."
107.0,Provider,"So last week when we're supposed to have our session and somehow he had wires crossed, and that was before you broke your phone so were you just kind of having a hectic day or something or."
2631.0,Patient,"yeah it works been hectic if there was. I don't know if it's always like this, I haven't been there that long. But they're just short staffed right now so they're asking people to stay late to stay extra to do as much as they can. To come in on the weekends, you know I work Monday through Friday and have the weekends off so they do they're just allowing you to get as much time as you can. And I stayed late on Wednesday, I just forgot they asked me, and at that moment I they said hey are you able to stay I just said yeah. And because of that I just you know spaced it out that whole day I was thinking right well how long can I stay and what am I going to do after. and food wise and all that. And how much time before I got to get them to the. i'll get on my laptop to do score so I just spaced it out. guys it's been like that, for a little bit now for good month now it's been like just we've been behind."
107.0,Provider,"uh huh well and with you, being off of probation the kind of the. The heartache or the heat of having to make certain things is. that's been a big deal for a long time, so I would imagine that it takes a little time to kind of adjust, because now to your point it's mainly been work or school. yeah making sure you have something to eat."
2631.0,Patient,"yeah john. No, no, you know it's before I always for the most part would say no, because if I said yes, and it will have something to do with probation related that I miss it's a different story like. Right in if you're if you're if you're probation officer understands that life gets in the way sometimes it's step one tactic and. you're all right, but if not, or if it's not your first time doing it, then you know you can lose your freedom for a little while for 30 days or 60 days they can just revoke your probation. A lot can happen so now, you know it's different oh it's I don't have that hanging over my shoulders now now I can just live. I can literally give it one day at a time now, without really having to worry about. What is in that day, other than work in school."
107.0,Provider,"That that's that is huge how when was the last time, like were you for five when was the last time that actually was a part of your life, where you didn't have to worry and you can just kind of do each day."
2631.0,Patient,"long time, and my teens I guess probably was the last time."
107.0,Provider,"Well that's what I mean I was being kind of silly by suggesting, you were four or five years old, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were. In the single digits when you really didn't have to worry because, even when you were a teenager and she have to kind of deal with the gang situation and what was going on around you."
2631.0,Patient,"yeah, but it was normal, so I didn't have to worry because I never thought anybody else worry, so it was just something that was a natural part of your environment."
107.0,Provider,So you are without all of that craziness that's my word I don't know if you would use that word and living life on your own. Work school when you think you've been doing it for a couple of months now.
2631.0,Patient,"yeah i'm i'm it's nice i'm happy. i'm tripping your. Other my my last little. connection to it, is this the box and so that's my. last thing is just getting off of this. One time off it is like there's I don't I still don't i'm happy where i'm at i'm happy, where I am and who, I am today but. One time off the suboxone, then I can just completely shut the last door and then go forward without having to look back for anything or be reminded of anything and now like now i'm at the point where. I actually think about like. Being off suboxone as a possibility, where before it was just. I just did it was routine I did it every day because I had to so I wouldn't use anything else. So I wouldn't even think about it because I couldn't, even if I want it wasn't going to do anything for me, so you know it got me to the end of my probation but now like i'm ready for it to be just all me know."
107.0,Provider,"I think that it's pretty really it's incredible that you are at this point, not that I didn't believe that you would be here, but. it's just in and of itself for you to get here and beyond your own and be able to kind of shake loose all the the things that caused you heartache and pain in the past and have a different life experience it's got to be pretty amazing."
2631.0,Patient,"yeah it is it's it's a trip sometimes when I I mean. I don't do it often, but when I do any anytime it comes up just to think about it is. A trip, you know what you where I am now and the places i've been before i'm definitely bad where I am now."
107.0,Provider,So um do you get to kind of reflect with anybody in your family or anything to kind of just acknowledge kind of how far you've come and. I know you cut ties with a lot of those other people.
2631.0,Patient,"I have, I mean I definitely did when I first got off, but not since then, like, I talked to my sister I talked with my mom when I first got out, but other than that now it's just. move on."
107.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah. Do you have much contact with your sister wasn't she kind of having some struggles there for a little while or no.
2631.0,Patient,"yeah nah my sister lives about 15 minutes away from where I live, and she's not far my little sister still lives with us, so I have a i'm in contact with like at least my immediate family almost on a daily basis okay."
107.0,Provider,"So what's next just kind of day in, day out, get used to this life without having to worry about probation or having that stuff hanging over your shoulder."
2631.0,Patient,"yeah that's it I feel like i've pretty much adjusted it still I knew. I already knew that once I got off, I was comfortable getting off probation because I know mine is going to be like this for a while, I still have years left of school. I mean, I doubt i'll start stop working anytime soon, and even if I was to get lucky, and my creator good business, I mean, I still want to work and be active in in that in either my education or my my career. So I mean. i'm gonna be living this way for a while, so I I knew, even just for school I knew I had a while left so my life wasn't going to change, whether I was on probation or not."
107.0,Provider,"yeah are you starting to develop kind of a friend group between school and work and different things, or no."
2631.0,Patient,"not really not anything like social I there's nobody there work that I don't I that I dislike I get along with pretty much everybody, but because we're sectioned off, you know i'm around the people I work with. In my section more and they're all good people, so I mean we're friends in the sense we get along and we joke around we have fun it's fun at work, but not where I hang out with them outside of work."
107.0,Provider,"And is that intentional, do you kind of feel like they might there might be some shenanigans Sarah just hasn't come up and so it's fine."
2631.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't want to it's just a personal choice I just prefer to at the end of work just come home and watch sports i'm i'm a big. fan of sports right now, you know baseball that's the playoffs basketball is getting started football just started so there's enough, there were. On my free time I prefer to just do that watch sport catch up, if I missed a game watch espn or something and other than that, like. Work and school after work just do school just do school work and hang out at the House i'm enjoying it i'm happy there I don't I don't miss you know I don't want to go after work to the bar and get a beer or watch the game, you know, a sports bar or something I prefer to be home."
107.0,Provider,You kind of lived hard yeah so now you're kind of relaxing a little bit ah.
2631.0,Patient,"I did. I don't feel like going and spending I don't drink. But if I did. i'd rather buy a six pack and go home, then for what, for what i'm gonna pay for one beer at a sports bar I prefer to. buy that beer and take it home, but even at that, and then you still gotta drive you gotta figure out a way to get home. So I just. I just avoided completely I did it I i've done all that I did drinking and anything anything that has to do with that, like there's doesn't appeal to me."
107.0,Provider,Well it's exciting you're officially a grown up.
2631.0,Patient,It is.
107.0,Provider,Man it's awesome.
2631.0,Patient,"yeah it's peaceful that's the one. awesome i've done so many things in my life that you know a lot of people probably don't do that I probably will never do again, the one thing I never had was peaceful now it's it's nice it's. Like I said I look forward to going home, I look forward to hanging out watching sports or reading, though, the only thing that I dislike is reading on my computer I hate the laptop even it's a two in one, so it. folds and. gets bigger the screen hurts my eyes it bothers it if I do it for too long, if I try to read for longer than let's say an hour straight. You know i'll get a headache it starts to bother me so that's, the only thing I dislike, but I still I you know I look forward to coming home and just hanging out."
107.0,Provider,"You should look into these sunglasses that are yellow frame. So they're yellow screen, and so they caught they combat the blue screen or something they're designed specifically to wear so that when you're reading on a computer or laptop or whatever it doesn't bother your eyes and give you a headache."
2631.0,Patient,"i'm gonna i'm gonna try that year, this year, the second person to suggest. That I bought the little protector."
107.0,Provider,"I bought like the phone. That helps to her, but. yeah go ahead and invest in the glasses."
2631.0,Patient,"i'm gonna i'm gonna try that because the film that protective thing that I bought it didn't it help somewhat. A little bit what I mean it did help a little bit like i'll give it that it helps some but it wasn't as good as they claimed it was going to be, or I expected it to be so, I mean, I think the glasses. i'm hoping i'll be better."
107.0,Provider,"I think, from what i've heard, I mean you can get different you know intensities I I think so anyway, and I want to say they're yellow so."
2631.0,Patient,"i'll check it out, because I was hoping, I was done with that I wasn't expecting i'm not I quit with the vaccine and all that i'm not against it. I just for me I don't feel like it's for me I don't feel like I need it and I wasn't expecting it to be a problem with school because, in the summer I had started. And they were making a green mask and then, once they told us we could stop wearing masks they said Okay, this is it and, from now on it's going to be optional you choose to wear the mask or you don't. And and we're going to move on, so I was like alright cool and then right before the. fall semester started they had let us know that they after October 1 they were going to ask for the proof, so I thought all right well i'll figure it out, but what they meant was you're gonna have to upload it by then. And it's going to upload it in the system, then you will you weren't gonna be able to go for the rest of the Semester, even if you want. Your card."
107.0,Provider,"The day after on the second grade, so you have to have it, by then, which is, and I will eventually I said, you know what i'll i'll get the vaccine."
2631.0,Patient,"But before I was going to get the card, it was going to be too long, so I said, you know what i'll just do it, so I thought I was going to be done with online stuff so I didn't even think like yeah to the glasses or anything I just thought over for me."
107.0,Provider,that's a hassle.
2631.0,Patient,"Well, Mr to figure it out."
107.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's good well at least this way you don't have to rush be in such panic about it yeah hopefully can get the glasses me I feel like well, you probably have to order them on Amazon or something look into a couple of different options, but. Hopefully that'll help, even if you go back to school you're still probably gonna have to do a lot of your reading online so you're probably still going to need them."
2631.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
107.0,Provider,So it should be a decent investment for you.
2631.0,Patient,yeah i'll look into it.
107.0,Provider,"Well, sounds like everything's kind of cruising along which is awesome. yeah you."
2631.0,Patient,Know stay this way for a little bit I home.
107.0,Provider,yeah a long bit hopefully.
2631.0,Patient,yeah long as I mean you never know what life's gonna throw you but. it's true until then I just take one day at a time.
107.0,Provider,"I like it sounds good, well, hopefully, your phone stays happy and safe from now on."
2631.0,Patient,yeah I have so.
107.0,Provider,Shall we set up another time to meet. yeah unless there's something else you want to give me a heads up on.
2631.0,Patient,No i'm good for now.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's see maybe we'll do something kind of the beginning of December or kind of beginning middle of December, does this day and time for the most part, work for you."
2631.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
107.0,Provider,"Alright, so we do. December 8. Just gonna. For. Now. And then, of course, if you need to change something you'll let me know."
2631.0,Patient,i'm yes ma'am.
107.0,Provider,"And, in the meantime. Good luck keep up the great work."
2631.0,Patient,"will do, thank you."
107.0,Provider,"it's good to see you. Likewise, take care. bye bye."
