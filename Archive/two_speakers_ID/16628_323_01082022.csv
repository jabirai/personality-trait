16628.0,Patient,"I answer this question you. See. Well, when I first. Time think the year that I started using. I was probably like 2122 you know I had my wisdom teeth removed that gave me over tabs. And it just wasn't taking pain away and it says you to take one here's the hours, and I take one and a half, and I was still hurting. But you know, like i've never been around slugs have never done them, so I didn't think it would hurt to take more so, I think I took like two and a half or three one time and and actually take that away."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16628.0,Patient,"And like I had energy hours away because i'm always like just a tired person I never had energy I. always had trouble getting motivated getting up getting awake you know i've always been down. Okay um. So, I guess, I was actually high and not really realizing it and then, when I run out my prescription that's when I started bottom Wall Street and then that's when people would tell me don't know you got both from it in it. Right."
323.0,Provider,"Well, and I. gave you some energy it not only took the pain away but it gave you some energy."
16628.0,Patient,Right.

16628.0,Patient,"Before that oh yeah. yeah cuz I was like wow i'm awake you know, like, I can clean the House, you know is. So it's partly from there. And then it's like if I didn't have I would say, tired and stuff and like I said in the beginning, I didn't realize, I was a drug addict you know because it's happened little bits at Tom because i'm like i'll have that. Energy back you know you're awake. And then you know, after a couple years of doing that that's you know when I finally realized that I got a problem with it."
323.0,Provider,When they were buying off the street what were you buying.
16628.0,Patient,"It was little cabin purposes. And then you know, like fast forward a few years later, which would be I think around 2010. Like i've always had back problems 2014 I had back surgery. Okay, but i've got some this stuff messed up and I didn't have medical insurance nothing you know and that's what got me back with the pain medication and then a friend of mine, she had an oxy cotton at. hmm and that's when I started taking those online wow that actually worked for the pain, you know. Because at the time I was just looking to get rid of pain, you know, trying to get higher thing because I had quit on my own, and then the oxy just kind of got me because I was able to quit the smallest Lord has two sides with the axes it went from. I think within three months I got it to do and six or seven eight hours a day."
323.0,Provider,You know.
16628.0,Patient,"Because I have heard that i've heard people talk about you know how can you do, that many a day you know, because at first, I would get sick and throw up. yeah."

16628.0,Patient,"yeah yep so I was your shock on how quickly you know that they give a medicine had you know, maybe my tolerance pepe. But yeah I was on probation. Trying to think what I was on probation, for I think I had a dui and I was like I was on probation tell my Fine was paid pretty much I didn't have to report or nothing but that's when I you know started using proxies and then I was like I asked for help in trouble, because this. probation violation, so it kind of steered me away from asking for help."
323.0,Provider,And they weren't doing drug screens or anything during probation.
16628.0,Patient,It yeah it was mom according.
323.0,Provider,yeah okay.

Yes, I was just trying to get my fix and then I told him. I was like yeah so I didn't ask for help, because I knew I get trouble. There, which they actually surprised me because they did help me, you know I will interrupt court. For a year and a half. Which that helped tremendously you know, like because the Council and everything I had good crew. yeah and then like. Because before you know you think like coffee can help you but yeah they actually did because a couple of them like David you asked me how you doing."
323.0,Provider,And I.
16628.0,Patient,"mean a lot of them just drug testing Okay, he filled it out here, but I can tell, they actually you know cared and tried to help me. But yeah like said it was all pretty much me trying to self medicate for pain. And even the judges like total mustard if i'm not pregnant and I don't have kids but I don't qualify for any kind of medical systems. So they understood that part you know. I tried, I was off the drugs and then. A couple years after that paper for years. I didn't have custody of my kids and I tried messaging my son on Facebook, he was. I say 1615 or 16 at the time, you know which that as a whole, other story, but uh. You know."
323.0,Provider,hold on I just lost you there you are okay our sound is cutting in and out sorry. So you tried to face him and you tried to message him on facetime. Here you are you. Can you hear me.

323.0,Provider,"So, you had the last I heard was you had you had tried to message your son."
16628.0,Patient,"Right. And he just he wanted to be an asshole to me, you know if somebody's voice recordings and that he hoped I died and was trying to tell me how to do myself so that got me to relax you know, and I went big I went for the heroin this time. And then. yeah I was on that. I think. 2013 2014, as you know, because I was collected as clean for a few years after drug court. And then, when my son had said that that just kind of took me. Then about I was almost five years ago I went out to a sandbox and clinic it was an outpatient I was doing good there. i'd never failed a drug test. The doctor seem to care at first, but towards the end a lot of us started complaining, because she would say that there was stuff in our system when you know they knew we knew that there wasn't. which he I was all talking like Okay, she just wants to you know build our medicaid you know so she can get more money. And then come to find out, like all the people that was doing individual counseling they weren't I don't know how to say it like they weren't educated enough. You know, to do certain counseling so then she made us everybody do groups and a couple times, she told me that there was method my system. And i'd never done this before."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16628.0,Patient,"You know my drug of choice was always you know something down. yeah yeah. And that's what I told her I said, out of the four or five years i've been here so i've never failed drug test, so why would I do it all of a sudden, you know I said i'm. had no cravings no nothing you know I said I just would never speak person and she's like well the lab fenders like 20%. or 20 something you know in my system of math and i'm like it is just impossible, you know I said, is there any way because she's like well, you have to do extra counseling now because you know your system. And she just kept, adding that, like every week, I was going every week and then she won't become two and three times a week and I talked to some of the other people and they're like yeah she's saying we got marijuana in our system and we don't you know, so I think. She was just trying to I don't know got the big head with the money cuz uh."

16628.0,Patient,"I was in rehab this was during this one before I went to drug court because I told him I said I want to I said I don't think I can stop because of the environment and people around us, that I want to be a way so. It was a Salvation Army in Dayton Ohio. And I got up there, they had boys and girls together which we weren't allowed to talk like if I just said, excuse me, I would get in trouble yeah we get around them, they just pretty much made it impossible to complete the program I was there for two months. which the the guys, there were very perverted. And I told him one. Because he wouldn't leave me alone and a couple days after that. I was at a desk point where, when I come back to like we got your stuff packed you know because you're kicked out i'm like Why am I kicked out. And they tried to say that they had found a treasure down under my bed. And I was like I don't even know what it tries to do is you know under like it's a sleeping pill, so I don't have any trouble sleeping, so why would I you know which the way we weren't even allowed to have an ibuprofen. would not have cell phone nothing. I would go to the gas station I would buy these one pills are called many things, and they would give me energy I kept them in my bra because I knew that we weren't allowed to have nothing. But I don't want just lay in bed all day I need my energy, so I had that my role has opened in my bro yes, I told him I said i'm not gonna leave anything my room, because I know you guys check, so I know that that's a lie. But yeah they tried to say that I, I stole some rules sleep medicine and then I finally get my way back to my hometown because I call operational stress and i'm on the street, you said I don't have no way home. Like you know, two hours away and I told him what was going on, you know and he's like you know we can't give you any transportation, you know, so I told him I said just whenever I figured out a way home, I said i'll get a hold of you, I guess, so. I was on the street for almost a month, and then I had finally got me a way back down and I go talk to my probation officer and he's like. So do you know why you got kicked out my school year they said that I stole the transit and from some girl he's like no they didn't tell me that they said that you're talking to a boy. i'm and i'm like yeah they didn't you know. And I told him because they wanted me to. Give them my feedback, so they could send more people, they are not to master don't sit on there, so they just. I said the Salvation Army, so they just want us there to be their slaves pretty much make us work 24 seven set of. But yeah like they were supposed to do counseling and it was all about the Bible, you know I knew someone once a week. And you think you're supposed to talk to him, you know, like the news talking and she's like well, did you read your Bible. um, I guess, I read my verses and then that's all they're worried about is reading your Bible, and then going to work. Because they made the jury. cook for them and then the boys worked in the shop. But yeah then they'd always threatened us Oh, if you don't know what we're saying, then we'll call a probation officer and you'll go to jail. So that place is a joke, you know I said, the only thing that kept me clean was closed, I had no money and I didn't know, nobody instead of the nat I said, there was just as much drugs into rehab is there was on the street."
323.0,Provider,yeah doesn't sound like an optimal experience.

My parents, they they just would never like. Let me go stay with friends, but then again I couldn't have a friend over the House. It was kind of like you're gonna sit here and do nothing you know. and"

And you'll hear us talk. quite a bit in. The group sessions as well just get an you'll just get a good idea of. The work that we do together so. than the other so so it's a weekly group two times a month to see Dr sell two times a month to see me. yeah and then the once a month drug screen that you'll do. um and sometimes what works well for people is when you a week that you're going to see Dr cell then maybe try to see me the next week, so that you have a contact with one of us each week it's. If it works with your work schedule and things like that that's great. The only day that will be an option for you to have individual sessions with me at this point is going to be Saturday, because you can't have group in an individual or medical appointment on the same day."
16628.0,Patient,Okay.
323.0,Provider,"looks like one bright heart health appointment a day. So. If saturday's work well for you, with your work schedule and all that, then I would encourage you, when you call to check in for group on Wednesday go ahead and schedule your next January individual point with me, I know that I still have openings the 22nd and 29. So you can go ahead and get something scheduled and usually the sooner, you can get it scheduled, the more you'll have some flexibility about what's available because of my Saturday appointments booked up pretty quickly."
16628.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I was trying to think I was brilliant at time up to my email, I was getting ready to but. I think I do have the next point for you, I think it's like in February."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so um when I see you Wednesday and group, maybe just even if you send me a chat let me know when your next appointment is because. We will have a care manager in with us and group and if I need to try to get you in in January them and tell them to go ahead and get something else scheduled. For January. So do you have questions, for me, I know I asked a lot of questions of you thanks for sharing all that."
16628.0,Patient,I can't think anything you know just yet.
323.0,Provider,"Okay. I think you're going to like the Wednesday group it's a very we've had some people that have been in there over a year, so they feel like they really do know each other and can support each other and they're very positive very supportive of each other. So we've created I think a nice little cohort of folks on the Wednesday evening group."
16628.0,Patient,that's that's really good.
323.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I think you'll fit really well so. Well, it was great to meet you do you prefer Elizabeth or Liz or Liz okay. i'll let Dr sell know that we met."
16628.0,Patient,That we can expect to see you.
323.0,Provider,Wednesday night and i'll look forward to seeing you then. Okay okay. Have a good day it was great to. meet you.
16628.0,Patient,"Yes, Nice meeting you thanks."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is the end of it actually is the bps appointment with Elizabeth Johnson she goes by Liz for initial treatment planning. think we can. Definitely identify and list out all of the attendance requirements that I just went through with our We obviously want her to. Be drug free to. Start Up real a program of sobriety. and help her in terms of just building a sense of recovery she's employed so that's great. Keeping in compliance with us will be good. and getting her in for all of her monthly appointments will be useful as well, so end of the bps appointment with Elizabeth Johnson. going to do some trauma work, I would add that to her treatment plan as well, some trauma work around the childhood molestation and just recovery from. Her trauma. Okay."
