13171.0,Patient,"My boyfriend and I have plans to move out and actually. Okay um we wanted to move out by the end of this year, but it just does not look like it's going to happen so hoping before the first half of next year or during the first half of next year. So we're looking into options right now we're focusing on building our credit, so we can have better chances of getting approved for place."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13171.0,Patient,"That seems to be our only like major barrier. But yes, we would very much like to move out Susan."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh either stressors there, there were some pretty. Significant stressors when I saw you last are they have they lessened with regards to I believe it was. Your visit a."
13171.0,Patient,brother in law or some who.
383.0,Provider,"That you. didn't you guys had difficulty. How is that is, that is, that any improved or."
13171.0,Patient,"It hasn't gotten worse I don't think but it hasn't gotten better. There was a moment for like a day or two, where we thought it might be getting better I actually liked him briefly. And then, like sometime later that week or the next week, he went back to ignoring me again and, like did not want to be around me anymore. So that was a little disappointing my sister and I both thought that was going to be like a turning point for us but turned out it wasn't. But i'm a little less stressed out about it, I just have tried to make peace with it and try. It mean if he wants to ignore me then I don't have a problem, ignoring them back like i'm not going to try and push it or force it or anything. So that is a little bit less stressful it does still make me a little sad because it impacts my relationship with my nephew."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13171.0,Patient,My nephew definitely can. You knows that in his dad and I don't talk until you like asks me about it. becoming aware and. My my nephew has to choose between spending time with his dad or spending time with me.
383.0,Provider,And that doesn't feel great.
13171.0,Patient,Because I don't get picked off.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm i'm sure i'm sure it doesn't. Is he is he residing in the House as well, your brother in law, no okay."
13171.0,Patient,"No he moved out in November of last year. Okay, but he visits every day."
383.0,Provider,"I see. Well, what are some of the things you're working on currently with your in your therapy."
13171.0,Patient,i'm saying. So we're going through the acceptance and commitment therapy process.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13171.0,Patient,that's been really interesting. And that's been large. Or that was the result of the stressor of my brother in law.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13171.0,Patient,"We have just been talking about my birthday that just happened earlier this month, so I journaled a lot during my birthday so we're kind of reviewing my my journals right now and some like insights that came up a lot of stuff about. My relationship dynamics with my family. feelings about software. And how that relates to my work like finding a job and my business that I have with my family. Those are the main ones that we're working on."
383.0,Provider,"I see. That all sounds good. How are you doing with regards to work, employment and are you actively looking for work or how. Were you out with that."
13171.0,Patient,I am like somewhat actively looking i've been really focusing a lot of my time on my family business that I have. That my cousin and my niece and I started because we're trying to launch before the holidays this year.
383.0,Provider,And what is that your family business.
13171.0,Patient,Oh it's. A retail store online retail store and we make handmade resin home goods and gifts.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great."
13171.0,Patient,I haven't really caught my attention.
383.0,Provider,You know so durable.
13171.0,Patient,And so yeah we're trying to get everything prepared to lunch and join this like business cohort to help us just like start right away.
383.0,Provider,"um but sounds exciting. Are you, you had mentioned in I guess that first appointment that you did have sometimes intermittent thoughts of self harm or interested suicidal thoughts. How are you doing with with those with regards to. Having."
13171.0,Patient,"The Center. It still happens. A little more. Frequently than usual, I would say. But it's still generally fleeting like it doesn't. And I have been talking to my my therapist that I see every."
383.0,Provider,"that's good so you guys have a safety plan. or in kind of in place. Well, it sounds like things are going pretty well for you. I mean there's sort of a dichotomy there that things are. You know you're starting a business and you've have plans to move out and and yet there's the intermittent intrusive suicidal thoughts which indicates there's there's a there's something that is. Unresolved or depression, I don't know you know sure you're discussing that with a therapist but. definitely something to not to. ignore. yeah. How was your sleep and your eating patterns with tasks of daily living taking care of yourself self care and that kind of thing."
13171.0,Patient,"I don't remember if, when I last saw you I was already had started medication yet, but i've been taking adderall generic adderall. And that was actually helping with my sleep a lot. For at the start. Because I would. use up all this energy during the day and I nighttime I so tired, I could just knock out and stay asleep. I do have to be a little better about taking my second dose earlier in the day, so that it doesn't keep me up at night. And I have been finding things that have been helping me. fall asleep faster and like help the medication were off faster. So sleep is actually been going really good. And it helps the weather's cooling down, so I am not like waking up in a hot sweat and i'm not like tossing and turning. don't feel like i've been like sleeping in, but I do sleep pretty late. My boyfriend gets home from work pretty late at night, so I usually fall asleep when he falls asleep."
383.0,Provider,la la is.
13171.0,Patient,"yeah he comes home anywhere between 11pm to 2am sometimes. And usually he needs to like eat dinner, or like decompress so that might be like another hour before we go to bed."
383.0,Provider,"Oh well, so you stay up until he gets home."
13171.0,Patient,"um I don't like intend to sometimes I do try to go to sleep before he gets home. Sometimes that's hard, because my like my dog will wake up and want to see him, and so I wake up and."
383.0,Provider,Then right.
13171.0,Patient,"i'd rather like sleep through than he interrupted. And you know he has to come in the bedroom and you know get ready for bed, and all these things, and so lights go on and there's noise so sometimes it's just easier to just stay awake."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. And then, what time do you get up in the morning after big going to bed."
13171.0,Patient,i'm usually between 8am to 11am. Pending on what time I fall asleep.
383.0,Provider,Right right.
13171.0,Patient,"My aim is usually like the the average, though."
383.0,Provider,"Well, that sounds. Like it that's actually pretty good considering if you're going to lose two or three. yeah. yeah. Are you managing you know we I think there were we talked briefly there's some intermittent struggles with anger, are you managing that pretty well and feeling like you're able to manage. angry feelings."
13171.0,Patient,"So no I still don't have. Things like. A. Coping mechanism that I 100% comfortably rely on still. i'm still feeling it out. yeah i'm just not quite sure how exactly to deal with feelings of anger. When i'm like. home and surrounded by so many people and, like I don't want them to know that i'm angry, so I just I don't know how to do it like privately and quietly. yeah."
383.0,Provider,Do you go outside or to take a walk sometimes just just because.
13171.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely that helps a lot. And sometimes they take my dog with me so that's really nice. yeah. But. I don't. I don't always get to or some something happens and I don't get the chance."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think you might want to just kind of try it for a while i'm just going outside and walking you know walking. Being outdoors and getting a good walk in. yeah it's not just the exercise that's beneficial when you take a walk it's the change of environment is looking around it's having other sights and sounds and. to capture your attention it's you know also sometimes like looking up at the sky, and I see trees just the shift of of environment, I think, is really helpful in addition to like the fresh air and just getting that fresh air into your body. and bringing your attention to something. else other than this really strong feelings that are kind of hijack our attention, you know."
13171.0,Patient,"yeah so i've been trying to incorporate. More movement, I think, would be really helpful for me. To just like not feel so frozen or stuck sometimes."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah dude do doing movement practice like yoga or TAI Chi or anything like that.
13171.0,Patient,"um no yoga I do stretch occasionally i'm trying to make it more part of my routine I think it's just. You know, making a habit out of it can be kind of hard. Right um, but I do have a pretty good like stretch. Practice once I actually do it."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think moving can shift how we feel as well. No. i'm. Where are you are, you and your partner considering moving I mean into staying the same staying local are you thinking about moving. somewhere. A little bit at a distance from your family."
13171.0,Patient,"Almost we want to move to Irvine, which is a little bit of a distance about 45 minutes, an hour away from my family."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13171.0,Patient,"But it would be much, much closer to his work he works just around the corner from there, so that's a really big stressor for him which becomes a really big stressor for me. So yeah if we can shorten his commute that would be really helpful for both of us. We also have family out there, we have a cousin up there, one of the cousin that I started the business with so that would actually be really helpful for me as well to be closer to her, so we can do more business together."
383.0,Provider,That sounds sounds like a good plan how far does your partner need to commute.
13171.0,Patient,"To me it's about an hour each way, which is a lot, and when you add it up that's like 10 hours a week and that's just the sounds like a lot feels like a lot."
383.0,Provider,yeah and this day is just expensive to to be driving not much.
13171.0,Patient,"Exactly, so it would be ideal if you could just work 15 minutes away, which, if we get to move where we want to move to that would be what would happen so that would be really nice."
383.0,Provider,"yeah that sounds nice. And, well, I think that. I don't think I have any other questions for you. or you're you're seeing chantelle. Pricing her like monthly or quarterly with regards to your adderall."
13171.0,Patient,I see her every week during group sessions. Okay. So then i've been able to keep her up to date and we've been discussing medication changes actually.
383.0,Provider,"Okay i'm. Taking something in addition to that, or I don't see any maybe i'm not looking at here the right page of you."
13171.0,Patient,"Know i'm just taking birth control, but we're considering switch so I just got a new prescription for Ritalin that i'm going to start. Next week, I believe. Because the current dose of adderall that i'm taking is a good. level for our focus and energy but it's been giving me like really severe dry mouth it's not manageable anymore. The dose below that was also good, but the dry mouth was manageable, but I do like the level of energy and focus i'm having now."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13171.0,Patient,So we did a crossover to Ritalin to see if i'll have the same side effects so i'll start that next.
383.0,Provider,I see and you take your medication daily as prescribed. And are you in therapy weekly or bi weekly.
13171.0,Patient,weekly weekly okay good.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's good that you are. have some contact with chantel weekly. yeah so um then maybe we can make an appointment, for you know, in three months or so just to do the quarterly check in. That works for you. So let's see here. to her. Just a quick question about you know suicide suicidal thoughts that. When they come in, are they sort of fleeting or are there a nice sort of serious feeling of intent or plan there when you have a suicidal thoughts."
13171.0,Patient,"they're mostly fleeting there was one time. Maybe last month that it was it felt sort of serious but it went away by the end of the night, like, I was able to fall asleep and everything. But it did keep me up for a little bit longer than I normally would. But I was able to talk to my therapist about it, I believe the next day."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good. Great you have a good relationship with her and you're you know still staying in touch and you're just engaged in therapy that's really good. So do you think January, would be a good month to have a check in. yeah okay. How about the word the 14th or the 21st work for you."
13171.0,Patient,The 14th should be good. that'll be 2022.
383.0,Provider,yeah my goodness. A good time two o'clock.
13171.0,Patient,Do you all have 230 or three.
383.0,Provider,could do to 30.
13171.0,Patient,Okay that's perfect.
383.0,Provider,"Well, good luck with your business. Great great timing holidays online shopping."
13171.0,Patient,yeah i'm hoping to have good updates for you in our next meeting.
383.0,Provider,"yeah that sounds exciting well you know just stay with your. I don't know if you do any breathing. To you know when you're out walking. If you start getting escalated you know, in terms of an anger. feelings of anger just moving move movement to when when it's angry is a really good way of discharging those feelings inside, you know getting that getting the body moving so."
13171.0,Patient,yeah you're welcome.
383.0,Provider,"Alright Sabrina, thank you for coming today."
13171.0,Patient,i'll See you in January.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, see you then bye bye. Alright, so suicide risk assessment. She reports intrusive thoughts. It doesn't seem like there's much. externality there but let's just say, I would say she's low risk she's got a lot of social supports and she's engaged in therapy she sees chantel weekly. And so I think the protective factors outweigh the risk factors which are basically you know intrusive. fleeting thoughts. doesn't seem like there are any. there's much depression there but i'm that's my assumption to sing her in this particular appointment today so that's not a factor. Okay, so my assessment is low risk and yeah I think that's. What my conclusion will be for today, thank you. Oh, and her next appointment is January 14 2022 at 234 and 39 appointment, thank you."
