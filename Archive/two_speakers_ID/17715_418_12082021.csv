A lot of times they there's a lot of trauma there just by that the activity that happens during the course of your active addiction, you know what I mean. Right all kinds of trauma this gunshots I mean hearing gunshots in the background, and knowing that they're right around you that's not a normal thing that can cause drama. People stealing all around you and you being afraid of getting. caught or or you getting beat up or or you know any kind of violent crimes all that stuff is trauma."

418.0,Provider,"been watching that's it knowing what you know. Having having experienced what you've experienced that's not a normal way of living, but because of addiction and our maladaptive way of coping. We we make that our norm when we're involved with that negativity we that's our norm, you know what I mean it's no big deal somebody got shot in the room next door or somebody odd. right next to me or. we're trying to bring somebody back so we're throwing them in the tub and put Nice on I mean. there's all kinds of ways, people are trying to bring somebody back you know. In places, you know."
17715.0,Patient,Right oh i've seen it yeah.
