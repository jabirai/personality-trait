11942.0,Patient,is making me oh. yeah.
207.0,Provider,39 in December.
11942.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So. But you know again. This is the thing you know it's funny because someone in my opinion, in my just my recent group said. You know, we talked about the same thing in our group, you know gratitude and identifying what you're grateful for and. You know I had someone That said, you know she was naming out all the things that she's grateful for, and she one of the things that that she said that I thought that you know was so profound is that. In being grateful in her recovery is trying to catch up to today's world to today's society because, and the reason why, for her is because it's um. It is she was always high so when you're always high you're still stuck in your your your era when you how things were when you were doing. But just because you numb yourself with the drug you did, and you remain high, and everything that you were doing, because you numb yourself it didn't mean that the world's stock right along with you. Maybe your own private world stop and and that private world is only you alone living in it you're the only person you're the only participant and you're the only certain. Being in that world when you were under the influence right. And, but it doesn't stop the world around you. The world around you continue going so now that you're here and now, and here and now you're sober and you're seeing that fog is removed and now you're seeing the world for what it is your thing I don't understand it. I don't i'm not I can't get down with the lingo either, like all these different and one of the things that I thought that was interesting she said she said. You know I she's been in in recovery for a while now, and she was like you know, whatever drugs. That they're using because you think about if your mom or your dad or anybody who is older and as the elders in your family if they were added. The drugs that they were doing back then is different from the ones that you weren't you were you were exposed to to the ones that's going on, so they would your. elders in your family that were one addicts will say to you, like I don't know what that is I don't know what these young kids are interested down I can't even keep up with the name. And so now today. For the younger generation under you that's you know your thing. With these young kids are doing I don't know what they because it's just killing them all, but at the end of the day, no matter what. You came from a drug is a drug is a drug, and what it does your body was detrimental, and the reason why it was detrimental because also all of these things that were exposed to today. In comparison to the generation before us, and so, when she said that I thought it was so profound because she said, you know i'm trying to keep up with the the the the culture of today, and I say all of that to say is this. You are your age. your daughter, and so you see light and you think of things. Because your level of wisdom, even though. You have made poor choices throughout their life. Your your your your wisdom still comes from. Your level of understanding comes from the fact that you're older and even though you are not necessarily doing the same things that arm that you were doing in the past it doesn't take away still your level of understanding and wisdom."
11942.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"It doesn't take that away, and so you can still pass that on to off young box, because what that's what we are compared to you were young books compared to you, so it doesn't mean teacher you understand it doesn't mean that you. can't teach us, and so, for your daughter you're saying you know I don't understand what it is that she sees in him, I don't understand what she likes it because she still has so much anger resentment or whatever else says she has all of that, so therefore. i'm not very respectful of you, and what you have to say, and so, even though. One may say, listen to cheryl your mom is passing now wisdom she doesn't see that wisdom because she's so looking through the lens of bitterness she's still looking through that emotional lens of how she feels about you."
11942.0,Patient,"I think, too, and it took a while to recognize that she was molested by her dad. hmm Okay, you only she's my only girl, and I trust, what my mother says my mother she's alone jealousy and her from me, you know and and it. took a while for me to even actually understand and accept what mom was even saying, but I trust, what she says and she's right, you know, when I look back at some of the things and I think she holds me responsible. And I feel like I do, I am responsible, because I left at that point was drink, you know. And when she was two weeks over shall I priced where do you this came out of nowhere, I had her in my arms looked at her dad. Not one time to get this man ever make me feel this way never I said you ever effort my daughter, I will kill you two weeks old, mind you. And I don't know why I said it, but I just looked at me he said what's wrong with you, I said I don't know i'm telling you what i'm feeling right now, you ever mess this little girl i'm like kill you. So I believe when I left in that happy because I kept asking me Daddy touching your Daddy touching you she didn't tell me, but one of our brothers filing joke soon as it, yet I snatched dress out, you know, and I mean this goes it's one of my. counselors had to explain this to me and I really can't and I don't really understand it fully but like what i'll tell you something now it is we was cuz we got together okay. that's the most very embarrassed night and I tell people. You don't know what it feels like until you when you see one your own kids do exactly what you do have a how guilty It makes you feel you know how how bad I feel about that. Well, we was out one night and I couldn't find her, she went her way I went my way right. And not done there her dad store because you have you seen have you seen or no I haven't seen it, I was told tired, I said, can I please just slam for can please Atlanta for on tired yeah well I wake up the next morning his sister came in and we was married 10 years so. He comes out of the bedroom guess who else came out of bed. And that was voluntarily you know, and I, it took it took I i've never mentioned it to her, you know i've never mentioned what, why was you in that room, you know it crushed me I didn't know what to say you know, but my account that my my counselor she's a mental health counselor to. She tried to make me understand it's something about I don't mean exactly understand it, but I get it, but the way she did explain it to me, you know kit no nothing else that yeah it does I don't hold it against or you know I don't. I don't and because I know I know she loved me, but I also know arms right she is jealous and they act like husband my sometime by."
207.0,Provider,"your daughter your daughter, and her father."
11942.0,Patient,"yeah and he's with the younger girl and he's got another daughter. it's probably I think she might be 12 or 11 or 12 but this means sick he thick. And she knows it, you know she's she's brought that out, but I think or nine years ago and i've asked her because accounts are told me, she said sure you feel guilty because of what you said when she was two weeks, so you feel responsible. For that happened turn and I do because I wasn't there, but that I know she loved me God, I know she guys, you know she she shows that in different ways, but she also shows jealousy. But I still want the best in show, I still want the best for everybody it's weird. it's weird."
207.0,Provider,"you're breaking up a lot. ya know it sounds to me like you're you're you're speaking, that some of that to come from you know well before I say that, let me ask you this. Did you when you, you were out drinking, or what have you did you was some of that you had an eye, you had a thought or an idea that something her and her dad there was something going on with her and her dad."
11942.0,Patient,I always yes.
207.0,Provider,"And even though she would, if she would the night or whatever, do you think that you drank or you did whatever you did to suppress your thoughts and your emotions."
11942.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah we try and draw it away. Because the way I was acting because I never left my kids you know never, never left my kids and kids leaving for out what. An ex boyfriend mind he's passed away now, but we yanked him back and forth back then, if we have we was married to whoever had the kids had them. Like I could go drink them from him he could go on for me and whoever it yet because we're still married well I did that, and when I get in when I did that. The first time I did it I snatched him up I learned in my purse national anthem straight to a babysitter go out to celebrate me I got my kids you know stupid shit and he was like man you just see all that crying about having kids and your baby what."
207.0,Provider,"Do you think, do you think. You think that today, your daughter whole families that meant to not just your drinking, but just you know how you your your involvement as a mother and the your inability to provide that nurturing and that protection and all of that. and In so do you think that issues is she she ever opened up and explains to you, it says to you all. That happened to her when she was younger, whether with her matter, what have you did you think that whenever you were around there was fear of her, she feared, whether it will make you leave and she didn't want you to meet."
11942.0,Patient,Probably yeah I never thought of that you're right probably.
207.0,Provider,"disenchanted. They i'm not going to tell you anything, because if I tell you then i'm going to lose you and I want you here, and so, as you get older. A still a lot of that anger and everything is festering you understand i'm saying and so now she's at a place in her life, who are you to tell me about me. You were never there So yes, why was younger I wanted you there, but now that i'm older and i've been exposed to the streets and i've been all of this different stuff who are you to tell me anything. So, even though you see the wolf in sheep's clothing, she is not hearing anything that you have to say, because you were never there to tell me so who are you now to try to tell me anything."
11942.0,Patient,I never thought of it like that you got a point. You get a point.
207.0,Provider,But again.
11942.0,Patient,it's so kind of downtime that live show.
207.0,Provider,"It comes down to this, you know. You it's your and just like when I think it was in this task group or the group last time, I think it was this actual when you talk about you know, whatever you are going through, and how you, you know you had a relapse or what have you. Listen, at the end of the day, yes, you fall down, but you have to get back on we all. have them, we have to get back up right it's like a baby when a baby walk you know the baby they dropped, but hey you will never learn how to walk if you keep on. Your buddy you got to get up and so and there's actually a song we fall down, but we have to get back up again, this is Gospel singer named donnie mcclurkin and back sing that song um but again. it's The thing is. Why we fall and we must get back up but, at the end of the day, you're working in your sobriety. And while you're working on your sobriety you're not doing it to get like from you know, like how we put things on social media we're looking for life. you're not working on your sobriety to get like from your children or forget life from everyone, however you're working on your sobriety to re establish the relationship. With your family. But ultimately to be successful, for yourself, so you can be around to see. Your children and your grandchildren and all of that. So you can be around to do that right, and so, in doing that it's only in them, seeing it and you've been consistent in what you're doing and you're intentional and you're not backing down. that's when they will then believe you. And they will come alongside you and say hey I see mom really try and maybe I should hear what mom has to say right. But if you if you keep falling down remember at the end your children are just looking for you to fail because hey you've done it a million times So what did it what what is this now. Okay, so I had a slip up that's not surprising to me remember We grew up what you're doing that for what's what's the what's the big deal."
11942.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"You understand, and when you. hear that. That speaks to that self that the lack of self confidence that you have within yourself to continue fighting So yes, you fall down. The question is, are you going to say there are you going to get up which one. it's up. To the choice is yours. But, in doing so, it is. Once I fall, I have to look at what what caused me to fall. You have a wall and you hit your tone you Stub your toe on the Chair. You ever walk a sub you're talking something and you're like oh my God it takes your breath away."
11942.0,Patient,As it ever happened yeah.
207.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and when you Stub your toe What do you do you look down to see what you said you're torn. yeah, why did you from your tone."
11942.0,Patient,Because I ran into something.
207.0,Provider,And why did you run into something.
11942.0,Patient,Because I wasn't looking. For you want payments right.
207.0,Provider,"Because you weren't you weren't paying attention to what she was doing. Right. He was not being vigilant, you would not being cautious, you will not be paying attention to what you were doing that's the reason why you Stub your toe into something So what do you do the next time."
11942.0,Patient,You go around it.
207.0,Provider,You pay attention so it won't happen again.
11942.0,Patient,"You got a point you got a point, and you know Rochelle I know I know what gets me every time you know it's when I focus yeah because I told you, I was actually out of guilt, I thought. And I it's me putting all my energy into the kids and mom it doesn't bother me with mom you know that's a natural thing for me, but the kids is what. flow, you know and and I gotta stop it put that put that and I know that's gonna be the roadblock and i'm saying that's what pulls me down in when it's when I. say. I might as well pick up because i'm already there you know."
207.0,Provider,"Because this is what happened. will go use the same analogy of paying attention if you were paying attention to you and your sobriety you would have never stopped your toe. You would have. gotten a case of the essence. If you were paying attention to yourself and what's going on with you. And that i'm still not strong enough, so I do need to pay attention in order to get my legs strong enough and get myself together guess what, if you are paying attention to yourself, you would have not meet had a need to get a case of the sex drive, you would have not gotten that. it's simply because you weren't paying attention what because you're not paying attention. you're keep hitting your toe not on different pieces of furniture, but on the same piece of furniture. cause you not paint the picture if you paid attention, you would have known that piece of furniture has been sitting there for the last three weeks I don't know why do you keep yourself on it your children are making their own choices. Focusing on them. is going to eventually make you crumble and fold."
11942.0,Patient,"It to me, I know that it's going to cause you mental."
207.0,Provider,"emotional and physical distress, simply because you're focusing on them and that's the reason why you've gotten to that case. Because you're you're physically mentally because you're thinking about them. all the time. Emotionally it hurts you to see them getting ready to go through all that you've been through and they're refusing to listen and you know they're heading for destruction, but they refuse to stop so that's emotionally and physically, because my mental and. emotional is so far out of balance, I am now physically getting sick. yeah when I physically get sick. You you know what i'm just going to give one."
11942.0,Patient,Right right.
207.0,Provider,"No cheryl. pay attention because if you don't stop paying attention to what you've got no business thing attention to you cannot you cannot help humbling men. That does not right, I know."
11942.0,Patient,"And I know this in my heart, I know this. yeah it's where I have just separate i've got i've got one that's upstairs now that we're. really well, let me down you're on TIM. he's a grown man, but the thing is, I was telling my good friend, I grew up with him every time he sees the love of my life, Michelle. love of my life we both been here, he don't judge me know that we always talk about God this girl on telling you, we are living in the mark of the beast to tear I don't know what you think that it's here. In there. yeah anyways I know where he's at and now i'm saying it took me a long time to grasp what I was doing to my mom. I knew, and may I appreciate that, but I know exactly where he generated right, but I was you know right he saw a late late except your I don't well hell getting everyone except. You know began to wonder and i've got i've come to the conclusion that I can let it go but it's all right. hold on."
207.0,Provider,hold on one second sure.
11942.0,Patient,She put me on.
207.0,Provider,"yeah but. This is the thing. I don't know a whole lot of people who give birth to children and don't love them. I don't know a lot of people who give birth to children and don't want them even depending on you know even with how that child was conceived. However, even if you say you know what i'm going to give this away or up for an option or whatever, the situation is, it does not take away that emotional piece of it. It still hurts like hell, because remember hey I went nine or 10 months with this child growing in the system there's some form of an. attachment, I went through hell and back trying to get this thing out of me because that's when you were in the hospital that's what you're telling the doctor just get it out to. go through all of that. And so, regardless of what it is, there is still an emotional component that's there, because they ignore it all we want, but there is still an emotional component, that is there right. yeah, and so we find different ways to numb those emotions. We find different ways, so I say all of this to save this show. There is no doubt that you love your children your your children may have a different opinion about about it, but there is no doubt that you love your children, and so, how you deal with your own personalized trauma how you deal with your own things in life was that you know. And you know it, not necessarily at that time, knowing. The mental physical and emotional impact, it was having on your children. and"
11942.0,Patient,There was a phone call came through I didn't hear go ahead.
207.0,Provider,"No, and I said I said, based on what you went through in life, you you, you did what you did to numb all of it to escape from it all. Not recognizing what it was doing to your children and even when you recognize what it was doing to your children your inability to handle that level of her what's the number again escape at all. Now you've gotten to this place in life, where you said I can't escape it anymore, because i'm killing myself ultimately. yeah and so, because I know I know you know your issues in your own path issues with your mother and whatever in the end the arm the the. distorted relationship, ultimately, what you have with your mother and what's still here it is you come to a place in life that I can't continue doing it it doesn't take away. The hurt the hurt and the damage the emotional trauma mental trauma and all of that that your children are so faced with, and now you're learning how to get through it all. you're learning you're learning every day how to get through it all. But listen. It comes with a little bit of fighting it means that I have to continue fighting every day yeah and that's literally it you just have to be intentional about what you're doing, you have to stay consistent in what you're doing, because to be sober it comes with consistency."
11942.0,Patient,Right right.
207.0,Provider,"You have to be consistent, you have to consistently say no. I do not want to drink no i'm not going to do this, no i'm not going to go down to the street, no i'm not going to answer the phone to this person know it takes a lot of consistency practice ultimately makes perfect that's what he's all about."
11942.0,Patient,"Well, so far, you know i've got i've got a little bit of time, you know and and i'm going to keep today today starts another day you know it was tell mom my side I said i'm doing good. That yesterday day before day four day five doing good you know but undetermined though you know i'm saying i'm. Tired i'm so tired. And I know i've been tired before I said before, you know but wow when you get to where i'm at my age i'm saying it's fool. who I know I don't have too many up me I don't you know i'm going to be dead, and I know that I feel that in my heart, you know, I feel that I feel that in my body. So I have to, I have to be strong, you know, I have to end, especially what's going on in the world, it scares the shit out of me i'm telling you. That, I mean the drug addiction or be shit what we get right go through, and I know that."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm. That they got did you guys there mm hmm. let's see if we could. Will you let's get her you for the 29th and hold on no actually let's do the 30th 30th of September and let's do. let's do the 30th. Okay cool.
