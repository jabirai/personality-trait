79.0,Provider,And what kind of brought it about what was the instigation of it.

79.0,Provider,Oh man.
13062.0,Patient,yeah not to.
79.0,Provider,know.
13062.0,Patient,"to learn, so that definitely I think it was like. kind of like my brain hadn't really had to deal with that level yet of intensity and my recovery. yeah and so that being a thing was like my brain was like oh i'm just going to use the mechanism that I have. So make sense, but it just cut right."
79.0,Provider,yeah the sun.
13062.0,Patient,it's not sun it's like bright clouds.
79.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah.
13062.0,Patient,Because it's rainy here.
79.0,Provider,"Oh wow. That is amazing. That it got that right. Okay, so i'm guessing you I mean you talked it through with Andrea. Oh, it froze are you there. yeah there you are. yeah and that you're safe, you know. uh huh okay. that's good and, and that is, it is jarring when that comes up and so so often, sometimes I think it's funny people are like well you know kind of the don't will don't let it happen, well, it just kind of comes right. Like it's. Really. intrusive keyword. yeah yeah and it's jarring and scary and yeah okay. How have you I mean it sounds like you've improved your eating. or no, are you still in low."
13062.0,Patient,i'm i'm definitely battling it.
79.0,Provider,yeah give me a 24 hour recall and and also maybe do a day that was like the worst.
13062.0,Patient,Day. yesterday. My to English muffins with peanut butter and jelly and then I had. A cliff bar and applesauce. And then. I didn't hear anything until around 6pm and I had. A bowl of yogurt and granola and some your sauce.
79.0,Provider,"Okay So yes, smell. So what's missing let's have you kind of go Okay, I know this and this."
13062.0,Patient,well. Still kind of that lunchtime period is hard i'm always checking with Andrea about it and I kind of missed that I have like food rules as to like what breakfast lunch and dinner have to be.
79.0,Provider,Okay mm hmm.
13062.0,Patient,"um so one try to push back against that and like. Because that makes me like i'm fine with the breakfast and I liked them breakfast foods, but then like I don't like the dinner foods, so I don't do dinner, or like a don't do lunch. But then Andrea was like well, you could just have breakfast at dinner there because i'm scrambled eggs."
79.0,Provider,"yeah how often are you, with your family."
13062.0,Patient,"um. We dinner together, but my parents like to do dinner and TV. And usually I like that, but for some reason this week it was making me very sad, it was just like. Really, but I think it was because I was also already. watching TV and doing nothing, because I was like. Dealing with that. final thoughts and just being like I just got to do nothing."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. And just and were you able to vocal effects at all and be like hey so instead of watching TV, while we eat, could we. Okay. And is that, like a huge stretch. for you to imagine yourself doing that or is that not actually I could do it."
13062.0,Patient,"No, I could do it."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think you need that I think that's you recognizing the need, you have there's something funky out the window."
13062.0,Patient,yo just making.
79.0,Provider,"But I think that's really cool that you recognize that I have already been watching a lot of TV and I need something different for this mealtime when you guys like to just chat for a minute it doesn't even have to be long like 1015 minutes. You know, and it can really make a difference. and connect and feel supported and safe eating with people makes us feel safe that's well documented. But if you're not really connecting over your food than it. it's not going to be a connection, like a good. So. Okay. I mean. Do you want to set that as a goal or be like all right next meal eat together or maybe prep them early. Next, family dinner."
13062.0,Patient,My parents are going out of town.
79.0,Provider,Over I love.
13062.0,Patient,"to eat, but my friend camille's gonna be here, so we can do that."

13062.0,Patient,The yeah.
79.0,Provider,"cooking space what was that, like."
13062.0,Patient,"that's fine just French toast. Right. Well, I mean I wasn't like the fullest of sharing that it could have like I. Just did the made the like French toast selfless."
79.0,Provider,And then she cooked it.
13062.0,Patient,The egg thing and then she cooked it.
79.0,Provider,Now that's sharing I mean you don't want to both be standing at the the stove together that's kind of annoying.
13062.0,Patient,"yeah so. yeah and I told her, I was like turns out I. thought it."
79.0,Provider,"yeah that's Good though i'm totally followed through Oh, do you know your what your weights at."

79.0,Provider,"That sounds like a great plan and. The. You know just your experience and eating less and did you notice negatives to it, you know."
13062.0,Patient,People like I said I didn't like I was really tired and. hungry.
79.0,Provider,Any yeah any like specific symptoms at all like dizzy or anything.
13062.0,Patient,"i'm. Not dizziness but I know, over the weekend, I was just like I cannot move."
79.0,Provider,"Like exhausted exhausted okay all right that's good, I just wanted to make sure we're not missing anything there need need you to go to the doctor or anything like that, but it doesn't sound like it."
13062.0,Patient,"And I was actually thinking, I think I need to go back to the doctor for. To see i'm anemic again because that's been like. like this week is a bit of a. And as a different week you know, in terms of. Meeting meal plan, but in the weeks prior you know I had been doing really good about meeting meal plan, and I still felt really tired."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, now that is a good and your last."
13062.0,Patient,haven't been.
79.0,Provider,She was. asked to lie totally I fully support that. And you had. was your ferrets and in here.
13062.0,Patient,"No, they didn't."
79.0,Provider,They didn't really check that.
13062.0,Patient,There should be allowed that did check it because I know that she did check it I can try and pull it up.
79.0,Provider,see it on this one I just see the regular hemoglobin hematocrit but. The other the other iron part yeah pull up what you see.
13062.0,Patient,Tom barrington I have one from.
79.0,Provider,Okay. yeah where's that.
13062.0,Patient,Is 41.
79.0,Provider,let's stop that.
13062.0,Patient,And it was fasting.
79.0,Provider,"Actually, not bad any other any low. Anything on there, like be 12 do you have a B 12 number on yours."
13062.0,Patient,"I don't you know. Okay, let me look at the test I have CDC with differential for metabolic panel trends ferreting saturation."
79.0,Provider,Is that when normal.
13062.0,Patient,iron total is 135. Total iron binding capacity 356 and percent transparent and saturation is 38.
79.0,Provider,"It all sounds normal. But you have no be 12 on there so yeah I. would go and get your blood tested again, do you have your vitamin D on their levels. can affect energy can cause fatigue. Go back and see if there's any. On this. yeah but yeah but right down, you need to be 12 do the farrington in the whole anemia check again. But get the beetle and the D as well."
13062.0,Patient,Okay. there's one i'm just looking at the numbers on here. They all appear to you within gleamed. Except. White blood cell is at the bottom of the range.
79.0,Provider,You probably have some kind of. Three point something going on.
13062.0,Patient,yeah okay wait i'm taking a note. Go to Dr. So anemia. Be 12 and vitamin D.
79.0,Provider,"check those and see maybe it's a different, you can have pernicious anemia, which is the vitamin D 12 being low or just being vitamin D deficient can cause fatigue."
13062.0,Patient,"Okay, for sure."
79.0,Provider,"i'm going to guess, even though it was January I doubt you have iron anemia just because your iron stores, it takes a while, for it to drop down. And it's. Probably Okay, but I could be wrong. Okay, so eating more. that's the fixed but let's go to your food rules, and do you want to write them on the screen and do like a share screen or anything. And we can do just kind of a cognitive challenging them and then a plan of. How to change that because when you have a food rule you're going to bump up against it and you're they're going to feel like you're doing things right, but you're doing things wrong until that food real gets kind of dismantle them. reward system isn't there."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah well I just feel like for me it's like. I like with lunch, the only thing I can think of for lunch was like sandwich. And so I kind of almost want to move away from the language of breakfast lunch dinner. And yeah and I think that would help me to just be like having lunch i'm just eating a bagel i'm not having dinner i'm just having friends."
79.0,Provider,uh huh I love it just call it meals mealtime.
13062.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm that's great yeah and travel the world for me just a minute, and what would people in. Alaska be eating for lunch."
13062.0,Patient,Know probably like fish.
79.0,Provider,"Oh wait some kind of season based. base, maybe a seafood chowder. Like that it's really cold there right now right."
13062.0,Patient,it's winter oh yeah.
79.0,Provider,"All right, what are they eating in South America let's go to Brazil."
13062.0,Patient,Maybe like a rice and beans tuition. Some planting.
79.0,Provider,mm hmm totally yeah okay take me to Japan.
13062.0,Patient,Maybe noodle soup.
79.0,Provider,yeah. too late or a little where they call their little. bento. yeah where they have all the little. How about Russia was to Russia.
13062.0,Patient,i'm. A bland situation.
79.0,Provider,sausage and. potatoes.
13062.0,Patient,White potatoes and herring or something like. that's a little more Swedish.
79.0,Provider,"Yes, do you have Swedish. heritage."
13062.0,Patient,"No, I don't but my my mom's best friend is from Sweden. Okay, and so every like. Every Christmas and stuff we would. On Christmas Eve, we would go over to their house and do a Swedish meal. And sing some Swedish drinking songs. off of it. I am. abnormally well versed in the Swedish culture."
79.0,Provider,"And it's not family it's. Mine yeah we sing a Swedish birthday song for birthdays because my my grandmother was Swedish. She was cute and shared a lot of her heritage with us. yeah that's fun good Okay, so I like that that's how you're going to challenge that whole. deal is it's just mealtimes it sounds awesome. Any other food rule."
13062.0,Patient,"i'm, not that I can then go. That one was also pretty unconscious and Andrea had to be like oh so a food role, and I was like yeah. i've turned out. So um yeah I think that i'm going to do is. When breakfast was really difficult I like spent time like figuring out like three breakfasts. What I could do so I had like my like. peanut butter and jelly English muffin. yogurt and granola and then like a bagel and cream cheese. And so I think I want to spend some time to try and figure out what are my three lunch options."
79.0,Provider,"Oh yes, you want to do that now."
13062.0,Patient,"i'm yeah i'm not really sure what I want them, I think we won't want to be like pasta."
79.0,Provider,"i'm very good here in Italy, then yeah. yeah mm hmm."
13062.0,Patient,"Some, like pasta."
79.0,Provider,Warm or cold pasta. And what kind of sauce creamy tomato base.
13062.0,Patient,"No, I was thinking, maybe pesto. Or maybe just but. Actually, I like olive oil on it. mm hmm I like to do just follow the oil and salt and pepper."
79.0,Provider,Nice mm hmm super good.
13062.0,Patient,But I would need to figure out. More.
79.0,Provider,"yeah than that. If you cooked up your CD or something like that. You know that's gonna you can have that, for me, depends on the size of a package, but for a few lunches in the week type of a thing."
13062.0,Patient,yeah that was another thing that I didn't like what is leftovers for lunch.
79.0,Provider,You don't like leftovers.
13062.0,Patient,It just makes me sad.
79.0,Provider,"Oh interesting. yeah well, can we explore that a little bit more."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know it's just. seemed so boring. I think it also might be a little bit because the leftovers that we have are like dinner leftovers and i'm not really loving lunch or dinner. So then it's like okay Well, this is a leftover of something that I already don't like."
79.0,Provider,"Okay double negative. yeah what, why do you think there's a sadness with leftovers, though, is it. yeah. that the process you're missing out on."
13062.0,Patient,"No, I think it's more so. kind of that like depression era mentality. My family has a lot. Of like it doesn't matter how to eat it."
79.0,Provider,"Okay it's the scarcity mentality and that you, which is beautiful you naturally don't like which is great."
13062.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,You want to have the bountiful type mindset.
13062.0,Patient,mm hmm.
79.0,Provider,that's awesome that's very recovery mindset.
13062.0,Patient,"yeah well I think it's just like growing up and stuff I definitely saw my parents struggling with that mentality, because they had that mentality."
79.0,Provider,"And then, what do you mean by struggle."
13062.0,Patient,"Well, like, I would just see my mom eat this leftover that she didn't want to eat for like four days straight and just be like God eat it and it's. happy, but you're still doing it. And I think it was also probably I was projecting onto her like oh my God my mom's unhappy and i'm not fixing it oh my God oh my God."
79.0,Provider,"Oh wow. yeah wow okay. mm hmm you're a powerful yeah you're a powerful soul. don't even remember that and have that impression you know. You want to build it to make a difference, which is really, really cool but also a heavy burden. mm hmm and if she had thrown that food away and not eaten, it could your family's budget have handled that loss of $1 or whatever it was."
13062.0,Patient,yep.
79.0,Provider,"In some ways as a as a growing up person, you are seeing the illogical behavior of a parent."
13062.0,Patient,"or like if we'd be out at a restaurant right and then they'd be like do you want to take this to go and it'd be like a small things like we're not going to eat that it's gonna sit in the fridge and we don't want that. You know you don't want it. yeah and, like my mom has now gotten a little better about getting out of that habit my grandma still like if it's just like Fries or like the tiny little pathetic side salad that they put on your plate it's like really just a garnish. yeah taking it like no one's."
79.0,Provider,it's not even worth the container you're putting it in yeah yeah.
13062.0,Patient,"This like very, very much about."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah and why you know why that bothers you I would love to explore that more but that might be more of a therapy piece. I don't know you know because it's one thing to see people do stupid things. And it's another to be affected by them doing their stupid thing, even though it's."
13062.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,No definitely not affecting you.
13062.0,Patient,"Think it's probably my people pleasing. You know a bit like. Their emotions are my responsibility, and they feel the need to survive, so I haven't fulfilled their emotions because. Every survival mindset."
79.0,Provider,that's really heavy.
13062.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,And how is that illogical.
13062.0,Patient,"um. Many reasons my emotion or their emotions aren't my responsibility and they're my parents, they have the money they could be eating just because they want to eat what they're eating. Maybe they really like the lasagna so they're just having those oh."
79.0,Provider,"Well, I do really like was on your leftovers, those are good."
13062.0,Patient,I do not.
79.0,Provider,hmm I think it's even better. For the first time.
13062.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,"So Okay, no really, really good processing to that yeah, this is not my responsibility, even the person having the emotion can't control that that emotion came upon them right and and for you to be as a secondary person thinking Oh, but I could have changed it. yeah it's quite bold."
13062.0,Patient,I think it's always funny when I use that that type of like. Processing technique of. Being like. Like get off your high horse dude you can't control that. You are uh huh and that's.
79.0,Provider,"Exactly the opposite of what maybe people would typically think would happen right. yeah I think that's really, really cool that you can do that sneak. yeah."
13062.0,Patient,I got multitudes. kind of affect me over but.
79.0,Provider,uh huh yeah.
13062.0,Patient,"yeah so my goal is to work on those food challenges and i'm going to talk to him meal, but to. kind of her as my support system."
79.0,Provider,Can you get to a good fullness are you stopping to quit get all.
13062.0,Patient,"That was an interesting thing that I did when. When I was in Carmel a while ago when we had a meeting when I was in Carmel we talked about like eating the fullness and then eating totally a little bit over fullness just like kind of playing around with that and seeing about and. When I was in Carmel I did a couple days of a couple meals of eating just fullness and. It kind of made my meal is very jumbled and chaotic in that, like, I had the initial meal and then it was like Am I sorry oh yeah i'm guess i'll just have a carrot and it's like like kind of like you know, made it like adding on weird things to like but um. It was felt really good to just eat too, when I was full. And I don't think i'm fully in contact with that, right now, of like that feeling of fullness. But I would like to get back to it."
79.0,Provider,which makes sense in times of depression deeper depression. yeah I think it's.
13062.0,Patient,More distanced good to recognize that that's not necessarily something I can obtain right now. But I can work for.
79.0,Provider,Sure okay. sounds good yeah and you've got really good goals set thanks I just want to be supportive any other like things that you think need exploring or determine a goal for.
13062.0,Patient,"No, I think I just want to stick with those yeah."
79.0,Provider,"This sounds good, I agree okay yeah send me the labs or. let's see I can request that amanda request them from the doctor."
13062.0,Patient,I can just send her a message.
79.0,Provider,yeah perfect just do that as the hey i'm going to get labs.
13062.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I think she has to happen, yet."
79.0,Provider,and I know she's leaving right heart health darn it she's so awesome don't want to lose her but she's got some family things she needs to get.
13062.0,Patient,folks.
79.0,Provider,So.
13062.0,Patient,"Wait who is leaving. amanda Oh, I thought she just started."
79.0,Provider,"She did, but then they moved and then something happened and she's like I maybe i'll come back and."
13062.0,Patient,"It would be a while. I know, was a bummer. yeah I can also in my doctor message, because she tends to be very booked out. So I don't know if I can get to in person meeting shoes, but I can at least get the labs."
79.0,Provider,Exactly yeah.
13062.0,Patient,"That sounds good, I. Believe there's already the release of info from her so i'll just ask that you send them to you."
79.0,Provider,"sounds good, and if you and, if you want to send me your food logs despair accountability. happy to see them."
13062.0,Patient,"Okay, so."
79.0,Provider,"If you want to me at all do, that no pressure, though, to. I think you know I trust you. you've demonstrated, you know you know what a full meal plan looks like."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah I am proud of. My recognition of. I guess not not not being guilty about not meeting my meal plan to the point where I would lie about it. yeah because I guess it just that just. For me and my brain literally isn't, something that would work like you know it's just like it's it's not worth it in my brain, because if I lie about something and it eats my brain way and i'm like. I get so unhappy so it's like this is simply not worth it, I would rather just face the consequences which are men SLIM to none."
79.0,Provider,so incredibly mature I love it.
13062.0,Patient,"wise my life with them lying is very interesting in that I really hate lying because I it just. Like the amount that affects me versus other people is like a mountain in a motel. cuz i'm just like dying on the inside, just like I can handle it like."
79.0,Provider,i'm normally not that worried.
13062.0,Patient,And it's just not worth it.
79.0,Provider,yeah so wise okay.
13062.0,Patient,hey guys.
