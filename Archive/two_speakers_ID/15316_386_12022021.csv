386.0,Provider,"hi i'm mj i'm one of the prescription coordinator medical assistance, how are you today. Hello hi can you hear me."
15316.0,Patient,Can you hear me now.
386.0,Provider,"Perfect my name is mj and one of the prescription coordinator medical assistance, I believe we've spoken before Chris."
15316.0,Patient,yep I actually was trying to make trying to make sure I got you.
386.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
15316.0,Patient,"Okay, so here's my issue. Two weeks ago. So gave me a script for 16. Last week. She brings me, she gave me eight nate."
386.0,Provider,"I see the script i'm looking they're just continued here, so I see. And this is for the suboxone for you. yeah."
15316.0,Patient,"Okay, but then this week. she'll give me 14 period."
386.0,Provider,"So what it looks like is on the 1116 or 2021 she gave you a total of eight films, with one additional refill for the four day supply with one edition so eight days total. yeah and and then, following that prescription orders on. She prescribed a quantity of 16 for you, so this unity of 16 for an eight days 12345678 that would have been you picking up your prescription the following day on the 24th. She actually sent in on the 23rd she sent in a quantity of 16 23rd one. Let me, let me do a little math here, so the 16th 12341234. So the prescription from 1123 you wouldn't have been able to technically fill until the 24th and that was forced 16 for an eight days 12345678 that would have taken you to taking your last dose on the first and then being able to feel again on the second, which is Thursday."
15316.0,Patient,"Know correct but. She will know because she wrote it, I mean it was on Tuesday it's always on a group, so I was on Tuesday. Right so she writes me the same amount every week."
386.0,Provider,So what I think what she did is what what typically what she's 16 is the norm for you and that's what it looks like is either eight split in half 888 and then another eight at.
15316.0,Patient,This we was only 14.
386.0,Provider,"And I think it's because she's trying to get you to be on the same date or the day after so realistically for the 14 what she sent in for. She knew that you wouldn't be technically you wouldn't be filling until the 24th because you would have medication for the 24th. Or the 23rd excuse me so pick up expected date was the 24th for seven day supply and that would been 1234567 so you would have had enough medication to get to Tuesday the 30th. To take dosing that day and then needing to pick up again on the first is realistic, but you should have enough medication, at least until the second."
15316.0,Patient,Okay today's the second phase.
386.0,Provider,So. And then the new script went out on 1130 for that quantity of 14 So if you picked up on the 23rd.
15316.0,Patient,"I think the day he wrote it, which was Tuesday, which revenue that was."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, so you should have had dosing for that day is what i'm saying."
15316.0,Patient,"So I had. I was out that morning I always run out them, I always need my script that day because i'm out. By the time Tuesday rolls around so i'll take my last one like Monday night. Or, in the middle of the night Monday going into Tuesday. So I always need for that day."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, so if she if you if you want to pull out the calendar and look with me, because what I have here is her writing out on the 16th which is Thursday she wrote down on a Thursday. And on that Thursday on the 16th of November, she wrote out for four days supply with one additional refill for a total of eight days. which would have taken you for the 16th 17th 18th 19th 20th 21st 22nd 23rd of having medication. So she wrote again on the 23rd but you should have had medication on the 23rd remaining for for to finish out your dosing schedule that that for that afternoon or evening and then picking up again on the 24th. But it sounds like you picked up on the 23rd which is fine insurance may not like that very much so just be careful with that, but. Picking it was going out of town, so they let me I call my insurance company Let me pick it. Up okay."
15316.0,Patient,"But okay so that's okay so that's right but that's what screws me up so. We have one left for Tuesday. My year it doesn't. actually get by the time I pick it up. it's Tuesday night between like nine and 11 o'clock that night because they're open 24 hours that's why use that one. So she's giving me enough with that thinking of the days that sounds right, but I still don't have enough to last me through Tuesday until she writes me a new script because she writes it at one o'clock they don't fill it, I mean I know you called them, for me it takes. anywhere from three to four hours to fill it and then I have to find a ride. yeah out there, so by time I pick it up it's. A you know anywhere between nine and 11 o'clock at night so so I have to have that, like the the numbers need to stay the same, because that screws me up then."
386.0,Provider,"yeah what I what I can do is I can put a request in or I can get so this is the tricky thing, because I know your home situation, so what I can do what I can do is I can bridge for basically one day and give you one day's worth of."
15316.0,Patient,medication that just might think that's all I need to. Cover me.
386.0,Provider,Through okay. To get you know that's My only concern and.
15316.0,Patient,"Like I talked to Stacy and she had talked to sell and I told them what was going on and I haven't missed any I mean I missed Stacy today but it wasn't my fault, there was an issue with the meeting ID. Okay online for two hours waiting for."
386.0,Provider,You I haven't been.
15316.0,Patient,"Through i've kept everything else, where it's supposed to be. Okay, and she keeps going back and forth between 16 and 1869 60 like bridging me one week."
386.0,Provider,yeah so what it what it looks like here is that so she actually finally just on December. nope excuse me 1130 Dr sell put in a prescription overrides of what was previously being recommended is probably a four day supply with one additional refill to get you taken care of well Dr sell on the 30th of November put in an override for us not to do that for.
15316.0,Patient,"Okay, so it just went it just now went through. But because the way she had been looking at it."
386.0,Provider,"say when she right, it would want to clause, I get it."
15316.0,Patient,"You know, two o'clock. yeah realizing what. Tom actually pick up my script and everything else has been said that okay."
386.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's what I went through on the 30th is so when she sent into prescription it looked as if you already had that full day, but again um. If you didn't have if you don't have that full day I have no problem bridging you for a day but it's going to be multiple trips back to the pharmacy because i'll be able to do a day and then you'll have to pick up the next day. they're not gonna let you pick up. The same day okay."
15316.0,Patient,"i'm gonna make multiple trips, just so I can I know that i'm not going to get because I told I told Stacy and I told so even the 16. aren't enough, I mean they're becoming, to the point where they're not enough."
386.0,Provider,yeah there is um there is a message out here for Dr cell and Stacy to kind of group together to kind of come up with some type of treatment plan for you. In regards of everything that you have going on and and in regards of maybe finding you some additional resources for you know housing or whatever we need to do.
15316.0,Patient,"For that okay so that's that's kind of the good thing, so we just found a house. Oh, back in. The next week or two."
386.0,Provider,Congratulations that's it yeah that's that's a lot of. weight off your shoulders so.
15316.0,Patient,"I just got my license back. So I. was getting a car, so those things I you know I got a job so there's they're all kind of falling together. yeah i'm running through the two strips it seems like faster and faster."
386.0,Provider,Okay.
15316.0,Patient,"So, because i'm being. A little i'm I don't know what Sam becoming immune john but I don't have a tolerance."
386.0,Provider,"yeah you can definitely build up a tolerance, but typically when you've taken How long have you been taking suboxone for now."
15316.0,Patient,"Oh God, a long time. it's been two months, maybe, maybe a little bit more. Okay, I don't know."
386.0,Provider,"I have, I have all the way down with us, I have all the way into September um so it's been three months. um but um if you know in regards of dosing schedule i'm not able to."
15316.0,Patient,"provide any time of day, I know you can't you can't are they able is there."
386.0,Provider,You can talk to talk.
15316.0,Patient,"I thought. Was the match, I thought eight milligrams Max but."
386.0,Provider,"In the State of Ohio two times a day dosing for the suboxone eight milligram destiny milligram is pretty much what is on on covered by the insurance company. If they do, increase the medication, then we can definitely put in a prior authorization if the medication is requested that way, but we wouldn't do a prior authorization before it's written."
15316.0,Patient,"No that's fine that's fine, it will be the reason I asked is because. My fiance when she was on it, I know she was taking more than. twice a day, eight milligram strips."
386.0,Provider,"yeah it's when you've been on it for three months, typically the thing to do this particular medication works kind of like the opposite of your normal narcotics so axes are perks. And so it so less less is better usually than more it kind of it's supposed to work, the opposite that's why it's a half antagonist um and so um what. My explanation."
15316.0,Patient,"Like I feel like. don't take this the wrong way. yeah, but I feel like it would have been easier to just come off heroin. Then come off of these."
386.0,Provider,yeah um people have different effects different people have different like withdrawal symptoms on I i've heard you know that it's way better and easier to come off of.
15316.0,Patient,My dad but it's a lot easier come off of the suboxone. I hate it I get sick.
386.0,Provider,"there's different effects for different people it's really your body system it's your personal body system and how it how it's been. Like how it's working within your system so metabolizes Thank you that's what I was born. So how it metabolizes in your system can be completely different from what it, how it metabolizes in somebody else's system and so there's certain receptors that your your personal body will be more receptive of than others and versus. Something else so that's something that definitely talk to Dr cell about in terms of. You don't feel like it's covering you for that 24 hour period of time for the two times a day dosing see what she's able to do, but I mean that's, the only thing that could possibly. be done."
15316.0,Patient,But I can definitely get. A lot like i'm a night person is it is so if i'm up at six in the morning I probably went to bed at four.
386.0,Provider,that's me.
15316.0,Patient,So. I mean I. can't base amount enough where. I don't get sick in between.
386.0,Provider,yeah definitely talk to Dr sell about it and she's really open I don't know how.
15316.0,Patient,"No good I like, though, and I left the book really nice is just I don't think first you really understood the situation, I was in trying to get back and forth and her bridging meeting I was just blown meetings off because I wasn't."
386.0,Provider,"yeah no I think that's what it was it's an automated system so for your prescription recommendation it's automatically and put it in by the computer system. We need time like there's a missed appointment that's marked, whether it be a canceled appointment or a no show to women, obviously reflects more negatively on a no show appointment than it does on like a. canceled but it looks like here the. visit for individual therapy, they did check you in today um."
15316.0,Patient,"And so what they did, and then I waited online for two hours. And Stacy said I guess she messaged them says she tried to come into the room i'm."
386.0,Provider,technetium.
15316.0,Patient,yeah so I gotta reschedule with her till tomorrow for tomorrow.
386.0,Provider,"yep you're awesome nope it looks like everything is pretty great um I can go ahead and do one day bridge, but it won't be until your appointment coming up, so when you come in next week, what I can do is I can put myself a reminder down to get a script called in, for you."
15316.0,Patient,On the ship or Monday. Okay.
386.0,Provider,"So I can. know what i'd rather do it i'd rather get a hold you guys now on Friday or Monday it's Thursday but absolutely um. nope that's perfect I will put a reminder down for myself to get a script called in, for you, for one day supply so it'll be for a quantity of two and that would be the most I would be able to get going for you when was the last time you took the suboxone right now."
15316.0,Patient,um what time is it it's 130 what time at a much larger. A is logs morning. Okay Hello earlier am yesterday.

15316.0,Patient,I was like video.
386.0,Provider,"A health i'm not sure I would be very skeptic on what you see advertised because there's a lot of like scam places right now. I just read something about that that there's a lot of scamming going on, but so just make sure that they're verified."
15316.0,Patient,But I don't know if looking so good yeah you look.
386.0,Provider,"You can look up Tele health mental health. You can Google that and see what POPs in. I i'm based in in Oregon and so i'm on the completely opposite side of the US from you guys but um what I ended up doing for a. Close personal friend is I they have a facility here called serenity lane, and they actually offer it's a it's it's an in person clinic but they, but they also do tell a health for outpatient services. So outpatient services, if needed, instead of having to go into like a rehab facility."
15316.0,Patient,And it's called which what's it called.
386.0,Provider,"This one is from an Oregon it's not in Ohio. Well, like I said i'm on. i'm not familiar with your particular area."

386.0,Provider,"yep. And stinker and like I said, Dr sound Stacy should be in pretty close contact with each other in regards of your case just to make sure that we're getting you whatever resources that you need."
15316.0,Patient,"that's fine and they feel good about it, I just wanted to make sure everything got done. yeah rather than wait to the last minute."
386.0,Provider,I get that 100%. And then hopefully I didn't have that long of a week today so.
