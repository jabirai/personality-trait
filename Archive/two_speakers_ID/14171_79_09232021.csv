79.0,Provider,yeah.
14171.0,Patient,So yeah just been crazy.
79.0,Provider,"yeah Well then, I mean, as far as timing goes, I mean maybe we try and really for nutrition appointments sorry about today today's delay that's particularly annoying then. and Just try and really get to it. You know and keep it a little bit shorter maybe for you, rather than doing a full hour I don't know if that is how."
14171.0,Patient,"If we if we could that would be helpful, just because I am leaving yeah I do leave. Three hours earlier than i'm supposed to go out to a session so."
79.0,Provider,"uh huh Okay, then let's yeah let's do that let's I mean, as long as you're full open and you're not scared to dive in with me, what kind of attack a few of the things and. Maybe keep it to 40 minutes something like that, rather than an hour. Okay, so well and we've been talking for a few minutes yeah let's try and end it like 10 till."
14171.0,Patient,Okay.
79.0,Provider,"For you, and that maybe will help to relieve a little bit of pressure, but still get the nutrition therapy done so. Definitely okay so let's just dive in tell me your 24 I recall. I did yesterday."
14171.0,Patient,"Yesterday I had. A bacon ham and cheese breakfast sandwich. That my husband made. For snack I had a banana. lunch. With you bring me. We bought me some shrimp and a. Like a French onion grilled cheese sandwich. rice those early me. I failed I didn't get a snack in yesterday afternoon. And then we had we went out and got burritos last night for dinner. And then I had a little maybe about it. We stopped it got these brownies and then we're out, it was huge it was. Probably like half this piece of paper."
79.0,Provider,is a big brownie.
14171.0,Patient,"So I we both wanted some so I cut it in half, and then I could that happen, a quarter so. We each had a quarter for dessert."
79.0,Provider,yeah.
14171.0,Patient,it's like that is way too big.
79.0,Provider,"it's big it's true. Okay, and any stomach issues yesterday."
14171.0,Patient,"And know this morning I had an upset stomach but I don't know why I think, to stress."
79.0,Provider,A lot of stress stress is such.
14171.0,Patient,"When you know I it was really weird this morning because I woke up and I had actually what woke me up was, I was in the middle of a dream of going back to. You know my behavior of stopping on the way to work and getting burritos in that. So it was like I had this dream that I stopped on the way to work and got burritos even though my husband had made me breakfast and. So that woke me up and then. Driving to work. it's just like I had this strong pole to to go and get something. You know, and I just I fought it and fought it and fought it and I came straight fork and. You know, it has been even asked me later he's like did you end up going and getting something, because I didn't I didn't mention anything to him, but we're like so in tune right now, and so, then you know it said no, I said, you know really thought it. submerge was really thought it so."
79.0,Provider,wow that's powerful.
14171.0,Patient,I just.
79.0,Provider,"I love that you guys are talking about this, you know remarkable that is."
14171.0,Patient,"He has been so wonderful through this whole thing, and you know."
79.0,Provider,Like I said he's been.
14171.0,Patient,"You know, ever since we. Had the big blow up and he was ready to just file for divorce and everything on everything, because he thought it was having an affair it's like. You know. he's. been you know."
79.0,Provider,"Make he's not the first one, I chuckle because that's happened before, to our client. Literally names actually where the spouse thinks they're having an affair and they're like well if ED is would be a person's then."
14171.0,Patient,"Maybe well and that's you know he. He does leave it that way, he goes, you know, technically, because you were having an affair, you having food is like well yeah but. You know, not the type of affair, you were thinking."
79.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. um I mean that. You know what you've just described, is one of those cross points right where you're going along going along and then you have to cross point of an urge and you can choose to take the detour and because the urges superseded by what not not just the dream. But what comes before even before that."
14171.0,Patient,I mean. Just that that urge that history.
79.0,Provider,"yeah there's that's true there's there's a previous history so there's a there's kind of a stream belt right and but there's something usually before you here, let me. Let me share screen, I wonder if I can. Can I have you write on this board. We make it so you can share to. Like Karen remember I know there's a way and I just can't remember. Oh no no let's just have you share screen me. Okay, you just share screen and do the whiteboard. I don't need to write on it. Do you see the whiteboard. And then. You see, the options."
14171.0,Patient,Now I know.
79.0,Provider,"you're on your phone, so I don't usually join on my phone so i'm not sure what it looks like. Okay well i'll just you tell me what to write basically as well Hello Okay, so can you see that okay."
14171.0,Patient,"Thank you, things. cancel okay. Yes, I can."
79.0,Provider,"So you have. To use a stamp all right, you have the dream right that dream was significant. caused what. What kind of feelings for you."
14171.0,Patient,Baby or one I just.
79.0,Provider,"yeah totally. So the anxiety was there here, I should just write that. Because you had that little experience you didn't ask for it to happen it just happened. And then you had the urge right. Right like that. there's something before there's something right here. That even triggered that dream that's supposed to be aligned for you, for a word. straight line is. What could have triggered the dream. mentally because our brain works. sequentially right. something happens even to bring up. You know, even if you had a dream. About you know when it's something happening to your family member right, it was probably triggered by a worry that you had about them early in the day."
14171.0,Patient,You know right.
79.0,Provider,"So it kind of takes it further, I mean we're influenced by what we see in the day, you know or movies, or you know things but."
14171.0,Patient,"I mean, I mean yesterday with a very stressful day it was I don't. mommy day because I had to meet with my boss."
79.0,Provider,Okay.
14171.0,Patient,"You know, he he wanted to meetings, and I really. Well, we got like one and a half."
79.0,Provider,"So what is that called when you. have somebody you want that's your boss wants something that doesn't happen, how do you describe that."
14171.0,Patient,"describe that. Like a disappointment, like a."
79.0,Provider,Does it feel kind of like a failure.
14171.0,Patient,Yes.
79.0,Provider,Those are better word to describe that.
14171.0,Patient,Nothing I could think of that would probably be. Pretty accurate.
79.0,Provider,"Okay i'll just put failed kind of a feeling of failed because he wanted this and it didn't happen. Unless did you have a really, really strong reason why it didn't need to happen, like you had a different idea, then that's a different feeling."
14171.0,Patient,"No, I I, I agree that we did need to meet he. Okay, it was it was more out of my control so."
79.0,Provider,yeah.
14171.0,Patient,You know he's he schedules his meetings too close together.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, fair assessment he needs to know about that, if you have a way to tell them."
14171.0,Patient,not really.
79.0,Provider,hey can I. You know I mentioned something I think there might be something going on here.
14171.0,Patient,"Well, you know to kind of go back. He came to me on Friday and was like. He goes, I really don't want to impose on your on your family time and your weekend but. On Sunday that'd be great."
79.0,Provider,and
14171.0,Patient,"You know I I made the decision Sunday morning. I sent them a text and I said i'm really sorry I can't meet with you today, you know I have other family in."
79.0,Provider,A rock Nice.
14171.0,Patient,So I felt like I disappointed him. Already already.
79.0,Provider,i'm going to put times to. Okay.
14171.0,Patient,"So That said, I said I agree, I set that boundary and said yes."
79.0,Provider,"But it, but the feeling was still there, even when he wanted it or not, you know it still was there, but I agree with you i'm proud of you for sending that boundary. right that says, we have to work, work ourselves so crazy like is the world really going to end."
14171.0,Patient,Right.
79.0,Provider,"You know, such and such. Now so anyway, just a little exercise in. You know, looking at it really looking at what feelings were there are they comfortable feelings oh my gosh I don't want to be in your shoes even me reading this right. uncomfortable. Totally your brain is experiencing that and you don't get to control what happens in there really. Right, you can try and. Direct. And you did you did direct you did not you fought the urge you had to really fight that so. Anyway, I don't know if that's helpful or not, this is a little bit of therapy, not necessarily nutrition, but it involves the food, so we can kind of talk about it a little bit so something to take to the Andrea."
14171.0,Patient,"Yes, take."
79.0,Provider,"Take more to Andrea you know say this, you know clean and I talked about this, maybe there's something more here. So i'll stop share okay. um. let's see what else we need to cover i'm just thinking we've got. 20 minutes, I want to know a little bit more. About. Just your days you know, are you are you feeling like you're taking care of yourself, you know how's your sleep your water and that sort of thing any physical symptoms and what you've done about them."
14171.0,Patient,i'm. watering is non existent night I really need to work on water. Because like I said i'm a diet coke addict. cooking my starbucks.
79.0,Provider,"And we can I mean there's lots I can share in that I can share education on you know why don't I like diet coke and diet products and why why what does it, how does it affect you biologically and. yeah What about caffeine, you know, and we, we can do some nutrition education there, but at the same time you already know. You know, so I."
14171.0,Patient,I know i'd really need to get off debt coke especially you know being gastric bypass. Without so. What else would you ask.
79.0,Provider,The self care.
14171.0,Patient,sleeping is just not. i've been staying up too late and i'm always up and down all night I don't play through the night.
79.0,Provider,That been going on.
14171.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh for years, probably. Most, most notably probably last two years. And it's just kind of it seemed to have gotten worse at first, I thought you know. When I talked to my primary doctor about it yeah we were kind of leaning towards the whole menopause thing, but then you know when all this came out with the eating disorder he's like well I think some of it might have more to do with some of that. So let's wait and see what happens after you can kind of get some of that treatment under your belt. So i'm fine with that so and."
79.0,Provider,How long are you staying asleep at proud of time right now.
14171.0,Patient,"I would say. Typically, about two hours, no more than three."
79.0,Provider,"yeah, why is that a problem."
14171.0,Patient,Was not getting that deep sleep that everybody needs for six. hours or whatever.
79.0,Provider,yeah yeah at least the generally the rem it's four to five hour right and it's cleansing so cleansing for. and actually for other parts of the body but.
14171.0,Patient,"You know I am. A way it's been and I haven't talked a lot, because I don't take time for myself, I don't do anything for me. yeah i'm always. Trying to take care of everybody else so he's been trying to push me to do more for me, and you know so i'm just like you know it's hard, because you know I work. yeah 10 hours a day, and then I go home and thankfully he's making dinner that more and more, but you know it's still, by the time I get home at 530 and six o'clock and like now, what do I do."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah um and that, I mean you guys are going to have that discussion tonight, if you know that the toolbox thing. And it might be a good time to just ask people, what do you do, what do you do to Pamper yourself, you know, some people might be like. You know I soak my feet, I have this you know foot bath and I soak my feet or an odyssey that takes maybe 15 minutes right, but it can feel really luxurious or something another person might be like I just make sure I have time to smuggle. You know cat dog kid you know husbands partner, whatever that there is just all i'm doing right now is just snuggling you know and being being close. yeah I think I don't want to mention anymore, because i'm like who knows you know what what for you would feel pampering but it doesn't have to be long. Okay doesn't have to be like i'm going to go out and spend three hours. Whatever it can be 1015 minutes."
14171.0,Patient,"Okay now is think of you know pampering itself is something that's going to take you know. An hour or so, you know. You don't think of it as being a quick well thing but. You know i'll do some some thinking on that."
79.0,Provider,yeah ask ask the others to be good for some of them to think to. see your luxury like I can think of what I do you know and i'm like oh yeah I love it like when I go and do that I just feel like. This is just. delightful you know.
14171.0,Patient,Right so.
79.0,Provider,"yeah okay so sleep, we have got to work on that. um. And i'm not sure what he means by. The eating disorder type behavior stuff causing that. kind of a blank on that. anything we met."
14171.0,Patient,I think he was looking at my symptoms overall. That we were thinking that was you know. we're all related to men and pause. You know and thinking that maybe. Because before it was getting hot flashes really bad and.
79.0,Provider,And that could be eating soda related so true yeah.
14171.0,Patient,"So I think he's thinking you know, maybe once we can get some of this resolved to that the eating disorder that maybe my sleep will get better, and you know I see him again in November, so you know, if not, then you know something that we could at least address. And I can say look. it's not getting any better."
79.0,Provider,"I mean tell me about your sleep care, how do you how do you get ready for bed when do you get ready for bed what's the process."
14171.0,Patient,"um I just feel we usually spend after dinner and everything they usually spend about an hour watching TV and then. They typically will try to start going to bed at 10. Just so I can try and be in bed by 11 and then you know, all I really do is just yeah i'll go ahead and wash my face and. Get dressed and climate bed, but you know, sometimes DNS the kids will distract me or the pencil neighbors are."
79.0,Provider,True.
14171.0,Patient,"So, you know that the 10 o'clock start always a good thing, because then I have that extra time to you know get planned and like on my my dpt part I have getting in bed by 11. As a goal and a behavior to work on. Because there have been so many nights where you know. i'll end up watching TV longer than that mix I know it's 1030 quarter to 11 that's like oh man I gotta go to bed. So you know, then by time I get through with everything it's after 1130 so. But I don't I don't have like a huge routine to get ready for bed I just. yeah typically it's just you know I get you know I get dressed and i'm in bed."
79.0,Provider,And do you fall asleep pretty quick.
14171.0,Patient,"That typically typically I lay there and kind of toss and turn for you know at I would say, at least half an hour. yeah it's not it's not an idiot. You know the weird thing is there's nights when you know i'll be like feeling, you know tired and that will be starting to doze off on the couch where we're watching TV and it's like i'll just i'll catch myself and it's like okay I gotta go to bed now. yeah and, unfortunately, then, by the time I get to bed it's you know i'm i'm awake again and."
79.0,Provider,you're tossing and turning.
14171.0,Patient,A fullback sleep.
79.0,Provider,"yeah I mean I have ideas you know around that and of course I want them to be your ideas and so much better when a person comes up with it themselves right much more powerful um. But yeah I mean what do you think could be some things to do some sleep care, you know how do you prep for bed and. But you know in in your ideal like mind I like to ask that a lot your ideal, you know when I was a kid I wanted to be like Anne of green gables right like that was my like oh i'm gonna have an Anne of green gables life. or a pride and prejudice. The lead lady was the six hour version one to come and have that life, you know or whatever and. But what what is the ideal like. What would it What would it be like for you to. You know, be able to. prepare for bed and. Have it be some kind of relaxing something."
14171.0,Patient,"I don't know. I mean this has always been my my routine. I don't I am honestly I don't know um. You know I know his younger ideas to. Like when I was a teenager in high school I would always read before I go to bed. Okay, you know I would I would go to bed and lay in bed and read and then you know. That would kind of relax me, but you know I I can't seem to focus on a book and he. seems like my brain bobby's going so i'm. You know. When i'm reading a book, I have to read it, you know, read the page over and over to kind of get what i'm trying to read, but. You know I think I think that's the biggest thing is my brain is always just. I need to learn to just be able to turn my brain off."
79.0,Provider,And you can't your brain never turns off so that's impossible.
14171.0,Patient,"it's constantly going and it's going, you know fast."
79.0,Provider,"But you can you can direct your brain right we can't turn your brain off, we can direct it. yeah I mean okay i'm gonna i'm going to give you some ideas and just see what you think of them, so you can do a. Where you just write and write and write you free free right and you don't try and control or think about what you're writing you just go like if I was starting to write right now I would write i'm talking to renee. we're talking about sleep, you know, whatever my brain is thinking, I am not going to read this i'm not going to do anything with this i'm just pre writing every single thought that comes to my brain I write it and you do that for like some people do like. However, many pages, they say, like i'm going to I need to fill two pages, you know front and back of a sheet, or I need to free right for two minutes three minutes to just you're just dumping. Or you can also do some people do it a little more organized I don't like that, personally, but you may think differently, is just to write your list, these are the things that i'm need to be need to be done and get it down on paper. Okay. You can also do a meditation or a stretching session, where you can listen, you know with earbuds. And just do a meditation listen there's all kinds of free Apps you know, and I can tell you some of those if you're interested. we're just do a stretching where you have a sequence of stretches that you go through that are helpful for your body like for you what's a stretch, you know you probably need for your body."
14171.0,Patient,"Always somehow stretch out my my neck, and my shoulders."
79.0,Provider,"Just because of your job yeah totally so doing some of those stretches or even just going through a sequence of yoga poses. can be really good. So those are some ideas. Even sometimes a temperature tool, whether you need your bed cold, so you put out like a cold, you know put a rice bag in the freezer. And then stick in your bed before you get in bed, and then you get in bed and it's cold or warm you know vice versa, sometimes even temperature can be when you go to sleep what it really is is going into your body breathing deep you know it's a. it's kind of a surrender right. Right letting your body just rest and a lot of the meditations they do that you know they'll be like. feel your toes."
14171.0,Patient,Right you.
79.0,Provider,"know your heel. You know, feel that the bed is carrying you you don't have to do anything right now. You can tell, I listened to some before but i'm and music right music can be something that helps to just. You know, calm the brain certain types of music. I don't know if you ideas and, of course, you know, Sarah Sarah tone in the role of serotonin we can talk about that and making sure your gut bacteria as much as possible. or unhealthy state that they're producing that and and that you're feeding them. You know well. that's something that can can help us sleep, sometimes it is forgotten. So I don't know any other thoughts you're having as i'm describing some. When."
14171.0,Patient,I like he's gonna.
79.0,Provider,Movement.
14171.0,Patient,yeah so after so long as you start beeping at me and that'll go off.
79.0,Provider,So annoying actually. Like I am alive in here like.
14171.0,Patient,"You know I just yeah I thought about like journaling. i've tried meditation before you know, like like you were saying you know fill your toes. relaxes. move up your body is like yeah I just I could never get that."
79.0,Provider,that's fair totally fair.
14171.0,Patient,"um yeah music, I can understand cuz I really liked music and. So I mean those are some some good ideas. You know and. It would, it would be a huge help. For me, to you, and probably a good place for me to start would be to you know when I leave work and go home, then no more diet coke just have water."
79.0,Provider,yeah mm hmm.
14171.0,Patient,And you know start start counting changing my behavior Ben.
79.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14171.0,Patient,And then you know work it throughout the day.
79.0,Provider,"yeah and the half life of caffeine, as we age. It totally extends like we just do not process caffeine like we used to you know it gets worse and worse as we age, so you have to move up the time of day."
14171.0,Patient,"See i've never been able at i've never felt like Kathy has ever done, you know. that's ever really. energized me I guess yeah. But. You know i'm sure it does mentally. yeah yeah logically that still happen without me feeling like. You know i'm. You know jittery and everything so. But um yeah."
79.0,Provider,"Or whether we're conscious of what's going on biologically to us or not that's. that's such a different thing huh. yeah no I love that Okay, so what time, are you going to say just right at the end of work okay now I drink water or."
14171.0,Patient,"Yes, so you know I leave work and instead of getting the diet coke when I get home just have water."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, how are you going to like the water, though. You got to make it somewhat appealing."
14171.0,Patient,"yeah you know what i'm okay. I have to make sure I have some lemons second slide have sliced lemon in it, if nothing else, and you know it has to be ice cold."
79.0,Provider,"I can you have an ice maker. Yes, okay."
