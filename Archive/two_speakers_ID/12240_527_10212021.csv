And I was with someone I was dating and these two guys to next to us we're just chatting chatting chatting chatting chatting. turns out this guy like hires hookers and wants to hire so it's just even when I go to normal places to be normal people I don't know if I attracted or what like I just I feel like i'm cooking in that world. And I don't know how to exit because when I get stressed out that's the kind of stuff I do to like calm myself down because it makes me feel like i'm financially stable. Like that's how yeah when i'm feeling, you know the last which isn't good those are the six, I just wish there was a better way for me to like not folk not be pointed in that direction so easily like things go wrong and going there things go wrong and going there."
527.0,Provider,And yeah.
12240.0,Patient,"You know, and I do tarot cards like six times a day I don't know if that's healthy I don't know I always say new."
527.0,Provider,My my.
12240.0,Patient,Life is guided by the tarot deck. So I don't know if that's bad it might be I can't tell.
527.0,Provider,I know that when I.
12240.0,Patient,"don't care i'm not functional at all, I did two days off the Taro and I was literally having like meltdowns."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12240.0,Patient,What were the meltdowns about. i'm just not sure what to do where i'm going because i'm so you said you're all car to draw card and they stopped doing him and because it makes you feel like you have some control over the future.
527.0,Provider,sure.
12240.0,Patient,"You know, you can you can not just avoid it but enjoy the good things be you know, try to watch out for the bad. The bad things. So when I didn't have them I just I didn't even know what to do during the day I didn't know how to respond to people, because I wasn't sure like you know how that was fitting into the deck."
527.0,Provider,So I just.
12240.0,Patient,I literally was not okay I didn't eat that for the entire day. So I don't know if that's considered some kind of dependency.
527.0,Provider,"Well, we definitely need to get some structure to your day, so that you, and just work on, you know how you can feel better about yourself and the choices, you know, making. Making better choices for yourself to."
12240.0,Patient,Like like.
527.0,Provider,"Obviously you've had a lot of trauma to Ellen and that probably you know, can contribute to some of those like immediate like that's my go to skill versus. yeah versus just you know, taking a step back and go okay what what do I need to do in this moment that's going to be good for me not. Yet, not the old behavior that I keep using going to yes yeah yeah So what do you guys working on your group sessions are you getting any tools or support from the group as far as."
12240.0,Patient,"Like a blank participation now. So that's good for me, before I was just listening all the time he's like you got to talk, I was like okay."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12240.0,Patient,get away with that.
527.0,Provider,"Well, good cuz I make people talking my groups do Ellen. that's how you work on things so let's do you have like a notebook or something that you can kind of do daily you know make like daily."
12240.0,Patient,"Daily I write what. I do write less my list right now in the hospital, but I will write it oh yeah I do what's in the living room."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so so i'm wondering if maybe just even doing you know starting to work on just some self affirmations for yourself like. Okay, you know what are what are some what are some things I can do to be kind to myself and say to."
12240.0,Patient,myself.
527.0,Provider,"You know, and part of it is recognizing you know how can I keep my emotions and check for myself to like. yeah not engage in things that aren't going to be, you know arguments are not going to help me in this situation like."
12240.0,Patient,Jay way.
527.0,Provider,"waking up and attacking somebody is not. it's not helping myself yeah it doesn't help yourself either you know it just kind of sets the tone for the day so. You know, I wonder if, maybe doing some relaxation or meditation in the morning before you get up you know just kind of lay in bed and. And just kind of do some breathing skills, you know some deep breathing and just kind of clear, you know, try to try to clear your mind and think about okay what, what are the top three things I need to accomplish for myself today. yeah and what are the steps, I need to take for that so today. Is your driver's license. And then the next step is to call 211 to see what resources they have or or get on the website and email them. What resources they may be able to get you connected to for some housing."
12240.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because we need to get, we need to get you in stable housing, as what we need to do even."
12240.0,Patient,One of the top priorities yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and then and then, if you want to look for some jobs or put some applications and certainly you know finances are the top priority to Alan so I want us to try to kind of stay focused on those things you know, food, food, shelter and you know."
12240.0,Patient,Employment yeah the essentials that's that you know I don't know that we can expand much past that at this point because.
527.0,Provider,"You need to have you need that security right now. Yes, okay. So do you feel like that's doable for for today and tomorrow. Okay."
12240.0,Patient,yeah I mean it has to be I can't what am I going to do you know.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah yeah. Good. Do you have to do you have food for today.
12240.0,Patient,um I here's the issue that i'm having I lost my wallet with my mvp card.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12240.0,Patient,"And I have, which means I have no way of withdrawing money because I also don't have my bank card, which means, I have to ask for food for my ex boyfriend and i'm sure he would be willing to pick up some groceries he said so last night so. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Well, when you get connected with two and one see if they have a food pantry close by that you can go get some groceries yeah."
12240.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you um."
527.0,Provider,yeah and then that way and have you have you gotten touch to get your abt card. reinstated.
12240.0,Patient,I have to do that today okay.
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so driver's license your abt card the 211 for housing and food or sources, and if you have time to start pulling some applications for jobs, but I think that's going to be enough focus for the next couple days at least."
12240.0,Patient,You.
527.0,Provider,"know, especially. With just trying to get in touch with people during business hours to for today and tomorrow yeah."
12240.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Because you can probably probably get some applications over the weekend, but other you know we're trying to get you connected with businesses, we need to do those that's priority for today and tomorrow. Before the weekend rolls around so okay. All right, any suicidal thoughts self harm homicidal thoughts are. Just no. Okay okay and you've still got your safety plan that we put together in crisis numbers okay. Okay, and I was looking I know we've got another appointment scheduled it looks like Ellen on November 10 at eight o'clock."

12240.0,Patient,"No, I get an email sometimes no I actually generally don't get a reminder."
527.0,Provider,"OK, I thought they usually. Okay, usually they said, like. A text message or. or an email, one of the things you might do Ellen I know some of my some of my people that i'm seeing they call the virtual clinic like Monday morning and just ask for what their appointments are for the week if they have any appointments for the. Week, and what the end and when their group is, and so I wonder if that might be helpful, just so that you just have to remember a week, at a time like here's here's my appointments. My group sessions and then i'll call the next week and get any appointments and group sessions, just as just as a reminder. So. That way that we can you know kind of helps you just stay on track for shorter, you know, a shorter time frame, then happened to remember oh gosh what do I have three weeks."
12240.0,Patient,From now so.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so I will see you, then, and if something comes up don't hesitate to reach out okay Alan but try those. and try that resource so see if we can get some housing and food resources for ya and and then go get your driver's license so Okay, and you stay safe all right Alan."
12240.0,Patient,Thank you very much. All right.
