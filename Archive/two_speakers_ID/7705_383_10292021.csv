7705.0,Patient,Hello. Hello just walk into get a glass of I mean a bottle water.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
7705.0,Patient,You caught me.
383.0,Provider,"Actually, I had just grabbed my tea, and I think I. left it over by where I put it, so let me go get that and I. with you."
7705.0,Patient,"Well then, i'm going to get something put my in mind, then. Water bottle."
383.0,Provider,Okay. How are you today.
7705.0,Patient,"Oh crabby. I haven't had my caregivers as God Monday. I think yeah. Also, can be gone all week and i'm not supposed to charge you for anything and i'm supposed to be happy about it."
383.0,Provider,"Well, send you up for being away did she do some things around the House and make sure that."
7705.0,Patient,"No, not enough. I missing when I need her for us really to make food for me and she couldn't make food enough for me, she made some kind of really half ass casserole that had. Steps it's not good for me to eat in it so i'm not eating that and she got some stuff at costco that's not really good for people on diabetes, because got too much carbs and stuff like that I can. So I don't know. Please we're. Back she doesn't like me to criticize her. because she can't be working for anybody."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm like you, maybe. That you do have a somewhat of a good working relationship and that she's for to seems like she hasn't gone away, she hasn't left."
7705.0,Patient,I know it's not.
383.0,Provider,A very high bar but.
7705.0,Patient,"yeah she's been working for me for six months now. But yeah I mean. it's not what I would think as a a really good job for me, but. it's really hard for me to get anyone, so I know i'm kind of stuck with her so and i'm also, I have to keep telling myself lucky I ever and."
383.0,Provider,So so so so lucky that you have someone come on.
7705.0,Patient,"I know, but I guess. i'm picky. i'm very picky and i'm too picky sometimes so I have to try to remember that too. But she she says that i've i've addressed this thing about this week, this is going to be gone for several times. Because I don't think it's appropriate that she shouldn't make use an image that she should get paid for hours she doesn't work, but she doesn't quite see it that way. The way she wants it. Is the way she is talking she wants to be treated like she's on a salary, rather than on someone that it's paid hourly which is not what she you know she was when she gets. So I just had to decide whether I can deal with that are not just remind myself when she complains that oh yes she's our she's sorrow is not. But that's what she wants she thinks that her job is so good, and she brings me so many added benefits that she's allowed to work, whatever she wants, for her hours."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well that's not the way that I mean this is when we talk about we know we're talking about boundaries. yeah setting the mean this is sort of like intellectual and intellectual work, this is a work related boundary you know she's actually stretching the boundaries and asking you to comply. Rather than accepting the terms of the position which has nothing to do with how you set it up right it's. About I just us, because I have worked for. governmental agencies, so I know what it what it is, and it is what it is it's not but she wants to make it, you know."
7705.0,Patient,"As you keep saying that you know other people other people that work for me wouldn't dye my hair she's dyed my hair a couple of times and that's not true, I know other people whose people dye their hair. But it is hard to get someone to work for what they get paid to do what I want them to do so that's why I have to keep reminding myself. But."
383.0,Provider,yeah. What do you think about. I mean she's asking you to stretch the. The way that the job is written and.
7705.0,Patient,"She says well you know i'm getting all the advantages, because i'm not working, I have the government, you know paying for her, and all this and then, I have a government paying for my food stamps and i'm so lucky so that I shouldn't be complaining and you know. What can you do with something like that yeah like i'm so lucky that i'm anxious able and I wasn't able to work all those years, and you know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah it sounds like she's sort of meddling in your personal business a bit it's not you know I mean this seems like an overstepping boundaries. In that regard, on her part as well to make comments about you know what you're benefiting from and then this and then I mean that's your personal business it's not."
7705.0,Patient,"You see what i'm saying that she but she thinks of it as her opinion and she's she's. I would think this is what i'm thinking I don't know she's actually said to me, but you know she's just telling me what her opinion isn't her opinion is basically that i'm getting you know get now this stuff for nothing. yeah I really feel she thinks that she's been saying that about my boyfriend she, that is, they getting all this stuff for free, you know, like. I got you to realize that we're not able to work right."
383.0,Provider,"So this seems it's almost like bordering on some a bit of an abusive commentary, I mean."
7705.0,Patient,This yeah but.
383.0,Provider,"This is a put down these are put down this is if she thinks these things she needs to. I mean, she has her job is in home supportive services to people who need help that can't. afford to pay for that on their own and based on certain criteria so that is her her her job. I don't know if me reiterating to this you this to us is helpful at all, but. she's really. stuck out of her boundaries."
7705.0,Patient,"It just makes me feel like i'm doing something wrong, and you know, maybe I am maybe I get close to people, or maybe I tell them too much so it's hard for them to not see what's going on, when they're here. You know i'm not trying to you know hide things from her i'm not trying to also tell her everything either. As soon as she does it the way she sees it, she tells me is that she's there to help someone's life and unless she can help the LIFE get better she doesn't want to be there, she listened. To work for people who want to improve and get better physically and for the food, I mean i'm nutritional and stuff like that, like she's supposed to be an expert and she's not. You know she claims she reads a lot, and she helps me with that which course is bullshit but you know that's how she feels that she's not there to you know clean and cook as much as she is there to. Just try to help improve and if i'm not in that position that should go look for someone I mean you know it's just I tell her I go, you know you're constantly talking to me like you're threatening me Kim oh. and work."
383.0,Provider,But yeah yeah. What was.
7705.0,Patient,"It took me after I finally got because I I didn't try to get it for years and years and years because I knew how hard it is to get people. And finally got to the point where I had to do something, because I just you know just can't do everything on my own. And it took me like a year to finally get someone and the first one only lasted a few times because she got injured working at some someplace else. So she stopped doing what I mean she was Jay gotta can share this stop working for me, she stopped working together the next woman stop. it's like six months later, a guy next one, and she stopped because we couldn't communicate because she only spoke Spanish. And I was trying to communicate with her daughter going, you know translating and I tried doing stuff on the Internet, you know that translated, but it just didn't work. So she is very long either so she's saying that you know it's because these women. You know just didn't want to do the job for me and that's not why it happened, but you know. The habitation is nothing really you could do a man I just need to. yell at some something every so often without killing."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think Susan maybe you know I mean, I would like to empower you to set some boundaries in this relationship, and it is a relationship it's a work relationship. And there's some real crossing the boundaries and she's really crossing her boundaries she's hired by ihs S, and you have been allotted a certain number of hours which she is paid to provide care and these various domains."
7705.0,Patient,"Right okay that's that's true. she's she doesn't use up all my hours irregardless she wouldn't barriers up all my hours because I just don't have enough stuff to keep her busy but yes, she is she is higher cheat you my hours she wouldn't use enough hours up but yeah she's hired ease my hours."
383.0,Provider,"Right, and that is her job she's chosen to do this, she has chosen to to take this as a livelihood for herself, now that it's a it's a professional relationship that you guys have and. she's overstepping her boundaries by by commenting about your life style or anything I mean she's a sound like she's sort of bullying you and the relationship has gotten the boundaries are sort of blurred because she's gotten maybe very friendly and she thinks she can kind of. call the shots and she's even asking to not work and still get paid, which is basically a fraud, you know that's not. fine print that's that's fraud you don't that's not, how do you rate. that's not the arrangement yeah now. If she's if she would were in a salary position that would be different, but she's not and that's that's just the square of the boundary that she doesn't want to it to be that way well sorry that's the way it is and."
7705.0,Patient,"I know that she'll leave me if I if I really came down on her or whatever or tried to discuss this, or you know set firm firm boundaries, where I would like to she will definitely leave me and I won't have anyone."
383.0,Provider,"Well, this is see Okay, so I just like to respond to that. there's a space in between what's going on now and then what what you just described as the outcome of her leaving there is a way Maybe you can have a conversation where would be like you know those hours you're going to be gone I would be. i'd like you to make up you know because. He."
7705.0,Patient,told her that.
383.0,Provider,yeah and and and.
7705.0,Patient,"came across. Oh, I did this extra and I do this extra it I don't write down all the hours, I do it is bullshit."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I sent, and that reaction entire internal internally for you, that says this is bullshit is. something you need to listen to, because it's like it's that it's her pushing into you and your boundaries like going, I mean she's. there's something that isn't honest about that and so there's something a communication method, called the broken record and it basically is to reiterate. Your need and you don't have to come down hard on it, you don't have to be you know if you don't do this and not nothing like that it's just to reiterate. i'd like those hours to be made up and maybe we need to keep track of your hours, so that you don't feel you know imposed upon and and I also get what I need because I really do need this additional you know this help so there's a way of it's called. as a way of communicating where you're you give a little bit, and then you ask you know, so the giving and that exchange would be you know I don't want you to feel. imposed upon or like you work too many hours so let's find a solution let's just keep real close track of your hours and you keep good track that you keep track of them and then i'll keep track as well, and you know some kind of. I mean this is sort of a way of maybe softening but this and reiterating I really. I will need you know those hours in some other way, because this isn't I mean I I understand how it'd be difficult for you to say, and this is not a salary job you're not the one to tell her that actually. Her supervisor and she does have a supervisor, because these positions they do you're not just going out there, doing. This without a supervisor she's got someone that she reports to and that person should be notified that she is trying to get away with. I mean, I would recommend you call and say you know just just let you know she's great in these areas, but she kind of such as going to take next week off and and I really need her here, or is there a substitute maybe that could come while she's gone. Please tell me. What well, I mean this is this is having this is."
7705.0,Patient,"Problem Solving no but but Okay, but have you dealt with people working for genesis."
383.0,Provider,If I dealt with it.
7705.0,Patient,Have you dealt with people working for genesis.
383.0,Provider,"I have worked with many people that work, not many, but several clients of mine in the past, at work for ISS and I, you know I."
7705.0,Patient,Use problems. i'm just curious about say one I just curious.
383.0,Provider,i'm.
7705.0,Patient,Only me to get some.
383.0,Provider,No i'm sure there's all kinds of different different flavors of these kinds of problems sometimes their family members that are getting paid to take care of their careers and there's that situation which sometimes gets very. Complicated right.
7705.0,Patient,i'd hate that too.
383.0,Provider,"But like I said, there is an office, and there is someone in charge, and I think that. You know if you're going to be without services for a week, you need to call them and say i'm going to be without services for a week is there, someone else you can do just to cover in the meantime as what's your what's your what's your workers name."
7705.0,Patient,"Well, I can't pronounce your name, so I call it to me that she wants me calling me now. I can tell you what Okay, I mean just knowing from. How it's worked before in the past, because there have been people all these different people are trying to find the people before. And they're just so happened to get somebody working for you that they really don't want to hear anything but if they give her anything. And she did say anything I mean with the with the virus and stuff done around it literally is there's no list that you can get me was it used to be a list. That was really half ass but at least got a list that you could get people, you can call up. I mean that we're willing to work, but I mean is very small, small list right now there is nobody on the list there's no one who wants to work because of the virus and stuff. I mean, because, like I said I tried for over a year to try to get somebody and it was it was just like impossible, so I you know I wasn't getting any help but that's fine I really don't want to lose her."
383.0,Provider,Sure sure right right.
7705.0,Patient,"To have that there'd be someone that could cover but they don't work that way just they just don't work that way that would be like a. They get people to come in and then, once the people come in they're hoping everything's happy, but they don't really. i've never heard of them, maybe they do, but i've never heard of them, you know coming in and mediating or anything or. You know, say they could provide someone else for errors it just you know they just don't have the hope to do that."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but do you sign off on the hours, do you have some do you do something to verify. The hours."
7705.0,Patient,The hours.
383.0,Provider,Okay okay.
7705.0,Patient,"I mean. This is it, they either say yes or no there's no in between, say they say yes you're pretty hours or no, you down."
383.0,Provider,For one week or for two weeks.
7705.0,Patient,Two weeks. At a time.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. well. I would tell her maybe if you're going to approve the hours you want the hours made up for when she's going to be gone. and
7705.0,Patient,"she's already been gone so I mean kind of too late for that one. You know, maybe I should have done that, before I tried to tell her before she left that she'd have to make up the hours without trenches going into the whole thing about you know she does this for me, she. Claims she doesn't like it, yes. hard to fight against something like that."
383.0,Provider,"Okay well one thing i'd like to say Susan is good for you for saying you need to make up these hours really good that was good, you said it you put it out there, and you voiced it so that's excellent."
7705.0,Patient,And it is a good and I can't make her do is it what is it.
383.0,Provider,"Well, you said it."
7705.0,Patient,or upset.
383.0,Provider,"You said it, you said it. And then you can request it, you can say you know next week and next time you see her you can say so will you be here Friday, a couple extra hours to make up for the hours that you weren't here yesterday."
7705.0,Patient,"Right we've already gone through all this over and over and over and then should get all mad and i'll get all mad and we'll talk about it, and we really don't come to an agreement and the next time we do it go through the whole thing all over again."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think at that point where, if you're if you're butting heads and you're getting angry and she's getting angry that. phone call to supervisor, at least, just to alert that you know you really like Mina and you know she's been great but you've been having a few problems and if somebody you know there's nothing wrong with asking if somebody can help I do this, all the time and I, I know you know I."
7705.0,Patient,"See, because when he first started, she was already, starting with the thing about not being the right hours and I left messages for all the different Councils, I have not even one of them called me back. i'm not in an all this time have I been able to you know say anything about the hours and stuff they only asked once a year. it's just ridiculous."
383.0,Provider,"yeah it is, is part of. Some unfortunate. You know just that people don't have integrity and the work that they do and. what's up, and you know people like you end up getting not getting the service that you should be getting. People not responding to your phone calls, but you know, often, you have to call over and over and leave messages over and over until somebody just gets tired of having you leave messages over and over and calls you back and tries to help you because. You know the squeaky wheel gets the grease So if you keep on sweeping people are going to want to."
7705.0,Patient,"yeah I just know what's gonna happen now is i'm just gonna be out without someone again. But I was out, I certainly can leave messages that I couldn't hurt me to do that."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I mean if it, how is she doing with regards to the basic things that you need to have done like getting your laundry done, and you know getting the food."
7705.0,Patient,"Yes. She does Okay, she doesn't do perfect she does great, but she does Okay, and I know that you know it's not like hiring someone that you. Completely pay and have total control over whatever Ashley is trying to please you, you know, I have to you know be willing, not to have it be perfect or even great so i'm willing to be habit be okay she does the laundry you know. She makes my South what I do is I have her make salads because she makes Korean food it's actually makes. So the only thing she does is like noodles and stuff so now, I just have to cut up stuff for SAS salads every day so that's what she does she was complaining about grocery shopping for five times a week she claims, so now because of you know, the expense for gas. And i'm not paying her gas, so I offer she said no, and they of course don't pay her death. But i'm just getting it through Amazon that groceries it's not it's not worth it. You know she can minor little things locally and then she doesn't have to go far. So we do have just. kind of like just been balancing things."
383.0,Provider,can't you just do one grocery shop a week I mean just one time per week and get all the things.
7705.0,Patient,"were different at the firm a couple of different stores and the way it's going, because I was using food stamps and then maybe we could do that, but now i'm gonna have to economize more so i'm probably going to have to. You know, not be able to get all the stuff I was getting before so i'm just gonna have to. I think you know getting it through Amazon doesn't bother me that much."
383.0,Provider,"isn't it much more expensive, though, to go through Amazon."
7705.0,Patient,"Not the stuff i'm getting is mostly like i'm selling stuff like you know, Greens and can so things like that so. It doesn't seem to be too bad. I mean if it gets worse i'll have her do it because she was she started out by going through most of the grocery shopping at grocery stores, but she's not very good also applying cheap either. So um."
383.0,Provider,"Do you go with her, or do you just let her do the grocery shopping."
7705.0,Patient,"Well, I I can't really go with her. yeah I worry is why went with her Wednesday to pass goes, and it was horrible because I couldn't get a an electric cart for the whole thing, so now she goes, but she won't go to costco for me anymore, even though it's cheaper and she won't do things where she has to. Carry heavy stuff as lot of stuff she won't do because she claims she can't do it or it's too heavy or she's gonna hurt her finger meanwhile i've got to do it, whether you know. and her hurts me or not, because it's got to be done right So what can you do with that one. So. As a challenge."
383.0,Provider,Well let's show we chat a bit about your sleep.
7705.0,Patient,"let's do that so much for. fun it's more about the musical. That when I can say, I actually went to."
383.0,Provider,i'm so proud of you.
7705.0,Patient,"I tried to get out of it, and I still went and I even bought the next season ticket."
383.0,Provider,You TIM. yeah that's great.
7705.0,Patient,"yeah I went my first one that I wasn't on heroin for four years, or something it was interesting I found I was very critical. Luckily, there wasn't anyone I was telling it to but it's very critical of the. musical, but I have fun."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good good so that's interesting for you to observe about yourself right you've got the part of you that has fun and joy and then there's the part that's critical. And certainly we can criticize things but. You know you just you have described being that sort of victim of criticism by your older sister and your mother, in the past."
7705.0,Patient,"I wasn't the kind of criticism, I was it was more like they had read in the hallway 10 the musical and I was just checking some of the ways that some of the choreography and stuff so it was it saying. Oh, they were horrible dancers, I just didn't like the way somebody it changed it changed it that's all."
383.0,Provider,I see okay.
7705.0,Patient,There was wonderful what they did. But.
383.0,Provider,"i'm so thrilled that you did you go fully by yourself, I mean did you have."
7705.0,Patient,About myself. to it.
383.0,Provider,What was that.
7705.0,Patient,"that's the way I usually go to it but myself. Really yeah I did have one woman sign up for tickets with me for two years, but most of the time I canceled so she didn't really go with me and we didn't sit together either anywhere, we had separate seats, but we should take that the bus up to get the APP paratransit up together. But yeah she doesn't talk to me anymore, and that is a building."
383.0,Provider,In the building.
7705.0,Patient,"yeah someone in the building couple doors down for me, but."
383.0,Provider,Oh really did you guys have a fighting or something.
7705.0,Patient,"No, not really she's that. she's just this was his gets a frantic For one thing, and I don't know how that how that affects things. nicely done a lot of medications and I know that she. She has a challenge with. Key keeping relationships, going so I don't know. You know if it's my fault her fall, but we didn't have any kind of big blow up or anything and she's still because she's so paranoid she kept thinking. that the reason I wasn't going was because of her and I kept saying no, no, you know I tell a true that every day with her, I just you know have really problem you know going out and doing stuff with them on drugs or not, you know. She is you know she is just she's just very paranoid person so. But anyway, it would have it, with whoever went with me so."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7705.0,Patient,I back to completely being by myself now.
383.0,Provider,well. it's still quite how you said it's been how many years since you've been to see a plane.
7705.0,Patient,"Well, I was going to a couple every season, but it used to be, that would go to all of them and then go to a couple more on top of it, so I used to go to like maybe a year, then it got down to maybe about three and then this season so far i've only seen one."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7705.0,Patient,"And this is the third one, the first one, I didn't see the second one was the reason I wanted to see it because it had staying in it, you know this thing is right."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7705.0,Patient,"yeah so is one that he had written, and so I guess make sure that chickens for about four years, starting at it for a while. call you know, seeing it with something like that, because i've never paid the money to go to a concert because it's cheap expenses wage expensive."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7705.0,Patient,But so that was really cool and so now these other ones now will be without stuff in me. So that'd be good.
383.0,Provider,that's so great Susan I think you're really making some some great strides how are you doing with your exercise and. You are walking trying to get out and do walking how are you doing with that.
7705.0,Patient,"yeah my exercises gotten really bad since the day that I have this shots and both arms I haven't quite recovered from that i've been trying to. i've been trying to do stuff but I haven't been able to get back up to where I was so like today so far i've only done one, and it was really hard for me to just like really sweating afterwards. I still have this thing where i'm sweating and I don't know why. So I tried to talk to everybody prescribed stuff but so far every Wednesday it's not them, so I. go in and see my main doctor so soon as she has."
383.0,Provider,yeah I think that's a good idea of an appointment coming up.
7705.0,Patient,"No, I have made it with her yeah just. Right now i'm taking a Class two hours a week on diabetes and I finished with that next week and then i'm going to start making more appointments again, so I have so many appointments, because I have you guys like two or three times a week, sometimes four and then. That was like twice a week I mean once a week for two hours so yeah five things so yeah I get like really bogged down so i'm trying to you know, keep getting more and more stuff taken care of so now i'm working on a dental part two. aspects to do."
383.0,Provider,Some dental work done.
7705.0,Patient,"yeah lot, unfortunately. yeah they said two crowns and pulling it to seven and deep cleaning. Which i've never had. I say. The first thing next week."
383.0,Provider,"So I want, I want to review some goals that we have set."
7705.0,Patient,Because.
383.0,Provider,"i'm and I kind of love to go over a lot of goals that we have been setting as a you know August, just to see where we're at."
7705.0,Patient,August wow.
383.0,Provider,"yeah I think I think that we've written down here, and then to you know, for you to work on and some of them resurface in different ways, so and then August we had. You were going to do, mindful coloring. Right and we're going to reinforce your commitment to sustaining your sobriety and recovery. So where are you at with committing to your sobriety and recovery."
7705.0,Patient,and I did do coke once in the last week. It as isn't that I didn't pretty good. yeah.
383.0,Provider,Okay um how often are you doing coke.
7705.0,Patient,I only did that one evening. And that was it.
383.0,Provider,Okay um. What is it like for you to voice that right now.
7705.0,Patient,"What do you mean what is that, like two voices as far as what did you do it anymore, I was doing it like taking it one thing at a time and try not to do it as much you know. And I I said to the person I did it with that I don't want to do it again so each time you know it's getting less and less. And the last time I did it with crack at this time I just did cocaine. So that was a teensy bit more helpful."
383.0,Provider,Okay. um well let's keep working on committing to sustaining your sobriety. Okay.
