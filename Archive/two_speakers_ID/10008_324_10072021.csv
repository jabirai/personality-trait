324.0,Provider,"worth a lot to get behind your appointment, but but that's not a problem."
10008.0,Patient,You want to be scheduled miss Camille.
324.0,Provider,I sure don't our I absolutely do not. we're gonna have our appointment because you showed up today and i'm happy to see you and i'm going to tell me that you showed up today.
10008.0,Patient,"Okay, well, we got. About a half hour."
324.0,Provider,Okay. How are you doing.
10008.0,Patient,"i'm doing well. Things are going a little up and down but. I just have to whether, through them, I just figure. There is what it is. Some way to just keep moving forward."
324.0,Provider,Our things for what you're portraying.
10008.0,Patient,"Well, I. fired the lawyers that was just charging me money and keep giving me different lawyers. So I think it's on the 15th so I took another I just took it public defender trying to get my money back up with 3500 bucks. or something out of it, I don't think i'd signed electronic things if I didn't sign anything in I had an agreement with them. So, taking the Small Claims court in a pretty short and get over money but. i'm just i'm waiting for them to move their hand they they they said they would send me a bill of everything and I don't see it come to me and i've been kind of checking and i'll check it again today. So they haven't sent that yet. That i've noticed the invoice saying that they charge 400 bucks an hour. And, of course, six hours of the 24 and books. So to say, maybe you get something back, but she said, I signed some digital's thing and I thought I did too, but there's an email, I have here says, please sign this thing it's important. and I don't recall son, but i'm going to have to ask her to send me a copy of anything that I signed digital stuff in the network tell me right away i'm sure she'll have to do the building department. But that's where that is now the Court date I think his own 15th 25th of the 15th somewhere. One of those dates and I got a public defender. That guy who's pretty good public defender. that's where that is I lost the place, because it is case. At a place and we're in city, but because they some kind of way they it's on my record, even though it's just it's not even just I didn't been a trial or anything. So that kind of. makes me wonder, am I going to have to go through a whole bunch of rigmarole I got a section eight. So."
324.0,Provider,Are you selling points like the hotel.
10008.0,Patient,"yeah that yeah they can't put do anything until I get a place. I have a section eight now I have 90 days to find a place. And then, if I don't find one with the 90 days before 90 days is for a 60 day extension. So. Maybe sometimes just won't do the background check this other place did I don't know what. But that came up that kind of bothers me a little bit that I might not be able to get a place, because no one will read to me with that kind of a thing weapons and drugs. That seems like a. Higher hurdle hurdle. So. that's where I am with that kind of stuff. Other things are going on to personal things but. I just got through all this stuff and just."
324.0,Provider,how's it. around the corner.
10008.0,Patient,"i'm adding the episodes or anything like that. Sometimes I just did my imagination wonder, and I know it's my imagination. I noticed my message. But it's nothing like. people trying to hurt me or anything like that. You know. it's good my good my. Good that urine test."
324.0,Provider,Oh.
10008.0,Patient,"I mean it's it was tested a little while back, but no."
324.0,Provider,I haven't seen you.
10008.0,Patient,"it's been a few weeks, or so I guess. I tried to get in last time I guess. For one meeting and I couldn't get in they couldn't hear me I couldn't hear them. I think it was a group to where I didn't need to check in some kind of just in one."
324.0,Provider,Other thing. i'm sort of marijuana everything. I.
10008.0,Patient,"told you, I told you that. And don't worry about it. Or, yes, but no, I have. It something that I really gotta get a grip on. it's been a few months now, I think. And I just want to get more. Time. In between the last use. so that I can really have some clear clarity. stink better. And a lot going on, you know so much going on with his name, he thought i'd be pushed back against the wall I. you'd asked me a couple years ago so there's no way. To. How."
324.0,Provider,"How how's your movie in. Your room, as far as you know, you know."
10008.0,Patient,What was.
324.0,Provider,It can be. depressive symptoms and excel former suicidal thoughts.
10008.0,Patient,"It oh no nothing like that no. It can be. angry thoughts I guess a couple times. I just try to stay. Trying to. make myself understand. That I shouldn't go. In certain rooms. Whether it's drug use. Having arguments with people getting involved with other things that's really not my business. people tend to come up to me, for whatever. They came up the other day told some girls stole his backpack and i'm going. I didn't even know he was talking about. Was you know those continue. To try to deflect those things. If you're in this motels that you know people walk around it is cruising around and they don't stay or anything, and you know what they're up to no good you. know that. But i'm trying this page there was my surroundings and stay stay out of the mix. keep my mood. Keep magazine and check I gotta be able to know when they use magazine when not to use it. When they kick somebody's ass. Quick walk away from it, and when not to do it i'm going to jail."
324.0,Provider,"aren't you well that's we're trying to stay out, are you sleeping."
10008.0,Patient,"yeah i've been seeking fairly well yeah. I got a bit early. A little later than I used to go and but then I wake up about 435 o'clock in the morning, which isn't bad because both ready to go outside, even though I don't go for another couple of hours. But i'm starting to. starting to get up earlier and didn't exercise starting to. feel the feel the burn been just stretching a little bit, so it makes me more eager to do it more. Until I pull a muscle or something. Then of course it's all stop. But."
324.0,Provider,What about your appetite you're cooking and.
10008.0,Patient,"it's this it gets old because you know it's just a little hot plate. That little toaster thing so refrigeration is almost nothing that I do every situation and grief there keep things cool. But I can't really. You know cook liked I liked be able to cook a couple courses have a few things. couple burners on still working cook it was really a turning. You know, but my appetites it's okay one last little way. But this call me just."
324.0,Provider,When you're exercising.
10008.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and nothing i'm not exerting myself from that but i'm just kind of stretching a little bit just making doing some moves like TAI Chi almost you know that kind of just. A federal stuff but it's it's just an exercise it's a mental thing too. So focus on what i'm doing taking both been working with him i've been training every day to sit come and stay down. i've been going over those with him for the past. Almost week now couple of times a day I get some treats. And he's he's getting a little better. To have to take him out and i'm trying to do that three or four times a day. Once in the morning, maybe branch in in luncheon in once when I see. My no time before. You know, we come this coming before God will that's going to be changing really quick. yeah so i'm trying to do their. main thing is try to give me a place to get a place this. That was so one of my main thing is once I get my own place, I can get my stuff out of storage starts with 350 bucks every month. I guess maybe we'll need to try to do. Get just dawned on me to get rid of a lot of stuff to score near and toss everything I haven't used and. Except for my tools just get rid of it. And then, instead of get a half size place. least 450 something you could. squeeze everything into smaller place I got a 10 by 10 I think by by 10 or something like that."
324.0,Provider,here. Appointment yes.
10008.0,Patient,"yeah. I he canceled I didn't cancel it was there, he he didn't check in. So it was."
324.0,Provider,Marketing with a double booked the appointment and they have.
10008.0,Patient,That little words.
324.0,Provider,In there.
10008.0,Patient,"So whatever I saw him and I gotta go back in and do that. go in and make another. going to do that so i'm trying to do that today. get that done. been going down to this garden and we're in sitting watering. And I got something else to it, one, so I wanted to get down you're trying to get down to. Maybe just one o'clock appointment one last to know. it's just things is just going really, really bad. Nothing is. Quite. I mean I got about you, but. People not going to read to me if they do this background check we just not written. songs thinking what isn't it turns out that. keep looking keep looking to guess. Maybe somebody won't do a background check, who knows. Maybe 90 days, yes."
324.0,Provider,"I would definitely. always say take it literally one step at a time, one day for. You have 90 day year month day."
10008.0,Patient,to supply myself.
324.0,Provider,Every day right okay very.
10008.0,Patient,"Good and weightless something. So yeah there's three new places that opened up, I think, in public housing so that's different from section eight is public Council, so, if I can get a place, I can get place I don't know where they take a third of your income. which would be about 300 bucks a month. Which is about the same with they would they do fit. The you would pay for section eight it's about the same somewhere in the same with them. So it's not whichever comes first, so you have to take one day at a time it's good to remember that. And just to keep getting stronger means capable week."
324.0,Provider,"Another thing to you well yeah right what you just said, you said you're exercising so that's definitely going to keep you strong physically mentally. and Another thing too yeah and it is virtually. and spirituality. It I know it sounds easier said than done, but positive you know, trying to think positive. yeah you know the. Any anything positive. Positive affirmations telling yourself. You know I have 90 days to find. ways and i'm going to."
10008.0,Patient,"i'm going to get through them in and find it right, this this this case. or whatever. Whatever it may come that I have to do. are charged with the whatever the outcome is, I still gotta figure i'm going to be able to get through this. I gotta think positive. paradigm change it to the ballpark. i'm overwhelmed with knee pain all my money out eating money. No money, so I have to get a job. it's this work. didn't want to, I want to get my contractor's license so I gotta get this. Tackling each mission thing together. So niche overwhelmed."
324.0,Provider,"I say you. And I know you talk with you know me and many about that, before. i'm. Going goals you know, right now, things are a little."
10008.0,Patient,"Much do I must do that that's one thing I gotta do every day just give me a tablet I think we don't try to put it on the on the phone and stuff and get attended just keep me a notebook with me. things to do the day and you know least a couple days or so week ahead of time that I fix it myself from things that we view them at nine says okay we're back to do. It in Parliament, trying to move forward. But don't give up and getting. Difficult right now, Miss cummings."
324.0,Provider,"and I are here to. You know, support you, we worry about you when. You know."
10008.0,Patient,"It is so easy for me to just let it go, you know. it's easy and then then sometimes it's not live consciously letting it go. There so don't read it down and keep it in my head. So, like i'm talking about doing now to make sure it hit me. To do list. into."
324.0,Provider,"And if you make, if you make that list of. Everything. But categorize it. I draw a line down a little long term. goals are things that you know I don't have to get done today or next week, but. You know, maybe like within a year type of things and then, on the other side are my short term goals. You know, for example, housing. I would definitely put that on the short term side you know, this is something that I need to work on now. And then, as you go. You know, between either one check it off. and keep going. But like I say it's literally one day at a time is not overnight you're already moving in the right direction, you know. I can say. No substance use. You know, I think, once you get this court case."
10008.0,Patient,I think so.
324.0,Provider,That. would take her. You know that would be a big relief off your shoulders to.
10008.0,Patient,do not know what I have to do that.
324.0,Provider,"Right, and right now it's kind of just lingering."
10008.0,Patient,to know.
324.0,Provider,yeah so you're kind of level with the court case.
10008.0,Patient,"But that is a short term thing. But it's making sure i'm making my court appearances and. Whatever I need to the Lord. I need to try to get my money back, so I need to go to the small claims court. And I was going to do before and, if I have to send them a bill, and once they don't respond to the bill, then I fell small claims court another procedure gotta be there. Spending 3000 bucks back man. That would really. make a big difference to. sister have some money backing in my account. been a lot of money, but I used to have that kind of money three or 4000 bucks. Now i'm done anathema. To get a job short term goals. That have find some sort of world peace, decent. It. Is keep moving forward."
324.0,Provider,"And you can do it. You know what is coming. To the group. Everyone is there to you know help support each other. But. If you're listening everyone, everyone is going through some different you know. yeah. Actually. No purpose of. Supporting."
