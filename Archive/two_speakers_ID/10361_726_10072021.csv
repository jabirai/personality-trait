726.0,Provider,"Do, but I think. Now don't quote me on this, but I think it's the same medication that you're already on for pain management, but what I would, I would ask about the virtual clinic. To see if they can how that works, because they do have pain management. And if that's something that like. That you feel like that would be helpful for you out definitely. try to get involved into that. Because you're already doing all the stuff that people in the pain management clinic do they do groups, they do the meditation groups that that we already. do so it's not it's really not different from what you're already doing."
10361.0,Patient,yeah that's what I figured.
726.0,Provider,yeah. how's your pain levels.

726.0,Provider,"When you talk to virtual clinic ask them about the the pain management group if. You feel would help be helpful or beneficial. Because you could you could even talk. see if they can do like a doctor review. and see if it would be a good fit for you. And then I would also. You just you have a page Q nine I think yeah a pH Q nine that's on that says that it's overdue so when you end up talking to virtual just ask them to send it to you, so you can do that.
