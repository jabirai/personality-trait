383.0,Provider,hi.
6008.0,Patient,How are you are you. i'm doing good how about yourself.
383.0,Provider,"pretty good thanks. So we had a limited amount of. Time today yeah. want to get to some things right away. Okay, I, I am wondering, I know you had some oral surgery that that you were did you did you get that accomplished and in August."
6008.0,Patient,"Yes, I did so, I know I had a call with Tracy. Dr Tracy Jackson yesterday, and she was concerned, because of the last time we talked and how I missed two sessions and in a group last week. But I did explain to her that I did call in the first time that I missed with you, I wasn't feeling well and then this last time that I missed, I was in I was in I was. admitted into the hospital from Sunday to Wednesday, so what had happened is before my oral surgery I I got this infection called CD and that made me really sick. And then. I finished on a biotic and then like literally a day after I had to start taking the antibiotic for my gum surgery which messed up my stomach again and that's what landed me in the hospital on Sunday, I believe was the. The 13th. It might be the 13th not this past Sunday, but the Sunday before that, and my white blood cell count was super high so they didn't want to let me go and then, when I got when I know we had an appointment scheduled, so I made sure to call in. I made sure to call in like in I was telling Dr Jackson that to like you know they have the recordings and I had told him I was in my hospital gown I. You know I wasn't feeling well. and driving right now, I still have. I can't return back they told me, I can return to work for two weeks. i'm feeling a lot better this week, but I was still feeling, really, really sick even this past week, so I just wanted to let you know that too. So I did tell Dr Jackson and she did give me my medication for the month and and she understood and in you know, believe me, because I told her to send the doctor's note to you guys to let you know, like. If that it is, it is true."
383.0,Provider,So i'm so sorry i've been going through all of that that's. Really hot.
6008.0,Patient,"Thank you, I know I I honestly I feel like yeah the reason why I got so bad to was because. You know, I have a lot of things to do and i've already felt bad about having to miss work like when my kids are sick and stuff so. You know I tried my best, even though, like last week I didn't attend group the but the week before that. I still tended group, even though it was only for 30 minutes, but I wasn't feeling well and I was at work, so I think I pushed my body too hard, like, I really need to. Like take care of myself in this and you know prioritize That, too, I feel like sometimes I don't do that because of everything that I have to do, I feel like i'm failing people, and I feel like that's the reason why it got so got so bad as well."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well, it also sounds like the recommendation to take those antibiotics after you've already been. Taking antibiotics was probably not not the best."
6008.0,Patient,"right that he did that's exactly what they said, but they said, like. There was no other option, because I have to go on antibiotics regardless, but maybe that the surgery could have been pushed back. So they wouldn't have to have gone on that again and they didn't even know like if this C diff have had gone away like prior to my thumb surgery, because I didn't go get tested. Again, because I had the surgery, you know and then that to like I had to get the grocery surgery done. In August, like before the end of the month, because I have pushed it back so much because the work and. I have, like our this month that work like this is when we start doing our enrollments and we're on the phone so much that I had to like be okay to. To not that they told me at work like you have to get it done like we need you to talk come September nothing but that's what I was thinking like I need to make sure that I get it done so that I can still meet all my work requirements on time so yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know, looking back at it, looking back at the whole thing. you're saying I needed to prioritize myself my health. A little bit more. yeah, how do you think you would have done it differently."
6008.0,Patient,"So I think that um prior to the Sunday that I got admitted, I was already feeling sick towards the end of my antibiotics I finished my on a biotic on either Wednesday or Thursday of that that week. and I started already feeling sick and I had told my supervisor like I feel like i'm getting the symptoms again of what I had. And I had asked, like, I think that what I would have done different is just. had gone into either the emergency room because I already knew the symptoms. Instead, like I started taking probiotics which completely made me stop using the restroom and then that Sunday, I said, you know I haven't gone to the restroom since Wednesday and I like me to try to make myself go and that's when like I started having. You know my bell bell movements again and immediately I got a fever and stuff, so I think what I would have done is just really paid attention that week and gone to get you know my doctor's attention at that time and got in tested but. To be fair, I did do that. Because I did call that Wednesday and let them know that I was feeling sick but or Tuesday Tuesday or Wednesday. But what they require me to do is they, they have me go like checking into the hospital, you know get the little tube and the things i'm going to need, and then I come home and do the test, and then I go take it back to the hospital and then they call my doctor with the results and. I feel like I didn't have time to do that, but I could have made time. To definitely do that you know, but also because I was taking the probiotic I wasn't I didn't feel like I had to go, so I thought Oh, maybe this help that and maybe you know, but I definitely would have paid attention and not try to get rid of the problem in a different way. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"um did you get tested for coven. Yes, I did get to say it was. It had nothing to do with that."
6008.0,Patient,"No, I was, I was negative."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well, I think that you know prioritizing your health is it's hard to do when there's a lot of demands on you. mm hmm but it's so important, so that you can do life, you know."
6008.0,Patient,mm hmm great.
383.0,Provider,"Health we can't pick up the phone we can't. So just. I can see, you were trying to juggle so many things and and deal with your health but keep other things in mind like your work, responsibilities and when that needed to be done and. You know. Maybe what you learn from this is that if you're having health issues, you know they just really need to be considered and you need that consideration."
6008.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah definitely I agree. I thankfully like i'll be done with my medication today and. i'm still i'm going to follow up and make sure that I know that you know I test negative and. I guess like the thing is really it's highly contagious i've learned that from this is like my third time, I think that I got it and I know that it's really contagious but. You know, being in the hospital kind of opened my eyes to how serious it is, and you know they explained it different than my thought then my you know regular doctor did and. I I I know for next time I I definitely learned, I think that. yeah I think that I just have a lot sometimes and maybe that was assigned to like. You know, slow down, and you know if you don't take care of yourself. You know these things can happen."
383.0,Provider,um. So. So see def is that something that is contagious is that what you're talking about is being contagious.
6008.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. gosh well i'm not a doctor, so I don't, how do you think that you can track it that."
6008.0,Patient,"i'm a woman, so when I got discharged um. I. So, to be honest, I felt a little bit of pressure like from a supervisor because i'm. Like the first time that I got it and I was telling her like that I think it was safer for me to like work from home. You know she she was kind of like pushing it and kind of seeing like well, you were already here, you know these last days like like kind of not believing me, you know, so I so i'm. i'm sorry What was your question, I was going to go way off."
383.0,Provider,track.
6008.0,Patient,"Oh okay so yeah so they were telling me like. at work like Oh, maybe it's like you not. You know brushing your nails when you wash your hands or you know what you're eating like maybe it's the coffee like they were trying to tell me things like that, like kind of picking up what like they see me doing but. I specifically asked the discharge doctor at the hospital like what am I doing something wrong like what is it can I do different. Is it what i'm eating or like, how can I avoid this, and they said, there is no way to know what how exactly it happened, the first time. We do know that it definitely like like kind of brought it back are fired it up again because of the antibiotic that you took for your gum graft but um what they save like. They didn't tell me like a specific thing they didn't even see like they just said, people come in and get it it's not very like it's not a often thing, but when we do get these cases like there's no way of telling. What what it is, is just a bacteria that that um that stays in your stomach."
383.0,Provider,Right right well what a what a miserable experience of having doctors and you've been through a lot. Maria you know.
6008.0,Patient,"yeah I tried to I keep in mind like what you say, because I think so often I dismiss like what I go through, and I know, last time you told me like. kind of like slowing down in in understanding what I went through and like really taking that in because I feel like. Often, since I was little everything that happened in my life I would be like Oh well, that just happened like you know forget about it, like you're really went through it forget about it, but I do try to think like. You know, even though I like people might not believe me, of how like i'm really feeling, or if i'm feeling sick like I still have to be true to myself and and know that i'm. i'm saying the truth, and this is how I feel and I I I just have to have that trust in myself like you know you're you know you're doing the right thing, so there's nothing else, that you can do instead of like. Pushing myself to like make someone, believe me, or or you know anything else so."
383.0,Provider,"Did you not get really believed when you were sick when you were. growing up, did you got. Really any attention around. Not feeling well when you were growing up."
6008.0,Patient,"um no I think like anytime that I got sick my mom was Oh well, yeah my mom was very like. She made sure I went to the doctor see me to, even if I threw up one night, she would take me to the emergency room right away. Just to make sure that I was Okay, and even till now she's like that with my sister like she she says, you know we have health insurance, I can afford to take it to the doctor, so why not do that, but. When I was growing up with my mom my step dad I mean i'm sorry my dad and my step mom they wouldn't, believe me, like when I would say I would get sick, she would say that I was lying to go to like to go to not go to school, and when I was sick, she would try to send me off. To my grandparents house or my mom's house, because she don't want me to get my half brother sick because he was little. So those are things that I remember that that happened."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well you're very resilient I mean you're. you're kind of amazing you can go through a lot of stuff and still have a smile on your face and get to work and try and you know do and do all the things you need to do so, you have there's a good side to that you know you're very resilient. yeah The thing is that is it really important, though, is that you, you know you do listen to yourself, and like you said you do. honor your own needs and. advocate for yourself. yeah you're not feeling well and so i'm glad you I had gotten a message from Tracy about your. absences and her concern and I let her know that I knew, you were going to do, you had an oral surgery coming up in August and that that was maybe maybe it hadn't something had happened or and it didn't go, you know. You weren't able to meet your appointments because of that so i'm glad you were able to talk with her and give her more details."
6008.0,Patient,"yeah yeah Of course I told her like I definitely like you understood when she talked to me last time, and I make sure that I call it, you know what i'm going to start doing even screenshots when i'm maybe on. Like talking to one of the care navigators I don't like they sent you to to to a different place for. For different things like there's two zoom zoom ideas that you can call into so I don't know if it's like Tracy said something about it being like lack of. documentation on their part, maybe on there, like she said on our part, she didn't say there you know she she took. She took like kind of responsibility for that, because of them, but. She just said, like maybe with something that had to do with that I told her yeah because I made I made sure like this the program has helped me a lot and. I told my boyfriend that to like and he remembers like a year ago, before I got into this program how like sometimes I couldn't get out of bed, and like I would have no energy I didn't want to do anything on the weekend, but stay home. So it was it was I was in a very dark place and I don't know what would have happened if I kept continuing doing what I was doing like it was. I was taking too much pain medication, I was I just was it was just too much, and I don't even know what I was thinking at the time, you know and. I do, I do. I do think that i'm resilient I think that i've been through a lot in my life, so I don't try to blame myself for things you know that I did I I try to see it as like. You know, different people cope differently and. considering all the trauma and and abuse that I had growing up like I. I really don't know where I would be if I didn't have my kids you know my kids make me want to do better, like, I want to have a good future for them, I want to make enough money to provide for them to go to university that they want to want to go to if that's what they want to do I. You know I they give me like. A reason to live and throughout my journey I i've learned to love myself as well and. Be proud of my accomplishments and in how I am as a mother today. So often, I don't think that I did that for myself, so I think that the program has helped me a lot like even when I talk to you, I really look forward to it and I just I feel like it helps me it helps me very much."
383.0,Provider,"i'm so glad Maria and i'm thrilled that you're that you have experienced all of these, you know that you can see, you know what what better place, you are now than you are and. I have seen people not not deal with their mental health and and and let it slip and you know people, so you know I know people can continue in that dark place it can NUTS i'm so glad that you're not in that place anymore. And that you can recognize. All of your strengths and build on those. yeah so we do have an appointment next Tuesday I don't know. But that's coming up, basically, you know one it's another 30 minute appointment. Do you want to keep that appointment or do yeah. Okay, so then."
6008.0,Patient,we'll do it.
383.0,Provider,that's next Tuesday and we can get kind of more into. If you wanted to talk about with your something like that you want to kind of get more in depth with.
6008.0,Patient,"yeah i'm actually right now my kids father, with my old my oldest two kids keep them Emily. He was so he's been in prison for the past like year and a half, I believe I became in contact with him because. My kids my daughter, especially started crying and I think she missed them and she wanted to talk to him, it was causing her anxiety and. I didn't I don't know like what's the right thing to do, I you know he's had a lot of drug abuse and and alcohol abuse problems and he just got released on Sunday and. You know he's calling them and I told them like to not let them know anything of like what he's doing or because I don't want to call them any worry my daughter worries a lot about him like making sure that he eats and. Making sure that he's okay I don't know why so that's something that I wanted to talk to you about to see like to let you know more of like how the relationship is right now what was going on before and like, how can I move forward for something that is healthy for them."
383.0,Provider,How old is your daughter.
6008.0,Patient,she's eight.
383.0,Provider,Oh she's so young. and How is it that your ex has their number to be texting them and so.
6008.0,Patient,"Oh well, he has my my number that they don't have a phone, but the reason is that, when she started having those. Those problems asking about him she hadn't talked to him in over a year and a half and. I decided to talk to him, first, so I reached out to his dad and his dad was able to give them my number, and he called me, so I made sure that I establish a connection with him first before jumping in in. Like here talk to them, so I wanted to see where he was at like mentally and and what he was thinking of like talking to them about and stuff so. He seemed to be okay, you know he he apologized for things that he even did to me like that he's never apologized before and I kind of was hesitant to. Like let them talk to him, but I just don't that's where I wanted to ask you, because I don't know like what like what to really do I don't want to come in between their. relationship I don't want one day to that for them to tell me like you knew he knew he was in in the police, he was. He could have talked to is how come you didn't let me talk to him, like What could it caught what damage would it cost me like I don't want I don't want them to like feel resentment from like me, being in the way of. Of even though I know. Like I could tell them, you know the reasons, later on, but I just I just don't know what to do right right."
383.0,Provider,"Right so so your your daughter's age and your son is how old. don't really young. I definitely would not have I mean he's someone with obviously with pretty big problems, I mean he. hadn't used problem, and he was in prison. and I think that did they does he have direct access to them via text. to talk to you for."
6008.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. call me first and then i'll let him know. Whether they're available to talk, because you know they they do go to sleep at a certain time and if he called over that time good yeah because he contacts me first."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good good, well, I would set up maybe a structure around that maybe say you know let's let's have it be like on Sundays that you call or something like that so it's not just like random like oh calling now like because they're they're going to get."
6008.0,Patient,escalated you know.
383.0,Provider,"When they're going to get triggered you know when the calls come in, so if there's something like that is structured on the weekend, when they have some downtime. And maybe you can encourage your ex if there's going to be this communication, because this could probably lead to Oh, and I want to have a visit. yeah any court order mandates regarding visitation and that kind of thing."
6008.0,Patient,"No he failed to go like he actually filed the paperwork to gain some custody or visitation and he didn't show up twice, so the judge the last time we we went he didn't show up the last time, so he. The judge was pretty upset and he said, you know you were right, this was a waste of time and you know, the next time he comes in, because he always have the right to come in. And file to see them but it'll be a lot harder for him to gain anything because he's showing us that he doesn't want to do anything. Responsible yeah. So yeah i'm. Sorry i'm glad you brought that up because I did um because he was in the place, he was at it was he couldn't call. Like at a certain time because that's what originally wanted him to do, I wanted it to be consistent, because they're used to him being so. inconsistent so there's 10 now that he's out I did text them, and I say like I really need a schedule of like when you'll be calling them because they should have a routine around it."
383.0,Provider,"So i'm going to have to get going, because I have a group and 11 but I you don't want you, you can lay down this he's. shown himself to be not responsible didn't show up so you're the you don't want you don't need to ask him what is your schedule, you can tell him. I would like let's have these meetings or calls happen on the weekend at a specific time good times for us, and maybe give him two choices are Sunday afternoon or Saturday morning, or whatever. And then you can make those choices. So that you stay in the driver's seat. Because because you're the responsible party so."
6008.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"Thank you, man talk about that further on Tuesday."
6008.0,Patient,"Okay we'll do. I look forward to it Thank you so much. Have a good day. Okay, you do."
383.0,Provider,Okay bye bye.
