Both moved to New York and the beginning of HR at the end of August, so I got a new roommate who was also a friend i've known for a long time. But then there was only two of us so didn't make sense to stay in a three bedrooms we just had to do the whole apartment hunt through San Francisco which is like. A specific route all experience. Where they like show you shoe boxes and then are like this is gonna be all of your money. or like lying about neighborhoods they're like this is not feeling like this is the tender, those are.

I think i've experienced a lot of like life changes like I feel like i'm in a new season with like a new apartment i'm living in I went through. A breakup which was sad but also in other ways, like really relieved and exciting to like be single again so like I think there's been like a lot of life changes. Which isn't to say that there hasn't been like big mood swings, but I think they've all been like very appropriate for the things that are happening. So I think, for the most part, like all my from my day to day i've been feeling like more stable than I have been in some months."
