15150.0,Patient,"and So I don't even know how to fix that I don't know.

79.0,Provider,"The body dysmorphia lt. yeah have they talked to you about the body dysmorphia that bdd mm hmm it's real it can be a real problem. And you, you know you've mentioned quite a few things you know that you are aware of i'm in these meetings with me the way we generally do it is we set a goal some kind of goal like you know I want to be able to you know, have a statement that I can tell myself like you know. eat you know eat the food and the food is going to do good things in your body just be able to repeat that to yourself, while you're eating to try and."
15150.0,Patient,calm.
79.0,Provider,"So you have less spinning now or that you can eat more. But we create a goal, and then you work on it for a week and then kind of return and report. So that's kind of have a nutrition sessions go. And we work on a meal plan so I I give you like a meal plan that says Okay, you need to eat this. And this and try and do that for a week and then let's talk about it next week. Does that. sound good or what yeah like."
15150.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's good, because I know like for breakfast lunch, we can make what we want and like so they buy stuff they. Do I don't like to do dinner a lot, because sometimes like to grow other girls make dinner, and they really don't know how to like make healthy food and they make it like. You know so sometimes I don't want to eat it unless I took right like when it comes like doing like i'll eat dinner with everybody if it sounds like because I can eat salad and I can eat. Most of the time, like, I can eat that and I can swallow it all, and I want to go through it and i'm fine yeah that's the stuff I can eat if it's if it's like vegetable salad definitely that I usually keep it down you maintain that isn't anything else I don't."
79.0,Provider,"Care yeah that's stressful. And so it's a constant battle yeah. yeah let me get a little bit more, I need a little bit more information on your symptoms. So can I ask you, some of the symptoms physical questions. So do you have any you know temperature regulation problems when you like get really hot when other people aren't hot are really cold or you stay cold Gemini temperature regulation issues."
15150.0,Patient,I think so yeah like okay. I don't know if that's because my medication like. But I do get hot does it get cold.
79.0,Provider,"And that is a lot of times that's inadequate eating. Okay, and what about your skin, do you have like easy. bruising or any you know just anything with your skin if, like okay that's not probably not good."
15150.0,Patient,I don't think so.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, how about your hair, do you feel like your hair is doing Okay, or is it falling know or have you had time periods, where it has kind of fallen out. No okay um and how about just when you stand up, do you ever get dizzy. or kind of get black spots are a lot."

79.0,Provider,that's a lack of nutrition mm hmm.
15150.0,Patient,Oh really okay.
79.0,Provider,I got it.
15150.0,Patient,I got it but.
79.0,Provider,"No it's yeah you don't have enough nutrition so it's having a hard time hoping all your veins it takes a lot of energy, when you stand up your veins have to go to go whoop. and create some blood pressure so that the blood doesn't pool you know, in the lower parts of your body when you shift because gravity is pulling on you. and your veins respond kind of opposite action to try and keep the blood up and if you don't have enough nutrition you're not eating enough. It doesn't do that for you and you get dizzy because all the blood rushes down."
15150.0,Patient,So oh. Okay.
79.0,Provider,"yeah that could improve with eating more and how about men Caesar your period I don't know if that's ever gone away, sometimes we don't eat enough mentees goes away the periods go. or become."

This is so powerful Rania it's it's amazing and you have started, I would say, actually your attitude I think your attitude you're not at a one you're giving you're shortchanging yourself. Because you have this really powerful desire here, you really, really do so I think you're here. I think you're there okay. Let me do. yeah, so I think you're actually more like a three. I mean not a three I think what we need to talk about. is to get you to a three what's going to get you from two to three, you know, is it. Know what's going to happen here do you need to practice saying positive statements about yourself, and do you need to. You know, give yourself just like a little hug squeeze or a stretch, you know doing sometimes doing kind of stretching can help and go hey my thought is all. Right, you know the brain is powerful the brain can change what it thinks about and how it thinks about things."
15150.0,Patient,Really.
79.0,Provider,"yeah totally. yeah, what do you think what would make you move a little. bit more towards feeling happy, you know about."
15150.0,Patient,"You know about your way and not having to worry about ad. Because I have to ask people every day like if I look fat or not, and I don't know."
79.0,Provider,And they're probably why would you stop in Italy. yeah.
15150.0,Patient,"And it's like my mom teach my guys you asking that one more time she's like shut up like. everybody else like you're not but if I believed it like and ultimately it doesn't matter how many times somebody tells me that i'm fat or not fat like I don't believe it like I believe. That I mean. starting to get a little bit more reassurance, because I know like I was. Like everybody everybody else told me like when I was out there and, as I mentioned before I came in here, I was too skinny and I lost him doing that I know, based on how much they weighed like that I was like either way and i'm sure I might still be a little bit under wait for like."
79.0,Provider,yeah. yeah I don't believe you do have they do have a logical part of you it's just maybe allowing that logical part of you to.
15150.0,Patient,"be like a bit more in charge. People tell me i'm beautiful time and even if I did, like a kid because I thought that if I came in under way and I gained a little bit that I would be okay like with having a little bit busy. And even allow myself to do that because they. want you to have the time and i'm like nc jokes came out of my system, I could probably tell you that i've tried to the except for one day. No two days I didn't do it because one day I had a migraine and like they make me sick, so I threw up like like I didn't even make myself so today like I got sick automatically. But I think there was one day or two days, because one day I was sleeping so I didn't really eat that much. When I got here, so there was probably two days i've been here for 39 days today so two days I did not go and try to make myself do up whether it was a little bit or lack because they don't do it every time after I eat. Good work."
79.0,Provider,But I you do it at least.
15150.0,Patient,I do it at least. Once a day I do at least try once a day to go throw up something.
79.0,Provider,"So, are you saying, I want to try and stop doing that and maybe do it like. Yes, maybe go one day of not doing it, like every other day, or something."
15150.0,Patient,"What do you think yeah at least want to hurt myself either like say no, like and. I i've been doing. It and I don't do it when I like see I because I was coming off mess, too, so I don't do it like when I didn't do it when I went out on the streets, I didn't do it because there was always on the go. yeah and my counselor there do more exercise like. So they're doing a lot more like they're letting us do like cuz there's another girl in here that wanted to, because sometimes we're supposed to exercise at least 30 minutes a day and sometimes the counselors they get busy, and they have days and they don't like. They don't take us out the walk and so somebody else spoke up about it so they're starting to like. More like every day because I will do recommend will sit there. Because. They don't want to deal with us and then they'll go like be like here play and it's like dude come on like. They don't teach people to get clean because it's like all these girls are coming in here like and i've seen girls that like i've seen out there on the street. That we're in and they get clean and then they blow up and it's like nobody he does anybody about nutrition and healthy diet and it's like you know, I think that that's very important as females, even though they're comfortable with themselves. Do they but still if you're at some point if you're that big how much healthier, is it not, and I don't mean that to sound. Right I don't want to I mean, because at some point, like if you're like listen wait you're not healthy it's not healthy to be that, but you know what i'm saying like not a terribly people are not like level people. that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is, if you don't teach people had to have like well i'm still sin, I guess, I would like to learn how to eat healthy and eat like a normal person. So I can be like you know, so I won't have to like a way I can eat and just be normal and be like Okay, with it, while i'm not overweight, you know what i'm saying."
79.0,Provider,"Right What would it help if I kind of so I wrote down a few goals, it looks like you know you're like I want to reduce the amount of times i'm throwing up so let's just maybe see if you can. Do one day of know throwing up. And then Okay, maybe the next day you throw up and then the next day don't. So just see if you can go every other day, does that make sense."
15150.0,Patient,yeah.

That sort of thing um let's see. not finding the website that I like. Well we'll just do this one. Okay i'll share my screen again. Okay, so here is kind of a plate, and so, when you go to get your dinner, you can kind of go okay. You know, a quarter of my plate, you know if you split it up into pieces, a quarter of my plate needs to be protein, you know, a quarter needs to be like grain if it's like. Bigger type noodles it's Okay, for it to be bigger than that you know. And then, about half of your plate with. fruits or vegetables. And then you want to have a dairy you know some kind of calcium, are you okay eating dairy that bother your stomach it oh."
15150.0,Patient,"No, it actually helps because I have to take tons of."

But I have to take it a lot, because sometimes an acid they're gonna make me want to go get a prescription of have to take it consecutively for more than two weeks because it's a treatment Center so like if I drink dairy that might help because sometimes it helps. So you don't have three bucks off."
79.0,Provider,"yeah so you can have milk with breakfast lunch and dinner, and that would be really good. And then have a little protein have a little rice um. So that's one example, let me show you another example that's about breakfast."

79.0,Provider,"yeah I mean a bowl of cereal like that was great like you know. just get a regular bowl you know you fill it with cereal to it's you know. Not quite to the top, so you don't want it to dump out. And then just add milk about halfway up. So, but yeah you. You should be eating a full bowl of cereal plus aside, so you should have. Like your bowl of cereal and the milk. Plus, like a banana or something like that. And that would be an appropriate breakfast size. Does that seem like too much."
