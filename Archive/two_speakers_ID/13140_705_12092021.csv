705.0,Provider,"With your friends to when you evaluate Kelly of like is is it worth having the conversation. what's like one friend, in particular, I mean dude I guess what i'm asking you, is when you evaluate, is it worth you have in that conversation with that friend that you feel like that that's important enough."
13140.0,Patient,"No, not really I feel like it's fine right now. i'm not an alcoholic I don't think I am one, like just drinking it's like whatever happened happened in the past and from it, and obviously I know it's not good to cope with drinking like and there's better ways to cope which i'm working on right so."
705.0,Provider,"And i'm not hearing that you been going back to drinking, I think you said on vacation you drink, one day, and then. yeah and then and then have have things return pretty much back to most weeks, you don't drink."
