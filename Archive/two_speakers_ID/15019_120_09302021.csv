You know, make my own rules and kind of it's it's really fun I like working with another one so."
120.0,Provider,"What i'm what i'm just curious what ages, do you usually have there."

120.0,Provider,"Oh fun so and where are you from what state are you in. California California Okay, because we have people from everywhere so i'm never i'm always like Where are you from you know all over the place, so. you're very busy person that sounds like with all your. My and everything I have a 10 year old daughter to so that."
15019.0,Patient,"that's been a busy to, especially now starting back to school and all that."
120.0,Provider,"Sure, a lot of lot of moving parts, it sounds like with everything. yeah cool um so so tell me kind of about first of all kind of what brought you into to bright her in general, like what, why did why what what kind of led you to seeking out more help and then also more about your eating disorder and kind of how that came to be. Like recognizing that you'd help with that too."
15019.0,Patient,"Okay um yeah I I came because of my anxiety, I have a lot of anxiety so i've been taking like Prozac and xanax pretty regularly. na know those annex is supposed to be something temporarily, but I actually take that daily twice, and I still feel a lot of anxiety. And so, when they asked me about you know what what issues I I have, I have anxiety, I have depression, I have OCD and I also have an eating disorder which I don't like to admit but it's there and. i've worked on i've tried to work on it on my own, but it comes back like it's. It just doesn't go away and. yeah it comes back to haunt me and it's something that I believe i've been struggling with my whole life I just feel like. I gained a lot of weight and then I lost a lot of weight and I think that that kind of triggered it to. Be more more of like a everyday thing. But I worried about it, because my daughter she. She is concerned about her body image and she's only 10. yeah and she says like oh look at my stomach and you know and. She was coming on mommy you're skinny I want to be skinny like you and. I don't want her to think that it's Okay, and you know and that she's she's I mean she's she's she's just them, just like the perfect size but she doesn't I don't want her to think that she needs to lose weight or anything like that, and she like wants to go on the exercise machine and. yeah I noticed like she doesn't want to eat something cuz she'll say like Oh, I already ate a lot and. i'm like wait you're growing you know and you're 10 and it's okay and she's she's a healthy weight she's not overweight or anything she's she's, if anything, we would be underweight so. I don't want her to. I think she kind of gets that, for me, even though I don't try to share that with her, but I think. I think she sees that she's always commenting on oh mommy are so thin and you know and so now you're so skinny and. You need to meet. harrington so it's."
120.0,Provider,"A vegetarian for what's the reasoning, for it."
15019.0,Patient,"um it was actually mainly I was vegan or a long time ago and I was kind of because, like i've watched all the videos and I was like oh like you know first out and. I stuck to that for a couple of years and then vegetarian came about i'm going to say. it's probably been about 10 years now that i've been a vegetarian i'm not strict vegetarian, though I eat meat here and there. It was it's just more because I feel like it's um I know that meat and fat caused me to gain weight and then I also am borderline like high cholesterol, so I try to stay away from. from me just because I feel like it it's not the hobbyist or me but. But then I also feel like i'm low on protein so every now and then I I try to eat it I have different people telling me different things you know."
120.0,Provider,"Right right, and you know, and it is tough whenever you have any kind of obsessional thinking patterns or start thinking of thinking of food as being. it's okay come here sorry my dog is it's okay. you're Okay, I have a foster dog."
15019.0,Patient,"Oh, I have on my leash."
120.0,Provider,Around having a leash right on this side of me and my dog is a little bit nervous about him because he's. So she's like sitting in the doorway can I come in.
15019.0,Patient,"i'm like. Oh, my foster dog is."
120.0,Provider,"He just doesn't I have to have him on a leash because I don't trust him. Anyway, good boy yeah you'd be good. yeah you be good you just sit there. just sit there he's like I can't have too much energy. So Okay, well, I was gonna say is anytime we start having you know, having beliefs about food or food is good or bad, you know that kind of messes with it when when you already have kind of an obsession with thinking. You know, and so one of the biggest goals but eating disorder treatment is to really. Work on not seeing food as good or bad that food is just kind of an object. You know, and it doesn't mean different foods. Like they all have their place in moderation. You know and. And you know, trying to trust the dietitians when they kind of help you make choices around that. Instead of. Trusting whatever you happen to see online."
15019.0,Patient,yeah right.
120.0,Provider,So i'm glad that you're recognizing that you have some kind of rigid beliefs around food and you don't want to pass it on to your daughter.
15019.0,Patient,"For sure yeah I mean cuz it was something I kind of I mean I kind of got away from it and but. I never really like when I had my psychologist I never really told him, like, I would just tell them all i'm okay i'm doing better you know, and I would just and I didn't I wasn't quite honest with him about everything you know and. But I noticed now it's starting to come back and and something I struggle with every day it's just you know. So I do. I mean, I do laxatives. i'm not as I used to take a lot is to take about like seven at a time. Now I do four at a time which is still not good."
120.0,Provider,Every day. Or how often.
15019.0,Patient,i've been doing them every day.
120.0,Provider,"Once a day. Yes, okay."
15019.0,Patient,"And then I tried to. Like i'll try to like go down on them and then i'll have like regular bowel movements and it actually makes me really happy because i'm like you know it's getting back to normal. And then I don't know it's like something clicks and I go back to it, and the same thing with like vomiting like yesterday a lot and I felt very full so I. Right okay yeah which I haven't done for a long time, but. It was just something yeah it just I don't know it just it's just like this feeling I have where I feel like i'm too full and I ate too much and like I regret it afterwards. Even if it's something that's healthy it's still."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, how often does that tend to happen, the vomiting."
15019.0,Patient,"and It I didn't do it for a long time it's probably been like a few weeks since i've done it last night was like the first time in a few weeks. And I used to. I used, I was I started i've always had issues with food like either overeating or like binge eating and then you know, then taking diet pills, or something like that I always i've always had that since I was younger and I started as an adult I think it was after I had my daughter. And I I gained a gain weight it wasn't it wasn't because of her, I was I had gestational diabetes, so I actually didn't gain that much when I had her. But after I had her, and I think it was just the stress and I went through a divorce, and so I think that kind of caused me to overeat and gain weight and so that's when I kind of started purging like throwing up for her and then. And then I ended up having to have oral surgery so, then I that's when I went back to locks it is which I used to take when I was younger. I went to the laxatives and then i've kind of now like recently kind of just been doing, both of them and then trying to work out and it doesn't make sense, because it's like i'm losing. Everything that I put in my body, you know and losing a lot of it and not bringing in vitamins and I take all these vitamins, to try to stay healthy and you know and work out but it's like I can't build muscle because i'm I just feel overly tired and week, and she so i'm. Not her. yeah so I know you said that you had purchased for about three."
120.0,Provider,"To take laxatives every day pretty much, and then you haven't purged for about three weeks or so Prior to that, how are you doing it more often like, on average, how long how often you to keep urge."
15019.0,Patient,"And there was a point where I was doing it properly daily after every dinner. Okay um and. I would do yeah I would do it just so I would get most of what I ate for dinner out. Not after every meal, it was just it was just one meal, but."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. And then, how much, are you exercising."
15019.0,Patient,"i'm trying to do at least three times a week for 20 minutes. per click on on an elliptical machine. um. I do that, I mean I know that's like a healthy way a healthy way to do it, and it also helps to really my stress and all that. I just sometimes i'm so tired that I just don't get on it and I. I kind of blame that, on the other things that i'm you know, like everything else, because a lot of times i'll be really shaky and we can so I I think that's why i'm not staying on that routine, which you know I really wish I would."
120.0,Provider,"yeah i'm the laxatives that really can do a number two yeah. yeah yeah so if anything if you can keep working on getting off of those I know I know it's really, really hard. it's not it's obviously not you know it's not an easy thing, but your body and but and you might get you know you might have some. Like water. With retention. And we're a little bit because of it did your body's used to that, but you know it will help with your your fatigue if you're better hydrated sure."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. I mean, I think it's. yeah it's pretty it's pretty bad it's like, especially when like I can't hold in like for out and it's like i'm like I have to go to the bathroom I don't."
120.0,Provider,Know yeah.
15019.0,Patient,And it's kind of it's been a tough point like a few times and it's you know it's. yeah it's it's not.
120.0,Provider,"So, like. So, like is this been. Like you said you've had kind of some of these behaviors your whole life. So as i've been kind of off and on. With the laxatives like and then."
15019.0,Patient,"I did it a lot, when I was younger. I remember, and then I kind of got when they will take them I would get like this nauseous feeling because of the taste of them I would always because I always take the same the same kind of a little pink ones are correct dollar. And so, now I don't get nauseous from them, but. I go up and down so like I said, like I got up to seven or eight and then like now i'm down to four, but I was down to two, which was you know and so it's like I know I fluctuate depending on. How I feel."
120.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, do you ever been like eat a whole bunch of food, knowing that you're going to."
15019.0,Patient,purge.
120.0,Provider,"Or, knowing that you're going to take a bunch of laxatives that."
15019.0,Patient,"When I was younger I did. Okay um now it's more like I might eat a lot and I feel like i'm treating myself, you know because. I did a lot of no sweets, for a long time, and so, sometimes i'll eat like the scone or something and then, if I eat that awful it's more of a guilty feeling so it's more like that then i'll bring it up so it's like."
120.0,Provider,"feel kind of like let yourself indulge a little bit. But you don't been just. As far as like eating like a significant amount of food that other people would also consider a significant epic okay. This is mainly kind of the restriction. But what's emerging involved. Right right right okay. Okay i'm. And i'm and you haven't had any treatment for this specifically right the reading disorder we haven't really ever kind of talked about it. i'm actually really excited for you, because you know, for you to finally be able to kind of look at this stuff and and realize that it's not your friend. Even though it's kind of been in your life for so long."
15019.0,Patient,In.
120.0,Provider,A you'll feel so much better. yeah no.
15019.0,Patient,"I mean I I had a point where. I I passed out in the hallway and I like I fell down and I hurt myself, I had like a cut on me and. I know the reason behind it was because I was, I was so weak and because I was taking laxatives and you know. purging at the same time, and so. I just don't want something like that to happen again, I mean that didn't even like snapped me out of it, I thought it would you know. That was probably about maybe a couple years ago. Okay, when that happened and I thought for sure that because I was so afraid when that happened, I thought for sure that would snapped me out of it, but it it didn't it."
120.0,Provider,"unfortunate, are you having any kind of health problems with right now recently."
15019.0,Patient,i'm.
120.0,Provider,mentioned fatigue for sure.
15019.0,Patient,"i'm tired I get weak and I get dizzy sometimes. Okay, so that's definitely something sometimes i'm shaky. And i'm not really sure that has to do it i'm kind of confused on like because when I when I go get my tests, like my what to the doctor. i'm good on all my test it's just my cholesterol is like slightly almost to a high point. Which is weird because I don't eat meat but. I do like tortillas."
120.0,Provider,"I i'm. i'm vegetarian, too, and I also have high cholesterol its genetic. that's what they're finding more and more yes it's really more about your liver than what you're eating. And so it's more important to eat really. really like Omega threes like NUTS it's really important to eat those things, because that creates that raises your hdl cholesterol, which is the kind of protective. You know. And the dietitians can tell you all about that, but yeah but it. was kind of a misnomer, for a long time that diet and cholesterol where. we're kind of you know causal but it's really not. Okay cool."
15019.0,Patient,"I tried and that's why i've tried let's increase like eating more protein and. You know, trying to. It yeah and try to eat more foods that are like high like. Whole grain and you know. To help lower my cholesterol. But I don't know, like my shakiness that has to do with. I don't I don't know the I should like, if it's my eating disorder or if it has to do with my medication or them taking or. I really don't know like."
120.0,Provider,"I would, I would guess it you're eating disorder. Because you're chronically dehydrated. And so there's there's a really good chance that your body is struggling. Even though your labs aren't showing that, because you have your body's probably adapted to it. And my guess is that you're you know you're a lot of processes in your body are probably struggling. yeah right now, and I mean shakiness can be from a lot of different things, but typically you know low blood sugar is a huge piece of it. And, and even just. blood sugar dips you know, especially if you had gestational diabetes you already might have be prone to some of that stuff."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's what I think of a lot and I feel like I have, I have that sometimes like my blood sugar drops. And yeah I definitely feel like that, and like i'll get sweaty and i'll get like where I feel feverish and."
120.0,Provider,Like all kinds of yeah you're. Like your body's trying to figure out what the heck it's supposed to do yeah and navigate everything. Do you ever are you losing your hair at all.
15019.0,Patient,"I lose a lot of hair on my still have a lot of hair but i've noticed that I have, I have lost a lot they used to always thin it when I went and. Your data."
120.0,Provider,Which.
15019.0,Patient,"i'm happy about it, but then i'm kind of scared some like my hair is always been very thick and i've always had. to know."
120.0,Provider,"What about things like do you get like kind of dizzy when you stand up and sit down like when you move from one position to the other. Yes, okay. that's called ortho static blood pressure."
15019.0,Patient,And sometimes I feel like i'm off balance. mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,"So i'm not super scary when you're watching a little kids too, because if you. Pass out when you're holding somebody or you, you know accidentally fall on somebody or something like that you know."
15019.0,Patient,"And I remember I lost my balance I like tripped over a chair and like falling down and like I was Okay, but. it's still it's like sometimes I noticed my balance is not is not good so."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah and you're probably like really chronically dehydrated how are your teeth or your teeth suffering from this.
15019.0,Patient,"um they know they seem to me okay. i've always had issues with like my gums just with them receiving and I actually had. surgery to like have them repaired on the bottom, but um so that's, the only thing I have issues with is kind of like just making sure macomb stay healthy, but other than that I don't have any other issues."
120.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, do you have like your skin like chronically dry or anything like that. yeah that's frequently a thing too."
15019.0,Patient,"it's very dry my face will get very oily but it's it's very deceiving because when I try to put like a makeup on or something it's very dry it's like peeling So yes, I have very dry skin yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and are you getting regular periods."
15019.0,Patient,"I have been and it's just recently, they kind of switched as they've kind of been a little irregular when I was younger I used to only get it, like every three months. And then, after I had my daughter I kind of regulated me and so i've been regular ever since but i've noticed recently they've kind of been coming at different times and usual kind of surprising."
120.0,Provider,"yeah cuz those because that can mean there's a lot of factors that can affect it but that's also you know, a sign of malnutrition to. When your body is. struggling for food than some of the processes such as hydrating your skin or growing your hair. You know, are menstruating those processes kind of stopped because it's trying to conserve energy and also your energy levels it's being fatigued. it's because your body doesn't have enough energy. To you know, to put into doing stuff because it's just surviving. ya know so Those are all kind of symptoms of malnutrition."
15019.0,Patient,Right right yes.
120.0,Provider,"So you mentioned some doing some therapy was is that mainly for the anxiety, then that you've in therapy for that you have done, like. A patient there before."
15019.0,Patient,"yeah it's for anxiety i've done therapy for depression. After my grandma passed away. And so now it's like I feel like I have invited, I have a lot of things that have happened in my life that I feel like they kind of have affected me more than a i'd like to admit."
120.0,Provider,That I was going through.
15019.0,Patient,yeah definitely traumas yeah so. that's something that i'm in kind of. Dealing with right now okay.
120.0,Provider,Have you ever been like in a treatment Center or a hospital setting before. No okay.
15019.0,Patient,"that's my fear though, and I don't want to."
120.0,Provider,"Well let's try to keep you out of it, so that you don't have to be in that situation for sure, have you ever worked with a dietitian."
15019.0,Patient,And i've done like Jenny Craig and stuff like.
120.0,Provider,That yeah.
15019.0,Patient,"yeah really well dietitian but thing i've done that, but they actually kicked me off, because then my weight kept dropping and um I yeah I was below weights, or they. continue. yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Well yeah. yeah I mean one thing that we always recommend is working with a. Eating disorder dietitian where who is savvy about you know eating disorders and some of the weird beliefs people eating disorders out and and so that's something that I think will be a really good thing for you to is to work with one of them and that'll help you kind of. Catch yourself in some of your strange beliefs about food. Right so. they're they're wonderful you know to to have. Because they're kind of a good. check on your own kind of obsessional thoughts. yeah so okay. All right, i'm just looking at my i've been jumping around a little bit with the questions i'm supposed to ask you. Right. So I am kind of curious as to it sounds from what you said, one of your biggest motivators right now is not wanting your daughter to learn some of the same patterns. Right that's that that is probably the best gift, you could ever give her is to have a healthy body image yourself, you know and to not. Make weight and food a big part of life, you know, like it's not the Center of your life. You know, and it is, it is very sad that kids at younger worried about that you know that should not be something that is in their. In their radar yet you know. it ever be preferable if they never had to deal with that."
15019.0,Patient,And that's what i'm scared about they notice she's picking it up and she's starting to mention things like oh my tummy or look at my big Tommy and oh like mommy i'm fat and I. need to exercise I need to go on the exercise machine and. i'm like no and. I don't I don't know why I don't know where she's getting it from because she doesn't she doesn't really know what I do you know.
120.0,Provider,you'd be surprised at what they pick up on.
15019.0,Patient,She has. She ever talk about it. yeah yeah she's definitely picked up on it and that's funny.
120.0,Provider,"yeah cuz they'll you know that's one thing that's so. amazing and also scary about kids is they, they do become what we are you know they could be your the model you for her, and so you know they they typically you know eating disorders are frequently passed along in families. Because that's what's modeled for you is how, especially women, of how women live and how they're supposed to be, and so young girls kind of think well that's what mom does and."
15019.0,Patient,"You know, and I think that's normal, and so I think, as you become more aware of it."
120.0,Provider,For yourself that's a wonderful gift for her.
15019.0,Patient,Yes.
120.0,Provider,"yeah doing for her so because, then you can really help kind of prevent it in her. You know and helping her not focus on her body and help her not. Like notice people's bodies and just realize that that's not important."
15019.0,Patient,Right right.
120.0,Provider,"Yes, so okay um. let's see I can you give me an idea of kind of how much you're eating every day like do you do you count calories or do you just kind of always a very small amount or."
15019.0,Patient,"i'm not what are you eating. is, as I used to be very obsessive about counting measuring and now i'm not like I. I don't eat the best, but all I like for breakfast I might eat like Bobby does or cereal and then for lunch i'll do. Maybe like. Like pita and hummus or. Sometimes i'll do like a sandwich and like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I like checks mix okay i'll just do. Checks mix it's like it's random and it's not it's not a healthy full meal that i'm eating at lunchtime. And then i'm usually hungry between them so then i'll do like maybe like ice coffee or something and then for dinner I usually have a pretty good dinner usually it's like a full meal like on how. You know, like. I don't know like spaghetti or. Like potato tacos with beans and rice and. You know something something like that it's usually."
120.0,Provider,A bad sometimes event the times you purge it.
15019.0,Patient,"Yes. Depending on like. For example, last night, we had we had hawaiian food, so we had a lot of meat and I felt very full after I eat that yeah I felt yeah so that's valid that's what I purged but then I I do a lot of blue ball to like the osi evils, and things like that i'll do that for dinner. And before is even purging those even though those were healthy and that's probably the healthiest thing I and all day you know and have all the chia seeds and everything else in it, but.

15019.0,Patient,and
120.0,Provider,"I mean, I know it's super uncomfortable but if they're willing you're willing to consider."
15019.0,Patient,"it's it's very uncomfortable but I, I know that that's something I need to do, because I have people tell me like you could probably gain some weight and. You know they're they're not aware of what's going on but they'll say like oh you're really thin you can you know you know, probably gain a little bit more away and. That will probably help you when you work out and this and that to build muscle and you know, and so I do have Comments like that, so I know that I probably should gain some weight, but. yeah it's very uncomfortable."

They have that in their head and i've told them you're not going to get better there's. You know, like if you're if you're that rigid around it, you know, then that's kind of the disorder. You have to be willing to look at it critically and. So i'm glad that you're scared but willing to try."
15019.0,Patient,Okay there and yeah I still very um I feel like i've met a weight or i'm comfortable right now but. i'm probably not at the right weight I should.

You know. that's kind of you know. yeah it's. A sense that you know your body is probably unusually small. yeah where it needs to be."
15019.0,Patient,"You know, sorry."
120.0,Provider,"dietitians will work with you on that, because that's what they do is they may look at. You know your history and the trends that your body has been through and then, and then the numbers of your labs and different there's different measurements to kind of help. help determine what it what an ideal kind of body range would be for you. know that your body can be healthy and."

I guess i'm trying to like you know continue my unhealthy habits and maintain my weight, you know and keep it the same place, but when it goes too low, I do get concerned, he has no I don't want to be."
120.0,Provider,"To you don't want to die you don't want to. Get osteoporosis. Yes, yeah cuz those things happen."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, and so that that definitely worries me. And then. I mean kind of like the same as when not as much, though, as women, again, so he gives me more anxiety, but when I when I lose I do. ain't you can I get concerned."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and. How do you feel about your body, right now, like you, are you like it do you hate it do you are like well it's Okay, as long as it doesn't get any more like, how do you how do you feel about your current body."
15019.0,Patient,"I don't like it i'm also bloated a lot and I think that's because of the laxative so I have a bloated stomach which I don't take you know because I think that's not my ideal body type. And I feel like i'm not getting gaining muscle or getting benefiting from working out. So yeah I i'm kind of yeah I guess i'm not happy with it like I am because I would like to be toned and. But then I feel like i'm not getting there and. Everything all the vitamins and stuff i'm taking any foods that i'm trying to take to help me like if I eat a protein bar or something it's just it's not helping so. Right yeah, so I am not really happy where i'm at yeah."
120.0,Provider,"it's a pretty poor body image for sure. let's see. Do you have any. Food rules, I know you mentioned being mostly vegetarian, but are like are there, certain foods that you consider like bad, like you, it sounds like kind of like sweet stuff is."
15019.0,Patient,sugar.
120.0,Provider,yeah the one of the harder ones for you.
15019.0,Patient,it's sugar yeah anything that. Because that's like that's my weak point I think is like when it comes like math and skulls and. I think those are my favorites so that. that's like my weak point is sweets and sugars. I do coffee and my creamer in the morning and I feel like that's kind of like where I get my sugar from you know his or. I.
120.0,Provider,Have coffee coffee in your creamer. creamer.
15019.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz I have a lot of creeper in my. view that so a and I have trade like alternatives because I noticed like. When I go back to them from like i'll go to like an almond milk creamer that's not as doesn't have as much sugar and then, when I go back to my. You know my coffee me it seems very sweet and so i'm trying to get away from like too much, sugar and also because I have that risk of diabetes, because of because I had gestational diabetes so. Okay, I I do I do worry about my sugar. And I know that's also where I gain weight and where I can get in trouble and where I can maybe benji is."
120.0,Provider,"When it comes to reason Okay, and the next part is about your your psyche history already kind of shared that you have anxiety OCD depression and you're eating disorder, obviously. Do have ptsd or any other diagnosis that you're aware of, or."
15019.0,Patient,"Not that i've been diagnosed with but I kind of felt like they had this incident with my ex and. I mean involved weapons and police and restraining orders and all of that, so I can't relate from that whole incident I kind of feel like I do have it like I don't know if that's possible, but I know it's definitely something that's affected me that I haven't talked about and. So um yeah I definitely think it's something I need to discuss with someone. Because i've kind of just been holding it in but. I noticed, I am i'm at the point, right now, where i'm pushing everybody away from me which. is something I tend to do is I push. Everyone away from me just because it I guess it makes me feel like I have less anxiety, if I have less people to deal with and. I don't have people to lose if it goes as far as dating or anything like that so. I yeah i'm kind of at that point or push everyone away from me so which. Which isn't you know it's it's not healthy and I, I noticed."
120.0,Provider,yeah kind of in your show a little bit. That way. Okay um Have you ever been suicidal.
15019.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
120.0,Provider,"No Okay, and so you do, what about like self harm like cutting yourself or hurting yourself, or something like that."
15019.0,Patient,"No, I mean i'll do is the laxatives which I kind of feel like self harm it's not taking care of it."
120.0,Provider,Right okay any history of substance abuse. No okay.
15019.0,Patient,My mom did my mom she passed away from drugs accidental drug overdose of prescription. So I know.
120.0,Provider,opiates or something.
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, and so I know that it runs in my family, and I also have been I was told that my dad was very like he would have his cans organized, so it kind of seemed like he was a little OCD. yeah."
120.0,Provider,could be. And then medication wise you're just on Prozac and xanax right.
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, but I. may take two milligrams of the xanax twice a day. Okay, I feel that's kind of a lot for me to, and still having anxiety like i'm still having and still."
120.0,Provider,"No Oh, you know what you know about that too, because another very, very likely piece that's adding to that is your mal nourishment because. you're when you're in when your body's in a state of starvation, even if you don't think it is, and you don't feel hungry your body feels like it's in danger because. Because, like, for example, like the called the caveman brain. You know, back in the day if. You know if you don't have what you need you know you're very much vulnerable. And so, if your body's not being nourished it's chronic like i'm in danger i'm being chased by a tiger i'm not safe and so. nourishment in itself and getting your body re nourished will do wonders for anxiety. and depression, too, because your serotonin is produced in your gut. And if your guts are being damaged by laxatives. you're probably not benefiting from the Prozac as much as you normally would."
15019.0,Patient,Right right okay.
120.0,Provider,"yeah that that's where it comes from, and if you're just like. not letting it worked normally it's not going to produce the feel good chemicals. yeah another reason to kind of work on this stuff so, and the reason i'm glad you're here."
15019.0,Patient,"yeah Eric can say talk to she was I guess it was the same kind of interest, a spoke with she was asking about the okay going down on me xanax and I said. Yes, because I do think it's kind of high. And I have tried to go down on it myself and it's it's not like."
120.0,Provider,You gotta grow really slow on that stuff because it's very physically addicting and.
15019.0,Patient,"So that's when I kind of you know, like it's not it's not making so much, especially if I can you know go down on it, even though I was easing down on it like doing like half the dose I still was feeling feeling that was like withdrawal symptoms, I guess."
120.0,Provider,"yeah and and you can have seizures and stuff coming out of that stuff like you can it can be physically dangerous to you too. If you cut it too quick mean that's one of the ones that. bends over like like xanax and alcohol withdrawal can actually be really dangerous for your body, and so you have to do it's very slowly. So yeah let let let them help you if you're going to change it, let them help you. With that process yeah. Again, cause things like seizures things like that, and if you're not nourishing your body your seizure threshold is already lower, meaning that you're more likely to have a seizure. If your body's not getting nourished. And so you don't want to mess too much with medications. And, especially when you're in a dangerous like nutritional state."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, okay oh yeah I mean I only tried it the ones, and then I just."
120.0,Provider,realized again yeah.
15019.0,Patient,"it's like I couldn't stand what i'm taking and so i've been but. I know it's kind of a lot, you know it was actually and six milligrams a day and I just started to do the morning and midnight and the afternoon if needed. But I know before whenever I check static, so it was only like Point five or something, it was a really small amount, and it was as needed. But now i'm taking a daily so it's. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"You were gonna help you find some other ways of managing your your anxiety and and the physical symptoms of anxiety to. So in regards to family history, you mentioned your mom passed away from a i'm sorry to hear that. An opiate overdose and then your dad has likely has some OCD patterns."
15019.0,Patient,"And yeah and both my parents passed away, I was raised by my grandma and my grandpa and. I wasn't told about my mom I didn't find that out until I went to go get her death certificate, and I was always told it was kidney failure, but then. I just remember stories up my mom going missing and my mom being at the hospital and her friends from the hospital and you know I kind of, and you know pictures of my mom kind of passed out on the floor and. I kind of put it all together, as I was, you know when I was older and I figured out that you know she she had a an addiction problem and. When she was pregnant with me they wanted to like a more because they didn't know she was pregnant, she was very irregular she only had her period every like five years, so this she believes she couldn't get pregnant. And so, when she had me she was taking which my grandma's home me was you know drugs for medicine for kidney failure but it turns out, you know she was taking other stuff and settings abort me, but I was too far along so."
120.0,Provider,i'm glad they didn't abort you. i'm very glad that you're here.
15019.0,Patient,"yeah yes. yeah yeah. yeah I kind of put it together and I figured out that what was going on, that she you know she was a dictator, you know prescription pills, and my dad supposedly passed away when I was four months from a heart attack. i'm not really sure that I I don't have access to his death certificate, so I don't know when."

120.0,Provider,never knew them then really. And you're not sure that what your dad passed from.
15019.0,Patient,"know because my grandma's for me it was. A he had a heart attack, but. I I really don't know cuz I know she didn't tell me the truth about my mom, so I think she there's a possibility, it could have been something else, and she tried to protect me. I know he had fat previous kids in. Colorado so like that's where like his body was shipped back to his Colorado and I I don't I could i'm able to get Ahold of a dust certificate for him, but. He never try it, but I."
120.0,Provider,"mean it's up to you if you ever wanted. to know. You know, but. yeah it. sounds like there's some things that aren't very top talked about openly in your family."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."

And then my girl ma it was. It was when I was in college she started to kind of get forgetful she couldn't walk and. So I didn't want to put her into the nursing home because I saw how they treated my grandpa they weren't very good to him in the nursing home he had a lot of bed sores and. So I didn't want to put her in that, so I ended up taking care of her. For probably about i'm going to say about three years until she passed away, and I was going to college, at the same time. wow I ended up with shingles which. I had shingles twice now. And so it was it was very stressful and I I feel like. that's kind of where my anxiety kind of really pete because I used to be, I used to call her initiative answer I would be worried, so I would be at home, to see if she's okay and. You know, and it was it was constant you know worry and we can share, about shoes okay and. yeah so."

So it's 11 hours a week. Okay it's Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Okay, and it's from three to six, so I don't know if that if you could even swing that because of your schedule."
15019.0,Patient,"I don't get off work until five, so I. don't know if there's. What The other option is but."

120.0,Provider,"just got off work yeah. yeah yeah we did. yeah and that's not usually a. Like a thing, because it kind of interrupts the process, you know. But think about it, I mean, obviously. attend choice, but you know and and maybe this new person that you're hiring on could maybe cover. On those days. so that you can leave early."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely yeah. That would that would be a really good thing."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so the other alternative would be to just do outpatient where you would just meet with one of our eating disorder therapists and with an eating for a dietitian dress. Okay, and it just wouldn't I think you would make more progress quicker in iot simply because you have a lot more support there and. You would meet a lot of people that would that care would care a lot about you and that you would hear similar stories. and be able to be like you to you feel that way to you know, like that it's. it's a very powerful experience to have other people that you can talk to. But at least you would need to do outpatient. therapist and."
15019.0,Patient,"mansion team. Yes, and that's something i'd want to do and i'd like to try to participate in that group as well you know that I oh."
120.0,Provider,"yeah so. If you want to me, I would definitely recommend I O P, if you can swing it. Has as far as works you'd probably have to talk to this other person and say. You know I need to be done by three o'clock on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday."

120.0,Provider,"And you'd have to close, for you or whatever. Okay, on those days."

15019.0,Patient,Oh sorry yeah that's.
120.0,Provider,"Sometimes I don't know if it needed. And we also have a free support group that's every other Saturday. Okay, and and I run it this Saturday, and then, but one of the dietitians runs it on the off off weeks, but I don't. Okay, and that's free and that's that's not people in it well as people that if anybody really but it's not people that are necessarily and I O P, for there are some that go to that too. Okay, oh it's a different group of people, but. OK, but so that's another alternative. If you. can't swing the scheduling part for you."
15019.0,Patient,"Okay, good Okay, yes, thank you know I think all those options, they sound great and definitely it's something that I need and. yeah me."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will let amanda know that i'm highly recommending I O P, for you and. You know and but if, but if, for some reason you can't make it work because of your work, then. Definitely would need to do. outpatient like and possibly even multiple times a week because. You know you're. you're eating to do some weight restoring which is hard you're going to need to have more support so."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely."

You know, but with the eating disorder group we do both, we will have the eating disorder piece, and the anxiety piece because it's probably very connected."
15019.0,Patient,"Yes, that's what I think."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so um so it would be an eating disorder specific therapist. Okay, so I wouldn't have we don't have it set up quite yet, because this is just the beginning of kind of meeting with me to kind of get a better idea of what your struggles are. Right and but amanda will look into your insurance and make sure that covers all that and kind. Of get out that so you will hear from her. Okay got it."
