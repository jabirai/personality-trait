But no, I get drug tested by my doctor I have pain management, I take oxycodone from my back I hurt my back went over for Boeing aircraft, so I wouldn't have enough pain pain specialists that I talked to any random drug test me."
498.0,Provider,"Oh, did they tell you that it's fine if you take your. Your updated labs after the 18th."
13743.0,Patient,"Just let us know, nobody told me anything."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, because because I received a message that said that you had a boot on your leg. No, I mean."
13743.0,Patient,Like.
498.0,Provider,"I told them to relate to you that when you get a chance to complete them that's fine. You know, considering your booth just let us know it's just that they have to be updated, just because, not because of you it's the therapy, even if you will, on stimulants or you're on this or that as a therapy, we have to have regular drug screens."
13743.0,Patient,"So that's once. Every year, how does it go."
498.0,Provider,it's no it's supposed to be monthly.
13743.0,Patient,Why.
498.0,Provider,"If I get because of the therapy and well if you if you are having drug screens by your primary care physician if they could send them to us, then it will alleviate the one for that."
13743.0,Patient,"Well, you just random. Drug testing my doctor can."
498.0,Provider,See we don't we can't we don't do like randomized. If you're in specific programs you do randomized but for us it's just regular part of your treatment plan.
13743.0,Patient,And you're doing monthly since you guys that's what a surprise.
498.0,Provider,"yeah, I can assure you that for stimulant treatment lands benzodiazepine treatment plans and suboxone treatment plans regular drug screens are part of the therapy."
13743.0,Patient,And does is it covered by the insurance that's what bothers me the most i'm like that's.
498.0,Provider,"that's a question that I will ask for you, because i'm not necessarily privy to specific coverages i'm not even sure who you're who your coverage is with, but I will inquire for you and I have Anna send you a message today with findings okay."
13743.0,Patient,So what I do I go to the to the. place where the quest you're saying to go get it done.
498.0,Provider,"Now the care navigator set it up for you so that you can go into what at wherever is closest to like your resident. Okay yeah so that you don't it's not meant to its well at least that I hope it's not inconvenience that meant to be an inconvenience it's a part of the treatment plan with regard to. specific treatment strategies, for instance, like somebody who's on an antidepressant. doesn't have to submit them as often but they still have to submit them just so that we can be aware of any like medication interactions or anything like that be, because the information isn't provided to anyone else, or any other entity, except for us."
13743.0,Patient,"So I have to do it because i'm taking impress them. On they haven't, this is the first time I heard this that when they called me as a monthly Why would I do monthly for a problem because i'm kicking oxycodone I figured that's the most strong medication and my doctors really tough on that."
498.0,Provider,"they're on the same schedule so it's it's it's not it's per bright heart, not for prescriber which is probably why your your your pain management provider may not be requiring it. Because like I said it's it's part of the bright heart guidelines it's not purpose grabber guidelines it doesn't have anything to do with pose your prescriber previously didn't have anything to do with Sharon or myself or even if you went with a different prescriber. It wouldn't have anything to do with us individually it's just part of the treatment strategy."
13743.0,Patient,"For some, that was. I was getting Eric innocent, why do I need to go every month for because what, if I can get a ride what am I can't get there."
498.0,Provider,I would say if it's something like.
13743.0,Patient,"come towards a frustration for you, you know you're in a."
498.0,Provider,"you're in a book about it. She said, you know she's in a book she won't be able to do it until the 18th that's it okay we'll schedule it after the 18th."
13743.0,Patient,i'm sorry for interrupting. When I go on the. 18th but it doesn't mean this can be taken off.
498.0,Provider,"Exactly so that that's my that's my entire point if you run into an issue where it doesn't come off and you're you know still somewhat immobilized and just let the care navigator know or let me know, since you see me regularly in group anyway."
13743.0,Patient,Tomorrow i'll be sending yes.
498.0,Provider,"yeah and then i'll let the care navigators know that any either needs to be pushed back or that we are aware, you know what I mean."
13743.0,Patient,And you guys put some submit something into the quest by my house for them to know that i'm going to get a drug tester how's this going to go.
498.0,Provider,"build the care navigator will order it for you in that it'll be order and then they'll have they'll have the order in place and then they'll forward you an email to let you know that there's a request for you know updated labs and then you'll go back to your convenience. I am glad you got a chance to see me today, so I can address that because I have at least half of the patients on on my caseload have had some kind of compliance change. And so. Trying to address it in group it just it just it feels overwhelming, but I would rather try to explain it to everybody individually, so that they know it's not them, and you know it's nothing that they've done so."
13743.0,Patient,"I don't mind it just that. getting around like I said, if I have my car grab some to take me. You know, because there's things going on, like I said I don't really want to discuss it, but there's things going on that. I don't have a vehicle to be digging around doing things."
498.0,Provider,yeah just let me know when whenever it's going to whenever that is satisfying the requirement is going to be an issue and then we'll try to figure it out.
13743.0,Patient,Okay okay fine.
498.0,Provider,So i'll refill your needs tomorrow.
13743.0,Patient,Oh.
498.0,Provider,"I didn't want to tell you about this so with the outcries lamb, you know that it's short acting in that that have you had clonazepam before."
13743.0,Patient,what's that.
498.0,Provider,"it's a it's another been so it's a long as the enterprise, the lamb is good for like rescue therapy, but it has a shorter half life than the clock. clonazepam the plan as a pm, is something that you could switch over to I want you to just think about it doesn't have to happen today or tomorrow. it's another benzodiazepine works, the same way, except it last a little bit longer. And it's, the reason I like it better, is because, at some point when you are ready in your anxiety is presenting with the ability for you to taper down off of it, yes, longer lasting it's easier to taper off of than the our problem so. it's kind of the safest alternative when it comes to benzodiazepine usage, because it."
13743.0,Patient,Has a.
498.0,Provider,"longer duration, so not only. Does it give you, yes, not only does it give you like relief longer, but because it has that longer relief it's easier to taper down off of because it's it last for so long. So I know."
13743.0,Patient,"I tried to. kick him out so prevalent that was sorry I couldn't take it, I was going crazy."
498.0,Provider,With this isn't taking you it wouldn't if you'd be coming off of that Christ will land but you'd have a good replacement mid like another benzodiazepine that last longer than our President.
13743.0,Patient,yeah I think. It sounds like interesting.
498.0,Provider,"yeah it's not like coming off. coming off of outcries lamb is difficult. Let me say this but switching over to another benzo is like the magic sweet spot because you still get the relief in the anxiety related to like coming off of it isn't there because you're not you're not coming. off you just moving over to a longer acting one. Which like I said, which provides you with a longer lead. Relief it most patients on our grads lamb typically have a good five or six hours of relief. Typically klonopin has a roughly about a 12 hours 13 hours relief period, so it is a benzo so that something for you to consider that's all."
13743.0,Patient,yeah i'm actually gonna even Google it and check it out.
498.0,Provider,Please do and bring me a question.
13743.0,Patient,Okay that's something that. We considering.
498.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, other than that any other questions i'll talk to Anna about the labs and let her know that i've spoken to you about them and then, when your book comes off you go get them done. And then, other than that questions or concerns you do, for your results tomorrow so i'll address it in group. I know what I was going to tell you, because."
13743.0,Patient,during the Christmas holiday to know anything I was going crazy because you forgot to feel it and I was like oh my God.
498.0,Provider,"See I don't know why that happened because you have what I did was I ordered your refill with the and then the the order was to have it called and again on the 27th so. i'm not sure what the I ux team addressed it but i'm not sure why that that break in there wasn't thinking that it was a miscommunication or misunderstanding. On on like the half of the order, but it was in in order to bridge you."
13743.0,Patient,Like to the nature of what. Does it.
498.0,Provider,"No i'm sorry that that happened for you, because I went in and I went in and looked at it, when you mentioned it during group and I thought, what. This means you have anything during during the holiday, but then I could see that the rx team went in in breached it after the fact, but that it had to be what it was, it was the Internet."
13743.0,Patient,Because Christmas China was really terrible.
498.0,Provider,yep because it was supposed to be submitted on 1222 but it wasn't entered until 1227.
13743.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
498.0,Provider,"yeah I saw that and I thought, what that wasn't what what it was how that was supposed to go so. I don't know I don't think i'll things around here are changing in order to like make improvements, so that patients won't have like that gap. Because you know I can call it in benzodiazepine therapy is is kind of crazy, but I can submit it and then. submit for a second year refill to be filled, at the end of that seven days, and so, if it's missed, then I won't know it unless you let us know they won't know what unless you let us know so i'm guessing that that's where the communication was the."
13743.0,Patient,"idea Oh, I did call and tell them. That day but Christmas was the next day, I was like oh what i'm going to do, I just it's terrible."
498.0,Provider,"Okay i'm sorry, you went through that i'm really sorry, you went through that i'm happy, you made it through, but i'm sorry, you went through that."
13743.0,Patient,"It was very hard very, very hard."
498.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i'll continue to try to make tweaks and changes so that you don't have to run into those boys okay. i'll do everything I can to avoid that but, when it does you know don't hesitate to let us know I don't I do not, I can't stress this enough, I do not mind the reminders."
13743.0,Patient,"OK OK. OK, but I enjoyed group I enjoyed very much it brings up a lot listening to the people."
498.0,Provider,For yourself supportive in group to the.
13743.0,Patient,"Time there's just so much, I want to say, but I hold back because I have too much you know."
498.0,Provider,Too much what I enjoy listening to all the young ones.
13743.0,Patient,"The younger ones, you know, but as older people, we still go through it and that's getting worse for me because i'm going to go through a divorce so that's harder on me and i'm trying my best to hang in there."
498.0,Provider,"yeah I can see, you are, I can see."
13743.0,Patient,"it's hard but i'm doing it. Every day, is a challenge."
498.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I think you're doing well, no considering."

498.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I hope it only gets easier for you, I don't know how I don't know how that happens, but."
13743.0,Patient,"it's gonna it's not gonna it's gonna get worse and i'm just terrified because you know, a holic so you know that's more of a challenge marvin can be really nightmare it's gotten scary before Christmas, it went out of control here so that's why i'm in a boot. So. i'm i'm OK for right now, but if not I have to leave."
498.0,Provider,"Let me know if there's anything else that we can do the. Fourth, is make referrals whatever we can do okay."
13743.0,Patient,appreciate it.
498.0,Provider,yeah make sure that you're safe.
