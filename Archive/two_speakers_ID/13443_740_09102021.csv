Okay, so why did you decide to become a treatment."
13443.0,Patient,"Well, basically. The majority of the reason that it came to bright heart was because I had seen another psychiatry that have prescribed medication for me. But it really was having some bad side effects or. Not it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, and I wasn't feeling very well, so I needed to see somebody, and this is who my insurance recommended me to."

13443.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, no okay good um the four times a month, how long do they usually last."
13443.0,Patient,"too long, if i'm focusing on like situations that are happening that are not good. You know what I mean. it's while i'm thinking about it, so I would say, like maybe I don't know 20 minutes half an hour or something."
740.0,Provider,That.
13443.0,Patient,When I get distracted and forget about it yeah that's good that's good.
740.0,Provider,"So do you feel like those thoughts of wanting to die, you can control yeah."
13443.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, is it easy to control or is it difficult to control."
13443.0,Patient,"um. I don't I would say halfway in between I just sit there, and I say you know what i'm not gonna let myself think these thoughts and i'm gonna you know, even if I don't believe it per se i'm gonna say the truth, and then I try to like repeat it."
740.0,Provider,"You know, good good deal okay. Well, we can move forward. Looking at something Okay, here we go, so you are if they say that you are endorsing the symptoms of severe anxiety and so they started in his 20s aiming from having a path abusive relationship any history of sexual abuse, when you were saving. Their lasted for several years, so he ended up enter binge eating to get a feeling of nominees from the trauma you hadn't had endured. You do also show with social anxiety and have difficulty drive it and in congested areas. said you ready during body and six or seven out of 10. alright. So is there, one of the main issue, the main body. odor what's right is it the mo."
13443.0,Patient,"You know what it's been in situations that I can't control or I tend to be one of those people that i'm very cautious and. Like say I have like a job interview or i'm going somewhere that i've never been before i'll always take a test run. So that that way, I know, like where it is how long it takes me, you know any me because I can't stand being late, I can't stand getting lost Unfortunately I don't have any directional. sense at all, so I just have to do things that will make me not feel so anxious. And so that helps and I am always like i'm a big list person, you know what I mean this is how i'm going to this is what i'm going to do this is how i'm going to do it, it helps me to be able to cross it off, one by one, that kind of stuff so it's just stuff to help me not panic."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so basically pre planning. And so that's something that really helps you because, at least, you are aware of the durations and things like that I like that idea. I like that yeah i'm happy that you actually found that outlet to help kind of reducing anxiety. And I think i'm going to use it for other people who share what inside that's a great idea. Because what happens is in like you said, if you have like a job interview well, you have someone that you've never been before it's good to map that out. To listen or to reduce that anxious feeling like what if i'm going to get lost or what if i'm late or young fans, so I think this is a great outlet I think it's a really good tool to use. Absolutely. taught me some English name is miss Alice I look it up. I think that's amazing um growing up what was your family life, like."
13443.0,Patient,"Well, it was difficult in that, like my mom and my dad and my sister. have very, very loud personalities. So they would fight, and they would bicker they would scream they would yell. I was the little girl in the corner that was reading her books. You know what I mean but. Just because I didn't ask for attention doesn't mean I didn't need it. So my parents thought that I was Okay, but I really wasn't. And all of their loudness really bothered me. You know, it was scary and like even today like if I get into a fight with my sister or something like that she wants to put up her dukes and brawl and i'm like. We can we can disagree and talk about things without having to have this intensity that I don't know It just seems out of control, but I feel. yeah I feel like i'm out of control, when I tried to have too much emotion okay."
740.0,Provider,"But when you say out of control, when you have too much emotion, I would have a look like."
13443.0,Patient,"Well, you know what it is it's just that I I don't make sense, like you know when you're trying to resolve something like I can't think straight and I can't like say what I need to say because i'm so like emotional and. Just a bundle of nerves, you know what I mean, so I just feel like if somehow, even though we know that we're disagreeing that we could just talk about it somewhat calmly, you know. Not perfectly, but you know what I mean that that would."
740.0,Provider,"be helpful okay. i'm saying it. i'm so. How is your so you said basically it's just that, when you your sister come together, she basically starts those arguments one she wants the first about something. argue about something and so y'all have basically different temperaments. Definitely Okay, and did the hurt temperament sometimes called was you anxiety anxiety feeling free."
13443.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
740.0,Provider,So is there anybody else in your family they call during the attitude agree.
13443.0,Patient,"Oh yeah my mom definitely. But for different ways, like my sister. She gets angry really quickly until I can see it coming i'm like oh God, here it is you know what I mean. And so that causes me anxiety, but my mother bothers me because she's so out of touch with herself, that it is ridiculous, like the other day she said. my sister and I were there, and she said, oh you're so lucky to have a mom like me that doesn't like barge into. You know your lives or try to like you know give you opinions on what you should do and i'm thinking to myself what the hell. Like that's all you do, I was like how Could somebody be so blind to themselves, like i'm aware of my fault, you know I know that i'm impatient that sometimes i'm grumpy you know if I don't feel well you know watch out. That kind of thing but wow I just some of the things that she says, like all these years you have to interesting we've had in my family, we have a line of like food issues. So, like my grandma was bulimic my dad was just avenger and my sister and I binge also. But her being married to my dad for 55 years and driving him crazy about the food issue like she hasn't learned anything like the other day she says zoia just push back from the table push back from the table and like oh my God, if I could push back from the table, I would be healthy."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
13443.0,Patient,You know what I mean. Obviously there's more to it than that.
740.0,Provider,yeah.
13443.0,Patient,"But she thinks she's right, you know."
740.0,Provider,"Like family. mom is 80 years old. And she stays in the independent retirement home yes okay. make sense, so outside of your sister do you have any other siblings."
13443.0,Patient,No it's just awesome.
740.0,Provider,and growing it what were your parents together.
13443.0,Patient,"Yes, they fought a lot, but they stayed together they had made a commitment so."
740.0,Provider,"Anyone your home life struggle with I know you said, the food issue, but did anyone struggle with like mental health and substance abuse in your home life."
13443.0,Patient,"My dad was very depressed and anxious. Okay, exactly like me. i'm not I have more anxiety than depression that he dealt with the depression."
740.0,Provider,Oh quite a bit okay. and I don't think I don't think I heard it on me when.
13443.0,Patient,He passed away.
740.0,Provider,This last year okay i'm sorry to hear that.
13443.0,Patient,yeah Thank you. And in his mom my grandma was actually hospitalized for anxiety and depression wow.
740.0,Provider,So just a family cycle.
13443.0,Patient,"yeah that's what it is, I couldn't think of the right word but yeah it's it's totally in our family. anxiety depression and food issues."
740.0,Provider,"Okay i'm sorry I don't know what's going on mobile in a way, what was. What was school like for you."
13443.0,Patient,"um. You know I had a bad start in that my first grade teacher she she wouldn't be allowed to teach today for sure, because people are more aware of the situation, but she was a really like angry person and at that time for some reason I just wasn't ready to learn. So she used to scream and yell at me you're stupid you're a vegetable you'll never learn. Anything and the thing was is that I didn't have the same personality, as my sister my sister would have said screw you, you know what I mean look at me like I just believed what she said. And so all through my school years I don't think that I achieved what I could have achieved because I. kept on hearing that voice in my head, you know saying you're stupid, so I thought, if you're stupid why try and it wasn't until I went to college, and I only went. Honestly, to occupy my time because all my friends were going I didn't know what to do with myself. and on one of my first courses I got an A and I thought that's weird, how is it possible that somebody stupid could get an A and I started to kind of rethink what Maybe she had told me was not right."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, ruthless."
13443.0,Patient,"yeah it was pretty bad and I still remember her name from first grade her name was Mrs Fleming, and she was horrible."
740.0,Provider,But at least you were able to prove her wrong.
13443.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
740.0,Provider,Did you struggle with any learning disabilities.
13443.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything but. I do struggle if it's anything other than in person. Which is why. Sometimes, like the Tele thing is hard, because I don't know why I just I just feel like. i'm visual you know what I mean and. it's just easier to be able to ask a question of a person. hmm I don't know yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. um. Were there any, even if it asks you growing up either your neighborhood or your family or your friends. My anything that you can dislike the highlight of nothing a highlight. For like. Was it a good neighbor who you will be in with the blue collar white collar neighbor who was an impoverished neighborhood. You know how will your friends like you know something like that."
13443.0,Patient,"yeah it's funny it was definitely I would say, like lower middle. But what was funny was that there was a ton of kids on this particular street that we lived on. And we lost contact after we moved moved out of the neighborhood like in middle school, but they found us on Facebook and now we're back again as a group on Facebook, we have a meeting like once a month or so. And so it's kind of Nice to. You know, be able to establish relationships again with them as we're all adults now you know."
740.0,Provider,"Are they relationship, do you feel like keeping life, they are supportive relationships positive relationships. They build you up in don't tear you down."
13443.0,Patient,"yeah I mean there's one girl that is kind of the terror downer kind of but, most of them are good, in fact, it was funny one of them came out from Arizona. And you know to California to actually go to our dad's funeral which that's pretty amazing you know what I mean just to kind of support us and. Let us know, you know how she felt and. All that. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, did you ever serve in the military. yeah okay. And do you have any financial legal problems that you're concerned about anything that actually a viewing party outside of your family airport."
13443.0,Patient,"yeah I had a heart attack, a year ago and I didn't know that I had had one, so I went to the hospital for something totally different, and then they found that out, and I ended up having to have some stents put in. Now, because I had just gotten laid off due to cove it. I didn't have the insurance that I normally had so the insurance that I got I didn't realize they covered. hospitalizations but they didn't cover meetings with doctors, which is ridiculous, so my bill ended up being half a million dollars. Why, and without a job there's no way that I can pay that so I contacted everybody some worked with me some didn't, but I would say right now i'm at about maybe like 20,000 in debt. But it's just one of those things where i've decided, you know i'm not trying to get out of it, what I am trying to do is. pay what I can because I still haven't found a job and. Some of them are not taking that for an answer, like. One chick was like can you pay 300 i'm like what about not having a job, do you not understand. yeah you know."
740.0,Provider,So I deserve you.
13443.0,Patient,"Know pain little bits by little bits and hopefully that will. You know, as I do get a job you know what I mean i'll be able to pay more, but. yeah i'm not happy about that because I used to keep my credit like score really high and now it's down because you know, some of them sent me to creditors. You know that. kind of thing like I was always very careful and now I don't have any control."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, let me actually does the hospital you. As the hospital, you have operation it doesn't have like a charitable department, because every hospital gifts charity phones. yeah right I don't know if that's the way for you all in California, but it's the way down here down south. yeah and a lot of times because a lot of times share of hospitals, they have like fun, they have they get people donate to hospitals charity phone. And what i've learned is that sometimes you can call the charity department and let them know that you're unable to pay all your extenuating. extenuating circumstances and they'll actually pay your bill. mm hmm. Maybe there's something you can look into to see if it has any charity department."
13443.0,Patient,I mean they reduce the amount for which i'm grateful. yeah but you know I still have.
740.0,Provider,"A lot of analysis, a lot. yeah that's like a bad habit for another half."
13443.0,Patient,Before buying a car.
740.0,Provider,"buy the car cash off a lot okay. that's a lot so yeah chatter look into that and see if they have that as an option. I know this is a resource here, so I don't know if it's a resource as well, but you just you never know and they shape and don't let the people realize that they are manifesting Now let me speak to the charity that one. Because I have learned that that's what they do people donate funds to hospitals for charity, because, of course, you know, especially people who are very, very wealthy part of the attacks part off is that they donate to charity they they donate the hospital charity. And so. I just I know that is that i've had i've heard people do it who've had very high medical bills that they call the charity department and the charity department covered their bill so see if they have the state of California So hopefully they hopefully they can help out a little bit. How to ease the stress and the strain of them hassling me all the time for Monday, which you don't have."
13443.0,Patient,yeah I don't answer the phone if I don't know. The number I don't answer the phone.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, are you are you currently in a relationship no Okay, do you have any children. yeah okay. Who do you live it."
13443.0,Patient,roommate.
740.0,Provider,And what is something what are some of the things you would like to work on why you hating treatment.
13443.0,Patient,"um. I think. See it's hard, I mean my number one goal was the medication thing, and I did speak with a doctor Sharon steps. And what she did, because what was happening with me in the medication was. I was on something I don't even know how to pronounce it but it's called a seat a low pram I believe. And what was happening was that I could not sleep, sometimes I would go 24 hours awake because I just couldn't sleep. But I was thinking it was a medication that was causing me not to sleep, but what the doctor said was that she thought it was because it wasn't helping me enough, and therefore I couldn't sleep. So I never had thought about it that way. So she added something called trezza don't. OK, and now that i'm taking that that has helped a lot. Like it just. Like the other day I had taken my mom out and my mom just does some crazy things where she doesn't think about how it affects other people so she left something in my car and she absolutely needed it I had already gone home. And she absolutely needed it, so I had to drive all the way back you know, to give her what it was that she needed and normally that would like piss me off, you know, like Sometimes I feel like i'm on the edge with getting angry and I didn't I was just like. How do I feel about this i'm like you know not really feel anything yay it's working. yeah."
740.0,Provider,And i've been able to.
13443.0,Patient,"sleep and that helps to like be like rested. Oh, it helps so much because. I would just like in the middle of the day, then I would get all tired, I would take a nap and then that would throw off my my rhythm, you know what I mean and so now, I feel like i'm sleeping more normally which is nice."
740.0,Provider,yeah that's really good. i'm.
13443.0,Patient,"So so there's probably other coping mechanisms that I. can use other than the medication, but the medication takes the edge off of me so that maybe I don't. feel those same feelings like what I tend to do I tell my sister, and she thinks it's so funny I was like I do my lamaze breathing like in through the nose out with them out with the mouth when I get really like anxious, but it helps."
740.0,Provider,"yeah it does. And so we will I will work on that if you want to learn more coping skills to add to your toolbox absolutely work on it. I tell people all the time that the medicine is there to help manage it, but it doesn't take you still got to work, you know i'm saying so those coping skills are necessary but i'm very happy that you have been able to get on the proper medicine to actually help. You be being able to basically manage your day to day obligations, without being completely anxious. And you know so that's the that is a great thing, did you have anything else to add or anything else, that you can think of that you would like to discuss."
13443.0,Patient,"No, not really."
740.0,Provider,"Okay well do me a favor big issue I don't know if you I don't know if you had your group time yet, if you have your group say something."
13443.0,Patient,About you justin yesterday.
740.0,Provider,Okay awesome okay.
13443.0,Patient,"I couldn't go to the anxiety group which is usually the one that they would send me to. So they sent me to another group. That has people that have a different problem but i'm just. If I have to do it on going to do it, you know what I mean."
740.0,Provider,When you put them in a group why didn't why didn't they say today to invite a group. You know I. read it again.
13443.0,Patient,"You know what they they were trying to send me to Sharon steps as group. Right and her group is on Wednesday at like 11. You were, I think it and i'm in school Monday and Wednesdays until four."
740.0,Provider,Oh that's why I say that I do that group so usually people don't know my case little thing in my room.
13443.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, that makes sense well whenever your schedule gets free you're able to actually join anxiety group, then you know, let let let them know so that they could actually put you in the Group whenever you're able to do it. So we basically talked about strictly mostly only. anxiety, how to manage it, how to cope with it, and things like that. So my mission I will see you every other week right every other week. and So. Basically, I think you just call the virtual switch to book your next appointment man next week, but the week after. That I will see you there but, however, it is definitely a pleasure to meet you I look forward to working with you, moving forward. If you have any questions or any concerns or anything like that I will try my best to answer i'm i'm pretty new here myself. So I don't know too much, but if I don't know what I around to somebody to do this okay um other than that have a great weekend and I will see you well, I will see you in group because you don't have my group good so. How are you doing i'm a fishing."
13443.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,Thank you okay. Thank you have a good night.
