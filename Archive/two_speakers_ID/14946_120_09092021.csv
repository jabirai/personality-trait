120.0,Provider,"Alright, this is the initial intake bio psychosocial assessment for patient Shannon Baker. just getting set up here. Hello. How are you."
14946.0,Patient,Good.
120.0,Provider,Doing okay. yeah fine morning.
14946.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
120.0,Provider,trying to get organized here.
14946.0,Patient,I heard it's really early where you are so.
120.0,Provider,"Well i'm like. Yes, I I have my coffee though i'm good for a bit so. Anyway, i'm carefully it's good to meet you and i'm glad that you were able to. Like figure out this whole zoom thing, it can be a little weird at first."
14946.0,Patient,it's what I do for work is help a bunch of boomers in my organization navigate it so.
120.0,Provider,"So you're kind of okay well you're probably more than I did then, with all this so anyway um Have you ever done one of these assessments before and take assessments for."
14946.0,Patient,"and add ish so i've been trying to get into treatment and I filled out like 26 pages for place in louisville Kentucky and. They didn't want to take my insurance and. So that didn't work out So yes, but it was kind of on paper."
120.0,Provider,"What a mess that they got that far before they your insurance said that you know, like I like, can you tell me that 26 pages ago."
14946.0,Patient,I know right. And i'm I have some serious issues with the barriers to service for folks seeking help. yeah the whole system is broken.
120.0,Provider,yeah there's definitely a lot of of areas that need to be adjusted and figuring out how to do it.
14946.0,Patient,yeah I think step one is capacity building and making school for anybody who wants to be an lcs w or a psychiatrist or anything like that free. I think that would help. You know. My mother in law used to watch this show northern exposure. And it was about this guy who served in Alaska because he got you know if he did this for a certain amount of time he got free school and it's like well if you serve medicaid patients for X amount of time your school should be free.
120.0,Provider,"Well, is. It is here, it is like it if you give 10 years to medicaid, then it will get rid of your student debt. But."
14946.0,Patient,It is. Not that way in Kentucky.
120.0,Provider,"Oh really yeah I mean you got to work there for 10 years but. If that's something you can do. So for medicaid or not, you know, like a State funded thing or a nonprofit."
14946.0,Patient,"Well, the nonprofit thing is national because that's how i'm hoping to get my student loans gone."
120.0,Provider,"Yes, good luck with that. So, have a lot to. It you know. It is a challenge, though, for sure, but this is what we have right now, so I guess, we have to deal with what we have right now."
14946.0,Patient,"Well, and i'm talking to a person and so that's I mean i'm i'm really excited."
120.0,Provider,"cool well. So what this is basically is i'm just going to ask you a lot about you and kind of what you're looking for what the concerns are and. See if what we have to offer is something that feels like that it could be effective for you, and because we want to make sure that it's the right fit. For what you need and. And then, also a chance for you to ask questions about the program and kind of what what how it currently works are you interested in like just outpatient or are you wanting the I O p. And or is that kind of what we're talking about today."
14946.0,Patient,"I think at this point in it my therapist recommendation I O P, is the way to go."
120.0,Provider,So you said you're.
14946.0,Patient,Yes.
120.0,Provider,"Okay D, are they. Eating disorder specified by any chance. nope okay that's part of it probably part of the reason why you reached out to us right. yeah yeah okay."
14946.0,Patient,"And UK health care, which is like the biggest medical provider in the state of Kentucky doesn't have an eating disorder Program."
120.0,Provider,wow okay. So all right. um. So just to make sure i'm understanding you're currently seeing a therapist or not eating disorder specified and so they referred you to us feeling like you needed more support than what they could give you.
14946.0,Patient,yeah they.
120.0,Provider,That about right.
14946.0,Patient,"yeah her schedule is really packed so I can get in maybe once every two weeks, and then you know. it's just there's a lot going on, and you know right my crazy doesn't fit in a one hour session every two weeks, so I need more help."
120.0,Provider,"Right okay okay um so tell me a little bit about. Some spring up the stuff I need to ask you i'm kind of what led you to here like why now like was there kind of like I gotta be something different or i'm you know, having health problems or i'm you know my job being affected or that kind of thing."
14946.0,Patient,"Well, my everything's being affected um but and. i've struggled with eating disorders stuff in the past, and my PCP after 40 years in practice, decided that. rona was not something she wanted to deal with so she retired, you know yay her I think it's great you know you practice long time keep yourself safe enjoy your retirement, so I tried to find new. PCP and so June 2 I went to this PCP and. I knew I was being triggered. because she was talking to me about how fat I was. man. Really harping on my BMI and I explained to her that I really didn't like that conversation, and we really needed to shift gears because I have a history of anorexia which she then dismiss she's like but you're fat. Like you can't be a typical and you know, and so you know what I should have done it as end of the the appointment, but lacking the assertiveness in medical situations. I dealt with it and just kind of get it through it and you know she wanted to send me the weight loss clinic and so she was talking to me about this and I kept telling her it's like we really need to focus on something else, I have some concerns about my skin. You know I have this small blah blah and just not. Getting the hint anyways so that was terrible but thankfully I had therapy, the next day, and so I was able to kind of process that but. I immediately started restricting."
120.0,Provider,So it. impacted you like to. behaviors where you started shifting behavior.
14946.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah and so. And like. I want to want to not restrict. um. But that's like getting over that hump is really hard, and so you know my therapist I was talking to my therapist you know. two sessions later, and I was kind of stoked because I started dropping weight like crazy and that I was talking about grocery shopping and a sentence like this doesn't sound like you. she's like how much of the day, do you think about food planning food because I plan to avoid doing that's just kind of my mo."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14946.0,Patient,"And so you know obsessing over nutrient density and caloric density and all this kind of stuff and and it was it was like i'd be. Working and i'd be like we're getting my project, but then I was also researching ingredients and it's like well, what can I sub this for this, and this for this, and so it was literally like. On my mind 100% of the time. And she's like you know I know you struggled with this before Have you considered. Getting somebody specifically to deal with that and I said, you know. Yes, the last time I had a really bad relapse I was in college. Well, no, it was after that, but the most successful I was was, I was in college to be an RD and I ended up switching majors and doing something completely different but. You know, while I was in that program the program department head was a really great person, and you know I went to her, and I was like look, this is what i'm struggling with and she's like let's work together, and so it wasn't it wasn't like. specific treatment, it was I was going to student health for therapy and mid management and they were you know, I was working with the dietitian. And just to you know, make sure that I was okay and. Then you know, a couple years later lot of stress in my life I did it again and I had a therapist, who was a little bit more knowledgeable of the eating disorders and stuff like that, and so like. I didn't get as deep as i'm now. i'm because now i've completely gone off to the the trail i'm like. I am deep in the woods and so. yeah and you know jen's like my my therapist is is like well, I really think we need to look into finding you somebody that's eating disorder specific to supplement the therapy you're doing here. And so. I tried and tried and tried, I have been trying since. late July early August to get into a program. But you know i'm still restricting and i'm still like. Yesterday I got on the scale and it was one thing, and I was really stoked about it, and I was like happy excited and then, this morning I got on the scale and it was like two pounds more and, like my rational minds like that's what your body does. it's not static. it's going to do this. And, but then you know, then another part of my brain is like, no, no, no, no, like this, you can't do this, this is because X y&z the other day, because my birthday was Sunday. And my partner is trying to be supportive but. kind of just an asshole about it. You need to eat and i'm like Fuck you and I hope that languages and bother you because I have a potty mouth."
120.0,Provider,and hurt all the time okay.
14946.0,Patient,"And I don't even try to not I just have potty mouth it's it's part of who I am and i'm not gonna like I restrict too much other stuff in my life i'm not going to do that anyway um so. On my birthday, on Sunday, I ate more for lunch, I had like 950 calories for lunch, like my phone was taken away from me so that I couldn't like programming it because I usually logged ahead of time, so I know where i'm at."
120.0,Provider,Who took your phone away from you.
14946.0,Patient,"My kids. And they're like you're going to enjoy this. And I know it's it's coming from like a release we want to help kind of thing my kids range in age from two to 21. um but you know they just. So anyways I had like 950 calories for lunch, after having had 300 calories for breakfast to 41 for breakfast and you know and then after lunch like I didn't throw up. But, like, I felt so bad, and then I almost passed out and then end up napping for like four and a half hours so i'm like okay I can't just start eating again, this is obviously a problem, though."
120.0,Provider,and tell me when the you know the sounds like the main trigger was when you switch PCP when was that.
14946.0,Patient,June 2.
120.0,Provider,"To second so um. So, most of this is really kind of started to spiral, since then, is that right."
14946.0,Patient,"yeah because, like, I was in remission like I had not relapsed in a couple of years. Like i've had another. kid i'm you know everything was going why I was like my you know regular fruit flavor of crazy and i'm you know dealing with childhood trauma stuff and all that kind of stuff but going to the doctor like she got in my kitchen. And it really. I mean so like I still have an appointment with the weight loss clinic in October. And I didn't cancel it because I figured if I can couldn't get into any treatment program at least they might be able to hook me up with a dietitian or something like that to you know repeat in some way but i've lost 39 pounds since June 2. Which academically I know is problematic and. Not so good, but you know again there's this part of me that's like yeah. So."
120.0,Provider,it's the two sides of yeah the one side is like happy their sides like oh crap.
14946.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,good thing yeah.
14946.0,Patient,yeah so okay.
120.0,Provider,"yeah your body is probably pretty confused right now. um. Alright, so. So, you said you have a history of anorexia when did when did that start was that kind of. Like. teenage years younger. yeah i'd be college having a relapse but."
14946.0,Patient,"So yeah like it through. middle school high school um. And and back then I would purge because it was easier because my parents would notice other things, but they were also the ones that said, you know you'd be prettier if."
120.0,Provider,"So at that time you you kind of. bounced around with restriction and purging. yeah and kind of dabbled a little bit and, like all. The different things yeah yeah that's more common, I think, then any then most like people don't usually have one that's just always be easier."
14946.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,to jump around so okay and but you never got any help with that point.
14946.0,Patient,"No, no, no things at home are crazy and."
120.0,Provider,"college was kind of the first time, when you reached out and we're like something is off with me. Okay. um. And so right now it's primarily restriction you're not are you purging right now."
14946.0,Patient,I have once um.
120.0,Provider,It can be.
14946.0,Patient,"As yeah one since June. i'm because it's a whole lot easier for me to restrict there's like there was. it's kind of like a high like you're winning. When when you can do that, and so."
120.0,Provider,It is.
14946.0,Patient,And so. I like the rush of getting to the point where you're not hungry anymore like you're so hungry your body's just like well Fuck it's not going to feed me let's just move on.
120.0,Provider,Right. Now that's that addictive part of it for sure. yeah um do you ever binge.
14946.0,Patient,and
120.0,Provider,Like feel like you lost control with food.
14946.0,Patient,"I have really good discipline like there was that one time between June, and now that I, you know I did, I just wanted to eat. junk food and I did, and then I felt. Like a complete and total failure, and you know. that's why yeah. yeah okay."
120.0,Provider,"Okay um, so I do you ever use any other types of complex dettori methods like laxatives diet pills. You know society of excessively exercise."
14946.0,Patient,"know so I have mobility issues because i'm multiple sclerosis. Okay, and I have a mtl sprain in my left knee so i'm kind of hobbled. And so I can't do that I used to do that oh my gosh exercising is the thing because, like you can. Anyway, and but like I don't have that option, which I think is why i'm restricting so. I don't want to say so well, but you know i'm i'm sticking with that. right because there's no well if I do this, then I can like I have no compensation. is just let's see if I can keep it under 600 a day right right okay."
120.0,Provider,So is that kind of about what you're hanging out is 600 a day.
14946.0,Patient,"well. Between 600 and 1000 and so, like, I have to be seen eating so i'll graze throughout the day. and"
120.0,Provider,"You have to be seeing eating by. Family oh so they're trying to hold you accountable, a little bit."
14946.0,Patient,Which is really aggravating and i'm always angry.
120.0,Provider,And it's yeah it's tough because that's you know puts them in a weird spot.
14946.0,Patient,"yeah it's like look, I know you mean well but leave me the Fuck alone."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
14946.0,Patient,And i've gone to lying about where I am with my calories because you know my partners like hey we're yet today so far and i'm like oh i'm almost there i'm gonna have a yogurt and we're gonna have a boiled egg and i'll be fine and you know not really.
120.0,Provider,"Right right okay um. Do you feel like you're trying to reach some magical weight, or do you feel like like i'm just curious as to where you're leading like are you like, I have to get to the size mental even normal again or."
14946.0,Patient,"and see here's the thing, where I have trouble with treatment like I want treatment, but I also want to continue to lose weight, because I do have that goal, like. When I was college, it was I was a non traditional students, so I already had kids and all that kind of stuff but. You know my partner even tells me like back then you weren't happy with the way you looked either, but like I look back at those photos and say, I want to be fat again, if I can get to like 161 65 i'll be happy because i'll be able to look at a photo of myself."
120.0,Provider,So you kind of have this like magical.
14946.0,Patient,"And it's not it's not like stupid crazy, I mean it's not like you know. My bones showing, although I would very much like to see my collarbone again. that's one thing that's really important to me like my classical stuck out and it was so awesome and."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you get kind of obsessed with some particular piece and evidence that somehow you're good enough. Oh let's see so. Do you have any idea of what your body naturally wants to hang out at me do you mean do you think that, like, if you look at like genetically. I was just kind of curious if you."
14946.0,Patient,"Care myself to anybody in my family because. i'm from upstate New York and I don't know if you know much about there, but the people there are really short. Okay, like my dad was five three my mom was five nothing, I know that my mom to me seems to have a normal body. But like she died because she was on diet pills and asthma, medicine and the combinations not good, in her heart gave out. that's not the official cause of death. But like I saw the diet pills in her purse, so I knew."
120.0,Provider,"that's what I needed help. yeah okay okay um. So I guess when you were like prior to June 2 were you eating in a pretty normal way or were you bingeing or I mean or do you even have any idea what that means now. Or was it were you like okay with things and then suddenly somebody commented on it and you suddenly thought Oh, I need to lose a bunch of weight."
14946.0,Patient,"And then, if they knew I wasn't happy with my body, but I wasn't actively trying to do anything on in your life."
120.0,Provider,Like it is now.
14946.0,Patient,"Right like it was literally like a switch flipped and obsessing about how many calories in how many calories out, you know, and now I know that you know my. My resting calories and everything like I don't know what my calories out are anymore, because my body's like freaking out because i've restricted for so long. And so, like my brain is telling me, maybe you need to restrict more because your metabolism stroke slow down. And, but like before my meeting with her, you know I had gotten to a place where. I wasn't happy with my body I don't think i've ever been happy with my body like I can look back and say that is the ideal, but I know my partner even said you were not happy, then too. So you know, and I was getting up at 430 and morning and going to the gym and doing all those things, and you know. i'd spend 45 minutes. On the elliptical and then do strength, training and you know, I was there, five days a week, and you know and and and and so, but like and my life as it is right now, and with the pandemic and all that kind of stuff I just kind of. You know. I was. surviving. mm hmm and so wait wasn't that big of a deal until it became a big deal."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay um. i'm just just do you think it's an interesting you know sudden shift like you said it was kind of overnight. When you were kind of Okay, and then suddenly I mean you are not necessarily like I love my body, but, most people aren't most people are kind of like well it is what it is, and I have to go to work, you know kind of. yeah because you know and that's I think more of a balanced way of living, because you know our bodies are constantly in a state of flux and you know we have to figure out something else that we measure as our source of contentment in life, besides our body."
14946.0,Patient,Right and I was just so focused on keeping myself and my family safe because.
120.0,Provider,I.
14946.0,Patient,"You know there wasn't a vaccine i'm immune compromised all this kind of stuff and you know that was taking up most of my bandwidth. And now we're so used to curbside pickup for groceries don't hang out with friends don't do all this, like so the survival part doesn't take as much bandwidth."
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah yep no that makes sense, and so you have a little bit more space to obsess about food and body okay um you mentioned. You know, having Ms and a knee issue, do you have any other like kind of underlying medical things that are like chronic Okay, and have you had have you been noticing if your hair's falling out or. Yes."
14946.0,Patient,"Okay, that is the absolute worst. And like you probably can't tell. The color of my hair via zoom but, like my hair is always brightly colored and so it's really obvious that it's everywhere."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay so yeah so you've been noticing that for sure what about like. blood pressure, like you get dizzy when. slow down."
14946.0,Patient,"yeah no and they took my blood pressure. At my neurologist the other day. And they're like ooh that's low, and it was like 90 over 60 or something like that. And i'm just like yeah I run low."
120.0,Provider,"Is that. Is that lower than normal, though, for you, oh."
14946.0,Patient,"God, yes I don't actually run low I just didn't want to get in that conversation."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay that's that's why no, it was it changed because a lot of people do run, though, like, I know I do, and my mom does so."
14946.0,Patient,yeah no I don't and I have been having dizzy spells.
120.0,Provider,"Or the static when you stand and sit like it changes, you get the. yeah this dark spot yeah Okay, and what about like menstruation do you as your period different."
14946.0,Patient,i'm perimenopausal I mean.
120.0,Provider,there's hard to know.
14946.0,Patient,"yeah i'm 42 years old, who knows."
120.0,Provider,"But yeah does it know if you know is that just another symptom of you know your body really struggling nutritionally. that's how I was asked about that because um. You know, things like that hair loss or you know or statics Those are all evidence of your body saying hope, be something is off. yeah but."
14946.0,Patient,yeah i'm a regular but i've been a regular for the last two years.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're regularly your regular. Like nothing shifted that way."
14946.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean it shows up and i'm like Oh, but i've also had five kids so I always have a panty liner in because if you sneeze you're in trouble."
120.0,Provider,Right yeah.
14946.0,Patient,or no amount of key goes little get that better.
120.0,Provider,"yeah for sure Okay, and how how tall, are you. Five seven Okay, and do you know your current weight and you said you weighed yourself, so you must."
14946.0,Patient,"yeah so it went up this morning, so it's 221."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was what what has been like the range of like what's been your highest weight and like when was that."
14946.0,Patient,To 56.2 on June 2.
120.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and then what about on the lower end where it's been like a low wait for you."
14946.0,Patient,and
120.0,Provider,As an adult like maybe since college.
14946.0,Patient,165 ish.
120.0,Provider,Okay.
14946.0,Patient,I might have gotten down to 140 I was wearing a size eight pants and it was amazing.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah your your body has had to shift back and forth a lot of sounds like. Are you how do you feel about getting rid of the scale we willing to."
14946.0,Patient,"Well, I purchased it and secret at first. Because I knew I shouldn't have it i'm. I don't know if i'm ready for that. I just. Like I want to want to."
120.0,Provider,"know that feeling I yeah oh yeah I get that feeling I get that feeling and you know. any reason to get better as a good reason, and so you know, I would just recommend to you that you really focus on why. You want to be different like, why do you want to be in a more balanced state with food like what are the motivators you know because there's always going to be reasons to stay sick."
14946.0,Patient,you'll always. I don't want to stroke out and die because I know my partner couldn't handle all the kids.
120.0,Provider,"And and it's a reality, you can strike out sure stroke out and die from this kind of thing."
14946.0,Patient,yeah I know you know.
120.0,Provider,"it's the reality and you can't say oh just kidding after that's done. yeah nurture shock, you know so um but yeah you have to kind of do this constant reminder of why you're in this is an investment in yourself you're not going to see if you're not gonna you're not going to suddenly want to get better that doesn't usually happen. So I can like i'm suddenly you know it's it's a struggle for a long time, and then it becomes hopefully a new way of living. You know. i'm so very worried about weight very worried about shape so very poor body image, how do you feel about your body, right now, like do you feel like oh my gosh it's horrible I need to lose more weight or. Are you like you know what i'm trying to be kind to it i'm trying to take care of it."
14946.0,Patient,i'm lumpy and gross.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so feeling pretty bad about current body image."
14946.0,Patient,"yeah like I try to avoid mirrors this point because, like. And i've never had a good relationship with my body, but like I am literally disgusted by myself and the view of myself and like i'll look in mirrors that are like neck up only. because all of this, and like I don't even like riding in the car, because the side view mirror shows the little like fold right here behind boobs and under my arm and it's like."
120.0,Provider,"Oh, and and and most of this has gotten. significantly worse since June like prior to that you still had it, but it wasn't as intense."
14946.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I wasn't happy with my body, then, but again, you know, I was in survival mode and that was. Not the most important thing and. You know it's just like. A balloon popped and it's like this is the imminent threat. This is, after I talked to the doctor yeah."
120.0,Provider,"All right, um do you have current food rules like I can't eat sugar I can't eat fat I can't eat carbs like what are the things that are the scariest for you."
14946.0,Patient,"So. You it it didn't start this way like. I got news to track. And because I thought Oh well, this is the healthiest way because they keep saying no bad foods blah blah blah. And like they. Created foods, based on calorie density, they have colors there's green yellow and red and like you have 300 calories with red, you can have you know blah blah blah. But my brain associates anything that red category. As no stop don't warning."
120.0,Provider,Anything that's kind of more calorically dense.
14946.0,Patient,Anything calorically dense it's like nah and I pretty much have a food script right now so like i'll eat overnight outs with cinnamon but no sugar. And it's oats in oat milk. and hard boiled eggs. i'm. Sure bonnie vanilla yogurt. Gala apples. and If my partner surprises me and makes. sausage and eggs. out eat that. i'll have a sausage about Devon sausage patty and two scrambled eggs. And the Bob Evans sausage is in the red zone so like I won't eat. As much like the eggs will be like the only thing in the yellow zone that i'll eat that day i'll just stick to fruit and yogurt for the rest of the day.
120.0,Provider,"you're always compensating for. yeah I think that you consider it as a higher color. Get dense food okay yeah all right, how do you do with eating around other people like are you a willing to eat in group in a group setting. And not like wanting to hide and things like that."
14946.0,Patient,"I don't hide to eat and, like my house is a really open floor plan so i'll go into the dining room to eat an apple or yogurt and I kind of want to be seen eating, because then people leave me the Fuck alone. And then my birthday, I was at my mother in law's House and my oldest has made kraemer lay instead of a birthday cake for me. And I knew ahead of time that was going to be a bad food, but it was my birthday, and I was just going to do it and make him happy and you know, so I did that and then.

And so, like there's this constant like my therapy session this morning with my regular therapist was all about the interpersonal shift between my spouse and parents and all that kind of stuff and then my family is out of the picture my mom died in 96. I don't really talk to my dad I haven't talked to my brother, since the pulse shooting. Because they're still all in the thick of. Their cold."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so you just have one brother. So you pretty much know you're pretty much completely separated from them at this point."
14946.0,Patient,yeah I mean I mean an occasional text guilt text from my biological dad you know i've really relied on shows and family yes okay.
120.0,Provider,Okay i'm. Already. So this is somebody already i'm just looking through these questions. Have you how long you been married for.

120.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, I was just trying to understand that."
14946.0,Patient,No it's okay we're being their house. And so I am queer non binary okay he's queer SIS mail.
120.0,Provider,"All right, because I just want to be as respectful as I can about using the right pronouns."
14946.0,Patient,know the right ratio.
120.0,Provider,That no.
14946.0,Patient,I do another thing that that doctor on June 2 didn't get.
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah and. Like times I mess up but I try i've tried really hard to not so.
14946.0,Patient,Well that's okay and that's why I put my pronouns in my zoom name.
120.0,Provider,I noticed that and I was like thank you for. doing that because.
14946.0,Patient,it's just it makes it easier. Because I mean. How we're socialized and you know. You get. So focused on certain pronouns and certain assumptions and I have a very feminine voice.
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay um. But you had also said that you were attracted to females, and so wasn't sure if."
14946.0,Patient,If yeah no I totally get it.
120.0,Provider,"that's i'm just confused so but as long as you're happy and you love the person you love that's for me, I mean."
14946.0,Patient,Most of the time I love that person.
120.0,Provider,Sometimes I mean if that's true with any relationship. Are things pretty good with your kids you putting a relationship with them.
14946.0,Patient,"um yeah yeah and it helps that all but the almost three year old is in therapy. Like that's one of the things that was really important to me it's like Okay, they have health insurance skin therapy sure. yeah because the older ones, you know when they were young. My spouse and I were not in treatment because we didn't have health insurance and so. When you have when I mean mental illness is traumatic and when you live with people with mental illnesses that aren't diagnosed and aren't treated that's traumatic so my Bigs I do I have there's kind of like the Bigs and littles. The Bigs had a rough childhood. Right it really did, and so I wanted to make sure they're in therapy and and then phoebe. i'm a FAB non binary. which was really weird because they they came out to us as i'm not a girl, and when they were like five."
120.0,Provider,And this is the eight year old. yeah okay.
14946.0,Patient,"And, and so that was very interesting to navigate. And like I didn't I didn't use the term non binary and use the pronouns until probably eight to 10 months ago, because I just consider myself letter butch. Like i'm just gender non conforming blah blah blah Okay, but know that that, and you know my little kid taught me it's like yeah you know what that fits and so it's really interesting how much we can learn from our own kids. um but yeah so so they're in therapy and that's one of those things that. You know, is really important, but I think that really helps our relationship, especially me in the Bigs because the 17 year old boy. has an ADHD diagnosis and a mood disorder unspecified but then there's also that childhood trauma piece, and so like with him in therapy he and I have been getting closer. And we're talking about things. We it's still a little bit hard. With my partner in him. But it's a process. right though right."
120.0,Provider,"All right, um and then. kind of more currently, you said you work for nami. Yes, what do you do for them."
14946.0,Patient,"I am communications and development. cool oh I shout from the rooftops and ask people for money. And I didn't know they existed in till probably three years ago, a friend of mine said. hey i'm going to go to this nami class called family to family and."
120.0,Provider,"I think Eastern state hospital and i'm scared because that's our mental hospital and she's like i'm scared please come with me, and so I went and it."
14946.0,Patient,"Literally saved my life awesome. And so I was working for different nonprofit at the time, and we had an americorps vista program, and so I reached out to their director, I was like you guys need a vista let's make this happen, you need help, we need to get this going. You capacity built because I didn't know you existed and then you know, a couple years later i'm like okay. Just hire me, and so I left my job they didn't have an opening I just went to them and said I just gave them a pitch and i'm like this is what I can do for you, and this is what i'm going to do for you, and this is how much you're gonna pay me to do it and they're like okay."
120.0,Provider,let's do it cool sweet. yeah cool.

120.0,Provider,You said you switched it yeah.
14946.0,Patient,"I switched it, so I was doing my observation with a Community dietitian and it was just one of those Aha moments, and so I switched to sustainable agriculture, with an emphasis in food justice. And because this lady was like you need to do this, you need to this and the lady I was watching her like all of her emotions on our face and. At the end, she was like you think I want to feed my children shit, let me tell you what it's like. And she's like I have to walk over a mile on a busy road to get to a bus stop with three children under five and then I have to go grocery shopping, then I have to get a mile back on this busy road carrying all these groceries. With three children under five she's like are you going to come watch my kids so I can go to the grocery because i'm not leaving them with the crackhead next door. And i'm just it was just one of those things where it was like."
120.0,Provider,saw this other piece of it.
14946.0,Patient,"For sure and i'm like food justice is where it's at and so that's what I was doing. And I did that, and then I did americorps vista and that was at a dv program here in lexington and then I was told hey you need to come, be a vista leader at this other Program. And I I just kind of like I was still doing food justice work on the side, but that I was doing this whole nonprofit thing. And then I did, then I was running the americorps vista program and then I went to nami and so it's like everything that's happened in my my guardian spirits have gone to be haggard. Because i've bounced everywhere and it's like oh my gosh."
120.0,Provider,"How about friends, do you have do you feel like you have a good social support, or do you feel kind of like you're pretty isolated, I mean i've covered changed a lot of things for people."
14946.0,Patient,"it's changed a lot of things. We had we had a. Contact cluster at the beginning. So we had these families there were like two families that we would hang out with, and you know our kids are friends, they live in the same neighborhood but we're not like close close."
120.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14946.0,Patient,"So there is a relationship, and I would say we're friends. But we're not close friends. Okay, like I don't get close with people."
120.0,Provider,Okay um and then you talked about a lot of trauma do you have like history of like sexual abuse or physical abuse and definitely a lot of emotional abuse you specifically mentioned.
14946.0,Patient,um yeah so. Physical abuse mental emotional abuse and. You know. I was farmed out to 26 year old when I was a sophomore in high school so that's sexual abuse messed up crusher.
120.0,Provider,and your password I can agree to that.
14946.0,Patient,"Well, their reasoning on that. And I was so angry when I found out later that, like, I just wanted to get away like I wanted to get away. From my family because I knew it was dangerous and so. They thought that if they didn't signed me over to this person, and let me get moved to Arizona with this person that I was just going to run away anyway, and never make contact again."
120.0,Provider,This was a person somebody that you. Like that you knew of or was it some stranger.

120.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14946.0,Patient,"Everything kind of happened in quick succession, after that, like once I got away, but I found out later that my parents had the option to send me to live. In binghamton New York was just an hour away, but it was like a fresh start whatever in a very healthy family. And they didn't even bring that to me as an option, and so, when I found out that later I was really upset it's like I just wanted to get out. And you guys did this thing instead of this thing. and"
120.0,Provider,You grow up.
14946.0,Patient,To be charitable to them. But I can't.
120.0,Provider,"So you grew up in New York, then right."
14946.0,Patient,yeah I grew up in New York.
120.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14946.0,Patient,"I left New York, when I was 16 I actually moved to Kentucky. With somebody I met in an AOL chat room like I said garden speeder it's totally haggard there are so many things that should have killed me I should be chopped in the woods, you know totally decompose by now um. But yeah and. Then ended up not working out and so, then I left there and lovely lady in lexington who's now my chosen mom took me in help me finish high school. You know, told Tom to back off my my spouse, because we were dating and. shana needs to focus on school, you need to not show up more than once a week I mean it was hilarious. yeah we were so mad, but it was."
120.0,Provider,Like now right. Tom now.
14946.0,Patient,Tom Tom is myself.
120.0,Provider,Okay okay. All right. um. Do you have what you need financially he have access to food or is that an issue.
14946.0,Patient,And we have access to food.
120.0,Provider,"There I mean you're not a problem okay. All right, because sometimes I can be a factor to people um What do you do for fun, do you have any hobbies that are not related that are just that you like doing."
14946.0,Patient,"Yes, and no So yes, because I do a lot of fiber arts, I like to so I like to crochet I like to knit I haven't really been doing that."
120.0,Provider,"So you'd like to but you just have been doing it because this is bandwidth. bandwidth yeah okay. um. Alright well that's all the questions I have for you, and so let me tell you a little bit about kind of what the program is, and I want you to see."
14946.0,Patient,If.
120.0,Provider,The repairs are crazy. If. You feel like. They.
14946.0,Patient,Did That would be a good fit.
120.0,Provider,"I mean. My main my main concerns it my my gut is telling me that you probably need a higher level of care that that's what my gut is telling me for what it's worth, and the reason why is because you're really stuck in an ambivalence you know, like you, you want to get better, but you don't and. And when you're in an I O P that especially a virtual one is you're very like we're here we meet three times, or we do groups three times a week. But you're kind of on your own in regards to being managed like like you have to be able to eat on your own, you have to be able to get rid of a scale. You know you have to be able to you know do some of those things which are freaking terrifying for you right now. You know, and so the purpose of a higher level of care is to kind of it's kind of like going to rehab it kind of takes away the thing for a little bit. And then, using us as a step down from a higher level, because right now using it's a step up. which makes it you're right here and you're like I need more containment and more support, which is step up, and I think we could try but Mike My concern is that you're going to want to start lying you're going to want to start like because that's the nature of the disorder. Right, you know and it's not a bad about you that's just what it does so that's that's one thought. Especially since your you know your families, you know already you're trying to eat just to please them, you know i'm worried, you would eat just to please us okay and."
14946.0,Patient,Would I be eating.
120.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean, do you think you can like if because it we only wants together a week. So, in a in an impatient, you would be eating every meal with structure for somebody."
14946.0,Patient,"So here's my thing. I don't have access to anything else, and I do want to get better. But i'm also really i've been in therapy for a really long time so i'm hyper aware of myself and my tendencies and I am you know trauma background i'm a people pleaser mm hmm and so like. I want to do things and make people proud of me, especially when there's this like doctor patient relationship there's like this, you know. This i've got to please the higher up in the power stroke."
120.0,Provider,Power differential yeah yeah.
14946.0,Patient,"And I know I need help, and this is my shot. Like it's not this or an Inpatient program there is no Inpatient Program."
120.0,Provider,What interest you have.
14946.0,Patient,At no medicaid.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's a medicaid you know, and they are well and the word here here's a weird thing about medicaid is every other medicaid. won't pay for I O P, they pay for Inpatient or outpatient that's what we hate about medicaid is that they wait till you're sick enough to eat impatient, but they won't pay anything in the middle. So that's interesting that yours is different, is your medicaid you have a care manager that that."
14946.0,Patient,"sent you, the only way like i've been trying to get in treatment trying to get in treatment, since. Like the end of June I knew that I was going to spiral I recognize that this is a problem. And so I talked to my therapist like the day after, I was triggered i'm like this is going to be a problem. We need to get ahead of this now. Because I knew. I knew I felt these feelings before and i'm very self aware. And you know I I was running into all these roadblocks and, finally, I talked to my friend who works for ma che so mental health America Kentucky. And she said, you need to call anthem and get a case manager, so I called anthem, and I said the words I guess, they were magic words I don't want to die. and"
120.0,Provider,"The NASA do you have UFC of anthem. anthem Oh, I think that, no, no, mine okay medicaid medicaid okay."
14946.0,Patient,"And so I said I don't want to die, I had a I had I got a case manager, the very next day. And I said look I need treatment, I need treatment now help me find something, and you guys were literally, the only place. That would take their payment at their reimbursement rate. Okay, and like. If there was an Inpatient nearby you know great but there isn't, and so I would have to literally abandon my job."
120.0,Provider,"My kid well that's usually what for most people that's what it is, you have to leave everybody and go somewhere, because a lot, I mean it sucks but that's kind of what impatient is is."
14946.0,Patient,"Right, I would have to leave the state."
120.0,Provider,Right like.
14946.0,Patient,There is nothing.
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14946.0,Patient,"And so I want to try this and, and you know if if it means I have to make a video of me throwing my scale away at in the dumpster at a store three blocks away, I will do that."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
14946.0,Patient,I don't like it. But if that's what's going to get me in.
120.0,Provider,"i'll do it kind of what the expectations tend to be is. You know, following a meal plan which is going to be eating, you know six times a day three meals three snacks. Usually, they start out with three meals, you know until you can get you know more able to you know, to follow that and it's and and it's got to be you know pretty much on your own and bigger because no one's watching you, you know, obviously. you're not purging so that's great you're not having to fight that right now. And then. Like we do require you to do, especially with a restriction to do labs like once or once a week or once every two weeks, depending on what the dietitian recommends and and again like you know not weighing yourself, but we still need weights and so you have to go to a doctor."
14946.0,Patient,To get that he's blind wait.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah all that, just so you have to you know sound backwards and all that, and then you know and and also you know you might stumble upon the number and you have to be able to not freak out, you know you have to be able to you know, and we are not a weight loss Program. yeah you know we're going to be we're not going to be talking about losing weight and we're going to be talking about moderation that's always the goal. Is um you know is getting your body in this in a place where you can function at you know the best quality of life that you can kind of thing so um and so that."
14946.0,Patient,would be more important than 165.
120.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah. So that's my main main again my get feels higher level of care, but I recognize that you not sure that you have that but it's kind of like the thing of. Like if you had cancer, you need to go to an oncologist you can't get your primary care and say, I have no other options, the primary care doesn't they don't have the ability to help you if you have cancer, you know so it's kind of I like that a little bit. But I also get that you really want to that you're motivated and want to you know get the help The other thing that you might consider. Is will they pay for a dietitian."
14946.0,Patient,"No dietitian here. So, like. I call the place here called Blue blue grass nutrition and. They gave me the codes for insurance and my insurance, yes, those codes are covered, but that particular provider. isn't there out of network."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
14946.0,Patient,"So, like I have gone down every road that I can find."
120.0,Provider,"Okay um because that that's The other thing is most insurances you know won't I mean I don't know how medicaid in your area works, most of them. kind of require you to exhaust doing outpatient first with it eating disorder therapists and into our dietitian before they'll pay for a program because it's cheaper. And how insurances. And so I don't know what yours is going to say, but if yours is already contracted with bright heart at I O p. They may already have something arrange that way. So that's another factor that might be. A speed bump might want some roadblocks be but whatever metaphor, you want us but there might be an issue is sometimes they do that, but if you're. My already have a contract I don't know and it sounds like from what you said that they might, and that would be unusual, but that would be awesome if they do."
14946.0,Patient,"ya know so my case manager. Like as soon as amanda sent me stuff. I signed the Roi for my case manager at anthem. And i'm like we need to fast track this because I finally got through to everybody on Friday before Labor day and i'm like it's a three day weekend I want to get everything moving, I want to get better. Right and so, like all that's done so now we're, to the point where assessment and data."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah okay okay um so and then the other thing that I don't have an answer to right now is I don't know if we have a therapist licensed in Kentucky right now, because what we do what we've been doing, like i'm licensed in 11 different states Kentucky is not one of mine. So I have to see what other therapists who's licensed aware and we recently brought in to other therapists 13 disorders best therapists. And I don't know if they're licensed in Kentucky because you know the rules are when the social or that therapy world. Is that you have to be licensed in the state of the patient resides. So we have to have someone that's, even though our program is out of California like I live in utah everyone lives like we have people in Ireland therapist in Ireland, I have a therapist in North Carolina they're all in different places. But if you license to your state, and so I have to find out what that and see what dietitian and every state has different rules, which is such a headache because I wish they had like a national thing. Like psychologists do, but it is what it is um so I have to find out to what the status of that is because I don't remember working with patient on Kentucky before from my experience. And so I don't know if we have one already so that is also a factor I mean but we'll do that we can get we can begin that process. But that also gets slowed down by the state, as far as because some say oh yeah you can start working with a preliminary license or provisional license. Other one say no, it has been your hot little hand before you can do anything because, like Alaska was like that, because Alaska takes six months to do anything and because I have that one and that one said, you could start with this preliminary thing because they know that they're slow. But I don't know the rules were in touch with kentucky's, we have to look into that so that could potentially be another factor and that's why. You know I want you to have the help sooner than later. So what I think what i'll what i'm going to do is i'll talk to amanda and. we'll go gotta I gotta find out from our director what who is licensed in Kentucky and see what the status of that and what the processes, because that's sometimes a bit of a pain in the ass to to deal with. And then, because the value of. Well i'm another thing too with that bluegrass whatever nutrition counseling you mentioned. yeah i'm frequently if there's not if there's no providers in your area, then they have to provide something. So sometimes they'll do a civil case agreement, but I don't know if you already looked at that at that or if you're a care manager, because it seems like your case manager should have looked into that if they you know."
14946.0,Patient,"Well, and I talked to them prior to getting in case manager, like my case my bed let's do this and told me to contact you all."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah okay well, let me do my homework, a little bit and reach out to amanda and see if they do if it is true that they pay for I O P, without having done outpatient first because frequently that's kind of what they do. And again it's I i'm impressed that they actually. will pay for it, because most of them are like I mean we've been pushing on that for especially California pushing on that for a long time in California so for customer. Their medicaid is. So all the different but."
14946.0,Patient,"As far as the regulations and certifications. i'm pretty connected so Eric freelander is appointed, the Secretary of the Cabinet for health and family services, so if that's the Cabinet, because the licensure goes through, we might be able to through nami because I know my boss."
120.0,Provider,"yeah and I don't have any idea because I haven't looked at licensure for Kentucky so I don't know what department, it is I don't know. yeah that's."
14946.0,Patient,"But like if amanda asks or anything like that you know. Okay, I do know the secretary that cabinet so."
120.0,Provider,"Right okay good we. Wait I was gonna say one other thought I had that set my mind and then came back was with nami would would they be willing to help you pay for impatient. Because I mean they love you you work for them, and I mean because you probably would fall off because a lot of these places have scholarships and yeah probably would qualify."
14946.0,Patient,"But here's the thing I work in development and so like I know what's money's coming in, and I would never asked that of my org. Because that money has somewhere, it needs to go like we have a mental health diversion court, and you know, there are people that it's literally keeping out of jail."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
14946.0,Patient,"And so, like I wouldn't feel personally comfortable asking for that."
120.0,Provider,"Right Okay, but in the meantime, you also might look at I cant rember the name of that. Oh, there was what I said. My coworker talking about her but it's a. Another source of scholarship money for treatment for peak because you know you're you're not alone in this boat, of not having the resources for it and having kind of this medicaid circle of. All the different pieces that exist and My guess is that the maybe one of the reasons why you are medicaid was playing playing well with bright hard is because you don't have any other thing in your area."
14946.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, and since we're virtual but another thing too that's it that's Another factor is since coven started a lot of programs are now virtual that before we were the only ones. And so we actually lost a bunch of business when Colin happened because everyone else, like the bigger programs like ERC the really big programs. have other options, now that they didn't before."
14946.0,Patient,Right and Kentucky has really embraced telehealth.
120.0,Provider,"really good. Oh, my gosh good."
14946.0,Patient,They they they are doing all kinds of stuff and they're like helping people get internet access and all kinds of stuff.
120.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah yeah.
14946.0,Patient,Good though Kentucky is loving. Tele health.
120.0,Provider,"and helping them good cool, so let me find out about the licensing stuff and double check on the insurance stuff to you know, to see if there is an option for. A higher level of care, and the reason why i'm pushing that is not because I don't believe in you it's not that but it's just you, you make. it's like jumping the line and treatment, you make a lot more progress, a lot quicker in that kind of a setting, something that would take six months, sometimes and I op could take a month and patient."
14946.0,Patient,i'm willing to do anything. Okay i'm willing to do anything and like I said.
120.0,Provider,If I believe if.
14946.0,Patient,"I fail if I have to throw my my scale i'll make a video, if I have to I mean. i'll do whatever it takes, so please don't. Tell me know because you don't think i'll do it."
120.0,Provider,"Well, no it's, not that I don't I stop that you don't. want to it's just that. it's just from the experiences, when you know you're going from being very in a very sick place right now. and trying to. Like. Like I just feel like you might need more support, but i'll let me see what the options are because, like I say I think if it is like. you're you would just make progress quicker in that I mean impatient sucks i've been there i'm recovered myself, it was 20 years ago, but you know it sucks but man, it does get you on track quicker and get your brain working better."
14946.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know that that's an option for me because, like, I know that my spouse can't solo parent, I know that, like. I can't go anywhere."
120.0,Provider,Okay okay i'm. Sorry we're looking at.
14946.0,Patient,like this.
120.0,Provider,"No, no it's okay it's Okay, let me, let me look into it and see what our options are you know see if there's any other. Because I want you to be successful and I don't want it to be like. we're always hounding you about stuff because that's what it feels like sometimes when with an I O P program when somebody use a higher level, but. We can. Let me, let me just talk with the team and also mean that licensure thing is a big huge factor. But like. Another thing is, if we could, if you could get into the dietitian there, you know that might be like enough, I mean if you meet with them a couple times a week to where they can like you know, because the face to face is valuable in regards to dietitians especially. that's always tricky to do here, because we can't wait, we have to just trust what you're saying you know people do blind weight and they. Had him like hold the phone and try it out like number, you know just irritating you know, trying to get the thing on the scale and all but I have to fail, their house and. You know it's a little bit of a hassle and I just want you to have the best care, because I know that you're in a really difficult place right now. You know, mean are you going to eat today, what are you gonna eat today. Are you sticking to those five foods are they told me about."
14946.0,Patient,i'll i'll do anything. i'll do anything.
120.0,Provider,"Can you just have like a sandwich like with a bread and cheese and Turkey or something. You know, you know you could you have to kind of be like i'm gonna have to do this, and even if it's motivating to stay out of an impatient place you know."
14946.0,Patient,You know so yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, well, I gotta run to another appointment in a minute here, but let me check with amanda and she'll check on the licensing. because those are all you know those are the kind of the bigger roadblocks and i'm worried about to just because it's been Kentucky I don't know if we have any I know we have Tennessee but. For some reason, because their states are close together, I always think that they're like the same state but they're not yeah. So, look into that okay."
14946.0,Patient,Okay.
120.0,Provider,"Thank you all right, you are welcome i'll talk to you later bye bye. Alright So hopefully you heard that that i'm actually recommending a higher level of care, but recognizing that she has a lot of limitations i'm. Considering IP but also we have to look into that licensing aspect. That you know says. Moderate depression recurrent moderate generalized anxiety disorder. and Eating disorder reread anorexia. it's probably more of an os fed thing but i'm will put put anorexia restricting type. And I will double check on that and I can change it when if we if I need. To just put yeah let's just put restructuring tight for now."
