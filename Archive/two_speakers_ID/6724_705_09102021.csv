What happened was I left the air, I was going to Texas, and the layover was in phoenix. So I wanted to take my dog find a doggie space, and so they kept pointing me to the outside of the. Airport, so I wouldn't to Walker. to let her play that area do business, and then I went back into the airport and they had to check me again and the line was like super super long. And I freaked out, and I said kiddo you know I begged people to let me go through, and they all did, knowing that I have my dog. And when I was at the security and they put me through and checked me blah blah blah, and then, when I when I started when I got to the other side of security and I started running down. The airport in my socks I didn't have my shoes on so I had to go back to security and get my boots and put a bug and then I ran to the to the. terminal law a waiting room and everybody was boarding. And I saw the last person board the plane and I miss my I miss my plane, so I started freaking out and yelling and in just yelling at myself, not at people, and what I talked to the ticket lady she was nice enough to let me go on the next flight. But it was it was really hard, but she kept me calm she just won't get the bullet, but she never you know she didn't freak out when I was freaking out and. So you know she'll learn. i'm sorry to say, she she's learning right oh."

That one X accumulated that now, I have to pay for. Anyway, i've been looking at the process, the procedure and I don't see him asking for things and he tells me he is. I don't see it in the system that he's asking for the witnesses. A video. yeah I think he's lying to me if I could see everything I could see everything that's going on."

705.0,Provider,"That right there that you just did yeah I would you know, sometimes just having those couple of deep sighs and just let it out a deep breath, you know, have you ever done the box, the box breathing. The box breathing people do it different ways so job, however, you like, but some of the formula with it is you inhale through the nose for four. And then you hold it for four and we can do it together and then you hold it for four and then we're going to release through our mouth for and then we're going to push it out as a second time. For for and it's going to really help you'll feel your heart rate and and your pulses, just like oh it quiet things down for a minute, so if you inhale through your nose when we're going to do for. And then hold it for four. And then push out through your mouth for. And then, for more."
6724.0,Patient,For more one.
705.0,Provider,"Pushing out so go from your ABS once you release it takes it takes some practice, but so when you release that second time, so we go in for hold for. And then we're going to release for and just when you think you can't release anymore you're going to push out your ABS and release before so we're going to go in. and hold. and release. And extra push. And then we're going to go inhale. Hold for four seconds. exhale out your mouth. For more push. One word inhale. Hold for for. breathe out your mouth for. push it out an extra for. Do one more. In through the nose. Hold for for. push out. and put out the extra good and let it go. Just let it go. Okay. Are you feeling tense in your neck."
6724.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, can you give yourself like even a massage or something, just to be able. To get out some of that tension."
6724.0,Patient,Physical therapist is warning tried to.
705.0,Provider,tie.
6724.0,Patient,I think he I think he could he kept trying to relax my back here with a massage. so tight so tight.
705.0,Provider,yeah but even that massage that you're doing will release some of those toxins that we build up you know with stress and help your neck and everything and it provides a good distraction to that you know it has many pluses. Anything that you have from your physical therapy that they showed you like equipment or like a ball like a golf ball or anything like that that you use.
6724.0,Patient,"right by therapists physical therapists from last year. It was an oakland they were really good, this one is there Okay, but they're going through so many people it's they can't really focus in depth with. The patient."
705.0,Provider,"That right there Jay, thank you for doing that, with me and if you can just today, if that comes up just be able to do a couple of those breathing and then massaging yourself to be able to like bring it back and be like okay. I want to Center myself, I will get through myself what's one positive thing that you can tell yourself."
6724.0,Patient,Think of anything.
705.0,Provider,"What can you do that, you weren't Paisley that you can say that you and Paisley are going to make it through today."
6724.0,Patient,we're going to listen to music.
705.0,Provider,"And if you need to sleep, remember that halt that hungry anger lonely tired and then you can evaluate each one of them and then adapt."
6724.0,Patient,repeat.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, the acronym is halt H a ll T and the H stands for hungry. The a stands for anger. The l stands for lonely. And the T stands for tired. And it's really good cheer if you're having a craving for alcohol or if you're experiencing anxiety to be able to go down that list and evaluate, am I hungry if so II. Am I angry take a take a break right do something that may be physically exert some energy if you're lonely reach out to people go to a meeting and if you're tired take a nap that you've been talking about."
6724.0,Patient,You.
705.0,Provider,And so the maybe then something that you can tell yourself today would be what.
6724.0,Patient,"Hello. Now is. Everybody is. Like all of those. cared African navigators. All of the people that. i've already said they're all I knew they were in the Philippines, but they lie, they will every time i'd ask where are you like oh we're in San Diego I said it San Diego you guys are in San Diego yeah we're in San Diego. And so I find out they're not in San Diego they're all in the Philippines. Which. The company that you work for. Does it have. they're making money because they send out all their employees to Philippines they're not caring for the patient they're not caring for the. welding that's all the carrier all the only thing that the company cares for is the money they can make not how to help the customer, let me be patient and my lawyer is out to get me and. He thinks i'm stupid and. he's frigging be alone and the insurance lady she is asking for a lot and. My medical. Assistance for my. neurologist surgery surgery surgical. oncologist they are avoiding what my insurance people be trying to help. them make it easier if they don't respond, it will call me back. Which means i'm not going to get my $400 a week from my insurance company. So that means i'm going to have to ask for money from one lawyer. So. It is a. lot that people are just trying to. Like kick me they're trying to kick me down the street like like you know what there's a can I can, and the limited can on the floor. And I feel like the lawyers kicking me down there and the. Insurance lady is kicking me down the street they're coming in there, along with me but they're kicking me down the street and all the care navigators and all of the people that I have to talk to with your company they're kicking me down the street. So. yeah. Just. A little bit of can go down the street being kicked down the street."
705.0,Provider,"And so, part of what you can think with that Jia is that to bring it back into today today today you're sober. Today you're managing. and take care of yourself, I heard that if you're going to try to sleep that you may take in a meeting. You and Paisley will spend some time and then be able to you know just take it just for today. After after after we hang up here too, if you can take care of your wand and put something on it, you know. get some neo sporran if you have it."
6724.0,Patient,"yeah yes, I will do that. Is. going to. fight a long sleeve top I can put on so people don't see it."
705.0,Provider,"And then, all those things we talked about what the deep breathing pull all that in at the deep breathing doesn't work just go down the whole list if you know you're hungry go eat something. it's it's this time to where it's like you know what, if you like, chocolate, or something like that each your chocolate."
6724.0,Patient,I like chocolate already.
705.0,Provider,"Okay well today might be a double chocolate day and that's Okay, you know and so being able to do those things if you need you know, I know, unfortunately, this has been shorter than, then I would even like but I. The other person yeah but. What I would like to do is have where I know that Tuesday that you're going to be able to be in group and then. I know that it's scheduled you before. But I will get them to reach out where we can schedule for next week, if that's okay."
