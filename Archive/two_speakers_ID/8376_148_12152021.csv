8376.0,Patient,"Great great. As you specific. topic. Okay. It doesn't have to do with drinking. But. Many of you want to continue on with. No, no, but. He had two dogs and. We had to put one away. Now, if I already spoke to you about that. Then a month ago. So we have. We have another one. companion. dog is sleeping. I had a good wake up at 630 in the morning. That my wife, has always been around for 45. Years probably isn't them. The difference in ours, but. Seven train I. Normally. sleep around one o'clock and then I would get four to five hours of sleep. So, even though I try to go to sleep at 10 now. I only get four hours of sleep. and Lucy holly leaves and Lucy comes in. The bedroom and joins me and. So I don't know my sleep schedule has been completely disrupted over the last month. I guess it's probably just something that I have to. deal with and it over but. yeah i've been falling asleep all over the time these days. Especially working from home it's not. it's not good it's better to go into work, and I can stay up the whole time that. said that i'll get my work done it's just that i'm only sleep all the time, like. I don't know."
148.0,Provider,"you're feeling exhausted, right now, because your sleep schedules getting interrupted by by. By the dog coming in earlier than you're used to."
8376.0,Patient,"So it's probably something is have to. Well, I have been working on it for the last month or so and. Then just been feeling very, very sleepy. Recently, and I think that's what's. causing most of it but that's Okay, because I love her. So how it goes off she goes to the gym and. Lucy cuddles up next to me and. And that's great but. yeah it's a. You know, last month has been. very unusual asleep places, you know after my we had to put my. I don't know that I bring."
148.0,Provider,"yeah say your. yeah that's a big adjustment for everybody, even even the other dog. yeah."
8376.0,Patient,"yeah holiday. discuss just before I got on with you, we should. mature don't."
148.0,Provider,know.
8376.0,Patient,Think Lucy will be okay. You know. Four years from. Now.
148.0,Provider,yeah i'm sure that's hard to think about when you're still grieving. And healing from the loss. yeah it's really yeah it's still really fresh.
8376.0,Patient,Think lucy's doing okay. So. She can be by me in the morning and. I think she's okay. Their length she's. sleeping habits are horrible.
148.0,Provider,"So, even when you're going to bed earlier you're still waking up so if you go to bed at 10pm. You wake up wake up."
8376.0,Patient,Wake up at two.
148.0,Provider,can't get any more than four hours which doesn't.
8376.0,Patient,Great that's been going on for over 10 years now.
148.0,Provider,Have you ever taken anything for sleep.
8376.0,Patient,"They take melatonin every once while to get to sleep. But then it doesn't keep me. asleep. After four hours, I just wake up."
148.0,Provider,How would you feel about talking to Dr pachter about. That.
8376.0,Patient,"Really, I don't want to take any medication to sleep before ours is fine. I should be. On. broadcaster. For. You know NBC news or video shows, because I or. Kelly and Ryan, because I know we don't get much more sleep than I do. I know it's not good. I don't know how to take care of it. I don't know after 10 years I don't know what. To do I can talk to him, but I don't want to take drugs. medication whenever that. I don't know i'm not gonna say it hasn't. I don't know. Probably my whole life it's been like that. You know. High School I fell asleep math class right right teacher with throw track and. Wake me up. So it's been in constant thing that. it's been consistent that I don't get. I don't get. Any can sleep for four straight hours. And it's pretty much been that way for a long time."
148.0,Provider,Even when you have extended periods of sobriety you notice the same your sleep is the same yeah. um.
8376.0,Patient,"yeah so I don't. want to take medication for it, I really done i've been trying to. Like I said I go to sleep at one o'clock and then wake up at. Five or six. For a long time than now i've been trying to go to bed at 10 but then I only sleep for four hours and the neighbor. So."
148.0,Provider,You can't fall back asleep once you once you wake up.
8376.0,Patient,But i'm so but that's new. So i'm thinking that maybe if I just continue to do that maybe I will sleep longer. If I can sleep for six hours.
148.0,Provider,"I. yeah I definitely would try and stay on that schedule of going to bed at 10. Because you were going to bed at one before, so I could see how your body would be like almost. condition to wake up after four hours, because after four hours, that was the time you were getting up before. Right yeah absolutely keep staying on the schedule for now and see if you can start to you know lengthen that time at all."
8376.0,Patient,"yeah okay i'll just try to keep doing it. yeah it's just frustrating right now. yeah yeah I can fall asleep on ago, how long has it been, since you started going to bed a little earlier. weeks now."
148.0,Provider,Two weeks okay let's check in after another. Two weeks. Okay yeah. Three weeks to change a habit.
8376.0,Patient,know.
148.0,Provider,let's check in after four and see where you're at.
8376.0,Patient,"least i'm trying to be consistent i've. always wanted to stay up and watch Jimmy. fallon and. Just recorded it, so I can watch it later, but in the news also. But I noticed sleep sleep. to sleep issues. is becoming more a problem, and it has in the past, like I said it's been a long time, but. They really want to. turn around if it's at all possible, but you know, after so many years it's. You know, two weeks, probably isn't enough three weeks probably isn't enough there."
148.0,Provider,yeah that's why I want to give it a little bit more time and check back in and just continue to monitor it and. Definitely stay on a very strict schedule.
8376.0,Patient,yeah yeah so 1010 to one ever working. Right and hopefully I wake up later. Hopefully. it'll be nice.
148.0,Provider,That would be great.
8376.0,Patient,that's my goal.
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah that's all.
8376.0,Patient,"But, but who knows it's not it's not, I can say i'm just gonna go do this is my body's. physiology says well you're just gonna wake up."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
8376.0,Patient,it's difficult it's.
148.0,Provider,"definitely on the right track, p."
8376.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,And I hope trading right now but.
8376.0,Patient,"i'm trying to change my life and. For the best I know that's best I can do without the news. They can read the paper, the next day."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8376.0,Patient,They can record Jimmy fallon so I don't need to stay up and watch that either so.
148.0,Provider,"And it's so much better when you record, because then you don't have to sit through commercials."
8376.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"that's a win, win here. yeah a winning place."
8376.0,Patient,So at least some concentrating on that and that's a big goal if I can get get that going. I think that's gonna make a big difference in my life.
148.0,Provider,"I think it'll make a huge difference in your life and how you feel throughout the day. When we lack sleep to our tolerance is lower our tolerance is lower and recovery, you know we're more at risk for relaxing we're not able to manage stress as well, or just we're tired we can't handle as much right when you're exhausted. yeah."
8376.0,Patient,"No, I think that's. I know that's incredibly true because i've had to take days off because. it's just so tired I slept. At home, through teleworking and I might have to take eight hours off and it's just not. Acceptable so I have to do something about it and."
148.0,Provider,yeah. I.
