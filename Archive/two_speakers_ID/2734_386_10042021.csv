The bridge is only going to get you to your next appointment um and so, which you have technically individual therapy tomorrow and then you have group again on the 11th. Currently, what is recommended in your care intensity recommendations is that you see you go to group three times a week so you'll have your normal group with Isaiah and then you'll have to attend to additional care group groups. per week and I can give you I can give you the um so your normal appointments are on Mondays, would you be able to go to a care group tomorrow. Oh, actually, you have individual therapy scheduled tomorrow, how about Wednesday Wednesday Sunday Okay, for you."
2734.0,Patient,"yeah that's Fine, let me. Take a look, I don't mind I told myself I wouldn't mind going to our groups because. Okay, no that's that's that's my thing to help me."

2734.0,Patient,And it will be anything.
386.0,Provider,And I get I get that and. I just can't I can't alter description.
2734.0,Patient,"So on and off the doctor is he on Thursday, so when I see him all and no one's going. On I can't believe no one even tell you cuz he knew and I literally no one had even told me I just said that then when the next pre authorization came up if we could lower my dose down, then, but nobody setting. Nobody so. yeah. You have any idea so i'll still take him, you know, two and a half, on nights I needed it so."
386.0,Provider,And yeah.
2734.0,Patient,"Talks wondering, while I was running out, and I was like you know, this is not making no sense but doctors is he was on vacation for two weeks so."
386.0,Provider,"yeah and he's gonna be gone so he's gonna be gone for a month. Approximately yeah so he has an actual family emergency and. So i'm that he's on only is expected to be out for an additional month here and, but there are going to be other providers that are in your group. that are going to be covering his caseload so definitely just let them know what was discussed previously see what they're able to get going for you. What i'm going to do is i'm going to call in, so this is a one time authorization only in which which the me interpret that here is what it means is. Is that perp right heart health, the protocol is is that you're only allowed to have one early refill perk lifetime of being here at bright heart health so. that's what this will do if you if you ever run into an occurrence, where your medication is lost or stolen, it would have to go straight to the provider versus the prescription team. And you would need to have a police report in order for a bridge to be."
2734.0,Patient,"I don't have that. I won't have that from us why taking. shredding thing, so now, you know what I got. Her about the old times like keep saying they take their bills and stuff."

On you may have to pay for the medication out of pocket i'm not too sure Okay, because if the insurance as an authorized it early, then you would have to contact the insurance company that's not something that we do. For early refills, but you can contact the insurance company and get an override through them and letting them know that the dose was decreased you just weren't aware. And they should be able to make the adjustments if if if if there are able to, otherwise you may have to pay for the medication out of pocket."
