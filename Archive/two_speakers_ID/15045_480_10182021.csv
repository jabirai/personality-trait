480.0,Provider,wow. So thanks.
15045.0,Patient,"yeah. trying to get from California to Florida. And a day didn't happen. So I wasn't able to go to the court hearing, so I wasn't able to. Get the custody of the boys like I had wanted. Because."
480.0,Provider,At that time.
15045.0,Patient,"I was unemployed. I was working on it. But I was going to school. I was unemployed, I was just trying to better myself. So when I give them next. well. The Court deemed necessary at that point, because I did show, even though. I was like like what the heck. The Court deem it necessary to take the boys and put them into foster care. So they go to foster care. Great why. They were there every family they let me talk to them, let me, you know. send them presence, you know, like, I was, I was still a part of their life, even though I wasn't there. Fast forward a few years. My mother calls me and says hey your dad and I are planning on getting our certificate things so we can be the foster parents. We can get the boys here, and once they're in. California, then you've built the legal process."
480.0,Provider,You.
15045.0,Patient,"can get the boys okay cool Oh well, so our House is not fit for them, they came out and it's back to that. it's not only fit for them. You know, because my brothers live like garbage and they still live with my parents. And also there's. Drugs involved. You know, like i'm the black sheep of the family, because I don't do drugs. Now me my dad wow. Oh okay yeah my mom addicted to oxy pot. So mom and brother."

But anyways so back to the boys so. So she goes hey we can't do it, but your aunt and uncle. They said they'd be willing to do it cool fantastic and at this point my mom is basically like. You, let me handle everything. I will take care of it. You focus on getting through school get your grades good just. Do what you gotta do. i'll be there for you. I was like okay. I worry about that. But I will trust you on. This as you're my mom supposed to. Well, she uh. She didn't tell me the truth. My aunt my uncle like boys come down for a visit. With the foster parents and get to hold. My youngest for the first. time we go on a. Nice hike. we're just having a blast you know. and At one point during the. weekends my uncle. comes over says wow this is really cool have you. And I was really cool you're Okay, with all this like are you doing like. Like well yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay with this. Like like. I don't know I just. I figured when. I found out. I was like I figured when you found out that we wanted to adopt them that you'd have an issue with that."
480.0,Provider,Why. So your mom didn't even tell you that.
15045.0,Patient,"nope didn't even tell me that not even up to the date of the day of them, they came out to visit my, no, no, no, she was she basically. had told me."
480.0,Provider,Over and over again.
15045.0,Patient,"That they were going to be fostering the kids. So that way, I could get them back. But that. Was. actually going on well i'm uncle wanted to adopt. them. So that way they can have. Because they were too old at that time to have kids they got. married and they also saw this as an opportunity to have kids that were blood related to them."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my. gosh."
15045.0,Patient,"So when I. same day. That, I find this out, you know I. I talked with my. My now. Ex Milo i've been together for. Five years you know, like, I was going to marry this. Dr her about it she's like what the hell i'm like yeah I don't know like. So she and I are just. Stay positive around the kids. they've had a rough they deserve to be surrounded by love and to be wanted and needed. And so. i'm like okay we'll just we'll get the weekend and then we'll start figuring it out. You know. So we go murder. playing with the kids. were having a good time my mom. I love my axe. She gets a bit of a headache. You know it's been a long day we went for a hike she was being. A water and everything. She goes outside. You know just get some air my mom like hey i've got. i've got something for your head, so that. You know I can give you something for your head, if you want. I was like okay sure didn't think anything of it. didn't think anything of it. i'm on a hands or an oxymoron phone and a value. For a headache. yeah which that combination. That combination can lead to. You know. coma and stuff."
480.0,Provider,Like.
15045.0,Patient,"And my mom's just take. yeah. Just like well it's fine I take all the time, your brothers take it all the time for. headaches wow fine. And I was. gone. At this point, you know, like her. She she's there playing dominoes of the boys, the boys are loving it, you know, but she basically comes over anyone points."
480.0,Provider,Like.
15045.0,Patient,We have to go right now we have to go to the hotel. Because. So we're good to go tell.
480.0,Provider,Everything.
15045.0,Patient,I can't i'm like what the heck did you do.
480.0,Provider,"So. Thanks nothing of it, because to her, those are like tylenol."
15045.0,Patient,"wow yeah. So. You know i'm. Dealing with that. We fast forward a little bit further. You know I started on the family, like i'm not okay with this not okay with this, I want my boys. I have been working. Hard every day. I went to school, I found a job i'm. Killing myself so that way I can have my boys. Why is this happening. And they're like Well, this is better for them you're. No longer able to take care of them right now uncle will be just."
480.0,Provider,like that.
15045.0,Patient,"They look at you you're living in an apartment right now. They have a house you're making minimum wage. Both of them have jobs it's just a better situation. they've got the finances resources to take care of that. And if you fight this, you will be designed by the rest of the. Because we just want the boys, here we don't care how like hey here. We just wasn't boys in your body."
480.0,Provider,"Well, how oh my gosh that's so harmful all of that."
15045.0,Patient,"So my dad. The only voice of reason in the entire family, the glue that held. My family together. Which now everybody look for new blue and. My dad was jb wells. i'm like almost blue I. am trying to I can't. Keep up with what he was able to do. You know and. i'm not even gonna try. I can't you know. And i'm not afraid to say that I. can have my family it's just. You know. yeah i'm. Not my dad. You know. But anyways so my dad's. That was the only voice of reason he basically was like. I understand you're upset. i'd be upset to you. Again ever talk to me about this, I will just straight up how it was. And we would have discussed, you know. I didn't know your mom was doing that to you. I didn't know that that was going on all I thought which mom was telling you the truth. I didn't realize that she was lying. i'm sorry for that. But this process has begun. And it's. going to be very hard to stop it now. So you have two options one you can either. do your best and try to take the boys. to your capacity and do your best to try and do that that's going to be a lot of work. And it's going to be really a large upheaval for the boys, especially after having."
480.0,Provider,This most recent upheaval.
15045.0,Patient,"Which. I will back you up that's the decision you make. The other decision you let your aunt and uncle. Take care of the boys. You focus on you and trying to get your life, the way you want it to the position that you. want it to be, and when they're old enough. They will come to you. Because no matter what your dad. You know. Yes, I have no data that you know they. Like I can spend five minutes in a room with them and tell them they love you more than like myself. he's like so i'm not concerned or worried about them not coming to you. I am. more concerned about what with the assault Spencer went through things cat put them. Through. I X the things that they've had to go through. jumping can foster home to foster home. That. This big evil, especially if you go to court, the Court beams you want to fit. After building up their hopes and their their third. wishes to be with you so. Lending club they can't. That can be very, very bad at that. So. took my dad's advice and I let my aunt my uncle. keep a lot of them are not all. Basically, your sort of deal for the Florida so like even though i'm paying child support, I do not give visitation rights. You know. They come down and see me. When they want to see me. mm hmm. How far away."
480.0,Provider,Are they now with your aunt and uncle.
15045.0,Patient,So they weren't sacramento they've recently moved to Kansas. You know so wasn't one of those things I could just five up there. yeah. Oh that's it let's fast forward a little bit further shall.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
15045.0,Patient,"My aunt and uncle had decided they want. To no longer be in California. This was back and I. got my little book from when I was at the hospital. Where I sort of writing down triggering events and things. So that way, I could find figure out what had put me in the hospital first place. That was back in. July. So."

15045.0,Patient,"I mean yeah. There is the the nurture side that can lead to some things like that well there's also the nature. Side where you're born with the brain chemistry. You know.

I was letting people down, and I was just. hiding in my room a lot and. They will just fit. My roommates notice something was wrong. You know, and so. She came out and sat down talk to me for a bit. Now I started telling her about how I was like. I was in a planning status. You know i'm going to plan a stage of doing something for myself. And i'm because. Man and I haven't been planning for a couple of weeks, you know so. She basically she's like well. Well, I do think you are strong and I do think that you are capable. I also think. That there's nothing wrong with seeking help. And if you do try to nurture so. You will be on an infant. If you check yourself in. So."

Lots of little things over a long period of time. Like and. it's kind of, sad to say, actually. I see things like with my mom and my family is little things. But. I think."
480.0,Provider,"that's I mean it's. For you. Do you had so much trauma and growing up that it it's like that trauma on top of trauma on top of trauma on top of trauma, so it makes sense that little things would be the triggers right. Because when you've grown up with such strong trauma history and something like a pencil breaking or like you said, having to cancel plans with people can elicit such a strong response that makes no sense to outside people."
15045.0,Patient,"yeah you know and that's The thing is, like it's just. I mean, on top of that, I was in the military too so i've got that whole ptsd thing going on, like. You know, but."

480.0,Provider,was your plans.
15045.0,Patient,"So. I am licensed to drive all the heavy machinery at home depot. and I work in hardware, where people the rope in the chain and such. My plan was. That because you know I. thought it was probably what. 13 years ago I but. i'm a researcher. I research things just for fun. You know so like I. I know more than a lot of people so that's when I found out like oh that's why 13 is an unlucky number because that's the number of loops that are inside of a news that makes it so the head doesn't pop off, but it does great the next. You know so Okay, so I had."
480.0,Provider,planned on.
15045.0,Patient,"Actually, you know hanging myself."

15045.0,Patient,"The right amount of length. On the order picker which I could get up to the highest point in the. In the building. I figured that would be the quickest and most painless method. Because the breaking of the neck. Because almost instantaneous death. Other than a strangulation. So that was. Probably the most That was the most logical so that way, I could you know. not have a large mess. For people to clean up. Just one body. And the ladder down. Now, because I do have that. Also in my head is. My mother had me, cleaning and cooking and everything at the age of four. I did the laundry for the whole House at the age of four so. While my living area. Be cluttered and messy."
480.0,Provider,and not a filthy person.

480.0,Provider,biggest.
15045.0,Patient,"One of my one of my biggest triggers is if. Somebody is cleaning. While i'm. You know, or if somebody has to. clean up a mess that I made. You know so. You know, I was getting into that that was that was one of the plans that I had. You know. That I could do that, and it would be easy to claim. he's a gamble and at that point, I felt like what was my purpose on earth, you know. And that was why you know, I was looking for the straw that broke the camel's back like yeah canceling plans and letting people down. That causes me anxiety it's an issue. work. You know. that the new management system, the. being passed up after. Four pay increases. You know the constant. Or the eight hours a day."
480.0,Provider,wearing a mass.
15045.0,Patient,"You know it's it's. An awful lot. So I was looking for. That that straw that broke the camel's back and. I didn't even think anything of it at the time. But the day of my hospitalization. Or the day before, because I decided that I was going to shower one nice shower. Before away so we ended up having one last night here at the House because. All of my plans never involved the House, I did not want to involve my family. And i'm. Like that that's that's something that. You know I felt like I had gone for me like it was. I I refused or refuse to involve my family. So. I spent one night here and then. We went down, but the thing that broke the camel's back the one that. really made me like."
480.0,Provider,feel something.
15045.0,Patient,"You know, when I left the hospital. I had a bit of it for a management position over harbor freight. You know. it'd be a $2. increase i'd be able to actually. put my skills to use feel like I was actually moving towards something. and They. Had messaged me, we appreciate your application and your desire to work for this company, but unfortunately we're. Looking for other candidates. At this time. So it was just it."
480.0,Provider,Was this.
15045.0,Patient,"feeling of hopelessness of running on my hamster wheel, you know. and"
480.0,Provider,It just another day.
15045.0,Patient,mm hmm.
480.0,Provider,And another block in the road all that yeah.
15045.0,Patient,Just something else to climb up and.
480.0,Provider,Over.
15045.0,Patient,"You know, because. that's all i've done my entire life is just have things so one of my path. That I had to climb over. can't go over you go around around it, you go under. It you know can't go under, you go to do it like yeah. It was no matter what there was never. An opportunity to take a break. You know. So."
480.0,Provider,It just. Seidel ideation is wanting and it's gate not necessarily a permanent out right so it's like you just want an escape from that constant uphill battle of things not working out.
15045.0,Patient,"yeah exactly I mean i've had suicidal thoughts in the past. When I got out of the army. Cat took the boys to Florida that whole thing began. I was living in apartments that I was sharing with them, but I was no alone, you know, and so I had this concept that hey I know how to bypass a fuse circuit circuit breaker I know how to do that and I got a toaster Why not go with a classic you know. So, like I. I had had those thoughts before, but I always like well. Let me just get through the day see how the day goes i'd rather not leave that kind of bets you know. But."
480.0,Provider,"So what would you say now is your biggest. protective factor, or like reason for living when you start to have those thoughts, do you have one thing that kind of grounds, you and pulls you back."
15045.0,Patient,"um. yeah I do you know, like. I mean it's it's harder. You know, right now, especially like a week after I got out of the hospital my dad. You know."
480.0,Provider,yeah like.
15045.0,Patient,"It was. It was a lot. You know, like. I do have people I love people I care, for you know and then living for someone else. does work but i'm also trying to live for. Myself, so I."
480.0,Provider,Put.
15045.0,Patient,A different kind of plan into place. You know we're like every day. I try to do at least one thing 10 minutes doesn't matter if it's five minutes. One thing for myself one nice thing. If it's.
480.0,Provider,Playing video games.
15045.0,Patient,"In the morning, you know or at night, wherever I go to bed, or if it's playing on my ukulele you know or on my guitar. or drawing you know or whatever it is painting, you know just something just one one nice thing for myself, one thing that makes me feel good about myself. that's that's step, one of the player. Okay step two of the plan. This guy This is my application for my passport."
480.0,Provider,you're going to travel.
15045.0,Patient,"i'm willing to travel my. So my dad. When he was young. Florida high school. And ran away from home was living on the streets and he was walking past at one point he was you know is dirty dirty clothes and everything like that. was walking out on the streets and you walk past one buildings little guy. comes out goes hey do you need a place to sleep he's like yeah. Okay, you sweep my dojo you see my studio you can stay here. And that's when masterly took him in. You know masterly was his his first martial arts teacher is you taught shaolin. So my dad lived in this shaolin monastery. In La. You know, when I finished his adolescent years living there, so I grew up with this very. Asiatic culture. Which is you know strange. But. You know. I grew up with that that was. The culture that I had this. That kind of culture and. So one of my dreams was always to. live in Japan. So."
480.0,Provider,cool. yeah.
15045.0,Patient,"So i'm learning, Japanese and i'm thinking that because I guess i'll wait for my birth certificate certificate to come in and once that comes in i'm going to fill out my. form of my passport. And i'm going to pimp some pennies and see if I. can't make it to Japan my birthday. You know, in April. end of April just revisit. spend a week there. see if I can live with it. see if I even like the place and if I do. I do truly like it. i'm willing to go to some of the hardware stores there. And i'm going to ask if they're hiring. Because if they're hiring. And they're willing to wait till I get my visa. Then and. By the end of next year, I could be living in yeah."
480.0,Provider,that's so awesome I love that and that is like the perfect way to cope with suicidal. ideation is having something to look forward to in the future that brings you joy brings up all of that.
15045.0,Patient,"yeah exactly that's this that's why. it's why I picked that one. You know, because it's something i've always wanted to do and. I had been practicing the Japanese you know a few years ago, when I got kicked out like actually like I decided to start you know doing that, so I got my cell phone bill folding Japanese food times and I actually started. Seeing would have liked to be living on that kind of style. I room was only an eight by eight so it's very small living and I was, I was already. Set with it. I told my dad that's what I wanted to do. And he was one of the only people, just like my family here that was like. Do it. When you get there, let me know it's like visit."
480.0,Provider,that's so cool so it's almost like you're doing it for dad to in a way.
15045.0,Patient,"In a way, and since my dad was cremated my aunt actually got not only the large earn for him to be in but she also got small little earns with the portion of him that each of us boys are going to be able to get so i'll be able to take with."
480.0,Provider,"me that's so great. Oh, I love that. Are you one of three boys. yep."
15045.0,Patient,"or four i'm the oldest of three boys, I am the oldest. You know so. yeah."
480.0,Provider,Which.
15045.0,Patient,i'm sure we're getting.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, because oh sorry continue."
15045.0,Patient,yeah we're I think we're running a little short on time. So i'm gonna let you take over.
480.0,Provider,"Well, so the only thing i've pretty much done most of what I need to do so, whenever we have suicidal ideation there's just I have to make a safety plan. And so that's why I was asking some of these questions was so I could go ahead and fill that out, while you're talking about like coping skills and stuff you use so um. Do you know warning signs for your suicidal ideation like does it start with more depressed mood isolating all of that is it more stressful events that are the warning signs, what are your kind of indicators."
15045.0,Patient,"um it's more of the. The low energy. You know. The. that's one of my indicators is the low energy and usually. When something bad happens. You know, and I started."
480.0,Provider,Having that.
15045.0,Patient,"low energy feeling like. i'll start off with a high energy very anxious. Everything and then it just. dips so. You know, like. That can sometimes lead."
480.0,Provider,to it.
15045.0,Patient,"As well as I have certain anniversaries and things like that you know. That. When they come up it's it's. I know that. seasonally a. veterans day. As one for me. For example, you know. Memorial Day is another. ashes birthday spencer's birthday michael's birthday. You know. So. anniversaries. tend to have more of that. thing attached to them, but usually it doesn't start floating into the suicidal ideation it just. You know, is I get sad for a little bit. I go to something enjoyable. And I get better. When it comes to the suicidal ideation it's more. Like i'll."
480.0,Provider,Start realizing.
15045.0,Patient,"it's happening. When it's happening, but. it's almost like Okay, so you know how you have. Your voice in your head not. i'm not saying I got voice I. know you have your voice. That. When you're like. you're thinking about something like. You can almost like. Like you think the words you know, so you can almost hear yourself in your head."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15045.0,Patient,"When i'm getting close close the the suicidal ideation portion. it's my voice, but the tones different does that make sense. No."
480.0,Provider,It does make sense that's interesting okay.
15045.0,Patient,"yeah so it's not. it's me, but at the same time, it almost sounds like. It almost sounds like it almost a different tone a different. Different. reverberation almost it just has a. Different frequency. You know. You know I tend to. Use frequencies as a lot of my describing factors, so it just. You know, a higher frequencies. You know, happy everything a low frequency is very sad angry, so it just has a very different frequency and the voice compared to my more upbeat voice."
480.0,Provider,That makes a lot of sense yeah yeah.
15045.0,Patient,"So, usually I can do that and usually i'm able to take a deep breath count to five, you know count some of the things around me or. Do the the how many things can I feel how many things you know or. One of my things my previous therapist. told me that really helped a lot. Was. She said you gotta be able to take care of yourself, where you can take care of other people and I like i've been told this but I don't understand."
480.0,Provider,"Right, what does that mean."
15045.0,Patient,"I don't get it, these plane she's like okay you're on a plane, the planes in trouble okay here masks drop down, you have to put your mask on first before you put the mask of a child or an elderly person his mask on why like well because you've run out of oxygen you pass out. yeah exactly if you're trying to put on somebody else's mass instead of putting on yours first you're gonna run out of oxygen going to pass out and then both of you will be in trouble. yeah put your mask on first."
480.0,Provider,Absolutely.
15045.0,Patient,"So that's that's something that I usually try to almost make a monster out of you know. And so, usually it works last month that. They didn't."
480.0,Provider,Do you have people. That. are like safe people that use for support when you're feeling like that.
15045.0,Patient,I live with the three of them.
480.0,Provider,Like your roommate. or they they sound like they're safe people.
15045.0,Patient,"yeah my roommates are safe, people like they. They hear me out. And they don't just like listen they actually hear me. You know. they'll say."
480.0,Provider,Their names are banning kale.
15045.0,Patient,"kale was my old roommate the one that kicked me out my roommates that are live with. Our Ben. Oh vicki yeah Ben and vicki. There are married couple up there, the owners of the House. and Then and vicki I actually was the one that married them, which is cool."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15045.0,Patient,"So they're the owners of the House, and then Craig. is one of the other roommates here. So, and I know that I can go to any one of them, and my biggest issue is talking to people, because I don't like feeling like a bird. mm hmm you know but. I do feel safe talking to them. girlfriends. Not so much, much. One girlfriend is a. New girlfriend so we're still getting the honeymoon phase over and everything, so I. i'm really. anxious about sharing some of the deeper stuff with her."
480.0,Provider,yeah that makes sense.
15045.0,Patient,"And then my other girlfriends who i've been with. For a year and a half or so. She. she's a great person she really is but she's very good at the guilt trips and if I say that I am feeling something she will immediately look for what she did wrong yeah then turns it towards her which. not yet it not helpful. I get it. Still love her to death, but I also know that I. yeah I can't really like express some of these things when i'm in a negative states. yeah you know. Because if if my vibrations low I try to express these things, and she turns it around that we're going to get argument because i'm not going to be able to communicate properly and she's going to get upset and she won't be able to communicate properly and then. People can't communicate you can't figure anything out and relationships crumble. So. I usually talk to her. Exactly usually I talked to the roommates. work through the issue. Once i'm feeling better I reach out to her."
480.0,Provider,explain what happened.
15045.0,Patient,"And at that point, I can communicate properly. and were able to. find that pounds now that she. i've already talked to her about how it is. And she's like you know if you're just having a bad day. Having a bad day just let me know. Say hey i'm having a bad day, just so I know where you are, and I can check in on you, but you don't have the message to do anything I just want you to take care of yourself. So. Like she's a healthy partner. Except for that one thing. yeah what."
480.0,Provider,"you've learned to work around it, which is awesome."
15045.0,Patient,Exactly Problem Solving yeah.
480.0,Provider,So we need to schedule another appointment because they do have somebody else in the meeting room. What works for you schedule wise. mornings how early.
15045.0,Patient,"A anytime before I today 10 o'clock was perfect anything before 10 of work, I might be tired, but I do it. I start work usually at noon. So i'm usually dressed out of the House by 1130."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I have. How often are you wanting to do therapy to because bright heart typically people do every other week, but I have some people that do every week."
15045.0,Patient,um.
480.0,Provider,"that's harder to schedule, if you have limited availability."
15045.0,Patient,"let's do the other every other week. For now, I think that that probably will work best. At least, then I can you know it gives you a bit more chance to work, the schedule and you know everything like when it comes to my mental health it's one of those things like I tried to. consult the professionals. mm hmm so now how often do you think I should be seeing you."
480.0,Provider,"I would not be worried to not see you weekly at this point, because even though you were just. Out of the hospital, you have therapy experience you're very easy really easily able to identify triggers morning signs all of that, I trust that you. would call if you were feeling like you needed an appointment, I feel like you could probably advocate for yourself so i'm good with every other week. I could do is eight way too early for you is nine the earliest, you can go."
15045.0,Patient,I can go I can go and I can figure it out. Like i'll be fine. You know extra cup of coffee. You know i'll sleep in the next day i'll be fine.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so if we could do it eight o'clock your time on Monday November 1 and then Monday the 15th that would work, and then we can kind of on the 15th see if we want to keep going every other week if we need to up it if we need to decrease it whatever. All right, and do you have my email."
15045.0,Patient,"I don't know. All right, everything in this book, no. I do not."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, I just put it in the chat. chat it's easy to remember. it's first initial of my first name last name at bright heart health."
15045.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,Perfect So if you need anything in the meantime email me if you ever just did I have clients that will then sometimes because that's a good coping skill for them and they'll just. come to me in an email instead of feeling like a burden to their friends i'm happy to provide that kind of support.
15045.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"All right, so whatever you need just reach out via email."
15045.0,Patient,"Okay, can do."
480.0,Provider,"All right, well, I hope you have a good week and. i'll see you soon."
15045.0,Patient,"Okay, about two weeks."
480.0,Provider,Okay sounds good bye.
15045.0,Patient,bye bye.
