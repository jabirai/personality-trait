12103.0,Patient,Hello.
705.0,Provider,I Sophia there you are. hi how are you feeling today.
12103.0,Patient,i'm feeling better. yeah how are you doing.
705.0,Provider,"i'm feeling very well today, thank you for asking it is Wednesday. yeah midweek and i'll just always share now that my allergies are acting up a little bit so sorry and then you're going to see me with my clean act, sir."
12103.0,Patient,"No, I totally empathize I also have allergies and i'm using the nasal spray but. I may also like turn off my camera at some point."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so what's what's been going on, I know when group we don't have sometimes a lot of times for individual so i'm glad that you could meet with me today."
12103.0,Patient,"Okay um things are better. I was able to get the refill for the prescriptions that I didn't get right away. I had really bad. Side like I guess it's withdrawal symptoms, because it I had really bad headaches and nausea and I felt really weak and irritable. And i'm feeling better from yesterday. So I wanted to also I also wanted to check in with you about that because I didn't want to alarm anyone and I wasn't alone, I saw my friends and I spent time with them, and my sister and we went to curry and spa. Oh good so because I told them that, like sometimes like I told them how as much as I enjoy their company it's just hard as I get older about my birthday. never really understanding about it. that's it. I still have that problem of communicating. To family about my mental health and. You know the. The stigma and the reality of being neuro divergent I think that's the proper word for it. I could be wrong, but. I just have a hard time. Like explaining that as we talked about in group just. Overall, the assumptions about it, and the idea that i'm helpless that i'm not. No yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Not helpless the Sophia i know is like you know what I know that you will always manage and so for for me, Sophia and for the group is you had said that when you shared some things that you were concerned if we were alarm i'll speak for myself. The more you're able to talk about it and verbalize what's going on to me i'm not you know, on alert or anything like that I feel like it's healthy. And I feel like, then I know what's going on, and I know how to help you best if if you come to a place where you have you're having thoughts and you're having a plan. Then of course we're going to help you get the support that you need at that time, but you shared with us that you are at home that you are safe and that you didn't have a plan or intent."
12103.0,Patient,didn't know.
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, I hope, Sophia because my you know what I want to make sure that this is a safe space where you can talk about those things where you don't have to feel like you know here I am i'm feeling this way and I can't share in a verbalize from coming from."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah I agree. it's getting a little bit better. I mean. The fact that my friends and my sister. were really understanding about it was good um they didn't like. Pressure me to do what I would want like you know, like what they would want to do, because they know that I have a tendency to just kind of let them take the wheel, because I don't like conflict. I don't like. making choices for everybody, I feel like that's. That type of leadership role is a little too much for me. Not that I can't do leadership roles it's just when it's. Whether it's an intimate group of friends or a big group of people It just seems like I feel responsible for everybody, when i'm only supposed to be responsible for myself and they agreed with that, like they they wanted me to just. Do what I wanted to do so, we went to the Korean spa and, like, I was able to. Like soak in the water and be by myself and join them when I was ready, so they were able to be really understanding about it. Especially since. i'm not very good at celebrating like I eat a dinner, maybe, or like. Do something small. Because I just don't like being reminded i'm getting old."
705.0,Provider,"birthday can be that way haha. yeah yeah I appreciate, though, how you are able to ask for what you need it and, that being honest with your friends that they not only respect your wishes. But you, you are able to see to where i'll go to the SPA but i'm going to have my alone time that I need to so i'm going to respect myself."
12103.0,Patient,"I was just happy that that was possible. I wouldn't have been able to do that a couple of months ago, or a year ago, or five years ago, so it was a pretty big deal because I always think about how they're going to take it and. And I don't want to make them feel unimportant, but then like I I like having that time to myself kind of made me realize that you know, like I am important to. And you know, like, I just want to be surrounded by when I do want to be surrounded by people that understand that and respect that. it's really hard to find sometimes."
705.0,Provider,"it's nice though so feel when you do, and they understand you, you understand them and it's like you went as a group, to do this thing, but they were independent you are independent and then you can come back together and talk about it everybody's needs are met."
12103.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,that's the beauty of a true friendship.
12103.0,Patient,"yeah. i'm just. i'm also trying not to think too much about the expectation when that comes with age and. So I was talking to my my boyfriend about what he wants in the future and it's similar it's the same thing that I do we want to have our own place and have a pet. And it was pretty simple and. kids came up and he and I are on the same page where we want to have a life together. Post living with family, we want to be able to have a future where it's just me and him for a bit. And it's Nice that to have that I don't have to have kids and he agrees and. It just got brought up again with my friends and I told him that, like I don't think now we're all on the same page like I don't there's nothing wrong about having children it's just that I feel like the generation gap right now is. Like especially this generation. They don't want to have kids because you know they want to meet couriers and it's moving away from the cultural and societal expectation. And it's just kind of. My mom for one is very understanding about that, but we also have very traditional family members and I try to. avoid conversations with it because, like I said yesterday, I still like want to. Like there's a part of me that still wants to be 28 and feel comfortable you know and nothing wrong with kids it's just. I don't I want to be able to take care of myself first I think it's, the best thing to have kids I feel like you have to be very patient and emotionally strong and mentally like like you're able to take care of yourself. And that's a big thing. So did to like relate that to family is kind of weird. My mom and my sister they understand. my grandmother she kind of asks it every once in a while, but I don't blame her because she grew up with that idea and then with extended family it's brought up and it's. Like I have written. Something on my note in my phone notes and I said that if, in the event that they do ask, I just have it like pre recorded that I would kindly asked you to not comment on. My choices and my opinion on children because. good or bad like it it's just not something that makes me feel comfortable it's a work in progress, but it's hard, because you know, like we talked about in group, you say one thing, but it's immediately met with negation and you can only do so much."
705.0,Provider,"I like though where you just took that out of there where you're like the pre recorded message. yeah I since to Sofia that it's a relief to you and your boyfriend share where it's like this is where we are right now we both agree that children we love them but we're not in the space to have them. You know, right now, but guess what Sofia, you have every right that later on, if you want to change your mind and you're at a different space in a different time you can change your mind if you choose to."
12103.0,Patient,awesome also actually very well said and concise I wish I was more I find a way one day to be to make things like clear and concise.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, Sophia I just want to share with you the way you word things and the way you're able to communicate is beautiful I really I would say that about you that you're very clear, concise and sometimes in group, you say it best than what any other facilitator like Mary and I. couldn't have said it that way, no one else. And a lot of times, people will complement that oh my gosh like sometimes if a person's new I don't know her name, and I know who they're talking about when it's. Like but she said this and amazed since. I was so you know I appreciate the compliment I also just want you to recognize that you have the the the gifts of one of your many gifts, is the way you're able to communicate and relate and put that into words."
12103.0,Patient,"Thank you. I guess it comes with it, I think it's also because I think the good parts of a person show up when they're in a safe space, but also when they're most vulnerable and a lot of people in group, I have to say I haven't met anyone in our group that has ever made me feel welcomed or. unwanted and it's it's it's very i'm very fortunate to be in group, especially like, even if I don't talk and I just hear everybody because, like you said before, like i'm i'm not alone in it. But at the same time. It makes me wonder that these people like me who have. A difficult time, you know with dealing with day to day and and my expectations and how to feel those problems are the most capable of listening and understanding. And then, when I was hospitalized I was hospitalized. Three times. And everybody in that facility, including the ones that are there for help and well like you know overall wellness they understand consent and space and. I know that we're not perfect, but why is it that people outside of facilities and i'm counting the patients, why are they more understanding about. empathy and other people, and then the people that. I think i've read it before the people that should be in therapy aren't so the people that are forced to go to therapy. have to go there to deal with like."
705.0,Provider,yeah i'm in therapy for people that refuse to get therapy.
12103.0,Patient,"yeah and. You know, like, I know I need therapy, but it's also kind of like that's kind of strange these people who need guidance understand the basic idea of consent, and this and there are people who don't do that in the real world like I don't know why."
705.0,Provider,"And to me to Sophia is that's a good question, and it is like, why is the central you know I know for myself. I think of it is that we're we evolve and we change and we do that, every day, and sometimes. Where you may be, and where I may be, and where other maybe you're at different levels and so sometimes people aren't open to learning something new. there's so set in their ways that they feel like their way or the highway and they're not open to anything else that's their level of where they are. Where you know I hear you talk in your so you have empathy you've lived the experience, where you know what it can be like. You have more of a global view you know and everything else that that encompasses this other person that maybe. We might even say seems clueless because they are they closed all those doors to where they are right now, and so they're not paying for fillings they're not you know it's like i'm going to protect myself by just like remaining an educated remaining like not open to anything."
12103.0,Patient,"Okay. that's one that's that's one way, just because I didn't I didn't think of it that way. It was always like a floating question in my head like. Like I keep mentioning or when we do the this the surveys and always asked like how many times have you been hospitalized since the last time you did the survey. And it always makes me think about that question of like why it is that you know people are the way they are at this point, and like you said it's because they're they're still in this space of like a safety for them and. And I just can't shake it this this like because I know that that's an answer and I have it in my habit in my toolbox, but also like I I can't help but wonder how someone who I stayed with someone who was labeled as very violent and. impulsive and just overall, just like a quote unquote because that's what his roommate said look up. But I I didn't see it, and maybe you know, like maybe I maybe I didn't see it, or maybe he's always been that way or. he's just like that towards the nurses, but whenever we're eating together or doing an activity, he doesn't bother anybody. He even if you make eye contact he doesn't bother you unless you say something like hey do you want to do this. He doesn't not bother that would be that would be the worst I mean like he doesn't acknowledge anything until you talk to him, so I was just kind of like hot interesting, I wonder if there's something going on, like in the brain, but one way that we look at it is the. where people are at in their safety zones right. So i'm going to think about that right now. And then there's my uncle who like. who sometimes still should like have that trauma from July, when I was hospitalized who he is a CEO and he has his life pretty much done for him, but he doesn't understand i'm talking to crisis, please leave me alone. Do not go into a room, you know it's kind of interesting. But yeah."
705.0,Provider,"You attribute that Sophia because we all have different ways, and I just gave you my way, like the point of view about that other we all have many ways to look at it, would you attribute like for him, is it more of like a lack of a boundary like respecting boundaries."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I kind of came up with. Like after my stay it's the lack of boundaries and there is something else, like ever since I was little I remembered him is very i'm. Very alpha very controlling like things have to be a certain way around him and like he is the sun and everyone else is a planet orbiting and I am like that outlier asteroids that refuses to orbit around the sun."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
12103.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,solar system.
12103.0,Patient,"I feel I think it's also because i'm into sciences and stuff, but I think it's the best way to describe it without trying to be mean. Because I don't really do well with people who are in a place of authority that abuse it. In my case, with my uncle he has a tendency to be very dominating in every aspect. So I guess that's one you're right about the bounder, it is a boundary thing but it's also like he's always had a problem with people having a different opinion so. It kind of like underestimated for a second there I kind of felt like I felt underestimated i'm not underestimate overestimated like he expected. me being in therapy and taking the medications that I am completely okay to be pressed and the truth is it's not it's just like anyone else with medication or not, if you press a button so many times someone's going to explode. So sorry I don't know where this came from."
705.0,Provider,"Oh it's a great conversation Sophie I know you're saying it i'm just thinking yeah It makes sense, he says CEO he's used to having that a third, you know, being the CEO he tells people what to do and it's like hey. i'm your nice i'm not to employ it's like Kevin that boundary and then the lack of appreciation that you are your own person and that you are an adult now you're no longer the child that maybe you know when you were a child were you were you more. agreeable and like okay uncle."
12103.0,Patient,"I guess so but it's it kind of depended on how it relates so most of my actions are were always seen in relation to my mom I think it was a cultural thing, where, as a people view your child is a reflection of yourself. and your parenting. So I never wanted my mom to ever be seen as a neglectful or like a poor parents, because or a parent with poor parenting skills. You know, but when it was always not related to my mom if my mom was not in the picture like say she's at work or like she is somewhere else. Then there's this other Sofia that comes off disrespectful but it's only because I never want to be in a place where i've ever felt small when I am verbal you know, like as a child, you know, or like as a person, now, not as a therapist or as. A woman with a privilege, you know nothing wrong with her about that, but as a person I think it's completely wrong. to bully a child, you know and bully the child's parent. for something that is a cultural cultural shock for him and, that being you know, like how I was raised, maybe different to the way he was raised, and so to expect that same. parenting that he got and forcing that onto the child and the mother is kind of like Why are you doing so as a child, like, I was only like agreeable when my mother was around and when she wasn't like I was my own person. which always landed me in a lot of trouble, but it also taught me a lot of things like how to word things and like how to see other people's opinions, which is why now my problem is there's so much empathy there that like it's hard to focus on myself. So, but it's still like there's a part of me that's like that girl that gets pushed around and she's like I don't like this, stand up for yourself so she's still there she's just a little bit like wilted but she's like you know, like if they give her water every day think she'll be okay."
705.0,Provider,"And you know what to us it's like sometimes if we're using that analogy of a plant and sometimes for plants, you know, in order to grow, is that they have to be pruned. And you know if we take a look at that that it's like yeah we approved, sometimes, whether we like it or not, life and that. yeah flower that may form there the, the greater the roots like we talked about transplanting and how a plant can thrive better and have stronger roots when you replan it. it's like just like that analogy is like yeah given ourselves grace, though, that you know what Sophia. I love that you're able to reflect back to where we were as a child understand that already you were doing it Sophia style where your uncle was sharing this but you're like wait a minute i'm going to verbalize who I really am right. And then."
12103.0,Patient,don't think of it that way.
705.0,Provider,"yeah you are ready, where you know, like regardless if i'm a child, this is Sophia style where here's my truth and i'm going to continue to share and as an adult being able to even if life is challenging I always say i'm in recovery recover from life every day. bounce back you know, and we do it in different ways and that's Okay, I appreciate that were unique and different."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you, I appreciate that it's it's kind of a I feel like I normally. would like a reminder like that, like maybe if I like right, I know, and then screenshot it and then make that my wallpaper in just like say that, like you're important."
705.0,Provider,Yes.
12103.0,Patient,you're going to explode if you don't say anything say something.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and then have honored that also. Even as you know, even as a young child you honored that and you said something you respect it your mom, not to say it in front of your mom but you honor time and place that you felt comfortable with."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah and. I just have to like keep practicing that because it's so easy like I mentioned it in group it's so easy to fall. it's like a bad diet really bad habit it's so easy to fall into like the bad stuff and then harder to stay on the good stuff because I feel like we're what i'm surrounded with mostly or what I surround myself with is that negative self talk, but also that idea of me. That not capable and I keep thinking that I keep hearing that and I feel that maybe if I practice. Thinking the opposite and looking at things differently, like john john. I felt so bad complaining about yesterday because john's probably drawn and Michael and everyone are going through their own battles every day, you may even be going through your own battles every day and. And I I realized that like you know, like I should be thankful that i'm in a place where people. Even though they're not okay completely they make it a safe place for other people and that kind of made me all teary after the. The call that's why I left abruptly without really saying goodbye cuz I just started crying and I was just like yeah like there's people who are having it. Bad are just as bad as your and yet they're sharing what goodness, they have left or what they have at the moment to make you understand that you're good and that you're you're worth. That goodness, and I don't think that I think about those things, every day, and you know it's kind of like energy or like you have a certain amount of energy and there are people who give up a lot of their energy for people like you, who like want to be better. And even though they themselves need that energy for themselves, I know that was just very human and It made me like really think about what I was really complaining about. Like who cares if I don't graduate Yet the fact that you're doing something about it is one thing."
705.0,Provider,"Also, though Sofia at the time, and especially I I can I can understand when it comes to birthdays that all of it comes up where we're like you name it it's coming from all directions."
12103.0,Patient,"And so, for you."
705.0,Provider,"To be able to say in group, how you felt I think is is also honoring those feelings and sometimes were unclear, you were able to come back from it and say hey i'm grateful to also. What the other Members had to say and supported me where yeah maybe I can walk away from this and take something from it, but again during that moment. you're human you have feelings and thoughts and a lot of times you know we don't know where we're going with it it's just important to be able to share it and saying this is what's coming up for me."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you so much, it does help. it's like a I just feel like you know that that feeling where you feel like you're taking up a lot of space at a certain amount of time and you want to give everybody, the same amount of space. that's how I feel when I share, or like if it's like sharing even a little bit feels like i'm taking a lot from people. So i'm working on that, like Jesse said, like I related a lot to what Jesse was saying, because you know, like cultural or not I feel like that's just what was expected of her where it's better if you don't share anything and. You know the world won't know your pain and you, you won't burden other people with it and it sucks that like you know, like if I hear that from someone else. Their problem I won't hesitate to let them know, otherwise I won't hesitate to tell them like no, you have every right to share how you feel you're in this world to and then but weirdly when it comes to myself it's like well you know what."
705.0,Provider,yourself right.
12103.0,Patient,And i'm trying not to do that it's just really hard.
705.0,Provider,"And then Group to the beauty of group is sometimes people need more time and sometimes not like, yes, we ultimately have this. Dedicated time but within that we go by what the Group is giving and some people are at the level where they want to share more, and they need that that day. Where others are just like look i'm in a bad space, but i'm not comfortable sharing right now I just need to know this is a safe place for me to hang out and absorb. Some supportive energy and so it's it's all you know all different wise, but you know one good thing to Sofia is sometimes to just think you know because you're very good at what would you say to a friend and then, if you can put yourself there and then say it back to yourself."
12103.0,Patient,"I can, I can try to do that, like. it's Okay, not to be happy right now. As long as it's like like for me personally i'm. talking to myself it's harder and harder because maybe I need to work on negative self talk and discounting like you mentioned because. Those are the two troublesome things that I deal with on a daily and it's not much the overthinking, even though there are days when I overthink about a situation. it's mostly just a lot of discounting and a lot of that bad habit of talking badly about myself and and to change that and make it into like a wallpaper or something or a little note on something i'm reading once in a while."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"I used to do that I don't know why I stopped when I was little, and I would agree we're not little, but when I was younger I would read and I wouldn't scribble on the margins, but not notes on the book, but like just little reminders to myself, like it's okay and. I don't think i've ever said that to anyone. I don't know why I stopped like I should probably keep going."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so it's good that you're letting this all come out and no longer do you feel the need to edit what you're sharing. yeah and you're finding out new things that work for you and you're also knowing that look there's a lot of other factors. You were saying to with medication withdrawing from something all of that is also factored in. So on each day it's like becoming more and more comfortable that. We don't always have to package, it up and put a bow on it, and all that we don't need it to look like this pretty presenting you know present each day, sometimes we just come as we are and we're rough around the edges and it's just like. here's what I want to share, and all this is this is how i'm feeling in that judging part if you're judging to release that part and to learn how to identify some of these negative things that you're saying is there, usually one or two things that you tend to to say to yourself."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah it is. And I would. like an example would probably be like. When one more in group and someone shares something devastating. I kind of look inward and I say like your problems aren't that important look at this person like they need help, like they need support and you're complaining about what and so maybe I could change it into I am I have feelings too. and I have problems to I guess it's a battle a constant like conscious battle, or like unconscious because sometimes I think about these things, even when i'm asleep, but like. it's that idea that. i've grown to understand life as a series of. fortunes and misfortunes and in that way, I also see it as like a comparison of yours versus other people's pain my sister, and I call it pain Olympics, or the paint like the light it's like a competition of how people feel um who has a worse. And I feel that that's. Affected how I treat myself and, like my situations and. You know that part of me that was like always defending myself get smaller and smaller each time I think about that and but it gets funny thing, though, is that part of myself that wants to protect myself grows bigger when i'm angry. So I guess it to their resentment like it builds."
705.0,Provider,"It can, and a lot of things, as you know, can have the pros and cons of it, and sometimes with anger is people think oh it's only negative, but no anger, a lot of times the anger is what initiates people to advocate to make changes in this world, and so it can also be used to motivate."
12103.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"And I like where you know Sofia you're like Okay, so this is what I tell myself, and these are the things that I can start doing were to affirm to challenge that thought. that's one way you know and that's a great technique, you can also try Sophia because there's different things, and you get to pick and choose with Sofia style. You can also do what's the evidence for this and you can really explore here's the evidence for it but guess what now i'm going to do what's the evidence against it. And he mirrors my evidence against it and really be honest and to be a little think outside of the box. And when we start to look at the evidence against how we really feel that core filling it breaks it down and it's just like it's okay to feel like. Other people are in pain more on some days and I feel grateful for, where I am but i'm not going to feel ashamed for me feeling the way I feel today, so you can have both it can be a balance, where that self talk goes one way and it's like let's bring it back. let's be able does yeah no right balance it."
12103.0,Patient,That sounds like my style actually. Like. I like balance.
705.0,Provider,"You can adjust, if needed, whatever you know I always say if it doesn't apply let it fly when in doubt check it out."
12103.0,Patient,"I remember that, from the first meeting yeah when they joined."
705.0,Provider,"yeah because it comes back to you and the more you believe and what coping strategies you tend to use or what you like, even when you say something you know what words what language speaks to you."
12103.0,Patient,"It does so i'm gonna write that down so evidence. So I had to write it down because I don't want to forget these things, I have a tendency to forget and. Yes, so I have it under my coping strategies, where it has all of my phone numbers that I have and the crisis and the text. number. yeah it's becoming a bigger safety plan or the bigger list of coping so. i'm kind of happy about it."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I can see, I see a small there and i'm wondering to probably more curious Sophia because I know today is October the 20th. And so, this day what would you call this day for you."
12103.0,Patient,It is a good day.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
12103.0,Patient,What were you gonna call.
705.0,Provider,Well i'm my is as far as the special day like. it's the day like after the celebration or no celebration.
12103.0,Patient,"Oh yeah no I don't blame you, you can say i'm not going to be upset I promise."
705.0,Provider,I just want to see where you are today.
12103.0,Patient,"i'm pretty i'm feeling better when I woke up I knew it wasn't my birthday anymore, and that was it was like sad but for like not really. Like I was sad because I had. Like i'm no longer in the SPA but happy that it's it's a different day you know. And I don't feel that yeah and I. I still feel the same despite being older."
705.0,Provider,"yeah can you embrace growing older, can you can you have a different level today of embracing that."
12103.0,Patient,yeah I can try.
