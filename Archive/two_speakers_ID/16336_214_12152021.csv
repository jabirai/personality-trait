214.0,Provider,"Oh, you."
16336.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, how are you."
214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking."
16336.0,Patient,yeah I couldn't figure out how to get one of these virtual background so you're stuck with my books but.
214.0,Provider,There you go good fine.
16336.0,Patient,"yeah i'm sure it'll be good. i'll have to work on a green screen later today, most of the time I have my zoom's and they get to see everything anyway, but there you go, it can be distracting Okay, so I got your sheet. About true North worksheets. And I didn't know what values you meant like religious, political I didn't know. and I don't know, maybe you had a."
214.0,Provider,So. The idea here is hold on. There we go. So. What our values to you.
16336.0,Patient,"um. well. Of. I guess sort of codes, how you run your life in a sense, you know. Little and big things that you think maybe others should do, but you certainly. want to be doing them yourself, though we're very complicated beings so half the time we can't do them or don't but that's that's another matter, and then. and You know, big bigger things that you think society should be doing like on mass we shouldn't be killing each other, I mean that's hopefully that one's a little bit hanging fruit, but. So I don't know was that specific enough or to be."
214.0,Provider,"well. What are your values, not the world's values, what are your eyes, not your opinions so values to me with consistent something like this okay. I believe in the lemon tree and I hug it every day religiously for the last 20 years my values are, I believe in the tree I hug it. I don't say I believe in the tree and then I don't have it, so I see something I have a value for, and then I show the value of it that's probably a general stable. So that's really where the value is coming. So what another way to look at is, we can talk either two sides of my mouth. I believe in God, but I can have infidelity and rob banks, because he forgives everybody it's not a value."
16336.0,Patient,Right okay i'm gonna I agree with with both.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, that, and this is about, we don't talk about this a lot so everybody be like what is he really trying to get out it's really not about that it's just like. You know these are like core beliefs core beliefs values if we believe in being. A pest criterium we won't eat need to build each like fish own so that that's kind of we say what we mean and our actions follow it there's no discrepancy between the two, that would be our values."
16336.0,Patient,"Okay, well, I guess there's. You know, but as as far as following let's say. A doctrine, for example, um I maybe there's a doctrine out there, that I follow, I certainly was brought up Catholic, for example, but. I don't follow the doctrine so. um but you know, to go with food, for example, I am a vegetarian, so I don't eat. me okay i'm the past scary but."
214.0,Provider,But perfect.
16336.0,Patient,So you know I don't know if that's a value is that.
214.0,Provider,"That is evaluate what you say. What you see, is what you follow. I don't steal but every time I go into the candy store when the pig an extra candy bar that's a conflict in a value and that's actually what we call a discord of core belief you're seeing one thing we're doing another not you. And and people don't understand that that conflict causes conflict internal. Sure he's he's."
16336.0,Patient,"You say you're great you're like you have this belief, but you're not really following it in exactly and you're maybe suffering consequences internally or by society's. Okay alright, so I so i'm a Presbyterian and. I don't smoke, no, no, no smoke never did smoke don't want to smoke. I mean, I have some of those those are really easy you know."
214.0,Provider,"But but but they all start off with the easy ones, then they start to get a little."
16336.0,Patient,Difficult yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Because, then they become more about. taking sides values aren't about taking sides it's about. I guess the best one would be the vaccination someone will believe that there's a value to the vaccination they get to vaccinate now the problem comes do you judge others who don't get the vaccination. Oh yeah becomes. Now the value issue there becomes. you're less than me yeah there's some judgment to it. And I was just trying to figure out, you know we clear about judgments and values, listen, we can have judgments for grownups. um but but we can't say one thing and say unilaterally applies to all like being a Presbyterian everybody should be plus concerns that's a broad stroke, so that is. Stress not a value now that's i'm imposing my belief on something that can't be about you."
16336.0,Patient,"yeah that's you know when each of us run the world it'll look a little different right but. But but yeah and and or maybe it won't and will only put that. yeah I can't imagine making everyone to pass continue anyway, the. huh okay so yeah it's still. it's still hard to list, how you are, I think. You know."
214.0,Provider,"Again yeah yeah this is this is this is actually like it's almost like a 90 day program to do this one, in theory, because it's like so where Am I where's where's my beginning."
16336.0,Patient,I don't know what a 90 day program is but.
214.0,Provider,"i'll be meaning, it takes it, it takes approximately 12 weeks to complete this properly."
16336.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"it's never done in one swift I got an ego it's really about Okay, I think I identified with the circle is okay I get it. Maybe I want to add some maybe I want to take some off and then is so what am I current strategies and are they working so seems like pesky Italians were confused he's like No Smoking is working for you. What is some of the things that may not be working for you like being away from family."
16336.0,Patient,yeah it's definitely not working.
214.0,Provider,Being being being upset about traffic in California.
16336.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"and That may not be a value, but it really starts to say so, why Why am I, putting all this energy over here, although it's factual how come I can't shift energy over the year."
16336.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,"Right, so the idea here is, and I say this too many people work with. Where is it where is a thing I saw the results you achieve will be in direct proportion to the effort you apply for go into the rabbit hole will stay there. All that energy getting to the rabbit hole instead of taking all that energy and placing it outside the rabbit hole."
16336.0,Patient,"And, and I guess. And what do you know what if you don't know how to move the energy or where to move it to."
214.0,Provider,awesome but are you are is one understanding that the energies misplace.
16336.0,Patient,so well.
214.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
16336.0,Patient,i'm a pretty sad person. I cry way too frequently and so i'm going to say yes.
214.0,Provider,"So when I look at your surveys, they don't reflect that."
16336.0,Patient,"Oh, my God Okay, I mean maybe the rest of the wrong question, I mean."
214.0,Provider,"I know now now you're onto something you see just because i'm telling you that's not what it's reflective maybe this isn't the right assessment tool. Because in depression, this has you had a seven."
16336.0,Patient,versus you know versus.
214.0,Provider,sounds like you should be more than 20 you cry all the time.
16336.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Well, I want to presume you bathe you brush your teeth he sleep."
16336.0,Patient,yeah I do those things.
214.0,Provider,"Now, if you didn't this number would be triple the number. Because right so i'm i'm wondering if what's not really happening is not only the loneliness but the whole the whole full the hopelessness."
16336.0,Patient,"of changing that loneliness is not good, I don't see a great change. I don't see him a move to change and so. So when i'm feeling tired well, of course, I feel tired, since I gave birth to my daughter So there you go but let's see feel bad about yourself well mostly. yeah I do and then. Several days. yeah I don't know I felt like I felt like the answer was several days like I sat there all day thinking about my failure, I would say, multiple times per week, not a whole day you know you can't. The world comes crashing in it, you, you know you ride you can't think about yourself all day and I try not to anyway, but. Several times per week, how about this 20 times per week I think of myself bad about myself and think that i'm a failure to my family but it's not all day."
214.0,Provider,"Fair enough, but it's 20 times. it's 20 times you decided that you're judging myself the ufo value."
16336.0,Patient,"Quarterly yeah and it might not last that long. And then someone calls me or you know, a dog barks and I knocked out of that thought."
214.0,Provider,"Right, but no one's actually called you email text to send you a special message."
16336.0,Patient,For my failure.
214.0,Provider,Now you really suck them every other. Word Has anybody done that.
16336.0,Patient,"No, they haven't, but I think that I instead of doing that they're avoiding me or you know, whatever other consequence, I think that's coming up or you know, like my daughter has anxiety why didn't I noticed that all of these years. don't know but I haven't."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, I I, I will say something that will either irritate you or put up like I wish I would have thought of that. So, no one gave you a big s on your chest. No one."
16336.0,Patient,No one gave me a psychology degree to know exactly sentence sure.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but, but your daughter has anxiety it's not a debilitating disease, where she's."
16336.0,Patient,She she went you know we're working on it great parts great.
214.0,Provider,"So then, why is this your fault, because you didn't notice him."
16336.0,Patient,because she suffers and I don't want her to.
214.0,Provider,Okay.
16336.0,Patient,"And if I noticed earlier or thought of something earlier Oh, please The other thing is, you know my neighbor my neighbor. said wow I think your daughter not, this is not bragging I didn't notice it, you know might be, you know highly intelligent I think she might be gifted i'm like she's four and I love her to death. i'm like i'm not sure she does, I think she might be showing up kindergarten teacher says the same thing, what. What I played with five year olds before. Net wouldn't have thought it wouldn't have thought I had to be told. So I you know where Am I."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I think you were supposed to be, I think I think if you will all that in the bag of chips you'd be a lot better, but you put your pants on like I do one leg, at a time, I think your expectations are higher than they should be i'm being honest because. Maybe I don't want my children to be in pain need them, I don't have children, I have kids in their 30s."
16336.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,"It bothers me tremendously that i've may have missed something I also not going to beat myself up because I did. Only because. I have multiple responsibilities at the time they will upbringing and i'll be honest, maybe my best wasn't good enough, but that's all I had to offer at the time and I don't punish myself a body. I remember you told me a great story that I thought was and I told this."
16336.0,Patient,"All right, I am it is bad parenting and you thought the opposite. With my shaking the thing and make it look like."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, my God that I am still elated by that story. i'm glad you had. The compassion, not to fall apart and not to get into the reality of fact that you didn't have a quarter, but to make your daughter happy, you went the extra mile which meant you had to suffer more pain realizing you didn't have a quarter think about that sacrifice wonderful sacrifice. So i'm just thinking there's there's this Lol where. If I if the only person to blame is me that it has to be I must be the common denominator, I think this is ultimately something some cycle urine about I should have soared earlier, I should have known she was gifted. I don't I have to say I don't agree, but I don't want you to feel bad because, like how are you supposed to have known all this and aren't people who see other people less more observant than the ones we see all the time."
16336.0,Patient,Right sometimes that is the case. yeah.
214.0,Provider,What we can see what we can seek as well with it all the time.
16336.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"I just think you're in a serious law, and I want to be honest you're very truthful. But I also think in that truth there's some catastrophic thinking that goes on."
16336.0,Patient,"Well that's true. That is true, I don't think of harming myself but i'm i'm i'm in a or harming others as you asked me way back, but um. yeah i'm. yeah. I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but you're you're an independent woman how you're putting yourself on some level i'm not sure, but you've done what most have failed to do still there's no great accomplishment for you in this."
16336.0,Patient,yeah well. yeah.
214.0,Provider,To be lonely I think.
16336.0,Patient,there's that. Is. Tough to be lonely.
214.0,Provider,And maybe that makes us frustrated and angry.
16336.0,Patient,"Okay, but we're still only and we're still frustrated and angry."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough i'm going to respect that and and definitely empathize with it, but I would tell you that at the end of the day, why aren't you loving yourself enough to know that. you're not lonely because you're choosing to be a because you're a terrible person just the clients that have landed right now it's not ultimately forever."
16336.0,Patient,"Ah. OK, well, I mean it's been a long time of this long, I have this loneliness feeling I mean. Last year, I had the. The therapist to you know repeat it back to me what I said, but the reason I went was this you know, so it wasn't working, and you know they're fair enough, but uh. yeah and it took me a long time to do it as it is and then years before then, you know you have here current strategies of how you were trying to like get around it. Okay, so you know i'm trying some of those so then i'm thinking and then and they're not working, but I haven't given up on them and then. So, then I think okay what skills, do you need to make the journey well definitely insight into maybe how i'm coming across so maybe that's why i'm not you know, am I coming across as aloof. You know don't need you, you know type of thing, and so, therefore, you know, no one calls, you know to hang out or do whatever and insight so that it kind of inside maybe I need to allow myself to be more vulnerable with other people so maybe i'm coming across as holier than now, God knows. And that no one wants, you know okay so then. Maybe i'm choosing people who are. You know I don't know more dependent. I don't know, but then you know with this, the vulnerability thing I have that predator versus brace so I don't want to be the prey so I don't want to give up. My well in theory, I don't want to give up my. I don't want to show my vulnerabilities just like you know the newborn gazelle and the African plains doesn't want to either so they'll be chased down by the lion you know. And that's kind of how I feel you know you."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so you just revealed the whole lot in that last sentence about what's going on yeah. So you are inherently stuck in fight. inherently your parasympathetic nervous system is always in fight, because you will not be. A flight, you will not lose ground, you will not lose your way you'll be alpha to any situation."
16336.0,Patient,And that's wow.
214.0,Provider,Well you're you're you're saying you don't want to be prey what would that indicate dominance.
16336.0,Patient,"True, but not everyone in the gazelle hurt his his. His prey and not everyone in the lion. process is is the alpha."
214.0,Provider,"But that's not what you said you said I don't want to be so the opposite of I don't want to be, as I have to be this. If you're not going to be pretty going to be dominant. I don't think there's I think inherently. there's something that you want to find a flaw to the you can actually determine this is why this is happening, like a math equation every math equation has an answer, the problem with life is it just sucks and it doesn't have answers."
16336.0,Patient,"Well yeah I mean i've been. Throwing at you know random strategies, all the time. And so, oh yeah and I forgot there's so that we already talked about the metrics and I don't have any So there you go and then. Was the other one oh the vitamin D, which I found was point two, eight so. In the web, you know the Internet that are new God. You can find two charts you know 10 to 13 good or. Good you can argue about it but point two, eight means i'm really sort of. Certainly not deficient."
214.0,Provider,But you're not you're not in range either.
16336.0,Patient,"Well, depends on the chart you look at. You guys chart i'm not in range, but the one for my doctor I am. My own doctor when we did blood tests in the summer. For my physical. So you know we can argue about it but devastated."
214.0,Provider,"I definitely. I definitely don't need to. debate the vitamin D, but I would debate, the one thing you said when you were tested in the summer."
16336.0,Patient,yeah I went to I had a physical and we did all that stuff and then I did it again for you guys just the bloodwork.
214.0,Provider,"So that's what i'm trying to find them, I cannot find it live results."
16336.0,Patient,I don't know I eventually found them i'm not gonna be able to find them.
214.0,Provider,"Like on the fly right now i'm looking at it. Okay, so we say you're deficient that love says you're not sufficient."
16336.0,Patient,"Right same result. I mean, as far as the numbers."
214.0,Provider,But not the same testing dates or same month.
16336.0,Patient,What was that one August.
214.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16336.0,Patient,Mine was June.
214.0,Provider,"I don't want to split it I I I could just tell you from the research. and empirical evidence we know the vitamin D deficiency whether it's off by one off by 200. Has. increases those to have depression, when the lack of vitamin D. So I could be totally wrong, but when I look at your depression score is there were seven if there were 20 I would continue to make a platform that the vitamin D would be helpful at seven i'm not going to make that argument with i'm going to make dollars. I heard some interesting things that I don't see in you and that's not helpful to you, the problem is you don't have an audience, so you become your own MC your audience your own show. And it becomes like this revolving door of this has to be all the facts and I don't think that's true at all."
16336.0,Patient,"Okay, but here I am i'm trying to get in my audience i'm doing it i'm trying to do my little strategies here and one is you so. that's you."
214.0,Provider,Fantastic but here's the thing what what is the ultimate commitment to. i'm going to do it for as long as it takes in that set it out of the 90 day on your 20 day one year three year Program.
16336.0,Patient,I don't understand why.
214.0,Provider,"When you're saying you're doing it and you're trying some strategies are you ultimately saying this is for indefinite until it launches, what do you have."
16336.0,Patient,"Oh, I have."
214.0,Provider,To tell me.
16336.0,Patient,"I can't tell you I mean, I presume, my insurance probably puts it into it, at some point, no doubt, I don't really know and then a. I don't I don't know like another one I have is join a book club which I did i'll just join i'll just keep reading books."
214.0,Provider,"You know, in theory, started reading books."
16336.0,Patient,yeah that's why I joined the book Club to do one a month. When I used to do Brazil.
214.0,Provider,"berto so now, this is called going out of your comfort zone."
16336.0,Patient,"Going if I didn't actually talk about it. So now i've been in this thing a year, I mean i'm not going to stop some months I didn't get to the book I didn't finish it cuz but there you go I you know hey but i'm not giving up the ship, so I mean i'm not sure I guy. I actually joined the Church, which I think has my values, not Catholic but there you go and of course we have andranik so I can't do another zoom so when they go back, I can go back, maybe, and then I think so, I mean they have my values I think so what's The other thing that I. I had a list of people that I text every week every week I haven't listed on my kitchen I text him how are you what's been going on, you know the reach out. And I write 10 letters, a month. I can't tell you like, I thought, these up i'm like Okay, I could do these I can do these i'm gonna try i'm gonna try them so for a year i've been doing the book club and the writing letters well and two years the tech. The Church I joined, about a year before the pandemic so i've been like trying to recognize the problem and. and move forward to a strategy that you know solution at strategy. And i'm churning and churning. You know, in the same pool. So."
214.0,Provider,"Is it possible, you just in the wrong pool club, you need to find another one."
16336.0,Patient,Another cool club.
214.0,Provider,pool. You show you.
16336.0,Patient,Oh i'm in the same pool yeah.
214.0,Provider,it's it's right.
16336.0,Patient,"So so yeah you're gonna find that, because the Church."
214.0,Provider,People I don't know I know you.
16336.0,Patient,None of these people.
214.0,Provider,Do you have meetups where you're at.
16336.0,Patient,"Sure, I did the meetup book club for a while, but then they switch to zoom and I found another one that was meeting in person. shocker. And so. yeah so I did the zoom for. For about three four months with the the meetup one, but then this other book club agreed to meet like in a Park, so it can be separate you know. And so that one i've been with a year yeah I think the year this month. So. So, but none of these groups are the same people."
214.0,Provider,that's a good thing.
16336.0,Patient,"Right, so you know that, so I feel like i've been trying to step in new pools. and So so it's like when you're divorced six times it's you okay not them and that's. that's okay so you're saying if it's yellow."
214.0,Provider,It wattles it quacks. yeah it's got to be a dog that's what you're saying.
16336.0,Patient,"It might be, it might be a duck yeah cuz i'm in all these things and. You know Okay, so I maybe I have the wrong strategy, maybe they have the wrong attitude."
214.0,Provider,"I don't i'm not sure I. I, I want to tell you that if we keep looking in with a common denominator and we're just closing the box tighter and tighter we're making a circle tighter and tighter and easier to just say the hell with it. Okay, I would, I would express it. it's not you are, it could be that the world is falling apart at the seams because of the pandemic, maybe the people that would want to meet don't want to be on the circumstances they don't want to get into an argument there's so much going on, that we don't know with other people. That we assume that. No one wants to do, and so we were basically just need to isolate I think there's millions of people that feel that way this just inherently the strategies may not be working because of the environment. You know, you may want to be an astronaut, the problem is when you're at you can't be one it's a bad strategy."
16336.0,Patient,"Unless you know Jeff bezos which I don't, but I could someday anyway, nothing hahaha but the but some of these, these are the ones I have now, but the Church, I actually joined four years ago. And I didn't."
214.0,Provider,will be hoping. When you join the church what were you seeking. God I pray well not not God not literally.
16336.0,Patient,"I think that I thought that I could. I could join one of their volunteer groups, which of course churches have a gazillion and that matters to me, and I would meet other people who that matters to them as well. And these people would become. Ideally acquaintances with any With any luck, you know more, so I. uh yeah so to me that the Catholic Church and you know, please don't be. You know insulted because we just have a we have and we'd like like but. uh is awful in so many ways, and so I couldn't I I resisted that even the concept of joining any church for the longest time. But I didn't want to try too many places and. I just didn't know how to. figure it out, I just didn't know how to figure out how to how to how to have a group, you know or a pool of people, you know, like when you're in. like an office pool like for you you're isolated now maybe you're normally in an office suite that has lots of therapists but or maybe you're not but you see my constant. You know I. I you know don't have a pool of people and. You know, like and when you join school or whatever so. But."
214.0,Provider,So so i'm going to throw something at you. yeah what the hell right why don't you start your own group.
16336.0,Patient,Okay. yeah I started a meetup group and invite people that have whatever.
214.0,Provider,"that's happening soon i'm right i'm right on the website. yeah simple hosts reach out to new people host the safe event I listen if you don't cast the line in the water. yeah yeah so you're not catching fish right. It sounds like you're resilient but the resiliency isn't finding the fuel to continue, because the pool. Is isn't isn't creating enough energy it, but you keep going into it, maybe the idea is any of the pools that are pre created aren't anything that's going to be valued for you, maybe what's value to us to find. The things that you're thinking about like I thought I would do this and I thought it would be that well, maybe there were 10 other people, just like you were thinking, the same thing, but don't have. The part to initiate how to do it, I don't know if i'm right or wrong."
16336.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's not wrong it's not a wrong idea.
214.0,Provider,"You know you tell one person who does not person who does five people down and before you know it, the fish story is all out of whack there's somebody to get hold of the story, but it has to start from one nucleus. And again, I i'm not blaming the pandemic, but the pandemic is basically seven."
16336.0,Patient,"Of course, and and the pandemic wreaked havoc on certainly myself, and I see that i'm in and made it hard for everybody else, and every time I see a person we talked to a lot of pandemic stuff and what we felt, and you know, mostly clients or. You know what whatever. So i'm. i'm just concerned because, of course, of course, the pandemic did this, but. In in most ways in my life i'm back i'm back i'm back, I mean i've been to a concert and you know, a play and. You know I just have to wear a mask and supermarket but otherwise. You know life's good well life's life. back. But all of this happened before, I mean. I i've been. In for a long time."
214.0,Provider,"And I understand that, but. I don't know so you know. it's almost like a meetup group."
16336.0,Patient,"I have to think of what I want to meet, I mean, I have no idea what I want to do in a meetup group, but I can think of something. I guess yeah."
214.0,Provider,"I really just believe I know this been has been for a while, but I just think it's. it's just a bad circle and until we figure out it cut that open."
16336.0,Patient,If I can find your circle that was headed.
214.0,Provider,"And then, but there are some things to them currently keep you bolted, to the floor your family. You really care more because of finances your daughter with school they're inherently some things like you there's nothing that can be done at this moment to try to make a different change like create a whole new atmosphere, it just can't be done right now."
16336.0,Patient,"You know, but there are other people who are poor live in a different state from their family that they grew up with who have friends."
214.0,Provider,"And there's people with no feet that they'll complain about not having shoes. But you're not dumb. This is bothering you and I think like why it's really okay to have things bother you, but when be incapacitate you it's something different. it's something different, when we can't get out of our way we tried to we believe we're doing it, but we're not and it's like so what else can I do what more do you want me to do it's not working less I get it. But inevitably things have to have a continuum, even if they don't work we do something new and something new and something no."
16336.0,Patient,"Alright let's go back here to the north thing, what is the north east, west and thing about. What does that mean."
214.0,Provider,"So you need to you all the concept is someone always must go true north. The problem is most people don't know what their true north is you know whether it's. Drug addiction mental health issues crisis's physical ailments they're always going in the wrong direction, so the way that they address true north. Is can we start to get this some bias and core beliefs, if we can start to learn, and what we believe in is actually what we're following then we're going in a true North direction if you're going other than true North you're not going into the right direction. So our campus so."
16336.0,Patient,"yeah I understand the compass thinking to north. But, most people are either West south east."
214.0,Provider,"And when we talk about true north or not people like what do you what I get it, because where do you talk about values core beliefs. Core beliefs, usually a corrupt diocese the corrupt it's a bankruptcy system once people don't understand that they have a bankrupt system, you know they believe they should work hard to play high that's that's a poor belief that's a bad value. So the idea here is sometimes just reviewing this will looking at like mm hmm that's interesting I didn't think about that myself. I say this but I don't really do that maybe I need to take that off as a values and probably take that off because I can't consistently say it. And follow through with it, I say one thing, but to another so that's really not a value before you know we waive all these things off, and then we start to get certain things like. I love my daughter, and I feel terrible I couldn't I didn't catch the same time that's a value, because the empathy. Is there the problem is, did you, is it a really a value because did you really have control of it, and you can explore that maybe not to have so much guilt, maybe not to punish yourself so much."
16336.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Like it kind of like helps us work through things. You know I don't know people say i'm a terrible parent and at times they weren't At times they weren't and then it's like Okay, you said, all the time now we realize you're not all the time. And it just I don't know just bring some relief to the catastrophic that i'm just broken i'm no good everything I do turns to crap. We start to fade away from them, we start to see clear lines when we take things and we push them to the side and that's what kind of this is about, this is about really exploring like the Church, the Church is always a good one. You know, I was raised Catholic by can't follow it can stand okay. But I go every Sunday well that's a problem."
16336.0,Patient,yeah I don't it's not I didn't join a Catholic Church.
214.0,Provider,or a church or anything to do.
16336.0,Patient,joins they have great value. And you know hey.
214.0,Provider,"or or or a particular supermarket I hate the employees now but I love the cells yeah that's a problem because you're saying one thing and you have to do another you're compromising. Your inner core belief and people don't see it, but that causes discord it causes problems with depression. Internal physical health and that's why we try to explore some of these things to like let's filter sudden certain things out and except we're human and we're going to say one thing and do another, but we can't listed as a value."
16336.0,Patient,"Okay, so it's, not that I. don't understand, with the whole thing is so. esoteric I just I got I can't I think without without. You know what do you call it, maybe prompt questioning or I don't know that."
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so here's a proud question why don't you love yourself."
16336.0,Patient,I I don't know.
214.0,Provider,"i'll tell you why. i'm going to tell you exactly why. You believe. Ultimately, where you're at you deserve it. Bad model people, avoiding did something worthy."
16336.0,Patient,"I def I definitely did a fair amount of things right, but I think."
214.0,Provider,Exactly.
16336.0,Patient,"What those two things are are so big but you know. The kindergarten teacher caught it and so that was early and that was good right so great so i'm i'm off the hook and i'm not supposed to be. An expert, since I only had the one five year old and I didn't have to to know that, like oh wow you know she's reading whatever in this one didn't. burn any age and they both seem you know lively and good, so I didn't yeah I could definitely talk myself through it and the anxiety not not so much because you know, looking back it was just a tad more obvious, but of course I mean I have my own Michigan then but um. But um. yeah. I, but you know, no one calls me. No one calls me."
214.0,Provider,Are they supposed to.
16336.0,Patient,yeah they are friends or people that like. Ideally call you. At some lloyd's.
214.0,Provider,Sometime.
16336.0,Patient,"Okay they're going through their own crap every single person for years. All right, sure okay i'm good."
214.0,Provider,"i'm good i'm going to just answer that really quickly, which will not solve any of this you have an expectation and that, ultimately, will be your downfall."
16336.0,Patient,"I think I slowly I don't have an expectation of other people all of that to me points to me not not to the others, not to the others."
214.0,Provider,"So them. So if you don't have an expectation of others, but you have an expectation of the self and therefore there's the reason they don't call it's you."
16336.0,Patient,it's me.
214.0,Provider,"it's me and you've asked them, have you asked him if it's you so you can confirm that."
16336.0,Patient,"No who wants to ask that question and it's an uncomfortable question for them, but yeah. Well, I could."
214.0,Provider,I went I think we're gonna find out for why.
16336.0,Patient,I am.
214.0,Provider,"I would, what."
16336.0,Patient,What are they gonna say I they're gonna say. Oh no Mary i'm just busy like if they really feel that and they want to spare my feelings what are they going to say but sure i'll ask them.
214.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah but even if they tell you the truth, you think they're lying."
16336.0,Patient,"Well, you know how you. yeah i'll ask enough to maybe i'll get some long. i'll i'll i'll think about how to ask it. In a more delicate way. You know, like oh. How are you. How do you keep up with all your phone calls right. and"
214.0,Provider,Passive aggressive.
16336.0,Patient,"It is, but I don't I want it i'm trying to."
214.0,Provider,"I I think listen Mary I just like to say, I want to wish you the happiest holidays and I want to start the New Year off with a found respectful all those I love, will you return my phone calls eventually because that's not passive aggressive that's just straight up assertive. And the reason I need to I don't want you to take all this blame like. I I truly don't know how to read you have some of them unless you do get provided with facts that it's not you."
16336.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay. alrighty so how about how about where. will acknowledge that i'm I I absolutely know i'm not the worst person on the planet, because."
214.0,Provider,perfect.
16336.0,Patient,"We can both list a few that would would would qualify better I mean i'm far from incredibly far from the worst person absolutely but how about if I do things that don't. allow access and so therefore i'm either missing it or i'm subtly or overtly not allowing and then, how do I recognize it. adapt or chicken or not adapt change it. No adapting."
214.0,Provider,"The idea here is, you have to find someone who will inherently you can just lay it on the line so listen. I believe that some of my actions. need some adjustments, but I can't get anybody to tell me if the way i'm speaking the way i'm acting the way my hand gestures, some of my comments are they are they. not good, are they off Court are they making people uncomfortable you know we assume that people who murder and do terrible things inherently a terrible people and then, when we look at their life and we figure out all the travels."
16336.0,Patient,"all ages love their soccer coach except he kills you know, whatever."
214.0,Provider,"22nd is a reason. Well, when that way you're trying to find out is if it's me Can someone help me change. that's exactly what you just said. No, I don't think it's I can make them."
16336.0,Patient,"If I could, if I could get them to spill the beans and it would have to be me to change. But."
214.0,Provider,But.
16336.0,Patient,You can only change if somebody said.
214.0,Provider,"But if someone said to you, Mary listen sometimes when you're talking about this topic. It seems pretty rude the way you dress it oh really I didn't really notice that I thought I was voicing my opinion. Can you give me an example yeah you said BA BA BA BA so I can't learn as someone doesn't address me and say listen, can I just point something out to you, so you don't have that audience your audience is you."
16336.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Right now, it may be difficult to get the audience to tell us what to do."
16336.0,Patient,right if I only had an audience that'd be great so I could ask even more of them. So there's there's The other thing that's getting the audience. huh.
214.0,Provider,"I, I think. That that would be extremely helpful."
16336.0,Patient,Now the problem what what. would be extremely helpful.
214.0,Provider,If you could get feedback.
16336.0,Patient,"Right so here here's The thing is, is. You know, we talked about these people I would get feedback from but i'm lonely I don't really feel like I have these people. You know that the people I text our clients and I text my family at home, which live in Massachusetts, so I would go visit him if they here I wouldn't you know I I think they do love me but they're not here So how do I. I would love to have a more you know I complained about the traffic but. it's you know you'd love to travel to someone it go into traffic if there was someone who said oh I can't wait to get to have you come over. I know traffic. Who is that person."
214.0,Provider,"who, I know, but you said something before you said I don't want to be vulnerable."
16336.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,We have to be vulnerable you'd have to call.
16336.0,Patient,me if i'm vulnerable than that's me. Okay.
214.0,Provider,"may not be happy. To tell someone. You have to tell somebody volume, you have to call your family's say i'm freaking miserable tell me you love me cry for help don't don't bitch about it tell somebody about it, you may be."
16336.0,Patient,yourself here i'm telling.
214.0,Provider,"I know, but I can provide you that part of the comfort you seeking I can provide you words in hopes that they they turn into some actions that provide you a positive result, but ultimately your loneliness has question you."
16336.0,Patient,"It is. it's crushing me. it's crushing me. Right now, without."
214.0,Provider,"Tell the family, I I don't know, I think we can't assume nobody's hearing us if we're not talking to them and telling them exactly how we feel not know angry man or put in a very vulnerable compassionate manner, I am truly sad being away from you it's, it is not deflating me."
16336.0,Patient,"It is it is depleting but what would be helpful, is if I knew how to make friendships and and. and have a friendship to you know say oh my God I wish my family was supposed to say Oh, I get it Mary you know you can use my shoulder, even though you don't have your brother or your sister. Correct yeah how do I do this."
214.0,Provider,I don't know how to do what What did you do seven years ago.
16336.0,Patient,I was a crazy Gal working in the PTA. Keeping myself busy busy busy.
214.0,Provider,busy oh idle time is crushing you.
16336.0,Patient,yeah can have that. So now.
214.0,Provider,This one is you can't have your cake and eat it too.
16336.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know what that means in this case."
214.0,Provider,"Well, it means keeping busy just not to feel isn't a good action."
16336.0,Patient,"yeah sadly that one, I know I know because now i'm not that busy and i've been trying to add, you know do things that my. occupied gauge not just occupy me. So um. So okay great and now, how do we do that, you know how, how do we get these things that are. yeah."
214.0,Provider,"Very difficult, there are no answers because anything we do has to start off doing it by ourselves in hopes that we can find the flock. So if you have idle time. I don't know you go to a local park and walk around do you go to a dog running see what's going on to dog runs you. Know go around a Community Center I did I don't know what will work what's not working is what we just can't find the damn answer and that's becoming certainly plus rated."
16336.0,Patient,"right but it's the same Gal who, let me tell you right now I walk around my neighborhood people say hi to me because I walk around so much like at the dog park or wherever you know. You know. I definitely have you know the library i'm there I go I go I don't I get books and I don't get books, I get movies now but um. You know Hello see them it's changing that to friendships I mean this kind of crap i've been doing forever trying, you know I listed my things about the text and letters in the church and whatever, but I do these other things too, I am so out and about in the Community and I. What am I doing wrong within all of these little activities that I do, that I know I can't just have busy time I know this, this is that's done that ship sailed. That ships ooh I know that already. I don't know. yep. So now you are."
214.0,Provider,doesn't mean we stop.
16336.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't but you know, neither does the crying neither does the law is, and so this is, this is the other part."
214.0,Provider,But you can't move towards your family but it's just not in the cards.
16336.0,Patient,yeah but. But why can't I have friends here then here would wouldn't be so unpleasant.
214.0,Provider,I would agree. Did you have friends did you have friends in the PTA.
16336.0,Patient,"uh. I mean i'd like to think of them as friends, I mean we're all all our kids went different places, after elementary school so they're like. You know, we don't we you."
214.0,Provider,"Know right, but so are you there was there was a disconnect whether it was from everybody equally or not. Right right that does so we don't know if those are viable options that may or may not be, but this is what happens ultimately anyway. We keep moving and then we keep bouncing then we keep saying how come I can't have any friends, well, we keep finding different things and we don't stay attached to something that was old that's yourselves and it says forget about it. I know I saw it sailed his business."
16336.0,Patient,"That part I know that's the ship that same and PTA was example of where I hoped, I would find friends and certainly it keeps me busy. And so i'd like to think at that time I had friends, but why wouldn't there be overlap friends, I mean I see when you're five and your parents move or whatever Okay, but you know. crossover friends. I don't you know why, why do you have friends for five years are I don't know I know I I see we're ending and time to so where."
214.0,Provider,I think ultimately. If we keep looking in we can't look out. And I don't think it's you just don't. And I just have to.
16336.0,Patient,"find the right group, you know after after five years, so looking for groups if i'm looking for the wrong groups and that's me looking for the wrong groups."
214.0,Provider,"And again. It could be the wrong advice i'm giving what i'm saying, though, is, ultimately, we still have to find a way to enjoy life, even when we're by ourselves and that's a struggle for you as well."
16336.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. It. Will it it wouldn't be bad being by yourself, I been by myself so much is that i'm always by myself. And I always feel very. lonely I mean it's one thing like I am I going to movies myself right good time to me that's not a failure and then someone said, really, you would go by yourself and everyone would know are going to do a show. and have a great time enjoy it it's that that's what it always is."
214.0,Provider,"No that's lie that's a lie, because you said it's the last five years now use the word always."
16336.0,Patient,"Well, for a long time."
214.0,Provider,When I was used us not always. For it's not always. just saying.
16336.0,Patient,This but.
214.0,Provider,i'm not splitting hairs.
16336.0,Patient,"I think you are. For. just keep myself busy what was hiding underneath it, I was divorcing some who is hell. And so, and no one was hanging around then either because he was hell So why did I choose such a person, God knows. anyway."
214.0,Provider,"So, have you been dating again, have you tried to date again."
16336.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah. yeah dating spawn has its joys and rapture.
214.0,Provider,What.
16336.0,Patient,"i'm. Well i'm sure you hear this from many people really do dating sites is that we are that people. really want someone younger they could be any age, they want and that's true for both sexes, this is not a man thing, this is a human thing and so people will put you know, whatever age and then they'll really be eight, so you know. I understand, except that's that's rough I can't I really rather would. You know within my age group, maybe five years younger yeah five years younger five years old that's a good that's a good spread. But it's very common to. Have for someone a lot older to want someone younger and again it's I hear from the female. Articles I read on the fabulous Internet also so I know it goes both sides of that equation."
214.0,Provider,Right so anyway.
16336.0,Patient,alrighty i'll do a meetup.
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so. When are we meeting next."
16336.0,Patient,We don't know.
