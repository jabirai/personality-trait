14411.0,Patient,So basically in 1000 and they want to receive you're not.
740.0,Provider,"there. Yet what what's something that you get worried about we talk to people. You don't know. You ever worry about if they're going to. respond to what you. know. People What else do you want to work on. Well, we can start off with communication and then we'll just move well when. When other issues arise they will just go from there okay. Okay. So first. let's talk about the types of communication, so there are different types of communications, I agree, you have. You have. The communicator who. would be if he could see. You have aggressive and he had started communication, so you have three types of communication okay. So someone that is passive. is basically a person has passed off smoking they're pretty quiet they allow others to kind of take advantage of them, they don't really fit healthy boundaries of people they always have the needs of others over there, they always what they need. They before I contact with Ben and look away does not express one's own needs and wants and less and less confident. And then you have another five will communicate it is that you have an aggressive communicator like through a grip, the communication. Basically, a person ollie express their needs, wants and what they see you, and everything else, there are other people feel are ignored, so they get easily frustrated. they're seeking a lot of overbearing way wouldn't have to compromise use of criticism, humiliation and domination frequently. Frequently answer well for those now listen disrespectful towards other things of that nature, and then we have a third of communication, both both communication is what we all strive to be and so JP and so would aspire to communicate with with a certain of communicators. is more so, these people who listen without interruption clearly states their needs and their wants and their one of the compromise, they stand up for their own right. They have a company in town by the language of good eye contact so out of these three communications that are listed as a crew which one to use which one do you related."
