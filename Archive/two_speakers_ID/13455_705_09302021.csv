705.0,Provider,This will be a one o'clock with Emily Rasmussen.
13455.0,Patient,How are you.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, how are you."
13455.0,Patient,Oh i'm good I just realized my videos off there we go.
705.0,Provider,"Very are. All right, so it's Thursday already."
13455.0,Patient,Is yeah days go by fast sometimes it's a good thing to repentance.
705.0,Provider,"yeah you know, putting into words what you were filling and tuesday's group was beautiful, it was courageous. I wanted to check in to if you had any like post group killings."
13455.0,Patient,"i'm. Post group. I mean never know I don't think so, and I felt super like. what's the word i'm looking for I don't know like comforted by Jesse. That was like. Like oh okay somebody understands, you know. That was nice I don't know that I mean like I think like I normally would feel like embarrassed. But I think I didn't feel that way you know, I was just kind of like. Well, I laid it all out there, you know because I knew I couldn't hold the back, you know. They can normally I would I would have. Totally been locked up everything's fine you know, instead of worried about it, you know, but I was at the point where I was like that's just not going to happen, like I can't talk without you know, like. addressing you know the feeling like I was going to cry you know."
705.0,Provider,"good for you, for filling that it was an interesting situation that you could just be yourself."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah and. yeah I mean i'm even like a little proud because, like i'm i've listened to, like podcasts it's a you know, like there's there's a lot of like strength and vulnerability. Is and i've always like avoided that, and so I feel like oh okay that's what it feels like you know. I didn't tell me."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly an empowering that. Even though this goes against all those years of what you were taught and what you were told that you refuse to be that way anymore and starting even you know. That you're just letting it out as it should be, and a release a healthy release."
13455.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"and vulnerability to me as taking that healthy risk like you want to talk about risk takers it's like you can go jump out of a plane whatever you want to talk about but risk risk takers to me is like sharing how you truly feel and putting out there, those core beliefs."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah yeah like um. it's like like. blunt honesty about like your humaneness. You know. and accepting that. yeah. it's hard, then."
705.0,Provider,"It is it's also, though, is having that level of vulnerability, with people you grow stronger connections you grow more strength within yourself."
13455.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,I mean it just keeps expanding from there.
13455.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm looking forward to that.
705.0,Provider,that's. yeah and the resource to with the podcast is a great way to even explore this a little bit more.
13455.0,Patient,"yeah a. While before I started therapy, you know, I was doing I was that's kind of what I was doing I was doing, like all the self help stuff you know, like the books and the podcasts and all that stuff and. And then I don't know I just kind of realized like I think I need a little bit more, you know. So, but I still listen to them, because I think that gets really great to like have other people's you know perspective, and especially like people that are wise and knowledgeable and you know experienced and. You know, like, I think, like I had like. Like such a small. upbringing, you know, like it was basically just my mom and my brother and myself, you know, and I didn't have like a lot of. Like my mom's family she doesn't even talk to any of them so i've never met aunts uncles cousins for my mom's side and my dad side, I hardly ever spending time with them, you know because they're divorced and. You know, he was. He just kind of like brought us to his house and we took care of ourselves and. Then we go back to my mom's you know what I mean, so I feel like I didn't have like like I didn't even realize it, but now i'm like like I. I see like people that have you know, like big families and big networks and friends, and you know people that they grew up with in their neighborhood and. You know that they went to school with and. Having like like just being able to listen to people talk about whatever is like helps you grow, you know, like just. Just all over, and so I was like okay well I don't I don't have that, so I need to find it. And so that's like kind of probably what all the podcasts and the books and stuff you know we're replacing is like, I have a couple friends, you know, and I have, I have my sisters and. And even my brother, but we're not that close but. I just felt like I needed more you know, like I had read or heard somewhere that like you become you know, like. The people that you're around kind of a thing you know, like. yeah yeah you know, and I was kind of like well. I want a different outcome, you know, so I need to have different influences. To like find them."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is, and I know, sometimes just who you choose to be around who you choose to invite in is even your language can change of how you were saying you're you're you know perception of if it's more positive or more negative."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah plus it like yeah like it. I think kind of like expands your you know, like thinking. um. I don't know it's like I I like it, because it challenges my you know, like my beliefs that were are like aren't even mine, you know, like they're my mom's."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13455.0,Patient,"And I like that, because it's like it's just. I don't know I you know I like it."
705.0,Provider,"it's a part of that too is healing to know that that inner child that wanted to have the right to say what you wanted to say and fill or have the right to not know. You know, and to be okay with that and it's like as an adult you can do that, and you can choose that you know what I don't have to have the answer to it. yeah and, if you want to explore that, just like in group, where people put things out there and never know where it's going to go. And the topic as you could tell already more group members definitely could relate, and even if someone doesn't have that first hand experience. In the event that they do like with a friend or somebody to that they're going to be like oh my gosh I remember in groups when people are talking about, but there are support groups and. Things yeah."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah and I didn't look into the I think it was like a CA the adult children of alcoholics. Yes, that Mary had told me to look into, and so I found their website and. I did I haven't gone as far as like finding group, but I did look up their website and I saved I like bookmarked it, you know."
705.0,Provider,That is fantastic there's also on that same page that probably you're talking about their website. yeah there's literature and material. that's very valid valuable to there's a I think it's called 25 questions or an adult child of an alcoholic.
13455.0,Patient,Oh okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah um if you don't find it, let me know and i'll send you the link. But it's really like don't even have to link. I try to make myself different folders, and so I have this one with a CA in it, and it is it's 25 questions, am I, an adult child. And then the other one is emotional sobriety and it gives more of a CA like talking about their 12 steps and the support. If you like, I can email those to I were talking i'm like can get that off of your email that I sent last time. Sure, well, I am glad that you're following up with that you know Emily and just to like you're talking about expanding you know of our. it's nice to meet people from different cultures and where you know hey we have a difference of of how we were brought up and learning different things in general."
13455.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"So great so i'm gonna pull from what I have your email hasn't changed correct the same one I sent Okay, and you are receiving when I send an email."
13455.0,Patient,I am yeah.
705.0,Provider,"That is good, and so i'll just put a CA i'm not going to write anything in because we're talking right now."
13455.0,Patient,yeah that's fine. Oh no it.
705.0,Provider,"Great so now that you saw to I know the last time I looked a lot of the in person or not, not in the in person meetings aren't happening just yet. Yes, some of the telephone or the online. Any thoughts about taking in a meeting."
13455.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I think my only concern with that is like I already kind of have a lot on my plate, and I don't want to like overbook myself. You know just. As far as time goes. With the I just I just want to make sure that, like i'm available for the kids first you know what I mean."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely on that note to Emily that some of them are just to chat and you can go that's like online and you would add to the chat so maybe late at night, if that matches like your schedule a little better."
13455.0,Patient,yeah okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah by all means, how, how is it going with working and then coming into groove and."
13455.0,Patient,"I mean it's good you know it's. it's not I don't know like it's not like stressful or anything like it being able to work from home I think makes it a lot easier, you know."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
13455.0,Patient,"I think the only thing that's kind of stressful is like my hours are consistent, you know and so like like this week i'm hardly working at all and that the stressful you know, like the last I don't know, three or four weeks i've been you know busier. But ya know I mean it's it's good it's good."
705.0,Provider,"Is there any to pattern of where, at least in those times that is dipping down where even financially you're able to save a little bit at this time, because you never know what's going to happen."
13455.0,Patient,"not really. i've i'm I had a savings account you know and. And so, like the month that like because I like when I do work, you know, even if it's not full time but you know, like if I work, you know 20 to 30 hours a week, actually probably only like 25 with the most. You know, like it's enough to like pay all the bills and you know get everything you know taken care of and maybe save a little bit, but the month that i'm not working, that much I just end up taking out a savings, you know, to pay rent or whatever. So. I don't know I feel like. like that is stressful you know, like not the actual like doing the work, and you know, like keeping everything. Well, I don't know, I guess, sometimes I do feel like I can't keep up with all of it, you know but. And no it's, not that I can't keep up with all this, I don't want to."
705.0,Provider,rephrasing that.
13455.0,Patient,Because let's be honest here there's days like today that I really don't want to do the dishes you know so it's not that like like i'm trying to take responsibility for that'd be like okay Emily no excuses you just don't want to do it okay okay.
705.0,Provider,yourself. permission to just if it's something on your list that doesn't really have to be done.
13455.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I feel like it does have to be done, but i'm just like i'm not going to like pressure myself to like do it at any particular time i'm just going to be like okay when. I have 10 minutes between or no, I have like 20 minutes between like getting off, you know the meeting with you and picking up the kids where I can throw all the clothes in the you know the wash and throw the dishes in the dishwasher and. you're done with it, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah either be done with it, or what would happen if you didn't."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah no I think if I didn't like i'd come home and then be like a little stressed like oh God, I still have those stupid dishes to wash wash them."
705.0,Provider,"And that's that's knowing yourself, whereas, just like okay so with all that knowledge i'm going to do what I know is best for me, which is set aside the 10 minutes and just get it done."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and. I was actually just before this I was listening to a podcast and the woman was talking about pain and like postponing it like. emotional pain, you know and like feeling it and dealing with it at this moment, rather than postponing it and so and i'm like repeat, I listened to, like the same podcast kind of like multiple times if it's something that you know, like resonates with me. Until i've you know i've listened to it again and i'm like you know, like the more I listened to it, like the deeper it sinks in. Right, and so I kind of went like. Like if you postpone it, you know it's just going to just get bigger you know, and so I tried to like. Think about the dishes like that well if I postponed doing them the pile is going to grow, you know and then it's going to feel more difficult to do, and I would rather. not be as difficult thanks i'm going to do it now yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And having that philosophy that matches up with with you, just like what you did improve, as you said, you've been listening to the podcast and. You did what you felt is the best for you, where you just shared it you let it out and it's like you know this is. uncharted territory but you've been moving forward, you know, like to instead of like around it like after so many years of working around the the emotional pain it's nice to just go towards it."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, it is because I feel like I see the benefit of. Like growing. Whereas before I didn't even realize like I was you know, like. Even like becoming smaller you know, like like as a person. Obviously not actually but you know, like in my ability to deal with life, you know it was. becoming more and more. I don't know. manageable I guess."
705.0,Provider,"And I got what you were saying Emily what it does take a toll on self esteem wise and all those things when we just keep working around it and it's like going towards it, even though it can be painful is healing and does help our self esteem. yeah all right."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah they want you know, like I don't know I want to change, you know."
705.0,Provider,"I see it, I hear it, you have displayed it, I mean this is just like the podcast and it's like the action piece if you're not doing the action piece and you're you're doing the action piece."
13455.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And for the your kiddos to see this, and that this is their role modeling. That is like priceless."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah I I sometimes wonder like you know, like Is it too late, because even like I have a teenager and i'm like a ninth grader seventh grader you know and then my little ones. Only in second grade seven you know and so like I often like beat myself up about. Like not you know, like dealing with it sooner, you know what I mean like being that adult child for the majority of their life so far. But then I go okay well beating myself up isn't helping them, so why am I doing that."
705.0,Provider,"Right and your question too about Is it too late, I think, well you're a prime example of it's never too late, and that is where you are today and you're getting the advantages of what it's like. 13 agers and preteens. yeah. I think they're going to be okay probably just watching mom you know and how you have to make these changes it's like that within itself there's no school that they could go to to learn what you're teaching them."
13455.0,Patient,"True. yeah. yeah so anyways i'm trying to like feel as much pain, as I can, on purpose, you know to grow. So, like I think those thoughts and they're painful you know. But. i'm like sitting there and feeling them actually feels productive finally."
705.0,Provider,"And that you're alive, and this, you know it's just like yeah having that pain it's just instead of having to pinch yourself you're just thinking of it. With the journaling to as an outlet I know we talked about like maybe writing some of that down Have you had a chance to journal."
13455.0,Patient,"I did yesterday, and I have kind of like here and there, and I know it's helpful and I just need to like make myself do it, you know I need to find a way of like reminding myself that like I need to do that, like I. i'm trying to like i'm just trying to like incorporate like little things. Like i've been going jogging every morning as well, not every morning I try I tell myself, like, I have to be like flexible with myself and like have some compassion, you know. Like Okay, I know i'm not going to do it on the weekend so i'm not even gonna like try to pretend that that's gonna work it's not. So i'm going to tell myself most weekdays like in the morning after I take the kids to school i'm going to go on a 20 or 30 minute jog. You know, and then come back and start work and do whatever i'm going to do and i've been doing that and that's helpful, but I think my next thing the key side is like trying to incorporate a time of day that I can journal. Like I did it, yes, like, I felt like yesterday I was just like. i've just got to like like get it out, you know. And like. Like I just like you know, like I don't know, like my my brain was just like overwhelmed with all these things I was thinking and and I kind of was like okay i've just got to like write it down and get it out of there, so I can cook dinner, you know. Yes, and so I did, and I feel really good."
705.0,Provider,"that's awesome and that's where you're you're learning more about yourself having the self discoveries and having an outlet of where to store it like. You know, with with group it's really common to have post Billings as we talk about these things we bring them out, you probably going to have lingering thoughts. How long do you want them the last is the other thing is it's like filling the pain is great, and is healthy, but if we go to that other side, though, that we're really sitting and marinating in. In pain. Is that healthy to and that's where it's learning that balance like you were saying is adjusting. hmm just like with the running."
13455.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Not every weekend what i'm going to do something that I feel it's more realistic and i'm going to give myself compassion and flexibility. yeah. and letting it go when you feel like journaling sometimes people only journal when they feel like there's a need. And I think that's healthy too. it's like finding your balance, because your balance is going to be different than mine or anyone elses in the group."
13455.0,Patient,"it's true. yeah. I don't know i'm still trying to like. You know, like, I feel like I have, like all these things that i'm trying to learn, you know, like i'm learning how to be an adult. And a new adult though you know what I mean. Like I like i've been an adult you know I. did some college and I got a job and got married and had kids and got the car loan, and all this, you know, like all the things you know but. I don't know like I, I think, so this is so, this was something that was kind of mind blowing for me and and really made me think about you know, like my life and just life in general for anybody everybody, you know it's. Like the definition of failure is. gosh hold on i'm gonna i'm gonna pull it up real quick because I thought it was like just fantastic it's. Not it, oh no, it is okay, the emission of unexpected outcome. that's the definition of a failure right so like I felt like for so long, like i'm just a failure, you know and like i'm not worthy and blah blah blah. But then I was like somebody said, like well you know, like the definition of failure is just an omission of unexpected outcome, and so I thought about that, and I was like well I didn't really have an expected outcome So how could I expect myself to succeed, you know. Like I didn't have a. Like a specific goal, you know, I was just going to grow up and everything that's going to be fine. Just super big you know just like you're just going to get out of this House, because you know when I was actually I moved out when I was 17 but. You know, like you're just going to get on with your life and everything is going to be okay, you know but thinking about that. Definition it's just the omission of an expected outcome and I kind of go well, of course, you didn't succeed because you didn't even know what success was you know you had no. definition of what it was you know what I mean. Right, and so I go okay So what do I want you know, like. Even in general terms. But, more specifically, you know."
705.0,Provider,"And through as we age to is what we felt. may or may not been our foundation of where we get our belief systems, our values that changes to your expectations of maybe what you felt the world, and what you should or shouldn't do. yeah time to."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah no definitely I think like the whole idea of getting like a nine to five job i've always kind of painted that and now i'm kind of like. For my own mental health i'm going to not do that. You know. i'm it doesn't it doesn't feel good for me, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah it doesn't work for you.
13455.0,Patient,"And I did it, you know, like I. had to get up and get ready and go to the same job every single day, and it was like mind numbingly painful and I just am not willing. To kind of like put myself through that you know and so i've just got to figure out well how do I create my own path that's so much different you know. Then you know my my expect you know my mom was like oh you just go to college and get a good job, you know. And I still think like that's the worst advice anybody could ever give ever. Like ever. But you know to somebody that's you know, like a teenager."
705.0,Provider,yeah and as a teenager you didn't have anything else to base it off of you had limited life experience.
13455.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And if a parents telling you that, then it must be at that age, it must be true, and that you really don't give yourself permission to have this other way of looking at things."
13455.0,Patient,ya know I think like I I just I need that flexibility. That. Regular you know regular job. doesn't doesn't give people you know.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and as you're talking to Emily I just think that it's ways to like you're describing how our value system changes, but so does like our priority list. Is of you know, like a triangle and what's up top you know, like the food groups, they put it so yeah."
13455.0,Patient,yeah yeah I remember taking like I think it was like intro to psychology and I think what was not Freud but what was the other guy mad mad mad look man I can't remember his name. Hello maslow yeah I didn't have like the triangle yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Actually, I think you are absolutely correct is that the one with the ego because all the theory. yeah okay yeah."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah. I remember that for a while I was. Thinking about you know, being a psychology major but I, you know, I think, after a while I think I just I don't know. I took like abnormal psychology well I took like psych one a inside one be you know and all the like the kind of like the general courses that the Community college, you know. and I think it was like by the end of abnormal psychology I was like. i'm just focusing on the bad part of human beings and that doesn't feel productive yet. And I feel like I want to, I want to feel like productive so like where's the positive psychology here come on people."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and thank you, at least, today there was more of a focus on positive psychology and that's where even back then, though, William glasser is my favorite and the whole choice theory and his is more about if we have a choice we can empower do remember him a little bit."
13455.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah I remember them.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and then where we are today that you're absolutely right, as we used to focus on this and that's why the strength base is so important. yeah each day is just making a list of at least three things that you either appreciated about yourself, or you like about yourself. To build again on what we're talking about that positive psychology of how we feel about ourselves."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I know that was helpful and what you said about choices like with. With my daughters, at least, especially like right now my little one is like it just made like getting ready for school so much easier because I literally picked out to outfits. They felt like they had a choice happy about it and it made things go a lot faster, which I was happy about, because i'm terrible at time management, sometimes, especially in the mornings so yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, so you are already securing their safety net within themselves is that trusting within our you know, to pick out our outfit it may seem to us like you know we're just automatic the to her, it means everything. yeah and that you're nurturing that."
13455.0,Patient,"noon yeah sometimes I think I may be a little bit too like. I don't like i'm not good at like being like strict i'm not like a disciplinary and you know and so like I feel like sometimes like I see my kids is like Feral cats. And i'm kind of like Okay, we now, can you please keep it down."
705.0,Provider,I.
13455.0,Patient,"never heard. But. i'm just anyways I just I find that funny I have to laugh at myself sometimes i'm like okay i'm raising Feral cats here at some point, you have to step up and discipline."
705.0,Provider,Are are you that if we're talking strength base as you already know that they probably have those as Feral cats the instincts and what's their normal instinct right and you're just you're trying that piece of it. Could it.
13455.0,Patient,"yeah probably you know, like, I feel like. I think like i'm finally like feeling good about my kids being different. You know what I mean like I think I felt like so stressed for so long, about my kids fitting in and getting the good grades, and you know, like being on time with everything you know, like for school and for you know, emotional and physical you know, like. And they've never they never really have you know they've had different strengths and different weaknesses and. And now i'm like I don't know I guess secure enough to be like you know what like that's that's not their strength, you know, like. it's this it's something else and they're still brilliant. Yes, just not in science, or not in English or not in math or you know because they're all so different, and it makes me really like sad sometimes because, like, I want to be able to like put them into like a different classroom environment that is nurturing to that to like the whole. The whole human the whole you know, like. ass and seeing that you know, like these different strengths are actually a good thing you know, like like people are not the same they're not, and so I really get frustrated with like the public school system because i'm just like. Sorry."
705.0,Provider,you're describing what William glasser outside of La I think it's in malibu he has some schools and it's exactly that there's no grades you you.
13455.0,Patient,Go amazing is that right.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, you go and you explore whatever it is that day but it's all teachable moments."
13455.0,Patient,"I think that's so huge like kids probably do excel in a classroom where there's you know, like whatever expectations are of them, but. I just don't know that it's healthy for their mental you know and sitting down and I don't know i'm just like I wish that like there was like a Montessori you know, like farm. somewhere."
705.0,Provider,"But. The way that you're talking about your parenting style to me matches up a lot of what the school that i'm reading about that glasser has been the founder. yeah having the ability to let your children experience life and only having like. Safety comes first, you have your safety rules, after that, like you were talking about you said, fear of Feral cats, you know. it's not. allowing them through that and you don't have any limitation that you're giving them this in the household so could it be that you're balancing it out, because in school they're getting more of the structure and you don't have to be that person."
13455.0,Patient,yeah that's true that's a good point I didn't think about that yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah man it's like wow what a great mom.
13455.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,yeah you're letting them be who they need to be in you even see the value that each one of them have a different personality different way they approach life.
13455.0,Patient,"yeah. and actually this year, there is the first year they're implementing like this, not no homework. Because I guess over the time they've found that it doesn't help anyways and it's just stressful and i'm so thankful for that, because that was always like a struggle, because they just they were so exhausted mentally that they didn't want to do their homework. Yes, and so i'm kind of like yay we're just going to read a book every night and that's the homework and that's great."
705.0,Provider,"that's such good news I didn't know that. That was being implemented now, but it makes sense."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah it totally does. I like failed my way through school because of homework. Like I probably if I didn't have homework, I would have gotten a lot better grades, because I never did my homework, you know and there's my mom was never really like let's sit down and do your homework with you, and she was just like. Either didn't bring it up or just told me to do it, you know. I don't i'm just happy about that, though, because I feel like. there's just you know, like your mind needs a break like I feel like after I work all day I don't want to like take a hour break and then do some more work. than I would just be exhausted. You know. And I kind of did that, for a while, like when I first started my business I had two different clients and I was like learning all these different stuff and. I was working like seven days a week, not like all day, but every day and I finally got to the point, after like a month, where I was like I just can't even think straight i'm exhausted. I just can't do it, I need to take a break."
705.0,Provider,"All of this to be you brought up earlier about the adult and and you, you know coming into me it's like. Having the self awareness that you are creating how you want to be right now that it doesn't have to be influenced by anybody else, this is truly just. You building upon how I want to go through life what is my priorities what brings me joy and that you're in the X, you know, like the exploring which is exciting."
13455.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"Because otherwise, how do you figure out, you know what you may or may not like. And i'll even take it through the childhood had had not maybe some of the childhood and as traumatic as it may have been, it also has given you that self drive and that independence and that out of the box thinking. That you have today."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah I read, I was reading a long time ago and maybe not that long ago a couple years ago. About this, family and the homeschool on the road. And they literally like teach their kids like as they're traveling like to Europe to Africa, you know and they go and visit. You know, like historical sites and museums and all these things, and they have their kids like you know write paragraphs or whatever. Whatever is age appropriate for the kids and I was like oh my God that sounds so amazing like Could you imagine growing up like traveling the world with your parents and meeting all these different people and cultures, and you know, like learning like almost kind of hands on. That was so cool."
705.0,Provider,"That that. Broader like international experience, though you're even starting it, though at more of a like in the household and by allowing your children to do those things, and by allowing you to do those things. Again, and then, if you choose to expand on that and do some some you know vacationing. yeah and have that opportunity."
13455.0,Patient,yeah that would be nice really nice.
705.0,Provider,or staycation so a lot of people are doing staycation and it's a new experience.
13455.0,Patient,"yeah I know I think it's great i've seen virtual tours of like the loop, and you know, like all these different really amazing places that I would love to go to and i'm like well you know, like that's almost as good or second you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah allows you to go there, and you know, I think that that's that's neat and sometimes just to get out of our like immediate area. yeah helps us like you know to experience a different culture and experience just something outside our norm."
13455.0,Patient,yeah I like that.
705.0,Provider,"What area, do you live in."
13455.0,Patient,"I live in Santa Rosa it's like sonoma county. Its wine country I don't know like so napa county is like right to the east of us, and then we're like close like a little closer to the coast. Okay yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I From what I hear beautiful area I haven't been as far as you're describing but even central, I guess, they call it the central coast, like the ventura thousand oaks."
13455.0,Patient,"Oh okay yeah that's further so I took the kids over the summer to to malibu we took a long What was it, it was like. Thursday to Sunday think and we so we drove we drove down there and it was probably. Oh gosh it was like a six and a half hour drive or seven hour drive something like that to you know to southern California so i'm trying to think like we're planning another little trip to Monterey. And that's only like to ourself. yeah so yeah I know it's pretty it's it's different than like it was when I was growing up there's a lot like it's there's a lot more people it's like a lot more congested and. it's burning every year, you know. Like we're close to lake county in Lake county is one of those places that has. Over the last like I don't know like probably seven years, like they've had like horrendous buyers, like every single you know fall summer kind of thing. And so I don't know i'm kind of i'm ready to move, but I also know that. I don't know, like, I think the kids it's beneficial for them to have you know their family and aunts and uncles and friends and stuff you know so. So it's pretty yeah it's not all that it's cracked up to be and everyone's like oh let's go wine tasting and. there's like so many duis here, and you know, like it's it's sometimes dangerous I can't tell you how many people and even young people, you know that I know or have heard of that if I gotten not only gotten duis but like gotten into car accidents and. Like my my oldest daughter she had a friend that she went to school with, and one of her friends. I think it was her dad died because of a car drunk driving accident, you know and so. it's I know it's like everywhere, but I feel like like in the wine country it's it's a lot worse because everybody like promotes. Drinking you know, like and if it's not the wine country there's breweries everywhere, you know and."
705.0,Provider,Right and they're usually in very rural areas where people are driving there and back under the influence where that's the main event that you're going to be drinking.
13455.0,Patient,"yeah well and I think most of the tourists actually. are probably safer for the most part, not always but you know they I think they plan on like having an uber or if they're fancy they you know higher limousines or whatever you know but um. I don't know I feel like it's maybe it's not not always the locals but it's just it seems like it. seems that people have."
705.0,Provider,"And when you feel that your media, you know we were talking earlier about influence you're. An influence you and if that's like all everybody's doing it, this is what we do and then that chance and the odds are yeah that. that's unfortunate it's like you know so heartbreaking for the family and what they've had to go through and. yeah goes back to driving under the influence."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah exactly or even just drinking in general, you know, like my sister holly she's. Like. 12 years younger than me or something, but when she was in high school a girl that she was friends with was like partying and drinking with some other girlfriends and they had a sleep over and she like. Passed out and expect expect seated like on her own vomit so she died, you know because of alcohol, you know, so it it's just the whole call you know, like if it's not one thing it's another it's like it's like a culture thing here."
705.0,Provider,"yeah wow. yeah and that's where it being so young, too, and inexperienced and what what that happening and the others didn't know to you know because of that to lay on the side and in case they do I mean that's just. In the schools are they educating a little bit more about the effects of alcohol or other drugs."
13455.0,Patient,"So I they do I don't think that I think it's like they have. I don't know it's like. I don't know if it's the middle school or high school, but I know that they do at least like one class like one one day, you know, a couple hour long class about drugs and alcohol, but it's not like. An extensive it's not something that they talked about a lot, you know. I think they do like a. Just a little one day class or something."
705.0,Provider,"Hopefully, without that at least tickets to kiddos you know at home, maybe talking about it, or just to to know. Any change to since two stays group, where you weren't sure with your father to."
13455.0,Patient,"Oh gosh. I have to and he's really lucky, so I he was he's still homeless, he doesn't have anywhere to go. But somebody that he kind of knew from a long time ago, paid for him to get a hotel room for a couple days so we're you know he's. He has a place to go until Friday till tomorrow, I think, and then, after that, we have no idea, you know, and I talked to my brother about it a little bit yesterday yesterday was my brother's birthday and I guess my dad has called them, you know to say happy birthday and. I was like. He didn't call me to tell me know Happy Birthday on my birthday jerk. You know, but i've always known him and he you know, had a better relationship, but I guess they like my brother yelled at him, you know, for doing the same stuff you know."
705.0,Provider,"But it still hurts also to with those things, just like your birthday Emily is that, then when you hear it with the brother it doesn't make it any better that for you, you didn't get that and you long for that and. Coming to the sentence that is this, you know as a father figure can't can you rely on that or not, and if not, how do you get that needs met you know, because you may never from him."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah I know I don't ever expect to, and I think I let go of that a long time ago, you know, like, I talked to my sister is about it, and they have a different mom you know, there might. happen stepsister you know, and I always tell them like you know, like, I was closer to your mom than I was you know our dad or my dad your step dad your dad you know. And then she died, and it was super tragic and. I you know I feel so bad for them, because, and it was because of alcohol to what a surprise. stalker there. holly was like 16 you know when she died and Brittany was 20 gosh I want to say 2324 maybe yeah they were young. They were really young, but no i've known for a long time that I can't really rely on him, you know. Either one of my parents to be totally honest, you know, like, I think I can rely on my mom for a little bit, but not for everything like for emotional support never like I will never call her if i'm having. A moment and I need somebody to talk to she's never been the person I call. Because she's just a wreck. So um, but if you know, like I don't know I walked my keys out of my car actually not anymore, because she's going through dementia, but you know, like she used to be like helpful in certain ways. yeah but my dad definitely like not. So yeah where do I get that like like. father figure, you know. I don't know I think i've like. Under rated the importance of that my whole life, you know, like Oh well, I don't really need them, you know, like I surviving without them, you know, but then I see it in you know, like my last two marriages, they were. You know my first husband was nine years older than me and my second was 12 years older than me and i'm super unhealthy relationships, you know. But at least like I feel like Okay, at least now I know you know, like I recognize it and I have to find maybe somebody else to be that. You know that father figure, not that I need like somebody to rely on because I feel like I need to be more independent, but just like what I like what a man should do and be and. You know. Present and all of that, you know. Because I know i'm like at that point where i'm like. I don't I don't want any men in my life whatsoever. You know, but that's not fair, you know I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"I think, with even your dad is it's healthy just set the limits where. it's to know that he may not have a place to live and you're thinking Well, this is my father and i'm sure people on the outside, have also where. They may be would come from, but for you Emily is having that where this is a father, that has not been reliable and that i'm going to put that healthy boundary that I wish him well. yeah but getting to that space where you can continue with your process and then finding that you know part of your journey. is finding that role model that may be more that masculine side that you are wanting and does that have to be like a physical person there for you, I guess, is what i'm saying."
13455.0,Patient,If we think.
705.0,Provider,Out of the box of who you want to adopt as. that's my male role model.
13455.0,Patient,yeah phil dunphy have you got to watch modern family have you ever seen modern family.

13455.0,Patient,"So funny. it's not J, the father it's it's his daughter claire's husband and he, like he he's so funny he's like this super like upbeat like positive. Like fun happy, you know, like he's like a real estate agent he, like always finds like the good and everything right but he's he has like ADHD I think. Like in the show I don't know about in real life, but you know, like in the show he you know he's that kind of persona and he's so funny. I like watching him. i'm like Why can i've had a dad like that are married, a man like that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's where it's taking just that quality said, even though this will not replace your father. But yes, this is, this is the sense of what I have in building that person and just being like okay. And you know. Just being like you know what i'm going to explore this more. I like to where you're wanting to do all these like improvements and gather from here and find these resources. But you're also balancing it out where the limits similar you having children, you have also things that you're not going to do on the weekends like jogging because you know your schedules pretty packed."
13455.0,Patient,"yeah yeah well and I like to. I don't know like I don't want to hustle you know what I mean like I don't want to be like. Pushing myself, you know, like so hard, and so I just kind of recognize like i've never been somebody who like does like self care kind of things like I just like I can't sit in about I think I told you that, like I just can't do it. it's never going to happen, but. I can Saturday and Sunday mornings just sit on the couch with my kids and be lazy you know and watch movie or whatever. And i'm going to enjoy that and not feel bad about it, you know. and actually look forward to that so that you know, like the the rest of the week, where I do have to work and I have to do all these other things and. blah blah blah, you know, like, I can be like Oh, but I have something to look forward to you know and it's just more balance I think i'm just like recognizing the balance and the importance of balance."

I make it I think i've talked to a lot about like feelings, you know, like I need to like I just want to keep exploring you know, like how to feel my feelings. And let them, you know, like some like figuring out how to do that and that's actually like one of the things I journaled about is like well, what does this like physically feel like in my body, you know, to take some of the power away from it, you know, like and. Try to. So I think i'm like just going to continue kind of working on that. But I don't know I can't think of anything else."
705.0,Provider,"That sounds great just continuing with that because, again we're talking years of not filling the fillings where it's just literally filling the fillings."

If you feel like you relate to somebody."
