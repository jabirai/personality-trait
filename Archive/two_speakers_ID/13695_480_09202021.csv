Is and now i'm worried like about next month's rent because I don't know how like my pay will be a lot better than any of my other jobs that i've been paid so that's good um but I pay leave or something I won't be able to make the room. Like before I would have because I clean and I work two jobs and I had a sitter so that helped until I didn't have a sinner i'm just just sound like my face is breaking out my faces and even break out."
480.0,Provider,"Well Okay, so the best thing to do right now is not."
13695.0,Patient,worrying about a month. From now right.
480.0,Provider,"So. For today all you have to do is take care of your sanity. The job interview and then Wednesday you. can think about the job and then like just take it day by day because there's no use so stressed out about next month, because you don't know what's gonna happen you don't know if he's gonna. Leave you don't know if he. is going to stay you don't know if mom can help you with red. You don't know what's gonna happen with jobs, like there's just way too many variables yeah."
13695.0,Patient,"I know today is just very hard. And then. i've got to call all these daycares to see if they'll take him and then they'll take him and I have to go to the Department of the services and sign these papers, we can start daycare chrissy needs to be in daycare."
480.0,Provider,"which will inevitably help you that, like that's The thing is it's stressful to do all that stuff but, once you get them in daycare then you're going to have a lot more time and energy to deal with other thing."
