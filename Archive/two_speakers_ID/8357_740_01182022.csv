740.0,Provider,Good afternoon.
8357.0,Patient,Let me just close my window to get rid of the square here. that's a little better.
740.0,Provider,how's everything going.
8357.0,Patient,"by hanging in there just. Just you know, dealing with the array of most of the usual suspects, but. Trying to weather the weather the storm and stay positive. yeah just. Just not feeling great the past couple weeks still you know, trying to. reconnect with. The aspects of myself that I felt have been slipping away so i've been working on the spirituality stuff been working on. balance and trying to. Not. give in to the negative processes and let them take over. Some success some. less successful ventures capillary. um so yeah that's kind of where i'm at just feeling a. bit down. it's like I don't want to think about it too much, but I also don't know how to. pull out of it without formulating some kind of more in depth game plan, I guess, because i'm just. You know, struggling to put in the hours in for programming, for example, about struggling to make much progress and that's really, really weighing on me. cuz. yeah cuz I put a lot of mental eggs in that basket. So. Trying to remember that it's just part of the whole thing to struggle all learning something like that. But. just looking for any kind of. break in the clouds still waiting to you know. Just struggling to feel good at any point in the day, you know some just really having a hard time stringing together, I guess. yeah."
740.0,Provider,Your medication are working.
8357.0,Patient,I mean it's I. I don't I don't really know how to quantify that I guess I can fix on but you know.
740.0,Provider,What other than I already doing anything with your provider.
8357.0,Patient,"um it's some. You mean shauntel or like my No, sorry, no. problem let's see."
740.0,Provider,Blue and dominate. Your provider for Brian work.
8357.0,Patient,"Oh for bright heart, I don't be shocked. it's I just don't know if. there. Is an answer. In the medicaid like i'm not sure if. that's the issue like I mean that also gives me energy still have brain fog, but as. I think if I took more I just get really anxious, you know."
740.0,Provider,"No, no, no it's not about the medicine, I usually have to I used to try to keep them in the loop in regards to extended periods of depression, not being able to come out of the phone. You know, establishing coping skills, however they're not working or they're not they're not effective things like that, so please keep me in the loop in regards to. Your disposition, especially when it goes on for. weeks."
8357.0,Patient,"yeah so that's uh. that's where i'm at, and you know I can't seem to. can't seem to. Get myself into social situations that's just getting worse and worse trying, but my friends are. Either away from the area and general past couple years or there are a few that are around i've been having a hard time because one of our friends died week and a half ago, so that's been hard. Obviously. and seems like everybody's isolating and i'm not able to. yeah yeah. And not see I don't seem to be able to. Get myself into situations where i'm social. alone so. Without. My friends, my very few friends doing things it's very. hard. still having a hard time processing my friend's death because it's just just. senseless. and tragic and he just had a kid. And so that's been on my mind, a lot lately. and just trying to. come to terms with that and all of the negative thoughts I have surrounding it, that aren't specifically even about it. And I have a lot of guilt about those because, like bringing up a lot of stuff about dissatisfaction with myself and where i'm at, and I feel like that cheapens the. The weight of this because it shouldn't be about me at all. So there's that. i'm just. You know just more more of. That not knowing what i'm looking forward to not knowing what i'm working towards early. Like I feel like i'm in no man's land where I just keep trying to learn how to program because that's what I told myself that's that that's the escape you know, like, if I can do that I get out I can get out of all of these negative loops something. worthwhile to build on and I don't I won't have to feel like i'm throwing my life away doing manual Labor killing my back and I won't have to. get good at the market and I won't have to you know, like rely 100% on external means to make friends or associates, you know peers. So i've put a lot of eggs in that basket and i'm just so. Bad feel so hopeless about it. So if all that it's hard to just keep doing what i'm supposed to do, every day. I don't know what i'm doing it for you know. Maybe I should just go back to working minimum wage and just. Taking the small victories of the full day's work, even if I don't make very much, even if I don't feel great about it, even if it hurts my back. I don't know i'm starting to get to that point of capitulation where I don't know how. I don't know if it's just a responsible to keep trying. To be to teach myself programming to pursue it at all. anything."
740.0,Provider,That you're passionate about.
8357.0,Patient,"It feels good when I can do it if you all accomplished when I when i'm able to put the pieces together that like it's something I could see myself doing for a career, if I could figure it out, but I can't and with my mental health it's like man. That I don't know I know if I get the job it'll just be more this more Problem Solving more more you know plow through 10 error codes to solve this little piece of the puzzle and. You know that's never ending you're never going to stop troubleshoot and I don't know if I can handle it, you know, even if I could do it, which I can't at this point. And then, I just wish there was some kind of resource that could actually honestly assess me and be like yeah I don't think that you should wreck your mind trying like maybe it's not free like I don't know I feel like everybody else will follow your dreams okay. You know I don't know, maybe it's not my dreams. I don't know what i'm telling myself."
740.0,Provider,Or maybe it is saying you're just talking yourself out of them because you're because you're afraid.
8357.0,Patient,"Maybe I don't know how to make that distinction that I, you know I really don't like everything is such a haze everything so just overwhelming so it's like I don't know how to draw that line, so I feel like it's just like. Just the hail Mary and I don't know if i'm fooling myself. That feels like I am when I can't do basic stuff. And I don't feel like i'm making much progress, and you know spend hours just getting burnt out and i'm not able to get past the you know the the error code and I just can't figure it out and."
740.0,Provider,"I think it's more so. You have to really practice. On. Not obsessing. that's the issue that I see. Which is why the depression has lasted long as long as it has because it sounds like you continue to obsess over it, which makes it worse. which puts you deeper in a hole, which puts you deeper in a slump which makes it harder to come out because i'm obsessing. Right when you're obsessing over something debbie's is constantly on your mind is basically is on your mind sober so to where he has overtaken your emotions, which has basically affected your behaviors which puts you in a in a very stagnant disposition. So. The thing about it is, is that it's okay to say I don't know. and come back to it later. And nobody asked me to be perfect, but yourself. No one is putting that kind of pressure on you, but you."
8357.0,Patient,And i'm not putting the pressure on me to be perfect.
740.0,Provider,Just also on someone in regards to. That perfect in regards to like a person's whatever he wants to programming and you know saying stuff like that.
8357.0,Patient,yeah i'm not shooting for perfectionism i'm shooting for a very bare minimum just anything that I could build on it just made me feel not useless at the end of the day and that's.
740.0,Provider,"What well, maybe he should reach out to someone who can assist do you have a mentor you have a support person, do you have a Co worker who does the same thing that you do. With saving, you need they. Did you can do by yourself."
8357.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Even if it's just one person you ain't even got to have the whole everybody in the company here is the one person.
8357.0,Patient,"I need to get a real job first it isn't you know just just here in their independent contract and stuff so I guess. I guess that becomes priority number one and. yeah I don't know I. don't disagree he's like you're describing overthinking it's like I don't think I ever haven't done. The whole day, every day, for years, like yeah I can. meditate or do breath work and get away from it 15 minutes, an hour at a time, maybe. that's why i'm always worn down always exhausted. Just adrenal fatigue constantly just. Running myself in circles. I don't know. i'm just I don't have the fuel in the tank to keep it going that I always did like there's nothing to look forward to, I have no friends, really. it's just bleak, I have no prospects of immediate the changing that and i'm so overwhelmed and anxious and just full of anxiety thinking about how to approach that when I feel so like I have such so little to contribute. And anything I keep trying to pour myself into I just keep getting destroyed a you know, like it's just keeps racking my self confidence, whether it's the you know. Programming or the market or just. Just just. Just gonna kill I don't know I just can't seem to find solid ground."
740.0,Provider,"And then, and you know, sometimes. We hit those are bottoms in life right we have those moments to where. To where It just seems like it feels like nothing, as long as."
8357.0,Patient,"They keep waiting for the bottom it's been over a year now, or just just that keep thinking it can't get worse and it just keeps getting worse. And I keep just trying to not think about that I just focus on the positive and just keep on doing what I can and it's just not enough and it keeps slipping more. And I keep trying not to focus on it, because it makes me tannic that eventually can avoid it and I panic and it gets worse. hey I don't. not sure. How to break out of this it's probably one of the worst you know cycles it's been and. not really handling it, to be honest. No, not just as. It used to be able to find myself and my ability to feel all of these intense emotions. And whether it and I don't really feel like i'm weathering anymore. It is feel like it's good sketches getting worse and i'm getting less resilience. and I know this negative dialogue. Just makes it harder to break that cycle, but I. don't. Literally don't know it's do at all, like every day it's just like I just keep feeling every day feels futile every day I wake up and I try this i'm not getting anywhere."
740.0,Provider,"What do you, what do you try anything you get up in your trap, what do you track."
8357.0,Patient,"Well, the first thing is just getting out of bed every single day I don't want to get out of bed every single day I make myself get out of bed at six in the morning. make myself drink water make myself. I used to make myself take a shower I can't do that I haven't been able to do that every day anymore, it was not in the mornings. But some you know going out so that's not a great sign trying to fix that. I put in hours, I put in an Eastern our usually three, at least in programming and I just i'm not making progress, you know for two days in a row now literally the progress three three and a half hours each day haven't paid for I can't spend seven hours troubleshooting one thing I could. that's killing me. Every day I. manage my portfolio actively for the first hour or so until it stops being so horribly volley choppy as bailing water out of the lifeboat. You know that I have so little leverage positions that I keep getting stopped out, which is fine. The point of the stops. That you know it's just I everything feels like one step forward two steps back just. You know my only conviction play I nail at 60% and i'm still down on the day just from comments positions and it's just whatever you know the market i'm not spending as much time thinking about it because it's just bad you know and whatever. You know, but it's just another example of something that I spend time in every day that it doesn't. You know, feel very fruitful and productive. You know I. Clean every day, but not enough because I make more of a mess every day weekend I slept a deep clean, you know. fall behind and that. um. I I wish I could say that i'm trying to be social but i'm literally stuck that feels incredibly hopeless, you know I talked to my one friend. not happy. With that aspect at all. Where i'm at. that's definitely the worst."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, we just having one friend."
8357.0,Patient,"yeah I mean you know, like a sure there's other people who would say that i'm their friend, you know, like one of my good friend. What can I do consider a good friend, or you know, like they moved down to La couple years ago. It just sucks you know he twice, he said, come up and visit literally on the day each time he said he come up and visit know clean room for the spare bedroom like you know, we had planned both times, he cancels day of. You know that that kind of stuff just really just weighs on me I just I know it's not a it's a reflection on him how he's all over the place and unreliable X y&z but you know. It sucks to. To clear time now like, I was going to do anything but the mental effort. Just you know just. To not even feel you know, like i'm even worth like a hey plans changed, you know, I have to text him like hey what happened."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
8357.0,Patient,"You know you're supposed to let me know when you left like five hours you're supposed to leave oh yeah I guess that's not happening or whatever you know stuff like that or just. And yeah India not talking to. And to my best friend. You know the the girl just because I can't. it's not healthy, you know I had to stop because it's clear that we're in different places, and it was just not. Good for me. So. yeah we decided to take a break from talking to friends. Just a whole lot of nothing."
740.0,Provider,"So. actually do some homework, did you do it."
8357.0,Patient,Specifically let's see.
740.0,Provider,"write down negative habits and counting each with positive ones, you want to develop and then to create a detailed plan. of how you want to see yourself in the next five years."
8357.0,Patient,"I did work on. Do did a lot of the first part, and I did a little bit of a five year thing but, honestly It made me spiral pretty hard just even. got myself into that place. Years cuz I."
740.0,Provider,don't worry about that.
8357.0,Patient,yeah it's. hard to think about the future.
740.0,Provider,"understand, let me ask you this, Stephen any. Any suicidal ideations."
8357.0,Patient,Any intent to self harm no foul here stand here for sucks. not going anywhere it's. Not. Not a thriving that's all.
740.0,Provider,it's going.
8357.0,Patient,"So not gonna do anything I just don't know what to do in general, how to get out of this this."
740.0,Provider,"This is what i'm going to say. Right, because I do tell tale, and the adderall yeah that helps for the ADHD that's cool however you i'm saying out around don't have for depression."
8357.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Which, which is the, which is why I told chantelle So hopefully she'll be able to meet with you, I don't know if you have a meeting with her. But I would encourage you to get a meeting with her immediately. because all the interventions that i've tried it has been effective, which means you, you really deep into it. Right and and even with positive intervention, you know i'm saying it is is not effective it basically is not working. Right. that's what that's what it appears right, and so is more so, it seems as if. There is nothing. They. The interventions are ineffective, but sometimes when you're in a major depressive episode that has lasted basically I think i've been seeing you for the past three four weeks and you've been in the same slump. That means we need more intervention, which is basically like kind of a higher level i'm not a higher level of care of but. Getting the provider involved. To see if she can also assist and give some advice. Okay. um and that's the thing you know when when it gets to the point to where you know we were we have. we're not doing our ideals like we should you know we're just barely which is barely making it engaging and barely getting by and just feeling like nothing right. Steve i'm not gonna leave you like this. i'm just. So i'm going to do everything I possibly can to assist you and to help you. Sometimes it gets really, really difficult to help yourself when you're this low to the ground. And so you know it's one of those things to where. If. What group, are you in a."
8357.0,Patient,Group.
740.0,Provider,What we'll be doing.
8357.0,Patient,The Monday.
740.0,Provider,Monday right.
8357.0,Patient,I was.
740.0,Provider,He was I. Did you meet with her after.
8357.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"Oh OK. OK so i'll shut up me but i'm. So. is one of the things i'm. I understand what you're going through, because i've been there a few times. literally a few times. So I get in. Trust me understand and I get it, but one of the things I will tell you is this Stephen. Is there he won't be like this, our wines. And now for to see. I know it's tough to believe it. But one thing i'll tell you they won't be like this hallway. The pressure is real being overwhelmed with emotion is so real. However, at the same time i've been there, people walking away folks you want to go to UK go to the i'm saying just feeling alone feeling trapped just feeling low and not able to get out and saying i've been there. But one thing I will tell you is that he won't be like this always evening. The more you wake up in the morning every day. If you can tell yourself another now. You gotta tell you everyone good night this outlines. It is gonna get better. Because the wheel. Is trust me. Mind you, i've said on apartment floors and had no furniture no job no call and no means the pain obo. i've been there. looked around and all the time looking to me when wall. didn't have no baby to sleep on. Nothing. Just me myself and I. know what to call him, but the good Lord. Let me tell you something you know what I told myself, I told myself this same thing it won't be like this alway. didn't have a dime to money. But you know what I thought was happening. I tell myself the same thing i'm telling you right now, but it won't be like this always. Let me tell you something. Because I know that your spiritual and the to magnify. One thing I always say to you is that your higher power is able to bring you to pick you up from the ashes, and to make something beautiful out of you. And so that's why you have to keep telling yourself, you won't be like this that way. i've been nasty and didn't nobody gave me no me. can talk to know provider and I have not there. It was on the me in a good lawyer. But guess what. If he brought me out. he's no respecter person can bring you out to. And that's a real death death death, a real to tell you. Now, when I say the days I easy absolutely that want to know why. Because because man is one of the woman is in a few days and those days are full of trouble, which means from the beginning, we have already been given trouble day. But one thing I would tell you is this. Is that you got this even when you feel like you down. And that you have somebody holding your hand, even when you feel like you can't hold on. You got somebody to guide you even when you feel lost."
8357.0,Patient,"i'm just not i'm. not worried about my soul, but i'm worried about the. extent to which will be able to progress in this body. I don't. Think i'm getting the message. Right now, and I think. My life is reflecting that. And i'm not sure how to get back on track. This this ride on the merry go round. I have the utmost faith that this isn't the end. My faith. In the ability. Of Stephen the ego complex the body that's you know that's the vessel of this soul. he's having a tough time know how to turn that or. I don't want to say and i'm not going to do anything and never going to do anything but I don't. See. The path. Because. The things that I thought were the ladder so far. I thought I was making progress and not. i'm not able to stop the panic. and overthinking is one thing, but just always just did it it's always just either panic or pushing it off and ignoring. The bubbles up."
740.0,Provider,Oh.
8357.0,Patient,"I don't know what i'm supposed to pour my time and my energy into my thoughts and your. obsession I don't want to obsess but I don't. know if I could just stop that I would like, I would choose that. So the trying to turn it on. Things that would be good for me long term productive, but if I just get stuck and it's not really helping me i'm just feeling worse about myself every single day. And I feel like i've dug myself in the hole. So many goals, I mean you know just you know just the program that's. already put my back against the wall and said, this is my This is my stand, this is what i'm going to pour my time and energy and do this is what all all you know where my back down working manual Labor in the short term to. To give myself the time to do this. started so many programs just given up just haven't been able to push through. that's not how you become a program i'm not sure if I can I don't know if i'm wasting my time I need to do something that if I if i'm not able to find something to make progress, of what am I doing. yeah i'm not living just I haven't been for years. And like yeah This is bad, but it's like it's. been bad before, but I always had people to turn to for something to turn do. I remember thinking about a year ago, like this is this is part of the dark night of the soul, this is part of the test like things will be taken away. But don't give up. persevere. And then it won't be like this forever. I can tell you one notable thing i've done since then I couldn't tell you. Any accolade depend on my chest. just been. Brutal. And more has been taken. And I don't blame. i'm not angry about it at least I don't want to be angry about it. I only blame myself and it's not even blame I just need to figure out. What. Just how to how to start moving with the music again. it's clearly. not getting what i'm supposed to get. i'm not picking up what's being put down."
740.0,Provider,For maybe you should look for an alternative. If the programming is weigh you down weighing you down would then look for something else that's less overwhelming.
8357.0,Patient,This is where i'm having trouble because I had this was my plan B. You know and i'm just yeah I guess I just. humbled myself and start lower started the bottom again.
740.0,Provider,"i'm like even like even even if it's something that there's an technology like working for Google even do you know, Google hire. working for you know i'm saying like finding something I heard you say something earlier talking about starting working a job and minimum wage. And it's not the fact of having to go there far down to work in a job, a minimum wage is just basically being able to stay in your field but finding something less stressful."
8357.0,Patient,I don't have.
740.0,Provider,I met you like programming you like computers. They show feel. That that's what you like to do.
8357.0,Patient,"Is no resume. To support the job like that I have, I have no experience."
740.0,Provider,What do you do for a living.
8357.0,Patient,"Right now i'm literally just doing like like independent contracting stuff like very, very sparse stuff right now I. did do a bakery job, but it was so hard on my back. And at that point, I was making so much more trading that I stopped doing that. Now I don't rely on trading for income, I also did more mortuary services, I would. pick up. Just these. bodies and transport them. And that. got very that that dried up a lot as well, too, and I was working with a friend who had a falling out with. And since then i've just been doing odd jobs stuff i've been doing, like door dash stuff just dumb stuff just. Out of the hopes that. The other things that I spend all my time on will start panning out they're not so got a capital. And pivot. have a lot of. My body just keeps hurting more every day, I have a lot of. apprehension about going back to a physical job. It really messed me up in my head and body, because of just the just the intense chronic pain that caused and is that I still suffer with just get no relief stress makes my body so tense, on top of the actual chronic pain and it's just so. feels like you're suffocating from the inside out is constant tension headaches constant back pain constant. Power supposed to go and we people be social be fun. How. Such a. Such a undertaking. I don't know I don't know how to. All of these things any one of these things that past points in my life have stopped me in my tracks. And they're all just the all overwhelmed me every single time I think any of the pianist. pain and just the crippling well me every day, every. Every time i'm not hyper focusing on something else so. So only."
740.0,Provider,So they have an APP called me.
8357.0,Patient,And I know I have a list of 50 different meetings I can't get myself there.
740.0,Provider,that's why.
8357.0,Patient,"I really, really am having a hard time coping with the self hatred of seeing these things we could be lays out it not being able to make it happen and I don't understand and it makes me sick. So I don't blame anybody I know it's me I just don't know how to fix it. i'm so stuck. So stark. You know it's like yeah there's the group's I don't know why my anxiety is so bad that I can't get there, I don't understand."
740.0,Provider,"Why it's difficult to do that when you don't feel happy with yourself and you feel like you don't measure up. So. It can be very difficult, with it. But. Even if. Even if you're not ready to meet anybody right now that's fine."
8357.0,Patient,But.
740.0,Provider,"What I am saying is you do have you do have a friend, you say you still have one friend and maybe maybe you should maybe schedule a time to go out with that friend. You know what what I want you to do is I want you to bond where. I want you to schedule going out with a friend."
8357.0,Patient,"who keep trying. yeah I was. supposed to go. To a. doesn't matter I could get there, so."
740.0,Provider,it's supposed to go where.
8357.0,Patient,"No, I was last Friday I was supposed to go to a vigil for my friend and I. didn't have the address and my friend at work to double shift and he fell asleep and didn't wait, you know wake up until after it started I had so much anxiety about the whole thing, and so, when I didn't hear back from for an hour past this time it started. I started drinking not nothing crazy, you know too much to drive just because I was trying to just be able to relax a little bit just give some. it's such a long week you know and and then I then I he finally called me back and I couldn't get there, and I just have so much guilt and just. But i'll keep trying. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Who else do you have available outside of your one friend, do you have any brothers and sisters. Any because."
8357.0,Patient,"Oh, my sister was out of. My parents they're great, but you know. So much guilt and just there, everything is just to just to try to make them proud and I just I know i'm not yet that's really hard to live with, but it's also what's keeping me, going so."
740.0,Provider,"thought I had to you know there who you are. Is it is it making them proud, based on what you're doing or making them proud. Just. As you are."
8357.0,Patient,"No doubt of a good person, but about doing it, he. can't make anything happen nothing to show for myself. at all. I just I every time I think about my past I just get massive panic attacks is crippling panic attacks. Just flashing back through 15 years of oh you're so smart oh don't worry it'll happen oh you'll just keep at it, you know you're so smart, you can figure it out you've got this just keep trying and I don't. I have not been able to convert that into anything dead whatsoever. I used to have so many friends, I have. Nobody thinks about me anymore, you know. I. For all intensive purposes, I haven't been alive for 10 years. Five, at least. Every holiday is just panic attack. Anything that marks passage of time panic attack. So the reason i'm trying to get out of the market, because just it's all metrics of time. Oh great you made money by that three months till expiration option okay Well now, you have three months, less to do anything with your life you're sitting there, looking at the number on the screen congratulations, you made money usually I don't. Like what am I doing. staring at a screen failing programming staring at a screen failing it market stuff staring at a screen and failing it enjoying myself after all of that. it's nothing there."
740.0,Provider,"I need you to me to five years. The first five he is once we get off here, and you go back. And schedule a meeting which entail tell them that it's an emergency.
