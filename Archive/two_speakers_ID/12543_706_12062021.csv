12543.0,Patient,And so that's one thing is like you know I mean you know things come cross your mind like what you upset yeah she's drink this bottle like. But the thing I think about is like I can't be like my siblings I will never be like no siblings I will not turn into what they are. Because that's what my birth mom does that's what that's what that's what the blood is like I am not like so that's what holds me to not be addicted to.
