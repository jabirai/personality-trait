I honestly feel like i'm taking it for nothing like it's not helping i've taken i've literally I think I have maybe four out of Atlanta because i've been taking it a lot lately and it's not getting rid of those things it fillings and that."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. So you can't just stop it, you have to go down off of it."

I i'm sorry it's been a long time since i've worked in the pharmacy so i'm lost as far as those terms and classifications by sertraline I did try that didn't help. I did try merch has it been at one point. It at that time in my life I don't think it really helped too much, but I also wasn't doing too good, and I was reading up on that and I had seen a lot of people had a lot of success, as far as what things it on the murtaza been with that reason that we would be able to try."
298.0,Provider,"You know what. i'm open to i'm i'm open to ideas, right now, from you, I mean you've got some education there so. So if you'd like to try multitasking. Your. Your survey that you're taking your pH Q nine in your stuff they're off the charts you can't get any higher for that so something's not working for you."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah as far as well as far as like the surveys go with the anxiety like you're you're speaking of the one that says like five to seven days. affiliate of worried, as I feel like something's gonna go wrong, all that yeah that that's what i'm talking about as far as like with this medicine not working, because I. Basically, where i've been. Like I don't feel any improvement as far as anxiety, the meetings are nice it's nice having somebody here to work with, as far as everything goes, but as far as the drug wise it's not really. I don't feel."

12622.0,Patient,"I have no problem getting to sleep like I could literally pass out within 15 minutes, but as far as staying asleep i'm up to three times a night every night and it's actually how it's been for the last i'd say maybe two years, three years."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to give you a murtaza pain 7.5 milligrams i'm going to write the prescription for two of them, but I only want you to take one for the first week at that time.

So i'm going to do I need to give you any refills of the boost prone to tie treat yourself back down."
12622.0,Patient,"How would you recommend the tight ration back down because I know these ones that you have now there, though they're like the bars or or 310 milligrams that you could break off, so I think I might have enough to be able to kind of. taper myself down from that, depending on how you would recommend doing it."
298.0,Provider,"It depends how fast, you want to go if you want to do it every two weeks, if you want to do it every week. The taper is usually cut it in half, and then in two weeks cut it in half again. And then stop. So that you're done in a man."
