At like 16 years old, and it was a surgeon on the West side of Columbus and every three days, he was prescribing 30 percocet 30 percocet every percocet that's what started it. When not too much longer after that maybe a year after that um I had a Max Hillary and I blow fracture and I have to have for steel plates and to both put in the side of my face so i'm happy. With us that's what really got me hooked on the opioids just because, with all that crap going on, they just constantly hand them to you."
418.0,Provider,"They do. yeah that's what, unfortunately."

This Columbus is not like that all."

418.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, it was that your first night it."
12648.0,Patient,"Will straighten up, as happened to get on a bus and fighter beating to go to every night for 90 days. After work or before work and have to go around your schedule was just. But i'm at a point where I even now i'm done doing so good in the treatment i'm on probation my on. See, I would have already been off of it if I my rest of to sin so now in Columbus Ohio day they used to let you off for probation and just put you on a payment plan they no longer do that my last hearing, I went to they do like a yearly hearing in my last one I went to the. Basically, said they wouldn't they don't do payment plans, no more because people are just not paying and are getting laid off probation so now they keep you on. Until you get paid, so I only see my PO because i'm i'm low risk and everything I see her every three months on a video or a call. i'm just it's the pandemic and I actually just got a call the other day that my attorney is now the judge. And she is not handling probation department and she knows my situation and i'm working my ass off and, that being label on probation can hold you back from a lot of things, and she. Basically, said that she's gonna go on to February, she has terminating my probation and we will just make a personal promissory note with the notary there and get it notarized between me and her on payments and she's want to try money."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so it looks like you have accomplished your goal of. Your legal right your legal issues you probation that that's going to be wonderful right."
12648.0,Patient,yeah that's been like a six year struggle.
418.0,Provider,"yeah so that's really good. that's really good. So what else, what else gotcha here."
12648.0,Patient,"Honestly, that was just smelled it just me and being young and wild and crazy and. does everything that's happened, I think a lot that night nicks into his while I was going through all that 13 years old, my dad had a stroke right in front of me crawl down the hallway no I had to pull him down the hallway. And it was really a long a long journey after that just i'm trying to you know go to school at that age basically living in the nursing home, we just. Ever since I turned 13 and that happen, I just it's constant i'm constantly going constantly going I think that's. kind of what that my addiction, when I was a little bit younger and you know just living basically living in the nursing home and see my family go through that and my dad just that huge transition, I just wanted to say hi and block it out, honestly and. Then I went. After all, that and then getting in trouble with the law and everything and then my mother got sick. She went to a hospital she had went into the hospital few years ago couple years ago with double pneumonia and she got diagnosed with severe stage for COPD emphysema. i'm. So that's what that's honestly that was the biggest I opener that made me straight my asset, because. I knew."
418.0,Provider,How much clean time have you ever had at one time.
12648.0,Patient,Was that.
418.0,Provider,How much clean time have you ever been able to put together at one time.

And so, but you have been able to put together a year and a half of street clean time right. yeah that's good that's good so so you know that you can do it. You know that it's possible and you're feeling like the suboxone is making it a little bit easier for you to get where you need to go."
12648.0,Patient,"Yes, it."
418.0,Provider,takes my.
12648.0,Patient,"breath away yeah i'll say it helps with the. Okay, so weird like because the opioids when you take them they they help with your pain, but you know they make it for loop, the same time. boxing just kind of when you take it helps with the pan, just like erases it like I don't even think about it, I flow through my whole day at work and i'm just i'm like damn."
