726.0,Provider,"See you have a good week that's really great. yeah what are you seeing how are you feeling differently, these days, you think. compared to when you started."
13284.0,Patient,"um I think that the most recent thing was how blown away, I was with this thing."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah yeah.
13284.0,Patient,But I was not and just the knowledge that i'm receiving you know when you told me. anxiety isn't just a mental thing because I always thought it was just a mental thing like you know.
726.0,Provider,And then you have.
13284.0,Patient,"These were just control your mind you don't control what you're thinking you know. You told me it's also a physical thing your brain. signals to your body. And then you know how we did this last time, where I was thinking about something negative that happens in my life on a regular basis, because of the fact that i'm a caretaker. or i've been you know, been able to hone in or fight or just like when it comes to life, and I can feel it in my body, you know the signal sending it to my body and then being able to get to that cold place you know and and when you had me put. I could feel the call me it was like a warm sensation but I felt it go from oh yeah the blood pressures of the heart rate is up."
726.0,Provider,To come.
13284.0,Patient,To a cold place.
726.0,Provider,And I thought yeah.
13284.0,Patient,Not this is this is real.
726.0,Provider,You know yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"And so, and I see my mother, I mean she'll come and hang out here with me and i'll see her have like maybe a panic attack every five minutes it's bad she's she's focusing on my baby. And so you know just the fact that I have that tool, now that ability i'm not really sure how i'm going to use it by myself you're not there with. Your fingers."
726.0,Provider,"I could show you something else, actually, then you could do good, and you can do it apple whenever you want that yeah."
13284.0,Patient,"And so, but but I guess it's the knowledge it's learning yet i'm putting the tools to use. Because big deal, if I have all this knowledge and I don't execute any of it, I don't use it all I don't use any of it, you know what I mean, but actually putting it to use i'm feeling the difference, you know feeling the difference. So the knowledge, the US and then feeling healthier, you know feeling more in tune with who I am. You know Cindy Now I understand for the longest time I didn't understand when people would say Oh, she acts like that or she says that because she's not she doesn't really know who she is you know, and I feel like in therapy i'm gonna be more in tune with who I am you know. yeah get to that place where i'm just at peace in my skin, you know a lot of times when I would explain to people, because people would tell me. Well Okay, you have the crisis mode, that is what catapulted you into drug abuse, but why did you stay, you know 17 years later, you were still using and at that point, I was still using because I hated to live in my skin know. I hated who I was I hated what I was made of I hated everything about me so it was just easier to stay loaded than it was to actually live with Diana wake up with her and go to sleep with her. And so I do want to you know I see hope at the end of the tunnel there's like there for me."
726.0,Provider,You know yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"have been a place where I am happy. And content even i'm not happy, all the time, but just. content with who I am. yeah so yeah that's so far that's where i'm at and i'm just like a we've accomplished that and what three months, four months."
726.0,Provider,"But you know you know, at the end of the day, it's kind of like I always say to. them like the person that's here is that at the end of the day, as a therapist we can be the ones to guide somebody but you're the one that's actually doing the work. Like it doesn't like i'm not doing the actual work of working on myself, you are the one that's doing that. And just your the willingness to even go to those places and like like I like when you put your hands on the throat like. You know, you can suggest something to somebody doesn't mean they have to do with it. But your willingness to do it to do it and go through the process of it is really nice because it's it's you you're doing all of the work all the time. You know, so I always say like to the person like giving yourself credit you're the one doing all the work i'm not doing anything but guiding that is it, I am guiding you be you are the one that's actually active in the world."
13284.0,Patient,"Right. And, and you know just trying to prepare my mindset, because my daughter's keep on telling me that me em."
726.0,Provider,em di.
13284.0,Patient,"super hard that it's hard to do so i'm trying to work, it now."
726.0,Provider,You know grab Ahold of.
13284.0,Patient,"everything and anything I can process it put it into play, so that when I do get to that place where we're actually doing end or i'm prepared i'm ready i've got i've got some tools in my belt, you know."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. I even tell people um and I know that, like in a regular everyday world these things were sound really strange to do but. When someone when. But when someone's doing work on childhood like let's say they're they're targeting a specific memory from childhood. I always say to them is there. Like for comfort when you're processing, I always say, do you want to have like a. Like a pillow or like what What was it as a kid that you found comforting, so I would always say like even when we're doing processing and we are doing the mdi. it's like Okay, how can you and the advantage actually of doing this through zoom inside your home, so you can get the things that you have your yourself to us so even before processing if there's like if there's a specific texture color sound smell that really provides a lot of comfort. I would have that with me. In processing So if you know that the smell of out on the 11th or roses, whatever is really comforting for you, and it makes you feel good. I would put that on while you're in the session because it just enhances more of that feeling of processing something that's really tough but, at the end, I know that i'll feel differently about what i'm processing."
13284.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so i've been thinking about i've been thinking a lot about my happy place and trying to build that right. Oh it's already I already picked it because it's so easy but Suffolk beach in Puerto Rico it's called God. And i've been going there ever since I was a little girl, so I mean, I think, like the first time I ever went there, it was my mom my grandparents my cousin's my hands. And we, you know, and so you know me and my sister, so it was the whole family, you know it was it was all day at the beach, it was snorkeling it was and then this particular beach does it have waves they're just like little lapse, you know soft beachy. Like you can hear the waves, but they're just looked a little soft beach ways right. I was focusing on feeling the hot sun because Puerto Rico is very close to the equator so feeling the hot sun on my face i'm feeling the warm water, you know, the last time I went there I googled to see what the temperature was and what the water temperature was."
726.0,Provider,And I.
13284.0,Patient,"Thought I can't even the temperature in the air, was 84 and the water temperature was at three."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
13284.0,Patient,"All right, it was sweet. So we all, just like get our. Our lounge chairs and we put them in the water, and we just sit there you know and soak it all up, and you know we get bored i'll go snorkeling going snorkel by the rocks or whatever by the. By the. God I can't think of the word, but anyways i'll snorkel and then i'll come back you know and then this big huge role of nothing but shops and restaurants. And so wow great somebody will go and order bunch of food and just bring it, we have an instant picnic you know, depending on who I go with will get the best drinks, they have what's called a mojito lab and oh i've got to be so careful I kid little bit. and can even buy one for myself because they're strong. But you know it's just like everything about. That place makes me happy."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
13284.0,Patient,"I present the warm environment that all the people. You know the people everybody that I run into there is from the island and you just get the sweetest people like will tell the people next to us hey we're gonna go buy some food will you watch our stuff. And they'll be like whoa of course darling go right ahead we're going to be right here we're going to keep an eye and you don't have to worry about anything. we're going to guard your stuff you just you just go ahead and have a have a good time go and get food shopping look, you know and it's just like everything about that place makes me happy and so that's gonna be my happy place so now I gotta find. Some sounds of lapping water."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, what are going to be. A song. You cannot I bet you could probably find that something on user. You bore."
13284.0,Patient,"yeah YouTube yeah i'm sure. And something that sounds just like it, because it's a particular sound, you know with that little. yeah versus a big wave that's constantly crashing right. yeah no i'm gonna look for that."
726.0,Provider,that's not Nice.
13284.0,Patient,And then i'll figure out where it's at so that I have access to it.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"we're we're you know, trying to get me back there."
726.0,Provider,You know what wouldn't be good to if i'm. If you took like a little container and got sand from the beach it felt it felt like the one. to your beach that you're talking about. because sometimes that's a tactical like like tangible thing that you could feel. That kind of connects you with their safe for your happy place.
13284.0,Patient,And i'm that kind of learner. You know I learned very easily if things are tangible yeah. Like math I could never get mad could never get algebra I always had a deer an F in math and then one day this guy showed me algebra with chess pieces or checker pieces that are remember. algebra in a minute flat.
726.0,Provider,I was no way. wow.
13284.0,Patient,"that's I learned all of the different yeah yeah. But I got it at least I got at least I knew what they were talking about and as. Long as i'm a hands on, I have to feel it and touch it."
726.0,Provider,"You know, it has to go the distance her day yeah."
13284.0,Patient,Dan sound I go back. In June. So in June up bring a bucket.
726.0,Provider,Just for you in a little minute block.
13284.0,Patient,So get some sand um. What about I have a lot of pictures of that be.
726.0,Provider,"yeah you can you can. include that yeah. Because you know what we'll do is you know when we process a memory or or something like that, from the past. You know it's it's a way that you can use the these tools, you can use it to help you calm down to help you get back to a better feeling place um and so any in any form, that you can enhance that a MIC awesome like. Okay do it yeah."
13284.0,Patient,"Okay yeah because I have so many pictures of that beach and i've noticed that when I even look at those pictures I get happy right away. Like i'm just like oh such a cool day you know, and it will just take me back you know. Remember, to have that."
726.0,Provider,"yeah every Member today and I had some like when you use your safe place, like several times. You know either either it stays like it gets better or you end up getting like you know, like when people get bored with something that like oh i've already done that use that. Then just remember your safe place can be that beach, and it can be anything else to it doesn't just have to be one thing you're safe place can work in a go with that beach because that's, the first thing that's like really like you feel it in your heart that's the best one to use."
13284.0,Patient,"that's so awesome that you should say that because yesterday I was hungry my mom a lot, because it was her 90th birthday right. So, and because she has alzheimer's she will ask me continuously is today my birthday and so that all of a sudden, I would just yes mom happy birthday, and I would hug her all over again, as if we never already went through that right. As I was hugging her and my my chin would be on her she's short. My gym your shoulder you know i'd be stooped over I was thinking of a such a good feeling. My mom song, you know."
726.0,Provider,And I had.
13284.0,Patient,"With those hands, I remember my mom's hugs that's like one of my first memories like I must have been like three. And I remember hugging her and feeling really good you know. Oh, my God. Because we haven't our entire we still hot girl I don't care. How old I get we hug. yeah, and so I like it that you said that that it just doesn't have to be that beach."
726.0,Provider,Good.
13284.0,Patient,A second in place would be my mom's hung's.
726.0,Provider,doll yeah. yeah oh that's so nice.
13284.0,Patient,I have a lot of good happy places.
726.0,Provider,"And you know what to even in processing I know it sounds weird and you can try it out and see how what how you feel about it, but even if you grab the pillow and you hugged it almost like."
13284.0,Patient,For comfort person.
726.0,Provider,yeah I feel like that would help in processing Just to give you like that that's the security blanket like oh.
13284.0,Patient,"Okay, something tangible."
726.0,Provider,it's something tangible yeah.
13284.0,Patient,yeah that's going to take some getting used to.
726.0,Provider,I know it's not safe as a real person yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"i'd have to definitely work on that one. Maybe I could get a pillow that feels like that, because all these people, because I was just as you were talking, I was writing down. Number two moms hud's number three jacobson's number four roxanne's hoods which are my children that have that they're just huggers Okay, they love dog every time they see me. yeah and so, but Jacobs, a little have you served my mom's have you served my daughters, have you said so i'm like you know they feel like this big memory foam pillow. So I would. Like to get a memories on blue."
726.0,Provider,"yeah and the only the only thing that I will say is to use caution with it, remember that when you're processing you're going to be processing memories from childhood, things are going to show up that you didn't even expect. So, so if you're processing something with your mom with with your daughter, or something it could it could trigger more of the painful stuff. If you're thinking about hugging them if you're processing something let's say like I was an adult and I did this, and you know, like we talked about in the past and other sessions about like that guilt feeling. yeah so just just we don't want to read trigger that feeling, but we just want them, you know just be aware of it. i'm not saying this definitely going to happen, but depending on what. Were your processing."
13284.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"Okay, that makes sense that makes sense to me."
726.0,Provider,"yeah So if you think like I always say to people, if you think of your safe place or happy place it can be something real or it can be something you make up as well. So some people yeah. yeah because some people say like I don't have any place that I can think of that I feel safe and like and i'll say you can make one up if you have control over the whole world, you can do whatever you want. Right, what would you make what would it be, and so like like I know, like some people. will say oh i'm under a tree and Jesus is there and they have my my whoever like it can be whatever you want it to be as long as it feels like a real comforting place for you that's, the most important thing about it yeah."
13284.0,Patient,"I hear you I hear you. I think that oh my God as you're talking Cindy i'm just thinking wow how blessed I am high because I remember this trip that I took to Israel. And we ended up going into this church that was like I think it was mary's church, so it was jesus's mom's the church that was dedicated to her. and And I remember that it was around church and you could come in from different doors and we sat we sat down. You know, it was just like any regular church and had benches that went all the way down and the pulpit, and so we sat down and we as as a group, because I think it was like 125 of us it was a big group and as a group we started singing that song. yeah do you notice on. yeah so we started singing that song and, as we were singing other groups of people were coming in and if that's like a universal song because it didn't matter where the people were from they started coming in and singing it with us."
726.0,Provider,And so the.
13284.0,Patient,"First group that came in, right after us were Indians from India. And I thought Oh, I mean I knew that there was Christians in India, but you know to run into them they're right in Israel and then after that came a group of people from the Netherlands everybody was tall and blond okay. And then, after that I think it was a Korean group. But, as I was watching this happened, and then we got up and we left, because we were like let's make room for other people that are coming behind us right but, as I was watching all this, I was thinking wow look at people coming from all over the world to worship Jesus. And I remember just having this. Like I know that I don't even have the word the right word for it, but this euphoria. joy and peace and worldwide love you know that's something that we run into every day. And and just to see people from all over the world coming in and singing that same song that we sing to worship God it was just such an incredible moment, I think I will carry that with me for the rest of my life, you know and so um. I don't even know if we'll have to make a place girl, because I have so many wonderful places like that you know just moments, where it was just it was just blessed just like total joy total um i'm touch joy, you know. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"that's a beautiful memory, though. yeah."
13284.0,Patient,mary's church.
726.0,Provider,"I think you pick the right word for it euphoria, I mean. yeah you know, like when you're praying for something and. You just start praying and it's just like you feel like something's lifting off of your heart like that, like open good feeling that start like sets in."
13284.0,Patient,"yeah I know. I have, I have felt that even even before therapy i've experienced that because I remember. A time when I was I just barely had started to feel the depression set it like it had said in that morning okay and. I had been awake for about maybe half an hour and I felt it like getting stronger and stronger and then like an hour had passed by and I was like whoa I. If I don't make this now, this is going to turn into something i'm going to get sick and so because i've experienced depression, where I start with the as the minute I opened my eyes i'm crying and then I cry all day long until I fall asleep again. And if my first opportunity to fall asleep is at three o'clock in the afternoon or."
726.0,Provider,You know.
13284.0,Patient,"The kids go to school, whatever it was."
726.0,Provider,And then I.
13284.0,Patient,"Just drop again just this deep sleep and then the minute I got it was just tears. I remember one time crying for like 1617 hours straight, it was just. Non stop I was like wow. You didn't have that much liquid and rewrite. yeah and so because i've experienced depression in such a heavy fashion. I knew I knew the precursor this can get really bad really fast, and so I decided to open the word and I started reading Psalms. And I just kept on reading them, and I think I have read like 10 chapters not versus chapters and after that it must have been like the 10th or 11th chapter owns right in there, somewhere, I literally physically felt the depression, who come off. yeah when it must my body. wow because it sits right here that's. And I felt it come off and it's not like, I felt to go like this."
726.0,Provider,Well yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"It lifted. whoa you know and that's the power. that's the power that that living word has you know. I also know that that God helps us and all kinds of different ways, you know."
726.0,Provider,We may.
13284.0,Patient,want to limit the Lord oh. get help through the work on.
726.0,Provider,You know yeah I.
13284.0,Patient,"mean God put so much out there for us, and so I know that that works for me, you know so so I know that what you're talking about right now I know it's real i've experienced it."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13284.0,Patient,Praise God for that one.
726.0,Provider,"I know I don't say that to everybody does not everybody um that I talked to is like so much of a belief. yeah but but I, you know I think it's just. Like how How else do you explain it it's it does it feels like you feel like you're lifting something off of you, when you do that yeah."
13284.0,Patient,"And not everybody, you know and that's why I just oh my gosh I guess that's that's another reason why I recommend you guys so highly it's because. I know people that have gone to therapy and they're like okay I walked in and they're in there they're Christians, they grew up as Christians right and they go care walked into my. counselors office and they had a Buddha and they had you know the Indian God, with the arms and. You know they had a picture representative Allah and then they had this you know, maybe something burning that you know people use. Burning incense and they were like I was so distracted with all these you know idols around me that I couldn't focus on what the lady was saying to me. Oh, you know I really gosh I really appreciate and I had people tell me oh my counselor will never talk to me about anything spiritual and it's like well if they see the door open for it, why not, you know. yeah well that you're okay with that. You know, have us the wisdom to say Okay, maybe with diane I could talk about. Things yeah other. people that are close to that, then maybe not. yeah We appreciate that Cindy I really do."
726.0,Provider,It malia me that. We glad.
13284.0,Patient,it's okay.
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah so it completely okay yeah I think that it's like once once you see that someone has. Like that's a strength for somebody that they have that belief so it's like Why not use it as part of their work.
13284.0,Patient,Right right.
726.0,Provider,it's like.
13284.0,Patient,it's just another tool that's.
726.0,Provider,"yeah like you said, like you said God. God created everything so he created everything else that's out there, good and bad it's like you know it's everybody chooses what tools works for them. And then you just go with them to help them through that. Like there's not, I think that in life there's not just one path there's millions of paths that you can take. And so, whatever your journey is that's your journey and that's that's fine there's nothing wrong with how you how you go in your journey it's just about you know how can we help we now get to the place where you feel your best. yeah yeah."
13284.0,Patient,"It was one little thing that I wanted to talk about with you just to see, we could give me some insight on it."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"You know my my oldest daughter roxanne oh my God she's like. I can't even explain how I love her even yesterday. She said to me man love is so intense and i'm like oh i'm sorry honey she goes no it's not bad thing, but it's just like that's a mother's love oh my God my poor mom you know. And it made me feel bad It made me feel like oh I should be apologizing for being this intense with her, but you know hey."
726.0,Provider,"there's nothing like it, though, because I I I. yeah I swear."
13284.0,Patient,word.
726.0,Provider,"it's like both for kids I thought I knew love, but do I did not know what it was like after having those kids I was like. This is what that is yes, yes."
13284.0,Patient,"And I remember, I remember as a child thinking I love my mom, but I could never love her the way she loves me, you know, end up feeling bad about that feeling about thinking that that's because. I just have been introduced to that love right and you just don't love anybody the way you love your children and so um so she said to me yesterday because I had told her. I told her own me and UK when he made up, and I know you remember that. You know, some my mom said some things about me to my aunt."
726.0,Provider,and her.
13284.0,Patient,"being turned into gossip about me and then I got super angry and one of the things that happened was that me and my cousin that when he stopped talking, you know we just G cut me off, and I cut her off as your mom. I I still feel like I was trying to do the right thing."
726.0,Provider,"You know, I was trying to."
13284.0,Patient,"See boundaries for myself, I felt like my answer my cousins had hurt me and I wasn't going to put up with that anymore, and so I needed some space and some time. to heal from that pain, you know, and then I told her I you know I just we just talked about everything, and one of the things that I said to her was. It brought so much fighting between me and my mom because then me and my mom every time that I saw my mom I brought it up again. Because I knew that she didn't remember what she did, and it really messed with me so oh my gosh I think I did that for like two or three months, so it was a lot of fighting. Until Finally I started noticing that all of that fighting that I was doing was affecting her plus it was a form of abuse, you know abuse. Against that man i've got to stop this, I cannot continue to almost like beat her up with this look what you did look what you said you know look, you know I just had to stop right. yeah, and so I told my cousin that me and my mom were fighting a lot over it my cousin started crying. she's like oh my God I can't believe that damage that we all took in this and we all did this and. i'm so sorry, so it was you know we just had this wonderful time of just apologizing to each other, because then I apologize i'm like you know don't think for one minute. That i'm like taking myself out of it and thinking well this was all done to me know I played a role in it to you know what I mean. Because I needed help with my mom and I was trying to do it all by myself, so that look it I wouldn't have to part with any money right because it's nice having all that money to myself. and so on, but I really didn't need help and so now I have somebody come into the House four or five times a week and just giving me and my sister four hours off every day, you know because i've you know we can't have a whole day off."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"that's too much to put on any caretaker. You know I wouldn't. Do it other people might it's not okay for me. But four hours off of it's just total and just so I didn't even realize how stressed, I was leaving my mother alone in the morning, while she was sleeping it was stressing me out. But now that I have somebody there with her, and I feel the difference of how calm, I am because I know somebody there with her, so I did tell me cousin listen I played a part in it, too, I played a role in it, and I want to apologize for the part that I played. You know, and then we talked about all the good things that came out of that, because one of the things that came out of that crisis was I started there well it wasn't I had already started before. No, no, I started there'll be after that crisis. You know that, like the first things that i'm just like i'm Donald gay."
726.0,Provider,I heard mapper yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"yeah and so you know we talked about all the good things that came out of it, and so we made up and we're both like you know back to our normal selves and. it's so I told my daughter that we had made up and she said to me Oh, of course, you did, because you thrive in chaos and I thought I do. and she's like yes mom you do, and of course right away, I wanted to throw it back at her and say, well, have you had if you are a single mother of five kids you thrive in chaos, too, but I didn't I didn't do that because it's not her fault. But yeah we're five kids right. yeah well I kept that part. I thought to myself if my daughter can tell. Then I thrive in chaos. And my kids can tell that. The three most important relationships in my life are people that are that are bipolar you know, one of them is is someone that has bipolar and schizophrenia, you know, one of them is someone that's bipolar and is married to a. what's the word. One of those one of those men that are very dominating but the big because of their mental condition they kept change."
726.0,Provider,All the dogs like associate.
13284.0,Patient,"nurses, yes, thank you."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"So she's got bipolar plus she's married to somebody that. suffers and rock that sociopath mentality problem right. And so. I don't I you know, obviously, and I have people in my life that are very healthy, you know and we're close, but these are my closest people. And so I think that. There might be some truth to what my daughter says, you know the people closest to me are people that are that need help you know, and then I thrive in that, and I remember you telling me one time that you thought. That it seemed like the reason that I derive there is because it makes me feel really good like even think about how I said Oh, I had a really good week. Why was my week really good, because the people that had that need the most help listened to me and got and are getting somehow or at least they took that first step. And you have all wonderful, but it makes you know, a part of me thinks wow Am I thriving when i'm in a chaotic relationship or in a chaotic, you know. I don't know I guess what I."
726.0,Provider,Have.
13284.0,Patient,"little bits of question or maybe it's just something that i'm going to ask that you pay attention to, to see if I am that kind of a person and then, if I can that kind of a person if that's where I thrive, the best maybe some tools, on how to. be aware of it when i'm going to that place or when i'm entertaining. That relationship and maybe some safe boundaries for me."
726.0,Provider,"yeah but I saw something about that and it's like you know. there's nothing wrong with being able to thrive in chaos, because God knows, we need people that can thrive in chaos in this world right. So the only. You only right, and the only thing is, if you need chaos in order to survive, then that's. And if you don't need it to survive it's just that you're really good at. Managing with it, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, to be honest. I would see that as a strength it's are you you'll find resources and you try to find solutions in the time when, maybe, things are chaotic but yours. If you need chaos to survive that's different like like if it's only a few we're continuing like very unhealthy patterns like people that are in like let's say in the cycle of an abusive relationship. You can you can start like you don't know how to be without the chaos that that's."
13284.0,Patient,devil rental OK.
726.0,Provider,OK that's an example of of. of needing chaos to survive yeah you're not doing.
13284.0,Patient,"That if we got there because when me. And we're not talking we didn't talk for six months, and we were the kind of people that talk to every day, so when we didn't talk for six months, I think the first month was tough on me because I missed her. Because I love her, but after that I was totally okay. yeah first month I was at peace with the fact that we weren't talking. yeah so that shows me right there I don't need chaos to survive. I just probably. Like you said it's probably a strength of mine and I perform well. yeah when or I can thrive, even when situations are chaotic yeah okay. so glad to talk to you about it because I was already looking at it like that's a bad trade and there's something wrong with me."
726.0,Provider,"No, no there's nothing wrong with you. Remember God made you perfect he he was, like all right, I know. Like you know. He put you in this world, he knew what was going to happen, he knew what was going to come, so he created you yourself were part of that plan right he created the Diana that needed to come and be in order to deal with all of life's. life's circumstances right yeah. So, so we have like 10 more minutes, I want to make sure we schedule something. Sure i'm France appointment, would you for our next appointment, I would like to install safe place for you. And then. From and from there, we can go right into processing, I think. Really, I let's see hi we do a safe place and we'll start. Okay yeah we'll start with something small, so this is how I see a data, and we can process something that's not super trigger and we can start with something really small right does have to be anything big and so let's see how you feel and we'll go by that. Okay, because if if it's too overwhelming that's okay we'll. back up we'll go back and we'll we'll reassess it's that. Right, I am flexible we don't have this doesn't have to be. going on."
13284.0,Patient,"yeah. It doesn't have to be a straight line. And I was trying to think to you know my daughters have done emt or but they've done it very young in life, you know. my daughter when she was like 24."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13284.0,Patient,"It started at like 27 you know, and so you know there's something to be said when you're you know pushing 60. yeah you more experience and you know."

13284.0,Patient,I think I think I think I feel good about that.
726.0,Provider,"yeah and let's just we'll have open lines of communication, if it's anything is too much it's completely Okay, we don't have to go forward with anything where you're not comfortable so um yeah we'll we'll just start the next session we're going to install your your happy safe place. Okay, and then and then we'll see what we do during our session, but then by the next session that we do then maybe we can pick something that you feel comfortable during some processing around."
13284.0,Patient,"All right, I don't start thinking about that so that I have a few things ready to go."
726.0,Provider,"yeah and I always say to people, you can pick something that's recently kind of triggering. As long as long as it's semi manageable if it's something you feel completely like distraught about it's not a good thing to process for us because, like very heavy let's just start with something smaller. Okay yeah so i'm Diana, we have Christmas coming up. So yeah So do you want to do two weeks or do you want to do um. Do you want to do two weeks or next week for the next one."
