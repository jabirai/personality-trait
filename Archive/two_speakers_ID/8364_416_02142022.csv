8364.0,Patient,"So nothing, nothing too special this. is his first valentine's day so hang out with him."
416.0,Provider,yeah. So um and you know stress wise how have things.
8364.0,Patient,it's about the same get a little stressed out for work at times but. I think it's just in an anxiety thing or whatever and. it's under control with everything we're doing. Trying this. grip grip the wheel to tide. and take it for what it is.
416.0,Provider,"And, whether in terms of your your chronic pain, what are you doing, other than you know. medical interventions like are you able to manage it like still with stretching and strength, training and stuff like that are you still kind of doing all that or no."
8364.0,Patient,"yeah I hadn't been gone the physical therapy for it anyways for the back and it's going from my foot I haven't been there since pretty much I started work because my schedule was. midnight's i've been on afternoons for a couple weeks so. thought about trying to maybe get back in there and. Otherwise I just do it myself at home. To whatever stretching I can, if it gets too flared up I have like a tinge in it that i'll put on and. Get the muscles relax that way."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8364.0,Patient,"And that is to. And then. I have an eight wave machine, oh no never heard of that. it's like this high powered 10s unit. Some 30 $500 machine."
416.0,Provider,You get like a muscle stimulation thing. yeah gotcha.
8364.0,Patient,"So i'll use that and if I feel like I need to isolate for any reason i'll do that too, but it hasn't been that bad. Because i'm just careful about it. If I wasn't. It could flare out of control, but yesterday, right now, i'm waiting. To have that procedure done. Because the procedure last for about a year. And it's been about that."
416.0,Provider,Every year. yeah okay.
8364.0,Patient,"So last time they. was actually two months they do one or block and see how it goes, then they bring you back in for follow up. to trigger point and then i'm supposed to go and again they do a second blah, then a follow up, then they ablation so I got like. You know it'll be probably three months before. They actually get it then."
416.0,Provider,And then you're typically pretty good for the whole year.
8364.0,Patient,yeah as long as i'm not. overdoing it. yeah but I get some more range of motion.
416.0,Provider,"And how has how have like your. You know sleep, and I know it's hard with any baby how his sleep and all that stuff in Korea."
8364.0,Patient,"that's been pretty good like I like that. Around 730 when he wakes up and then i'll try and go back to sleep. Until around this time, if I can. go about the day."
416.0,Provider,he's still working nights.
8364.0,Patient,"been on afternoons for about three three or four weeks now. Okay, from three to seven so. yeah. I was getting more sleep working the night shift because I would just be out for the whole day but. Just justin like I I feel more tired in the mornings and stuff but by the time it's time to go to work i'm. Fully woken up."
416.0,Provider,So it's important for you to talk about today what's on your mind.
8364.0,Patient,"i'm. Just handling and stuff but you know when I can when it comes up like had. Some training, I was doing at work. And it was kind of broken up, because my trainer got Kobe they pulled me a couple days to do something else instead of train. Then I got coven when I come back to me running the machine by myself. With no trainer and. One of the roles and material was manufactured incorrectly and I caught the mistake. But it caused like 800 cases which is like $10,000 for the beer to be blocked. I thought it. I thought it was something I did and i'm like great third day doing this by myself i'm already screwing up but kind of find out, it really was the material that was made in correctly. But they still went ahead and call me in the office and they called the coaching moment. Instead of. The worst or of the two which would they'd be doing an investigation. So. I talked to them, they made a sound worse than it was so kind of rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, but I was trying to not feel like that. and kind of just corrected them and let them know like it wasn't that bad I really did do a good job of catching it before it got. To the next step in the process so. They didn't really know, whoever was in there, doing it with and. Then they call me for another meeting to go over how trainings been going and I had to let her know that I didn't have my trainer and and I got back, and I was doing it by and she said what what you know she had no idea. And she said well when we schedule, you will make sure you have somebody with you. So you can finish up your training and will they scheduled me this week and i'm by myself again so."
416.0,Provider,"So, can you bring it back to her and say just fyi."
8364.0,Patient,i'll have to whenever they designate time for us to me because I think we're on like different shifts so it's sort of hard to like do that or. Actually. I just say that I probably could shoot her an email. And let her now. But um.
416.0,Provider,"it's probably a good idea, just as a. Cover your book kind of things, since you already been asked about this, you know."
8364.0,Patient,"yeah so do that on. Tomorrow, so I sent her an email and. Just let her know that that's how they ended up scheduling it out again and. i'm pretty comfortable with it, I I do a good job, and I know, most of it, I just don't know all of it, yet so when things come up, I do have to. rely on. My coworkers or what have you because our management doesn't know how to run the machines, they just know how to tell people where to be and what."
416.0,Provider,What they need should be. properly trained this stuff's going to come up again. Right like.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah and the issue that happened wasn't even something that's covered like in training they don't even tell you like Oh, you need to. double check the material it's not really like. I don't know the way you put it on it's not really facing you it's facing away from so you're not really looking at it like that, so. Now I will you know now, I will just to cover my own so but I mean it wasn't something that I was taught to do and when I had the second meeting. My trainer was in there with me and he was at. He was adamant that he thought that it was. wrong that they even call me in the office he. thought it was wrong that they even had me running it by myself and he felt like. I should. have two or three more weeks of training and. He really stepped up and. have my side in the whole thing. which was really cool yeah and. They didn't make it too big, of an issue, but they have to do something I guess you know, because they have to answer to somebody about what happened so. I was in this already wasn't in the mood to hear about. Because I was disappointed in myself that it even happened, while I was supposed to be technically my watch but. The way set up there. there's like another. Another worker like right by me well, my trainer happened to be training on that machine, so he was right there the whole time like So if I ever needed to help her a question I could just kind of ask him. But there was a lot of times, where he was like i'll be there in a minute because i'm learning how to do something real fast and then i'll be there. So I see what they're doing they they set it up to where he's still kind of right there but."
416.0,Provider,That you're not his primary focus.
8364.0,Patient,Right it's kind of a show. You know so.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8364.0,Patient,"it's how it's how they do things, I guess, whether you know it's it's irritating to the. trainers and some of the workers there. I just seemed like i'm going to do what you tell me to do that's fine but."
416.0,Provider,But you didn't. properly trained for it and support it right. Right yeah oh i'm sorry that's frustrating.
8364.0,Patient,yeah so.
416.0,Provider,"But it sounds like so you didn't you know it sounds like your response to it, though it was like really healthy and you didn't freak out you didn't you know."
8364.0,Patient,"Now I did have like I was, I was. A little irritated in like I said and. In the first meeting when they talked about what it happened and stuff they because we're Union they put you in there with a representative from the Union to. kind of represent you and stuff and. Even he told me he's like don't let her take on this side, and this is just what they have to do and it's not nothing. That you need to be worried about or anything like that now say. I think i'm just more frustrated that happen. On my watch I said, but at the same time, like, I told you that those guys are right there. kind of helping out, they were they there was four different people that touch the machine that day, but because I was scheduled on it. They wanted to talk to me about it. So i'm like I don't even know if i'm the one that put that role on the machine, to be honest with you because there was four of us touching the thing. And I guess you know I guess it's me where it was just that's where I got irritated because i'm like I don't even know if I did, that i'm the one that caught it but. hey you know."
416.0,Provider,But it wasn't ultimately you can nobody can say it was really a responsibility.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah nobody knows it I don't I can't because we're running two machines, at the same time and there's one two. there's eight different roles in material that are running at the same time, so when one runs out just put another one on and. we're back and forth fixing issues with the machines, as they come up and that's what I was doing us fishing fix an issue with the other one ran a check on material, as it came through, and then I went to the other one and was going to do the check. and discovered that the labels were upside down and stop the machine and. I didn't know why they were upside down. But they wanted to ask me why sooner and me why that happened young like. I don't know. You know I never seen it before and never seen it do that form when I tried to fix it I discovered that cereal was made incorrectly so. I don't know they said. we'll pay closer attention like. again. I don't even know if I was the one that actually. yeah so."
416.0,Provider,"i'm so sorry, can I interrupt you, for just one second I just. Did I hear I i'll be right back. sorry about that."
8364.0,Patient,Oh no worse.
416.0,Provider,try and make sure i'm not rolling over the top of my bearded dragon who's running around anyway.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah so by the next day, I was pretty much over it, but I mean. It just kind of showed me how things go and it makes me feel like okay guys thanks for your help, but no thanks, because if something happens it's going to follow me anyway so just let it happen, you know. Fellow co workers, we were trying to keep it going, because if the renders get done on time they'll force people to work, the weekend or stay over on the last shift to run out the rest of the run and. You know, we were just helping each other out so that. That wouldn't happen, which they weren't forcing me to work Saturday in case they ran over but. The midnight shift on Saturday. finished it they call me at four in the morning and told me that didn't have to come in at seven they were trying to have me come back when I got off at 11 and come back at seven to finish, but. have worked out, we still got it done but. Just have that always you. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So you. It was like kind of in the moment frustrating. He kind of walked away with some lessons about how you would. Maybe handle things next time you know, in terms of being just being more aware of it, and also the how you want to you know have somebody supporting you a little more. And then. But it doesn't sound like it really carried into like anger at home or anything right."
8364.0,Patient,"No, no, no role. Like I said I was, I was. I even told me. The bpm below which I don't even know what that stands for, but that's her title and. told her I said I think i've just more frustrated with myself that it happened and I didn't catch it sooner. I said honestly I did my check probably 15 minutes early than I should have so I did kind of do good by just catching it earlier than later, because I could have waited a whole nother 15 minutes to do that check. In on time."
416.0,Provider,But it costs them even more money right like.
8364.0,Patient,"Right so but that's not how they do it, they viewed it. That it was worse than it really was but. They said Oh, the packers are the ones that caught it, which are the next on the assembly line once it's labeled it gets packaged and I told her. Well, the packers potter because I called him on the phone and told him that I was coming over there to help them to find out where you know so. She was like Oh, they know that. Like I know you don't know because you weren't there but you're the one that's here because. There were supposed to be the guy that was managing that I think he had to. Go out six though she was covering and I don't know they just. They did what they did."
416.0,Provider,yeah. yeah.
8364.0,Patient,I just see how things go so. it's good to know it was good good learning moment.
416.0,Provider,yeah. well. No and. relationship wise and living with your mom and all of that how's that stuff.
8364.0,Patient,"is going it's going pretty good yeah a little. Little agree to disagree moment like first day because. Her roommate are supposed to move out and move out his rooms now ready supposed to move out the first is this next month, so. Before I came in my girlfriend was paying a certain amount and I figured. Keep it the same. me and her could split it because we still have the same amount of room. And a mom was trying to tell me we're all getting cut a break and it only be this much which was 200 more i'm like that's not cut me a break, at the same room and it's turned more. So. yeah it's not really kidding me a break and oh you're ungrateful oh. This that i'm like i'm not time being grateful, I told you to keep it the same and don't cut us a break we'll just pay the same you know we're paying more so i'm just trying to understand how that's cutting the break and she took it the wrong way. I we both had. Our way of looking at it and. They didn't come together, but we've since put it aside and things have been cordial so."
416.0,Provider,They come to an agreement.
8364.0,Patient,"Well yeah I went ahead and just beta is on 200 but i'm not really worried about it, but at the same time. I just was trying to. have my my point to the issue and. I don't think we really agreed on it at the end of the day, but. You got paid and then. yeah thanks de escalated since then, to try to avoid that situation happening next time."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8364.0,Patient,It was kind of just.
416.0,Provider,So he is still gonna mountain and will that change the cost again.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah it'll be too kind of what you know we we knew was going to be anyway, but. yeah. gotcha and ceramic pain. pain in the format, I did pay less if you want to think of it that way, but. I was thinking ever like we started the same amount of room, why should we even be paying more anyway. me common sense but. I guess, I was. Not thinking about her feelings about it at that time and. She wasn't thinking about mine so. But you know. We got everything."
416.0,Provider,You guys have been doing okay.
8364.0,Patient,"yeah it's been going okay. Was this. One day, at a time."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. You gotta, just as they come up right. So should we get scheduled, are you still happy with once monthly meetings."
8364.0,Patient,"that's still good yeah that's fine. The tongue, it was. Saying that's what my group was too, and I didn't know that and."
416.0,Provider,"Yes, but I have you on for creative."
8364.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't know that so that was good to know because I dealt with some insomnia stuff on Monday and I didn't know what was going on, or why. In missed on Tuesday, because I didn't go to sleep to like almost five morning. And then I got up finally. and reached in my pocket I had my medication in my pocket I forgot to take it, so I didn't fall asleep on time. And thought wow get in trouble, because I missed but. She told me, oh no you're good. Well that's good to know. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay let's get you scheduled for March, then. me find. Your chart."
