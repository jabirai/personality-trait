462.0,Provider,Hello. How are you doing.
11612.0,Patient,"I am Okay, I thought, our meeting was like 30 minutes earlier, so I messed that up. So, quite a few things have actually I just want to change my background for a second hang on. Oh we're. um. I just want to add to. anyways I I ended up and about a month ago. i'm telling this client my main client that I. don't want to see you anymore. Actually. told them how much you disgust me, which was like felt, really, really good I. I was. I was, I told me what she discussed. And I felt really good. I think it was a long time coming."
462.0,Provider,But now.
11612.0,Patient,"It was six years, I actually ended up sending an email to his wife and kids and. And I just like screenshots of all of his deposits to me. And haven't heard back from him I was testing and I was wondering, to see if he was going to. Help us out if he was if he was going to like come back after all, the thing after what I did. Luckily, he hasn't I mean I. I basically just. He. I told him like just all things like just how much you disgust me like it just how like I just couldn't even fathom that. He ever even imagined that I enjoy doing anything with him like even once because we would say these things like. You know it didn't seem like you were enjoying it by Sam and I was just like. Am I really that great of an actress like how did you think I could ever even enjoy one of these things with you like you're 73 for Fuck sake. And i'm just like about to be 40 so it's just all like tutorial too scary like too sad like I got into the game really late, I was like in my 30s already, which is already considered old for the industry and. So. I felt really good to tell them that stuff like I called him I told him, it was like a gargoyle it was like well I don't don't worry you won't you won't hear from me ever again if that's how you see me I was like. I was like how I see you, I was like go look in the mirror and connect some dots like go see herself like. it's amazing to me like the vanity of guys and i'm just so disgusted with men like I just like how could he ever possibly think, and I mean I know that's what half of the money is for is for you know. them to believe that they're desirable but it felt really good to like tell his wife and kids to. cuz he was just I just hate man that they have like they work really hard and then they have. To like you know. take advantage of a girl, and so there's that. So i've been looking for other jobs living with back with my parents my mom doesn't know what i've done. I told her, I was like looking for a server job, and she was like that sounds horrible. Like and i'm just like I wish I could share with her like how she I wish like how much of a step up that would be for me. You know I mean I used to do that she's like you're so much more qualified than that, and she thought for the last six years that I was a writer's assistant, because I told her that and I just had these dark moments, where I want to tell her everything, but I just feel. Like I don't think they could handle it. and My friend has been helping me I joined us like codependent koto group, like SLA a like sex and love addicts anonymous or i'm trying to like get to a meeting every day and. I mean it doesn't happen all the time, like i'm trying to meditate, but I just feel like a failure, I like. I went to a gun store a couple weeks ago and I like looked at guns and I, like you know with self destructive intentions and. I didn't buy anything but I was just like. I told my mom the other night that I was like."
462.0,Provider,When we get in fights I get real dark and i'm like you know I. wanted I.
11612.0,Patient,"Do about shooting myself in the head, every day, and she was like well. If you're going to do that don't do it in the House, because it lowers the value of the House, it was like."
462.0,Provider,So crazy.
11612.0,Patient,"Like she told me she wanted me to find a boyfriend and somebody that I like and I was like the guy that I, the only person I like smokes fentanyl and she was like well do you have any money and, like my mom never does any drug, which is like. The Attorney and a broker and. i'm trying to take it a day at a time I kind of dipped out of the comedy stuff i've cleared out all my social media. used to be."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's a lot of really big steps that you made there, when you say you don't like the person that you used to be, what about yourself. In the past don't you like."
11612.0,Patient,"well. I don't think it was true to myself. I was doing a lot of drugs. But. I was doing like acid and molly and shrooms and X every day. And we all day every day. In months and i'm trying to ask them do they drink alcohol anymore it's just everything's like such a. Everything such an extreme and I just feel like just such a failure because. i'm stuck here with my parents my little sister she's six years younger than me she's got a baby and a husband and she's like you know opening for Jeff garlin and comedy and then my big sister who's like 53 i'm 39. She has a $1 million dollar condo in Marina del rey that my mom just gave to her and all she does all days complained about how hard it is to clean the floors her own for to God. I just feel like I want to disappear. i'm a psycho person like I was even thinking about you coming here today and i'm like jesse's can flake i'm like just he's just trying to she just trying to mess with me like she's she's just trying to see if she can make me crazy like. i'm such a paranoid freak and. I was like notice use this as an excuse to like you know, try to meditate and not react like because, even when I try to meet up with shontelle like you know, half the time she just won't show up or whatever. And this program is like the only thing that I have. Besides, like my friends so."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you had some really big life changes like pretty huge you got out of the industry that you've been working in which is a really tough industry to get out of and has a lot of trauma associated with it. Not only that you emailed his wife and kids, which was a really big move you like you like you said white your social media. got about a comedy and moved back in with your parents, so you had all these big grand things happen, but you also can't be honest about what happened with a lot of the people around you, and that in itself is really, really hard. And, along with that you're feeling kind of lost. And alone you sold your car."
11612.0,Patient,"I had a nice car that this guy bought me and I just paid off my debt, but I still have a lot of student loan debt but. I paid for my credit card debt and then I have like a certain chunk saved, just in case I want to like you know I don't know what an emergency or something like I have a teeny tiny chunk saved. And i'm trying not to touch that you know I don't remember Okay, like every time I bought clothes, in the past, you make me happy. And then i'm like all right, whatever like i'm trying to remember that spending money, just like such a highlight game, just like before I go on here with you i'm like oh man, I just want to. Order this cat Muslim, I just want to order this cat Moses, making sure my calves and i'm just like I just want to hit border on that. On crime i'm so sorry, can you hold on for one second, I have to give this for one second i'm sorry. Sure Hello. yeah yeah. Good i'm actually in the middle of a therapy can can I call you back or am I seeing you at 230 today. Let me call you back okay all right, thank you bye. yeah yeah. that's such a fucking failure, like my dad I just I want to hide from everybody I don't want to respond to anybody like I had a publicist she represents fucking porn stars. She say the stupidest shit to me like I remember, I was jealous of my cousin because she got lady and she's like so cool she seems like songs that make you want to cry like real deep shit. And she was like Oh, she only has like 120,000 followers it's not that much i'm just like wow I can't believe. I mean there's literally just could see anything to be like to call my ego you know I mean it was just like she was there, too, and she does that for porn star, so why wouldn't she do that for me like she was taking my money you know and. I just feel like i've done the stupidest shit my whole life like I joined this cold and they lead myself like go I went for this guy that was twice my age, I had no sexual attraction to. But i'm starting to think of a fucking lesbian, because I just like i'm so disgusted with men. And then there's this guy in New York that like he's a comedy cellar comic and he asked me to marry him and i've never had sex with him i've only slept over with him and I never fucked him because, like he. He like is one of these guys that like goes to the snl after parties with like Elon musk and whatever and I was too scared to get involved with them because historically any guy get involved with it always turns to shit. and I just have like the worst tasting guys like this other guy liked will not one of my axes he has like a baby in Arizona and he's like so in love and she's four years old and i'm like almost 40 and living with my parents, I have no car I am. I just want to hide like I just I can't even pick up a guitar and feel like it just. I just don't know what to do, i'm like looking into john's getting a job as a cashier and. Trying to be healthy, but i'm like Oh, they could go get married to this guy and he, like he likes to roll you know he likes you know have fun. And I could have fun with him. But I don't even think i'd want to have sex with them like i'm not even i've never wanted to like have sex with him and not attracted to him, like that."
462.0,Provider,"sounds like you're just feeling really scared and seeing that as an option of what could help you get through this but rather than thinking about. You know him or a man helping you get through this, especially since you're currently disgusted by then maybe now is the time to step away from all of that, and start to. do some reflection on a bigger broader spectrum about what your purposes and what you think you know your purposes being here on this earth. Maybe you look at it from a spiritual perspective, a professional perspective right in every different angle and try to kind of narrow down a little bit from again that broader down to a more narrow point of what why you're here what your strengths are and how you can use them."
11612.0,Patient,"yeah I wanted to be like famous for so long. Like ever since I was little I wanted to, and then, when it was like. sort of felt like it was almost going to happen, for me, I went and I joined this cult. And then I wanted it again and I got so far as to like turning down to deal with amy winehouse sign, and I know that sounds crazy, but you know. You would want to kill yourself if you turn heel down and then watched her blow up because that was like the very last Development deal that, like the music industry did and everything now is like you have to come in with your own following and. From there I just made such bad decisions and I just like. I admire like quote unquote normal people that are like you know, working on themselves and stuff, but I just feel like. I just feel so small, like I wanted, I just wanted to have something to say something to offer. To the world like I wanted so much to be like."
462.0,Provider,A star.
11612.0,Patient,"But I look back at myself i'm like wow. You are complete psychopath like. I just don't have it in me to be like cardi B, or whatever, like, I tried so long that persona of like. He just needs so many drugs to keep that up you know and the reflection that I have done in my life, makes me vulnerable but it's just like it's just so sad like this, I obsess over this guy i'm looking at his Twitter every day. he's like basically rolled out from under a freeway in compton and all he does all day is like comment on Boxing shit. And he's like a comedian, and this is the guy that wouldn't kill me when we Fuck first like yours, because I was a prostitute and then he we finally kiss the other day, but like he doesn't have. Like I don't know why i'm obsessing over him like I choose like literally garbage. I mean this he's not even cute he's just like funny and crazy and out of his mind like I. I don't know I just um. I just feel really lost like I literally like I love hanging out with my parents at night, like I meet that guy rub their feet I run my dad's here my mom's feet she gives me a bad my bad scratch i'm like awesome."
462.0,Provider,What about that is awesome to you what about your evening with your parents. is great for you.
11612.0,Patient,I like hanging out with them a lot like we have fun. I think they're cool. But the stigma of living at home. can drive me crazy like because there's a workman that's here all the time. And sometimes I wake up and he's like moving in and out of the kitchen 20 times and I just feel like I mean We grew up with this guy like here always working on some shit in the House my mom loves always working on something and it just drives me crazy and.
462.0,Provider,"So what is it about that time together in the evening, that you enjoy."
11612.0,Patient,"I just don't feel so alone, I feel like full i'm so happy that I have like my parents. Data some health issues, which is why I moved, you know, which is why I stopped going to New York and got rid of that place in New York. But now i'm here, and you know I felt like God I gotta get rid of this guy but now i'm here and I like feel a little bit stuck here like it was. Different when I was like staying here, and I still have money coming in, and I was like Okay, I can just get another place anytime I want I had to tell this guy how much he discussed me. And, just like all the ways like just to tell them like how much i'm like you know. To go out and, like a public like he ought like suggested that. He was telling me that there was like a jacuzzi at this place, he wanted to go to like do you really think I want to be like out in public with you at Apollo jacuzzi like how fucking moronic. Are you and just to like tell his wife and kids out like man, if I was like married or child is somebody like those who could just thought they could go live like a double life and get away with it, I would be so disgusted. So. it's just like sometimes I like going out and hanging out with friends like a comedy things, but I just feel old I feel like I started it too late and started at like. I mean i'm like if I keep going maybe by like 60 I might do something, you know, like. I just kind of want to disappear I don't I don't know what to do."
462.0,Provider,With data man.
11612.0,Patient,you're a writer like that's an easy thing to like okay i'll just go and make money as a writer like.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so the time that you are enjoying right now is that evening time with your parents and that's you know from what you described because. you're around people who are just seeing you for who you are rather than as a sex worker or someone trying to be famous or a comedian or this or that versus these. Other people that you're describing who are like Oh, he won't kiss me because i'm this he's wants that right So what if you just me."
11612.0,Patient,"But it took me freaking two years, I mean I thought it would be that girl like always little girls will be like oh isn't QC when we have six wow Thank God that's not me and then I did that. Like it was like in some game, a little I love the change."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so. you're you're seeing by your parents for who you really are and they and and that feels comforting for you, so what have you started to surround yourself with more people like that people that aren't in any type of industry and are just. Either while you're in that one group, which is good that you described, but maybe like a hobby or something where people could just see you for who you are, and you don't have to. lead with that you were a sex worker, you want to be famous you wanted to be a musician or comedian and you just kind of lead with i'm Tara."
11612.0,Patient,"yeah I thought about that. going to ballet classes, something that I enjoy I haven't worked out in like six months, and when I do it really changes. So much, but it's just hard to get that motivation. To do it, and why so I prayed. And meditation I prayed I really don't want to meditate but I know I need to I just keep thinking oh God is so boring. And then i'm like well, maybe God made everything so like, how can God be boring but, like, I was just praying to God like using words, and I was just meditating last night, and I was like you know what they say, sometimes in these like a things I was like you know. Please take away my character defects like please help me to be like somebody that can have like friends, and you know take away like my controlling narcissistic qualities and like help me like. Like give me some excitement about life again me like no. I don't know i'm lucky I got this girl my life that's like talking to me she's talking about, like all the momentum i've had is like my downward spiral, and then it's going to take like a lot of momentum in the other direction, so I try to make a change so. i'm trying to do that, but it just. It just feel like what I was thinking about like I don't know I just. I hate life I just it's so hard, if this is like some game for us to learn some shit and reincarnation is real. This is just awful it's just so bad it never gets better like and I know like, even if I try to go, yes, hopefully, or do something like it's it's going to feel good for like 15 minutes, then i'm really hungry and i'm really disappointed in myself. it's not going to do what I wanted to do like i'm at least. Having new songs these days i'm like. You know i'm not so boring, and my thinking about weed all the time, and I know it's going to take some time but. it's just a really hard period that I feel like i'm in right now. And i've been really nice, you know my big sister because I just feel like, how can you live in a million dollar condo well i'm stuck here living with mom and dad like. It just feels unfair, even though she's like 14 years older than me I just I just feel like a failure, like I haven't been able to like get my life on track and. i'm trying to remember to be grateful. But yeah i'm like almost 40 and i'm just like. I just everything just seems like really so difficult so hard. that's kind of where my."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's the big change happened you got out of the work that we're doing. Now you're feeling lost alone, a little bit disappointed in yourself what do you think is going to be most helpful and allowing you to move forward."
11612.0,Patient,"I think I need to get a part time job and not run by my mom because she doesn't know how awful my life has been. She even offered me like to pay me $20 an hour to create create albums for her. In the past, whenever i've watched from my mom. it's always there's like control issues and screaming and emotional stuff I don't know if it's worth it."
462.0,Provider,"yeah might be good right now for you to just get some independence right, you were relying on that guy before for your income, what about if you just did find like a place where you're independent and you're not relying on a figure over you to pay you like your mom or."
11612.0,Patient,"A man, I was looking at a job at a sushi restaurant that looks pretty cool it's like a half an hour walk from here. I don't really need a car. And I told my mom and she just like shot it down, just like well that sounds awful i'm like Okay, this is why I can never talk to her about stuff."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and she's yeah she's coming from the idea that you were doing something else for the last few years, so maybe it is like you said just time for you to be independent and pick a job and try it and that might give you some. motivation right you'll be up you'll be purposeful you'll be engaging with people that might give you a little bit of motivation. And then that could be just a launching pad it doesn't have to be a permanent job it can be what you're doing for now to start to get a little bit of money get back get your feedback on the ground."
11612.0,Patient,yeah I did make some big steps like I. deleted my profiles on those two who what I like to call her website.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, though."
11612.0,Patient,"cuz I was like I was checking back in and i'm just like you know plug it like see what else is on there, like. And I just kept saying no to like different guys that would message me and just like clown them like it was the most fun, I was having you know just like some guy would messaged me and be like. Something though you're so heartless make love Little did they know what I actually look like now, because these pictures are all like five years old, with me, it was like long platinum blonde hair. And like let's make love and I was just like right back like yikes and that was like the most fun that I could have it's just like just cheating on these guys and stuff."
462.0,Provider,But.
11612.0,Patient,How much time do we have just curious.
462.0,Provider,"We have 15 minutes, so we have like about you know 2022 minutes left okay well um."
11612.0,Patient,"One thing that was really kind of bothering me. So. I hear that, like you know i'm really hard on my big sister. she's my half sister and she's. she's like 53, I guess, I thought she's like just 50 but she's 33 and 39. And she like wanted to tell me, and like make sure that I know. she's like you need to take responsibility, you know for venerated sex work or whatever. i'm just thinking to myself, like. The scrolls in a condo she doesn't pay any rent for the last five years, while I like sold my body do this. And all she wants to like saving me all the time, is how like it's nothing to do with her and it's not her fault it's like all my sisters are out of this House, but i'm the one that stuck i'm middle one, and I feel like i'm in the middle one and i'm left behind, unlike the recording. When i'm like the one that it was mental issues and she was like really wanted me to like look and make sure that I understood that, like. To take responsibility, like, for me, like I need to take responsibility and i'm just like. It makes me crazy that she's just like so high, and mighty about it, and she was like Oh, I would never do anything like that no Of course I wouldn't it's like. You were a stripper number one. You even talked about selling your body recently to this guy recently number two she just comes off as like so high, and mighty while she's like sitting on like a million dollar condo of my parents money. mm hmm and it just makes me crazy because it's like it, she would be like on the sky side when I when I told her you know it's like my sister thought that I would. You know, be able to get more money from you, if I wrote a sweet email, but I just can like to discuss it with you she's like I wouldn't, why did you mentioned me in the email I didn't want it she's like then he's going to think this about me i'm like i'm sorry wait what. Do you really get like. Two shifts with this guy thinks about you like, are you my sister or you want to say, like this is her whole. renter and was like around like."
462.0,Provider,him.
11612.0,Patient,"I don't want him to think this about like you don't even know this fucking guy like who cider you want, and like that, alone, it just made me so disgusted with her. And I used to go visit her in Marina del rey like with my car and you know drive 30 minutes down to go see her, she has a dog she walks them four times a day and basically gets out of doing any like real job because of it. mm hmm and it's just hard not to compare myself I just feel so annoyed with her. And I just told her recently in email, I was just like. i'm because she's kind of into reincarnation and I was just like. Whatever I did in a past life so like happening in my life, like, I hope to God like you're nowhere near me in my next life. Like. She wants to keep telling me all the time, like I take no responsibility for being a sex worker it's like. we're just does that come from, I mean like. I don't know how she thinks like it's her place for she's in any position to say anything about me when she doesn't even pay rent everything's handed to her, she just like a taker and just drives me fucking crazy. And then it's just like my little sister but i'll tell her like oh you're such a movie star you're so successful and she's like she goes you think i'm successful she's like this newborn baby and. And it's just all I just makes me feel so small it's like if she's not successful, with buck buck, and why i'm like living back with my parents like. I don't know I just I just feel. Like I can't I can't jive with my sisters really like she just. turned it when I told her, I went to the gun stores and just start acting really nice but before that she was like I can't do some moms like she's tired she's 53 she's she's mad energy she sickly she's got problems like."
462.0,Provider,"So, right now, your family isn't what's uplifting you and you said you feel really small has there been any points in your life, where you felt confident in yourself, and you know a little bit bigger and a short."
11612.0,Patient,"One on drugs. To sustain that feeling for a little while but no I don't think i've ever really had a good feeling I think my self esteem is always kind of been in the shifter. Like when I was really young I was feeling good about myself, but then I then I was waiting brainwashed when such a young age into this like whole culture. I just feel like I made so many bad decisions like I had three sons like I had two three sons, in the last year and a half for these two guys that just treating me like so shitty so bad. guys that I really liked and i'm like Why did I say yes to that like Why did I do that Why did I think that was going to be okay with that was going to be a good idea i'm just haunted by the the memories of. But of course now they have girlfriends that are not me because I said yes to the stupid shit and also why would they be me, because what I did for money, but like. I just. I want to be somebody that can like find a partner."
462.0,Provider,But I just don't even know if it's in the.
11612.0,Patient,"cards for me because, like the guys who, like me, i'm like literally disgusted by I don't like them, and this one guy in New York they're like him but physically is just not my bag. he's kind of happy he's kind of a big dude it's got like a belly. And that hasn't really been my thing in a guy but his personality, I love I love talking to him we hang out, we have a lot of fun together but. i'm not like I slept over his place, many times and never had sex with him, which is crazy but um but yeah just like my big sister so fucking stupid she's just like her brain is empty and she was like when it. When did you do today, I think we should definitely film a reality show we're definitely going to film a reality show and she's like done nothing she's never even hired a camera man she's like so out of her fucking mind all day sipping on Scotch and whenever I just. All these all these thoughts I just go crazy and I think oh my God I just gonna i'm just gonna take my money and I got to go to Puerto Rico are going to go to Costa Rica is going to serve you life wipe everything off the Internet, and you know change my name. And, just like just try to go disappear somewhere like i'm just such a woman. Of extremes they don't know how like i'm just so mad at people like. comics that I see that are like kind of getting big that just treat me like shit i'm at the comedy store, but would love to have sex with me like wouldn't even text me back about something that they texted me about. And I like open myself up to them and, like cried in front of them and they just like never even respond back to something and it's like I have to see their name in like the netflix is a joke festival that they're performing and i'm just like. I just have like the worst taste in people and not that i've been like the great that great of a person either, but like. I just feel like i'm so deep in the dirt like even like my old publicist she sent me a message, and she was like. Oh, you should have gone to you know because Jeff garlin and my little sister, you know he opens and she opens for him and but then. there's this thing where like he was trying to kick up one of these female comics out of the comedy store and I was standing up for her, and I was like don't send it to Jeff."
462.0,Provider,garlin he's like one of the biggest producers or whatever.
11612.0,Patient,"I was like I don't give a Fuck like Fuck him up that fucking hippopotamus pig and I like I told him, you know, he was like if you're going to use like staring down i'm like. i'm like not a chance."
462.0,Provider,Like and he was like.
11612.0,Patient,"don't approach me anytime you see me at the comedy store I just wrote back like NP like I don't get to fox like and. But, but what I knew at the time was that, like this other girl that was opening for him, like he let her stay in his house and see this guy that other opens for him to because he, like wants to hear them having sex and. let's open the door on her when she came to her Bikini to lay clean his pool and, like all the shit that I told him I was like you know, be careful with this. And Mike my publicist at the time you're like Oh, you want to go to page six with this information, and I was like no. And then, it just came out that like Jeff garlin like is getting all this heat from like being inappropriate onset of the goldbergs and my publicist sent me the the article yesterday my old publicist she was like we should have gone to page six and i'm just like. I hate everything about that life of mine like I hate all those people that like I just asked you like I just unfollow them like people that I paid $20 to come to my show and perform comedy. Then everyone like. wanted to follow me. I just. Just people who like just you know. want to take all my time, but like just take advantage of me and."
462.0,Provider,"I just. i'm so you've been in it for very, very long time. and in doing so you've you know lost almost your connection to yourself and your identity, so that can be just the biggest piece to try to bring it back to again your identity finding it and building it, you can create. Like you said you want to move to coach Rico wipe everything started in life, well, you can start a new life, right now, you don't have to wipe everything, but you can wipe what you want, and add what you want, starting now so. Bringing it back just over and over what's your identity, what do you want what's your identity, what do you want, who are you who do you want to be. You don't want to be that it's obvious all the things you don't want to be shared today so great don't do that. anymore and start to be around people like you said, the comfort you're getting right now is being around your parents. And the evening just relaxing and being you know, a family enjoying people who are seeing you as Tara rather than all these other things so. Trying to be around people like that more often trying to get a part time job it's a good start to just feel independence get your feedback on the ground and then what else again looking at the broader perspective of who you are what you want. And where you want to go from here."
11612.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. I don't know what to do, I just feel very alone my heart building like pre empty like a. I just i'm literally in the room, where I was born and raised the bathtub over there, what I was baked in as a baby like back in that same room and my friends like you need to be grateful, like it's a gift from God that you have your parents, right now, and they can support you. And I know that's true, but it is really hard. To not feel like a Fuck up just even by American standards, the stigma of just being back with my parents."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it is, it is really hard and what you did was really hard of leaving the work that you had been doing and being honest and sending email, and you know saying how you felt that was really hard."
11612.0,Patient,So what do I do I do from here.
462.0,Provider,"first thing again maybe find a job part time job and get that going and then. Maybe joining the ballet class and meeting some people that you can just introduce yourself as Tara and that's it and not talking about. Your previous sex work any type of wanting to be famous and just trying to learn about people and let them learn about you and your personality, rather than things yeah. And just start their day by day, a little bit of work at getting a job, a little bit of some type of a hobby or connecting with people that aren't in any type of way looking at you for past things just today who you are and then maybe some journaling on your values and what you want. To do what your greater purposes, like I said what you think some of your strengths are that just isn't related to. Anything material, but just who you are, as a person. Do you can you think of any goals or other things that would help you move forward right now in this kind of your this kind of stuck point you made big jump forward did the really hard things and now it's like oh wow this is, this is a lot."
11612.0,Patient,yeah I mean I guess my resume up for.
462.0,Provider,A good one.
11612.0,Patient,"I was working on one for a cashier applied to be a cashier at a gas station, just like hoping I get like abroad and held at gunpoint a little bit like, why is this job opening up it's a 76 station in beverly hills i'm like. My moms like oh that's just so beneath you a cashier she was like no idea. But I feel like I need one of those like Zen type of jobs, I feel like you know those jobs, so you would read about like some yoga master having like a cashier at a gas station or some shit. I applied for a job as a cashier takeout person is Chinese restaurant like I don't even really want to be a server i'm going to server i've been a bartender and. I kind of just want to try, being a cashier I feel like I really like it."
462.0,Provider,I feel like it might be fun.
11612.0,Patient,I like the idea of being a cashier a little bit. Being a servers like you got to create a whole experience for.
462.0,Provider,it's true and so maybe you go away from that I see and try out towards the cashier thing where you're not again almost having to kind of put on a show like servers have to put on a show and. cashiers really don't so it might be better to go for something that's just a little bit more real and connected.
11612.0,Patient,"I feel like that would be good to. could also try to make up a resume for being. An administrative assistant, or something like that, but I. need like it might be a little bit boring like I don't know how how much it is me, but then I was reading about this girl last night, like got out of sex work and ended up getting into the world of writing, and she created her own. editing business and. stuff and. I am a really good proofreader so maybe I could look into jobs for proofreading and editing I think."
462.0,Provider,Why not.
11612.0,Patient,"But yeah I am I, my whole I don't really want to spend any money at all. And i'm at a point in my life, where I feel like I really should just be like saving as much as I can I don't have like any retirement or anything like that, like I. I feel like I should just be saving and just my time of like spending money and having fun it's like that should not be happening anymore."
462.0,Provider,yeah so you focus on saving now.
11612.0,Patient,"So yeah I will try the journaling my journal used to be like Ohio and throw all of my old one out because they're all like I look back at them and they're, just like the same shit over over X, I was just like getting high all the time, maybe. longer than I. The longer that I don't give that stuff I think. The more diversity i'll have my thoughts and like when I read."
462.0,Provider,Her definitely.
11612.0,Patient,"I don't know why people think I should be a writer, but a lot of you should write a book like. I just think about all the people all the broke New York Times bestsellers you have no money now it's like why but."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well, maybe, for now, you do right, but again don't try to make a show out of it just try to do it authentically from you. focus on just authenticity and connecting to yourself, your identity your purpose, because there's been a big disconnect in all of everything that's led up to this moment right with the drugs with the sex work. event with. Some of the comedy and the music that you've described the industry so. I know it's really tough right now, but maybe you just try to keep kind of shifting your perspective to like Well, I can start fresh like it it's it's never too late for anyone right so just try to. Keep reframing the difficult thoughts to like okay what's the one step, I can take right, you can control trying to get a job, you can control thinking about your purpose. You can control editing your resume all those other things are sort of out of your control so that could be a good point of focus. Okay. And yeah."
11612.0,Patient,Good sorry.
462.0,Provider,"I was just gonna say and, obviously, you said you went to the gun store so you've been having suicidal ideation has that been regular."
