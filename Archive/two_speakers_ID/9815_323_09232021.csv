This one I had to actually carry these big old boxes over to my station and then I will scan every single item and put them in this tote. So when I feel the whole todo to a certain line I push it over to enter the conveyor belt. So as i'm pushing it like this, my whole hand like my wrist what like this without pushing it. yeah so I went to leaves and it was her and after that I waited two weeks to even say anything or whatever, but it just can't be more painful so eventually I went to the doctors, whatever and they checked it out, and I was on I was working from home at that point. Because I couldn't do anything."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9815.0,Patient,"So they had me working from home for a bit like a month and a half or something like that, until my received, but I have like a little. I didn't ever actually have like a full blown cast, and I just have to keep it wrapped and keep like something code on it and stuff like that, but. It was okay after that and I started doing other stuff and now i'm working at Amazon and pushing them boxes on to like into the bins where they go and stuff. Like That is my racist and bother me now so now it's like it's swollen. hmm and eventually like I had to like get like wrap it up for a couple days and now i'm starting to like you know, try to. massage it out. yeah and all that and it's kind of it's still the same like if i'm just relaxing it's fine, but once I like do some like straining I think I just strained did a whole lot more."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
9815.0,Patient,I didn't ever like completely healed after the first incident so. wow just dealing with that.
323.0,Provider,"yeah that's not good, especially given the work you're trying to do, known to. When you're not working, you really need to rest it."
9815.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,You can wear at work.
9815.0,Patient,yeah they actually gave me one but it's so cheap it literally actually broke the next day. So I actually have to go out to like a walmart or something like that to actually get an another one like another study one that's. better than that because that one. It literally less than a day phyllis I was so mad like.
323.0,Provider,yeah that's not good.
9815.0,Patient,"No, no."
323.0,Provider,"um, how is the job."
9815.0,Patient,it's all right actually like I actually like it um I they are turning me into doing different stuff so I can actually be able to move up. Good so. i'm waiting on that.
323.0,Provider,"Okay well that's that's good at least you know there's something you're working towards. Are you still trying to do, school to."
9815.0,Patient,"know. As toss up took a pause on that for a moment, until I get everything else together. Okay, just for the moment, like I don't want to I know now i'm not gonna actually graduate when I want to, but at least is still there and i'm all and I know that i'm almost done. Right so i'm not going to just stop for a very long time it's just I just need like a small break."
323.0,Provider,You know.
9815.0,Patient,"I just know that I can I know that the longer I put it off the longer I am want to put it off. And more is just going to be years later, and I don't want to do that. So i'm doing myself like a time limit to get back to it because i'm still in road and all that so maybe after I think I have no classes, after this semester and or this classes and so when break comes back is, I will just go ahead and just jump back in."
323.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I mean, I think you probably needed a little break anyway, you had been going at everything so hard. But I hear what you're saying and would want you to like totally throw everything way you work to get where you're at."
9815.0,Patient,"Definitely like I said, the first year was easy this year is definitely is harder, because it just more things just happened so."
323.0,Provider,All right.
9815.0,Patient,"it's just more difficult, but you know get it done."
323.0,Provider,"pretty good you got to get that degree, because once you have that degree, nobody can take it away. Oh."
9815.0,Patient,exactly as well i'm thinking.
323.0,Provider,Are you still working like crazy hours and everything.
9815.0,Patient,No my hours are still the same seven to 530.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, and that fall manageable."
9815.0,Patient,For the most part. I like get an offer early.
323.0,Provider,Your evenings.
9815.0,Patient,"So yeah, but I feel like as soon as I get home and relax is time for me to go to because I haven't worked at seven in the morning, so. I kind of that's just probably like the worst part about it, but on my off days and have three days off that last Saturday that I work. I didn't know when I get off. Is a bit strange free time for three days yeah. yeah that feels pretty good oh yeah."
323.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah those 10 you know 1012 hour days are hard, but if you get consecutive days off together that makes it worth it."
9815.0,Patient,yeah does unless we start hitting the wall until peak season happens. When I start working Mondays.
323.0,Provider,wow.
9815.0,Patient,"So i'll be my I work Wednesday through Saturday and then we'll be off Sunday and then work Monday and then work off Tuesday and then work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday and."
323.0,Provider,"split, we can you know it's like not. Not two days."
9815.0,Patient,"Exactly and i've done it multiple times already, they already had his work on Mondays like three three days like in a row actually. With the Mondays. So hardy know how that goes already i'm already knowing one speak season hit that's exactly where we're going to be doing working overtime and that's my overtime day I can't swish it."
323.0,Provider,"Right well, but I guess you'll you like it when the paycheck comes."
9815.0,Patient,"yeah I guess it's sorry it's. not bad. it's not bad it's a little worth it, but there's been people that i've talked to That said, there was just like oh i'm quitting because. That over time day I didn't sign up to work over time and aws i'm just looking at them like, but as a. You should know that just because I job says that it's never gone to be over time they didn't say it's never it's just going to be less likely that they do have time, but just be aware that this is why they give you an overtime day, just in case. Right so but they knew that when before they even started to job so it was just like I don't understand why. They just feel like. Fries yeah but they actually end up quitting I never actually seen a guy after that. it's just like that's me he was he was young, so I kind of expected that from people that slight young like that, though."
323.0,Provider,"yeah. So, but peak season. by October, or something like."
9815.0,Patient,"yeah is. yo from October, all the way up to like February, I believe."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
9815.0,Patient,"late January after Christmas, and you know you got all the special holidays, after that, so do new years and after that you'll probably be all right for a minute until the first of February or something like that late January."
323.0,Provider,"Well, I would think if you can survive all them and you're ready for promotion."
9815.0,Patient,"yeah. They say you didn't have to actually be there. longer than like you know it on something you know some jobs have it to where you actually have to work there for like a whole year. There are certain things that you've actually doing their day don't. require you actually work in there for a certain amount of time, so that's the good part about it, I guess."
323.0,Provider,"That is that is good. I mean, I would think I mean what I hear, at least in my area is that there's the warehouses there's such a turnover that those who could survive it for a while, get promoted pretty quickly."
9815.0,Patient,"Because, then you know around. But sometimes it's really not worth it, because you really don't see no progress being made, especially working in the warehouse like you, you see a lot of things, especially where i'm at like it's supposed to be. Everybody working together to like when like my job is to put away the boxes, so you get frustrated because you can go down and I always there's a lot of them to go down but. majority of them like There we have so much boxes that needs to be in these hours that when you actually go into them all, every being may think that every band is completely full. But it's only because people don't actually put in the boxes, the right way they like have like there, there could be a lot of space mate. If everybody do it right so it's just like everybody's really not working together, and then you have the people that actually goes and see those boxes. And they have to go into this big old pile of mess, or they have like say they have some small and they have like big boxes on top, and they don't know they gotta pull everything out it's just too much for everybody."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
9815.0,Patient,And it's kind of it can get frustrating at times. Especially if we have a lot of people working there all at once.
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9815.0,Patient,And we're all doing different things like it yeah it's hard to.
323.0,Provider,Get in each other's way.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah because I mean we're drive we're all driving around so with us, we can only put away like three boxes and then move on to the next house. them like if they there can be some people that really all they need to do is turn around they don't need nothing in the House, whoever but they'll rush you. When you're trying to put things away or find something just to circle back around to another one so it's just like they just they did to my sometimes. It can get really annoying. So a lot of people really don't stay."
323.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad you're hanging in there, I haven't trusted you enough to think you want to quit."
9815.0,Patient,Oh no. Maybe they have my time regardless. If I have to if I want to put my box in this band i'm going to take everything out and i'm going to rearrange everything in it so everything can actually fit the way it's supposed to be.
323.0,Provider,You know.
9815.0,Patient,"Like I just I don't know that's just my first store I just I can't put a big thing on small boxes, when I know it can fit a whole nother way. And i'm going to be able to put more boxes into it, at the same time."
323.0,Provider,"What you do. cuz you're meticulous about weight, you know how it needs to be done and you'll do it."
9815.0,Patient,yeah exactly. that's my only problem.
323.0,Provider,Oh man how a group going.
9815.0,Patient,"um I went Tuesday saw Am I just started going every other week so. Last week I didn't go. But I did I actually go into a just double check to make sure that if it started or not, that was aware. So once she said that I didn't have to actually be in that session and wait till this Tuesday, then you know I left, but this Tuesday it went okay. It wasn't bad I kind of was a little late, I was 15 minutes late. coming into a group because one like I just overslept up first. And then me trying to actually get into the group it so it's a longer than expected so."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, is your attendance is going on."
9815.0,Patient,"yeah it was all right, I didn't know, there was actually gone to allow me in or not because I thought it was. Right be like five minutes late. But no more than that. But you know they they let me and I guess they literally just she. got to sell just got done with the with the MIC check."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so that so you're still there for all the conversation."
9815.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,So that's good.
9815.0,Patient,I was the last person just came in and she asked me about the meds and all that and no I don't take anything anyway.
323.0,Provider,So yeah. OK okay.
9815.0,Patient,Okay man just in time.
323.0,Provider,"Well that's good. I mean, I do your report, so I look and see the attendance and all that so everything's going according to plan. And Have you had an appointment with Dr so recently."
9815.0,Patient,"I had yeah um last Wednesday actually because the Wednesday before that I could have sworn I had one with you, but they said that I had one with Dr so but. It does confuse me because, after this one is you said bless our conversation that mean you had it was that Wednesday, but when they call me back and scheduled me it was for Dr sale, but I thought, our thing our session was at. 9pm. yeah and they said that I had one with Dr sale, that same day at 10:15am."
323.0,Provider,So I did have you on the schedule and then I read that it was listed as cancelled.
9815.0,Patient,"And I think what they did is they canceled the individual sessions, so that you can see, Dr so. Well, I data and tell me that."
323.0,Provider,Though right.
9815.0,Patient,"So I was confused I didn't know which one I actually had. Right and I ended up having to miss it anyway because. Oh no I thought it was actually at 1015 but I didn't actually take my break at 1015 I ended up taking my break late, so I was already late to the session anyway. yeah The session was actually already already and take it until 1030. yeah don't worry sometime well, I know you can't do the individual in the medical on the same day or group, you know you know that, but I don't know why they just."
323.0,Provider,"randomly make those changes, sometimes without notifying the therapist or the client."
9815.0,Patient,"and Electric fields me so then when they call me after that saying that I actually missed a individual session I said I thought it was a. They say no, it was at 9pm but i'm like but you say it was with Dr cell not fearless. They just confuse me I don't know i'm like Okay, well, we can go ahead and just whatever so I guess it was with Dr sale, because they reschedule with her for that, following Wednesday, instead, and then you this Wednesday."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so how did your appointment with her goal. that's how I found out about your wrist because I saw her notes from the appointment you guys have talked about."
9815.0,Patient,"When good. went good. The same mo. Things nothing changed. Okay, thank. You talk about what's up what were her so."
323.0,Provider,yeah did you do a drug screen this month. I don't think I saw I thought. No your August September.
9815.0,Patient,"know because I thought that was our last conversation that me and you had was let's go ahead and just get one more. reason. Drug test done. And let's you know, make sure that everything is alright, and then we're going to go ahead with the process of doing that every two weeks with the group sessions and then. Right I didn't know if there was something."
323.0,Provider,You were September kid.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah and I thought that's what me and Dr cell was talking raw said that they had it. Because when they witness in the mail that it actually gets emailed to me that it's on the way. yeah so I had told her that and she said just go ahead and just because I had told her web man, you talked about was I thought I just have one more, which is the August, one I didn't have to do anymore."
323.0,Provider,that's true.
9815.0,Patient,Okay that's why I didn't know she said just go ahead and just return back to Center so I actually have it's a land on my floor. I didn't have to go and put it back in the mailbox but what am I supposed to write back on it like return back to sender or.
323.0,Provider,"Just mark off you're like if you have a black marker mark off your address. And then on the package just put return to Sender, and it should go out back to them."
9815.0,Patient,Okay that's what I thought I said I thought I didn't have to actually take a another drug test for some. reason I remember.
323.0,Provider,"I remembered you and I talked about that, but the reason I asked is because I saw that one was shipped out, and so I was like well, maybe we're just going to have you do another one. That."
9815.0,Patient,"I need to go back in and put another note in your chart than that they don't need to send the drug kits out anymore. So i'm going to go in, or return that one back. and put mark that off because I do actually have a. A permanent marker to go ahead and mark out my address, and put that down return to sender. So i'll go ahead and do that, but I was like okay well, maybe I didn't know if you actually wanted me to take another one brother my last time I checked, we said we're going to do it at the."
323.0,Provider,Right no that's fine because we're trying to work through just getting you ready to discharge so. We want to keep your way.
9815.0,Patient,mm hmm.
323.0,Provider,good time to get in contact of my PL because he's supposed to be telling me when I actually have to turn myself in.
9815.0,Patient,"And since i'm actually on a on a break from work for two weeks for my wrist to get better and whatnot I always wanted to go ahead and turn myself in because I still get paid for those two weeks. Right some of this go ahead and knock my five days out the way and then just come back. home, but I have to i've been trying to get it will be, because that will be very convenient for me. And i'll still get paid to so it's go ahead and just kill two birds with one stone. yeah so and go ahead and get that done but he's not answering my phone calls so it's it's irritating like I was supposed to i've been calling him all last week, he has not answered."
323.0,Provider,that's weird.
9815.0,Patient,"Like it's just I don't know he told me to call him on certain day and then i'll call him that he doesn't answer that I leave a voicemail call him back the next day, he is no answer so he can't keep complaining about how I don't. call him when when I call him he doesn't answer so I stopped calling them for a while. Right you don't care, then clearly you know I don't care either. you'll find out when I go ahead and turn my selfie and now I don't wanna call you."
323.0,Provider,yeah that's not that's not good.
9815.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"No, but it would it would be great to get those five days done, and not even worry about it. Which is the last hole really big hold right, I mean that's what we're kind of waiting for it to get that done so we could then also start moving for discharge from here."
9815.0,Patient,"Go and just knock that out. And do that um So hopefully I actually go ahead and do that. Monday so Oh, because I don't want to actually eat no i'm not going to do that Monday, because then they're actually going to end up trying to hold me for the weekend. I don't think they try to discharge people on the weekend so i'm going to have to end up going in on the weekend and getting off during the week so probably this Sunday or something like that Monday I don't know some I don't. know I had like."
323.0,Provider,Monday know you want to go in on like Wednesday.
9815.0,Patient,yeah because I have.
323.0,Provider,A very I have until.
9815.0,Patient,"We know birthday yeah i've returned to work October fish. Okay, so like a week and a half."
323.0,Provider,"yeah so I haven't silly then to go ahead and do my five days and come back up here. Okay, you want to go in on a Thursday, because then you get Friday Saturday Sunday Monday."
9815.0,Patient,"You will stay there, Tuesday yeah. yeah I think."
323.0,Provider,The whole five days.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah I have to do the whole five days, I think that that fifth day is when i'll actually get out. yeah because then that first day I actually go in and count as one day. Right, especially if I going in the morning, then I leave on that fifth day in the morning."
323.0,Provider,In the morning group.
9815.0,Patient,So.
323.0,Provider,Oh boy.
9815.0,Patient,"Go ahead and get this everywhere, and I know i'm going to hate it."
323.0,Provider,yeah I know.
9815.0,Patient,"They don't want to do it, but i'm going to just get it over with because it's fun to kill me."
323.0,Provider,"Part of your history, you want to just put the bed anyway."
9815.0,Patient,"That, too, I just don't know what I really want to do if I really sit there, and like I think what really drove me crazy because I really hate being confined in areas like that. Right and knowing that I can't just like I can't even use the bathroom like I hate the shower and they're like. i'll probably go that whole five days without taking a shower only because I really do not like being in there, like that."
323.0,Provider,Right.
9815.0,Patient,I just want to sleep eat and just that's it.
323.0,Provider,And do your time.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah and just do my time that's, all I can do, but you know, last time I was in there, they put me in a one man, sale and that was even worse because I was really like it was in a small little room like a hallway. hmm and it had like five other sales next to me but they're all individual sales, so we couldn't see each other or nothing and they, let us out one, at a time for our."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness."
9815.0,Patient,So I was.
323.0,Provider,Mine man.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so one men so like it was 23 hours a day locked up and is an hour out and you're by yourself, so you can either watch TV or you can be on the phone, the first time they let me out, they only let me out for like 20 minutes. And I had to go right back in. I was supposed to get my whole hour and I forgot what actually end up happening, but only got 20 minutes."
323.0,Provider,If they're written.
9815.0,Patient,"And they didn't let me back out. And I was in there for like. I want to say, like three four days. But I can't I don't know what time it is. or I don't I can't see the TV, because my sale was at the very end, and the TV was all the way in the corner, so I couldn't actually peek out and actually see it, so I was just trying to sleep my time off, but it got to the point where I was tired of sleeping but I had. no choice. Like I just want."
323.0,Provider,To do it.
9815.0,Patient,"mean yeah so I kind of have troubles now like I don't like seat belts I don't like wearing see pills I don't like feeling can find in areas like that or make me feel like I can't move I can't get out like I just. What I can when I go to sleep, I can close my room i'm close my room door like I feel like this, like a protection for me. I guess. But when my room door being close and everything closed lockdown then i'm okay."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9815.0,Patient,But. I can't i've never seen my girl.
323.0,Provider,yeah.
9815.0,Patient,"I don't I hate see boats, I cannot worse, the boat at all, I tried to but then I can strap it in but that part that comes over here i'll just go ahead and just put it behind me like I don't like that chef right there."
323.0,Provider,that's really how you like that's how you drive you put it behind you.
9815.0,Patient,yeah yeah I have to.
323.0,Provider,Interesting okay.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah because I don't I don't like I don't like that strap I don't like. being confined in that low area, because you know I know sequels are for safety. And I, and I understand that, but I just don't like that little that shot like it's just something about it it's just It makes me feel like I just can't move."
323.0,Provider,"Right and you want to you, like you want to do you want to be have access to get out."
9815.0,Patient,"yeah like at any given moment, like anything can happen like you never know. Like What if you're trying to take off to see bill, and he gets stuck to the point where you can't take it off. Like even in car accidents you never know a car, you can just be going the right way in a car can just be hitting you from your side. And, to the point where you're trying to take your seat belt off. And you can't."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
9815.0,Patient,"I need to be able to get out when I need to get out at a given moment, I feel like that cboe is for security, but the same time, it can be a security hazard."
323.0,Provider,You and your exit strategy.
9815.0,Patient,"Like you always it don't matter where you are what you're doing is you always have to be aware of your surroundings, you have to be aware of your any type of exit strategies everything, like everything you just have to be aware. Right and i've learned that like is this is better for anybody to be aware. Especially if you your actions."
323.0,Provider,yeah and then that kind of prison environment doesn't help.
9815.0,Patient,"No, but it makes you kind of be in your own mindset and sometimes that's a good thing to be in because when you're out here, and the world, you really don't think. You really don't actually think about the consequences of your actions until after it happens so some people may think of. Like get into that mindset of like what can I do better next time, which is the wrong way to go, instead of going that way. i'm thinking of it as Okay, so what is a way that I don't have to like you know kind of recreate myself into just I know that's wrong what I did so let me correct it and let me try to do this, a different way. Let me not get into it to where I can actually get in trouble again. But all of them all, only have one thing on my record, everything else is really dish traffic."
323.0,Provider,yeah. One infinite that you just keep working off.
9815.0,Patient,"yeah that's really the only thing so it's not like i'm on you're just doing like i'm catching felonies some I really have just a small little misdemeanor like this it. Nothing else big so i'm not really that type of person, Mrs oh you're just doing everything that everybody else is doing."
323.0,Provider,"that's. get it behind you, because I don't anticipate to you're gonna go back to."
9815.0,Patient,The have no.
323.0,Provider,bs anymore.
9815.0,Patient,"No i'm just trying to work on to get my license back again, I mean that's really pretty much all I have to do, but money is always want to be the issue, so I have to figure out how i'm actually going to. get the money that I actually need to pay for everything that I need to pay for on top of getting you to pay for rent and bills and keeping my phone up and insurance and everything that everything that needs money, I need to be able to set for a minute. So I have to figure out what I can actually do to get all that. that's the only. that's, the only thing i'm trying to focus on. So if I have to work over time from work and. Then this was gonna have to take."
323.0,Provider,"Oh. Well, I think that, between now and the next time we meet if you. get a hold of. The PO in are going to do your five days. If you can think about it, call into us just to let us know you're going to do it and ask them to send me a message about it. Okay, so that I know that if you're missing any appointments or whatever I know where you're at."
9815.0,Patient,"Okay, do we have any upcoming. appointments."
323.0,Provider,"think so, but hold on, let me see if I can look at this."
9815.0,Patient,"Because I don't think I do with you or that's yourself or. The rest of this month, I believe."
323.0,Provider,hold on.

After she has served her five days of jail time, which is part of probation. meets with Dr sell. Those are two individuals with me and continues with her every other week group. And then. Just check in her chart real quick. So also can we please make a note that her group assignment for. For the 28th. She does not need to attend if she's on the every other week. agile. And that I think should take should get her back in cycle and then what we talked about was the discharge for. For her completion of the probation requirements also I see that the drug screen did go out the beginning of September, and she does not need to do that, so we need to just make a note that she's sending. Sending that back in, and then the drug screen is not required of her. At this point again, as she gets ready for discharge. The probation is going to give her. Going is going to ask her to do a drug screen anyway Okay, if we can just note that in her chart than that will help me remember all of those details as well. Thank you."
