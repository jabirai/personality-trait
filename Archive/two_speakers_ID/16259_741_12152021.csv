741.0,Provider,"Okay screen taken, thank you very much."

741.0,Provider,"Yes, you are in the green your stuff is all green that's awesome."
16259.0,Patient,"awesome yeah that's good news because i've been having a lot of trouble lately it's been kind of stressful, to be honest."
741.0,Provider,Okay hey well. As it. Is it stressful trying to get all this stuff done. Everything happening.
16259.0,Patient,"I mean it's just a lot of i've never done that Tele health stuff that's just a lot of stuff I mean I gotta do a group counseling I got individual I got surveys I got like personality assessments and stuff and then. yeah it's just a lot of stuff and I i've never had to deal with it, that much stuff."
741.0,Provider,Right well. it's more responsibility being in tele health.
16259.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"But it's also a privilege because. You don't have to report every single day. Like you would like, at a methadone clinic. And you don't have. You don't have to go sit in a hospital or in a doctor's office every so often. yeah you know, so there are some there's pros and cons to all of the. different methods."
16259.0,Patient,Oh yeah I agree for sure.
741.0,Provider,"um so yeah it's. Okay, on a seven you were a I have you marked as as a cancellation, I think. Oh, I want to go back and look at that yeah I had it cancelled, so it wouldn't count against you. Because. You are waiting, but you never could get in."
16259.0,Patient,"yeah I was forever, it seemed like I just I waited like 15 minutes."
741.0,Provider,yeah and. I tried to let you in and then you couldn't get in or I don't know I don't know what happened. But I also had. Another client right behind you.
16259.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"What was that, like I could like shift. yeah I was like just cancel it cancel this appointment I reschedule in and we'll be good."
16259.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
741.0,Provider,"So we got you scheduled for today, and then we have you scheduled again on the 28th."
16259.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,and That way we'll get. To in for the month.
16259.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,And that'll keep you in the green.
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And after a while i'm sorry about coughing in your ear, I have a sore throat, and I think I have bronchitis again so. No yeah so. But the longer that you can stay in the Green and in compliance like from late for the next couple of months, then I might be able to drop you back to like a monthly. i'm. use it instead of twice a month just once a month. Okay, which would help it would also reduce your I think it would it might reduce your. Surveys I don't know if it's connected, I think your surveys are connected to your group. yeah that's that's your that's up to your prescriber, but if you stay compliant and and participating, then there shouldn't be any any trouble. Okay, and. So did you look at exercise number 64 the. trigger."
16259.0,Patient,"yeah I looked at it it's been a little bit since I did, but I. And wasn't it about like behaviors and so."
741.0,Provider,yeah it was about triggers.
16259.0,Patient,triggers okay.
741.0,Provider,yeah that the first one that I sent you was about the behaviors and the mindset. Engaging prior and the second one was the things that trigger for you.
16259.0,Patient,and
741.0,Provider,"So it was um. Let me see if I can I don't want to pull out that big old book I just pulled up here. yeah no. yeah it's easier to look at it on the computer and then he. Well, that is, if I can find it quicker. Oh. mind me one thing. You want to work on. In treatment."
16259.0,Patient,"um. I think we've talked about this before, but I think the biggest thing was. me just trying to have fun. Like socially in my free time because. i've always struggled with that ever since I stopped drinking and then ever since I stopped doing like opiates and stuff so."
741.0,Provider,"Right right Okay, so we need to figure out, we need to redefine your idea of fun. that's all right that's all right. We can do that."
16259.0,Patient,and
741.0,Provider,Did you ever make a list of hobbies or things that you want to try. Like things that you'd like to try or things that you'd like to learn.
16259.0,Patient,"um I don't have many things that i'd like to learn, right now, like i'm pretty comfortable. Well, I just started this this new job is addiction counseling, which is a lot of stuff is something i've really been interested in doing and i've been really kind of consumed with learning all about that lately."
741.0,Provider,"Right right, I understand it's. Pretty it's pretty. is pretty expansive amount of knowledge. And one of the things you'll find is you're constantly learning."
16259.0,Patient,Right exactly.
741.0,Provider,Because what it costs there's constantly new. Studies coming out there's constantly new theories about. How to do therapy. And those types of things that we apply when we were.
16259.0,Patient,So different to so every person you encounter you learn something. From about how did they deal with this stuff and all that.
741.0,Provider,Oh definitely and some of my client teach me things that I would have never thought about at the same time i'm teaching them.
16259.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"And my peers teach we all the time about new stuff i'm constantly asking the therapists who've been at bright heart longer than I have. To show me. How to be more effective. You know whether it's in paperwork, or whatever you know. But triggers. For for you. could be boredom."
16259.0,Patient,Is one yeah.
741.0,Provider,"That is one okay that's a very common one. Most people are triggered by boredom because it gives us an opportunity to think and feel. yeah and those are two things that you and I don't like to do you not really. right if we get gut level honest I don't want to feel stuck and I don't need to be caught in my own head, because I am my worst own my own worst enemy."
16259.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,"And I will start ruminating on stuff I don't need to be thinking about. And so Okay, so one of the first things was that they asked i'm sorry i'm having trouble seeing. i'm good some kind of funky pattern coming out of one I. i'm okay today it's been an interesting day. Yes, and this is very strange I don't usually have patterns. showing up on my page when i'm trying to read. Okay, so relapse. can be triggered by sights sounds situations i'm even triggered by smell. um I don't know if I related this to you before but um I had been clean for a while. And I was cooking in the kitchen and somebody broke out some vinegar to cook with or clean with or something and I start looking for a spoon."
16259.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm a retainer that.
741.0,Provider,And I was so triggered by that and it was I mean it was a shock. yeah that that I had that I experienced that so smells can. objects can trigger you. A lot a lot of people who have done like crack brillo will trigger and. different things like that. Are there any of those types of things that you can think of that will trigger you.
16259.0,Patient,"Well, sounds like music. i'm very every time I hear a song I associated with like a time period in my life for what like a member certain memory. And then sites i'm definitely sites if i'm if I see it, if i'm out at the bar and I see alcohol or the bunch of people around me are drinking. I don't really see opiates that much so really that would just be like memories and. All that."
741.0,Provider,But that can be your memories can be triggered by different.
16259.0,Patient,Banks right.
741.0,Provider,"I mean I don't usually see opioids either it's like I rarely ever see somebody doing heroin or something I don't put myself in that place. And I don't put myself in the place to watch them do a big old bump of coke either. There are certain things that I remember on. That will start the memory and train running. You know i'm a frequently you know they still sell those great big ol humongous lighters that had the big old worked on them. And, and I could see somebody light a cigarette with that. And it automatically takes me back there. So yeah there's a lot of different things, and you could do you probably should make a list. yeah you know and and. Because the more extensive your list, the more you can be prepared for. Right okay."
16259.0,Patient,yeah there's all sorts of things I just can't really think about what.
741.0,Provider,"you'll find and you'll and, as you go along you'll add to that list. When you find something because you're not gonna be able to remember all of them right away. you're not gonna you're not and some of them you're not like like with the vinegar and not really going to be aware that extra. You until it does. yeah and. So we when that happens we don't want to automatically go back to doing what we used to do. And so, if you can think of all the things that you think might trigger you put them down on paper, then you can be more prepared right. yeah because I really have a big problem with with a lot of triggers is that when they surprise you. that's when we have an issue. Right um. When you are surprised by a situation then. If you don't have a plan already written down. Then you kind of have to fly by the seat of your pants and it's a 5050 chance. That you're either going to make the right decision or not. Some addictive behaviors that are often apply social activities um. yeah. encourage you to continue the old."
16259.0,Patient,stuff yeah.
741.0,Provider,"i'm teasing or arguing. And I know the more sarcastic I am probably the more dangerous. You know. yeah because when I was out there, using I was a very sarcastic angry person. yeah so. today. yeah well today i'm much more lighthearted i'm i'm a little lighter I still. A you know, a worrywart in a serious person, but. um. And also you'll find her family members and friends and co workers that enabled your addiction. That you're gonna have to um. yeah you're either gonna have to avoid or you're gonna have to call them on their enabling behavior so that you don't engage in your old behavior."
16259.0,Patient,Right yeah.
741.0,Provider,"That are you just have to walk away from them and not associate with them. And sometimes that even happened. Even if you call them out on their enabling behavior. Sometimes they are not able to stop doing what they do. Right and if it's too much of a trigger for you, then you have to put them at a distance. yeah um which is hard to do."
16259.0,Patient,It is definitely is.
741.0,Provider,"that's very hard, because we like it when they support our nasty behavior."
16259.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And so, those are some things that you might want to have you might want to look out for also especially because you're back home right."
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I don't know about you, but my mom was my biggest enabler. yeah and I had to be very careful. Because you know I would call her on it. But she wasn't about to stop. So those things we have to be very careful about. unconsciously, they need us to be sick."
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,and
16259.0,Patient,helps whatever they're missing.
741.0,Provider,"Right exactly whatever it is that they're trying to. fulfill or whatever needed is that they're trying to fill by doing whatever it is that they do, then they need you to keep doing that for them."
16259.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,I swear my mom needs me to be the scapegoat. Somebody that she could blame. yeah I stuff.
16259.0,Patient,That makes sense. i'm working.
741.0,Provider,"yeah unfortunately and for each group listed and it has some different groups listed describe how you will avoid relapse triggers by their actions like for drinking using gambling etc companion. You know the funny thing of it is, is that you because drinking as an acceptable behavior in our."
16259.0,Patient,Society yeah.
741.0,Provider,that's he says i've you finding people who don't drink are greater if you hang out in 12 step recovery.
16259.0,Patient,Then yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"What you have to figure out if you're around people in a social atmosphere and now we're drinking does it trigger you to want to drink and, if so, what kind of what do you want to do to to keep that from happening."
16259.0,Patient,"yeah only is there, like only a third party years if they're the type of people that can drink one one or two beers and be fine then usually it doesn't bother me that much, but once I start feeling pete once I started seeing people feeling good then i'm like."
741.0,Provider,I want to get.
16259.0,Patient,"To my jaw and i'm like. yeah like that, but. I don't know I just I just always use my foresight and remember. How I would feel the next morning how disappointed I be in losing the four years I have right now, because i've had nightmares i've in the past, so I know exactly how it feels I decided."
741.0,Provider,Oh yeah. Always amazing. you've had those using dreams.
16259.0,Patient,"yeah when I. Not so much anymore, but I had a lot of. nightmares that I relapsed whenever it was like the first year so."
741.0,Provider,yeah well don't be surprised you'll still have some more.
16259.0,Patient,every once in a while I do I do but it's not. nearly as much.
741.0,Provider,"As it now yeah it's not like in the beginning, but what what got me was that you know at 10 years and I had are using green and I woke up feeling like i've used."
16259.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
741.0,Provider,That was pretty scary.
16259.0,Patient,It is yeah.
741.0,Provider,I haven't.
16259.0,Patient,"part is you didn't mess anything up so you got away with it and then. You felt like that's what I did, because my my fear was always when I drink up blackout, I do stupid stuff but, like, I had a dream, a couple months ago that I drank like two beers and those fine, so I woke up and I was like damn What if I did, that now, and I was fine so."
741.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. i've already proven to myself that there that I can do that for so long, and then I. Actually crossed that line."
16259.0,Patient,yeah that always leads.
741.0,Provider,"They don't have I don't have any. I don't have any misgivings about the fact that if I do one and I experienced control using for a period of time I don't know when that line gets crossed. Eventually, I crossed that line."
16259.0,Patient,mm hmm something.
741.0,Provider,"I have every I have every time. Right yeah i've gone for long, in fact, at one point I went for like a year of juice drinking i'm not doing anything else. But it was at the end, well before the year that was up, I was getting wasted and then it and then I tumbled into doing what I usually do you know."
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I went back to my drug of choice, so. yeah you never know where that line he if you lose control ever, then you never know when that will happen because it will happen if you keep pushing it. So. But yeah so you need to describe how you're going to avoid relax it. triggered like i'm on this worksheet here, I asked you to tell us how you going to avoid relapse when your outlet drinking using gambling companions or people pressuring you to you. or your enablers."
16259.0,Patient,"I mean I just basically, I mean i'll either leave this, I have to, but I just know I just have a deep, knowing that I can do it and that hasn't really been shaken for me since I found that out so it's pretty it's pretty much a no brainer that I just can't do it, I literally can't. Right yeah and I will take anything or anybody will change my mind on that as much as I don't want it to be true, and I want to be like everybody else i'm just not."
741.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. acceptances Nikki. Acceptance yeah I don't use, like everybody else."
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,call me special call me. too. call me anything you want to call me i'm just like i'm not normal.
16259.0,Patient,"Right now, other people just don't understand either they try to get it and they understand they understand it up the surface level, but they really don't. I always get questions do you think you'll ever drink again and you'll think you'll ever. I don't like that and let's just say. They have no knowledge of what it's like it's pretty crazy, but I guess you know I don't really know what they're like either to be. I try to ask people, what do you feel like after you drink two beers and you're able to stop like do you do you just feel like you should stop do you feel like you've had enough I because I can't."
741.0,Provider,yeah I don't I don't compute that part.
16259.0,Patient,"No, because that's what I get going."
741.0,Provider,that's when that's when it turns on and says okay let's get some more.
16259.0,Patient,Right exactly.
741.0,Provider,"You know, but also i've heard people say that they don't like that feeling. Your body. of losing that control."
16259.0,Patient,yeah i've heard that one to actually.
741.0,Provider,Before I love that feeling.
16259.0,Patient,"I know I never felt like I was, I wanted to get there, I never felt like I was there."
741.0,Provider,My I mean it's like. I know there's something wrong and very different I don't let.
16259.0,Patient,me know because a lot of people say they don't like that and that's when they stop.
741.0,Provider,"um. And if I could, if I could not like that and saw, then that would be different, but."
16259.0,Patient,that's not the case yeah.
741.0,Provider,"So changing focus from people to situations, what are the social situations that you think. will place you at greatest risk for relapse and we've already talked about being around people who are actually doing it like being."
16259.0,Patient,"yeah. And I guess social gathering like parties like. You know either holiday parties or you know remained. A. New year's is a big one, yes news is probably one of the biggest ones."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so our next appointment, we really need to collect put together a plan for you. yeah that solid right. yeah so that you can go and have fun and enjoy, but so that you have a backup. So that you don't miss out, you know."
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I mean, unless you just prefer to stay home i'm one of those weirdos that. I just don't like getting out there, with all the idiot."
16259.0,Patient,"yeah me either i'm. Eventually, I will be like that, but i'm so young now and all my friends are going out so."
741.0,Provider,Why right.
16259.0,Patient,"So do you want to go yeah I do, but I just. suck so that's you know. It is what it is, though, but I do enjoy seeing them and being with them. But there are a lot of times during the night, where i'm just like God damn it, I just wish. I guys."
741.0,Provider,Exactly exactly. And it's okay. To be sad about that.
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"You know, have you written the goodbye letter, for your dread."
16259.0,Patient,No it's no I never did do that.
741.0,Provider,Okay well that might be something you want to do between now and our next meeting.
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"say a formal goodbye. um and then read it to me next time how about that. Okay it's just preparing you for. New year's Eve okay. yeah so go ahead and write a goodbye letter. and And that way you can read it to me and sit literally say goodbye to your choice. Drugs of choice, depending on if you're like me, I had multiple."
16259.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And I think you do too, because I think you like to alcohol and opioid so pretty well."
16259.0,Patient,yeah I was into the downers.
741.0,Provider,yeah well I like the I like the roller coaster. Up down up down up down.
16259.0,Patient,I can do that every once in a while I did. The uppers it's just wasn't my thing. I if I had to have a downer. I did another but regardless. Right yeah.
741.0,Provider,So. Okay So how do you cope with stress. And relationship issues do those things tend to make you. bring out your addictive patterns. or Mickey Jones.
16259.0,Patient,"No stress oddly enough, not really as much as. As the other ones I just I don't know I just buckle down and get my my shit down, and I know I have to get it done and. it's never really sometimes it gets to me, but a lot of the times, it does on the relationships yeah I I always want a relationship, but um. I don't know i'm very picky and i'm not like a lot of people, I guess, and so i'm usually kind of lonely I have plenty of friends and stuff and I was had plenty of friends, but. I kind of like being myself and stuff around to me people, so I am a lonely person, a lot of the times, and that makes me want to use a lot. Okay, and it's not like I could go hang out with people and it just goes away because I I feel like I have to have some want to do that before I do."
741.0,Provider,Right and loneliness is. Probably more about intimacy. yeah and being with people.
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,because those are two very different things. You can hang with people all day long and still be lonely.
16259.0,Patient,yeah definitely yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Because of a lack of. intimacy of knowing each other and that's generally, especially at your age that's generally reserved for romantic relationship type style. You know."
16259.0,Patient,hey.
741.0,Provider,"yeah my personal opinion is that you have to learn to be intimate with your friends before you can be intimate with the romantic relationship. But not everybody understands that part. yeah and I personally have to be intimate with my higher power. Before I am intimate with. anybody else. So that's how that's what I had to work on it for. And I still don't have a relationship so. Right now, because I too am very picky I have made a lot of mistakes and my choices throughout the years, some of them do the alcohol and drugs, some of them just flat due to my dysfunction. And I don't want to do that anymore. So I am very picky and I am very cautious."
16259.0,Patient,yeah me too yeah.
741.0,Provider,"So and there's nothing wrong with that. But yes, it does, I mean we pay a price for it, yes, we do have periods of loneliness."
16259.0,Patient,yeah but I guess it's better than either being with the wrong person or putting everything you have into one person and then that doesn't go how you're supposed to because you didn't think about it too much.
741.0,Provider,"How or living in chaos, because you chose."
16259.0,Patient,"The wrong person. True that's true it's here, and you don't know how to get out of it."
741.0,Provider,"Right right and so yeah I don't know about you, but a lot of my clients are like. I am in this relationship and it's. Toxic how do I get out. Just like how did you get in. You walked in okay."
16259.0,Patient,So you walk out.
741.0,Provider,"But it's more complicated than that because they're living together they have kids together, or whatever you know. yeah but yeah I mean the drama continues right. yeah yeah so loneliness could be a trigger. So, probably a plan of attack on number one how to prevent. falling back into old behavior around loneliness but also maybe. learning how to find intimacy with one or two people. yeah in your life."
16259.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"These are just things that i'm throwing out there, so that when when you sit down to write your relapse prevention plan you have some ideas. And the other thing that I can do to is send you the next relapse prevention worksheet. Which is actually relapse prevention planning okay."
16259.0,Patient,All right.
741.0,Provider,"So i'll do that too. And that's probably more than enough for you to work on huh. yeah yeah you're like just piling it on. alright. Well, you have a very Merry Christmas."
16259.0,Patient,"Thank you, you as well."
741.0,Provider,"Thank you very much, I plan on it. And I will see you. On what was that day."
16259.0,Patient,28.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, the 28. And we will plan. on how to deal with New Jersey."
16259.0,Patient,All right. All right.
741.0,Provider,All right.
16259.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
741.0,Provider,"uh huh bye bye my. client has a desire to stay clean and silver the client has a desire to grow in the field of substance abuse counseling and he is actively pursuing a career in counseling. and He will write a goodbye letter to his drugs of choice for our next appointment. Which is December 28. And we will create a plan to bolster is resolved stay clean through new years Eve, which is a real slippery place for him so. Thank you very much bye bye."
