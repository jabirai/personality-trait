5107.0,Patient,"Okay, good."
480.0,Provider,"Because this one, the volume can go away higher um So how are you feeling about tomorrow."
5107.0,Patient,"i've been sick every morning, this week."
480.0,Provider,Like a stomach six.
5107.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,You can get anxiety.
5107.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. I think it's a very much anxiety because yeah like it's then just worsening. got it, I think it started way back in March, like once a month and it's been worsening to you know, a couple times a month and yeah like now, this week has been every morning, this week and i'm managed to get myself out of it after a while and still keep going, but it really sucks. yeah it makes it really hard to get up and get going in the morning, so."
480.0,Provider,yeah understandably now that's the worst.
5107.0,Patient,"Thinking about mentioning in my speech because I mentioned my. You know, fighting fibromyalgia and debilitating stuff i'm almost thinking of adding in a little lines thing I you know even been so upset and nervous about just this you know court date that i've been sick every morning, this week yeah."
480.0,Provider,"yeah So do you have your speech already written. Yes, do you want to read to me."
5107.0,Patient,"here. So, here it goes. i'd like to start by saying thank you, thank you for the wake up call that I needed, thank you for calling dhhs to without them, I wouldn't have had the guidance education and support from wellspring to take a long hard look at my life and change it for the better. I also found a new passion for helping people in recovery and i'm working towards becoming an addiction counselor and putting my experiences to good use. I would also like to point out i'm not an addict because I like to get high I have fought many painful and debilitating medical conditions daily starting in high school. This is where i'm thinking about adding in the line about being sick of every morning, this week, and I have even been prescribed opiates opiates for it for quite a while and despite it all i've been drug free for over two years. So i've repaired and also repaired many relationships that my addiction damaged, including with my two children and I pull very close to my supportive family and sober friends. i've cut out all my friends that still use and even moved away from Dexter i've moved in with my parents to help them and they become dependent on me. My addiction stole so much for me, it was a miserable way to live recovery has been a long, hard road but also rewarding one I don't ever want to step off the recovery path because there's way too much to lose if I do. i've worked extremely hard to get where I am today and done well enough to stay out of trouble for over the last couple years as well. Despite all this, hanging in hindering my progress, the concentration in this case, seems to be on how much I had when it should be on the problem that, having the drugs as a symptom of. And whether going to prison will even help me they feel prison would only be a step back for me at this point. I don't understand why there are two of us being charged with the full amount either I can understand, being an accessory to possession, but you already have one person doing a lot of time and has pleaded guilty to the full amount. This is also my first ever serious charge not and not something I will ever do again. I will accept whatever decision is made here today, but I think I could better serve society and the opioid crisis. By finishing my schooling, as I intended and perhaps doing community service as a drug counselor i'm also taking this plea deal because i've been threatened with a harsher charge and more time if I don't. I thank you, though, for listening to my story and considering my thoughts."
480.0,Provider,"wow That was good. That was real good. yeah yeah I got chills like three separate times. That was very good I like it, I like it a lot."
5107.0,Patient,"Like i'm trying not to make it too too long, but you know squeeze in there, you know some of the major points you know. yeah and like I said, I think I am going to add in we're going to talk about being sick and fighting and then talk, you know add in a bit about just fighting the nerves for coming to court. So, and I The other thing I might add, in there is. Or, I talked about never going to do it again and stuff that i've never been to even jail ever even spent a night in jail in my life. yeah yeah."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and that's something, especially with the new law in maine I think that's something good to point out is that they're trying to aren't they trying to get rid of jail time for first Defense drug offenders."
5107.0,Patient,"They were they had a lot of the bill, they were trying to pass with that, but it didn't get past it passed the House and not the Senate, or vice versa, one or the other, so."
480.0,Provider,that's frustrating.
5107.0,Patient,"yeah very, very. But they do have some new sentencing laws Larry said that. I think they're almost with the date of this stuff they're trying to get me sentenced under the old sentencing laws, because if I Larry said, if I wait till October there's new sentencing laws, where i'll get like nine days a month good time."
480.0,Provider,Why.
5107.0,Patient,"No matter what yeah so I kind of think they're trying to be sneaky and get me in under the old laws so that, like, I have to work my ass off to even try and get seven days a month, so."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I didn't know the laws are changing so soon that's unfortunate."
5107.0,Patient,"yeah Larry said that it's Larry that's one big thing I said is if I do you know get have to go in that i'd be better off to be sentence in October, because there's new sentencing laws for as far as good time and stuff goes."
480.0,Provider,Have you asked the Attorney about the possibility of if they decide you do need to be sentenced to jail time because they delayed the sentencing until October.
5107.0,Patient,"i'm going to ask about that. Either way, i've already decided i'm asking for at least. If I do have to turn myself in and asking for at least the weekend. so that I can tie a few last things up and prepare you know and prepare my kids my dog, you know everything the whole family's upset by this just."
480.0,Provider,Oh i'm sure.
5107.0,Patient,"Even my brother, you know my big bad. brother, you know, like he was here the other night and gave me a huge hug and was crying about it, and you know saying I don't I don't want you to go, because I don't know what mom and dad are going to do without you like, he even he is seeing how. Much my parents are coming to depend on me being here and being around and he doesn't want them to lose that so."
480.0,Provider,"Are they going with you to the Court ah borrow your parents. Yes, yeah and it's your mom going to speak to. She loved to."
5107.0,Patient,I don't know if she'll be allowed to or not. But she certainly would i'm sure if she gets the opportunity.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
5107.0,Patient,"But that's kind of why i'm preparing my speech as best I can because I don't know that if they'll listen anything else. And letters and stuff with me, of course I got another letter than one of my friends wrote me that's really you know really good talks about how i've supported her husband and his recovery and stuff so. So we'll see if that helps."
480.0,Provider,I was wondering if you are allowed to so you're allowed to bring letters with you don't have to. Like turn them in as evidence ahead of time.
5107.0,Patient,I don't think so. Okay.

480.0,Provider,"Smoking it's just so hard when you're around at all the time and there's nothing else to do. Like that was I quit smoking, I think, two or three months before I went to a rehab were smoking was allowed Of course I picked it right back up because I was around it all the time that's what you do on breaks, but. yeah if you have a good four months, first that might be enough. Right, but just don't beat yourself up over using that as a coping mechanism, because you have a lot going on, so my biggest thing, as long as you're not feeling super guilty for picking it up again, then. Right and and what it is."
