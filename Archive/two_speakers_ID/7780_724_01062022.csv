7780.0,Patient,Hello. doing good. news. So apologies for being a little a little late.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you just woke up like 30 minutes ago. yeah okay. to bed."
7780.0,Patient,story. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well, nine hours asleep that's pretty good you don't oversleep."
7780.0,Patient,"yeah i'm actually a pretty proud of myself for getting out of bed usually, even if I had broken up. I would still sit in bed, for a long time and."
724.0,Provider,i'm good. what's new and exciting.
7780.0,Patient,"Much. I. still need to do stuff for school um I scheduled a bunch of appointments with you, we have another one on the 10th for an hour. So I was hoping we could do some score stuff."
724.0,Provider,yeah definitely.
7780.0,Patient,i'm hanging out with donnie today just that boy they've been talking to. Good. My hair looks read.
724.0,Provider,This letter.
7780.0,Patient,that's crazy.
724.0,Provider,natural sunlight.
7780.0,Patient,"My hair doesn't look red, naturally. yeah there's not a lot going on right now i'm. i'm a little bit stressed out about money, it feels like. I got paid on the third and. I already am out of money. Because I had to pay my rent and. comcast which is $100 and. All this. So."
724.0,Provider,"So is it. Do you have like a lot of your bills are up front, like in the beginning of the month or. So it kind of wipes all I feel like they're the first paycheck of the month."
7780.0,Patient,"yeah the first paycheck of the month gets gets wiped out, I it was about 650 this month 350 goes to my rent for this month. And then 100 of it was being. yeah was for comcast but also 150 of it is. In. is being held by the Bank, because I did a mobile deposit and so they have to verify the check, then it stays on hold a certain percentage of the money. And so. I technically have $150 less than what is actually my bank account, so I just already had to start pulling money from my rent to like pay for something. And so it's mine."
724.0,Provider,"Okay now at the second part of the month, what are your budget, what does it look like."
7780.0,Patient,"Second parts usually a little bit easier. We do the rent and or I do the right and then that's basically it I try and have savings leftover but um you know, usually buying food or the occasional uber it just feels like it goes. Money it goes super quick and I don't get paid for like two weeks basically. And so I have survived for two weeks on no money like nothing except for my food stamps which I guess is the only money that I really need."
724.0,Provider,And is that. Is that food stamp is that enough to cover your food costs for the month.
7780.0,Patient,"More or less No, it is if I. plan it out. But. there's usually about a five day period at the beginning of the month, where I sort of. don't have any left."
724.0,Provider,Okay yeah. um Have you ever developed like a budget before have we talked about this.
7780.0,Patient,"um I tried to develop a budget. it's hard, because my paycheck fluctuate so much."
724.0,Provider,"Like like significantly where it's like pretty inconsistent, or like you can get like a ballpark of what you what you're expecting yeah."
7780.0,Patient,"I can definitely ballpark it, but it just ends up with me pulling money from five I I i'm not a great. saver of money."
724.0,Provider,"So why don't. Why don't we why don't we add it to like the to the list of things that we should. Look at potentially addressing because financial financial financial hardship is like a major stressor in people's lives, especially for all of us that live paycheck to paycheck. You know it's. very stressful, so why don't we. You know, over the next you know month or so why don't we developed like like a budget strategy, you know you just really it's like it's you making a list of. You know what your income is and what your outgo is so money coming in money going out there figuring out what the dates are. And what your pay period breakdown is that we try to figure out like a way where it's you know if you're saving 50 bucks. You know, every pay period that way you're not or whatever that like that dollar amount is that we could figure out where where you could save as long as you're holding on to that you know you can stay pretty consistent playing out like your you know your month. there's always room to play around with a budget because, like what are other bills, you have like like list like list your bills when they're do. And then we can kind of figure out like a like an easier way to pay, because sometimes like if you have credit card bills, or like insurance or whatever it is. You can actually contact those people and be like hey look, can we move by my bill date, to this date instead because. Logistically it just works out better for me and they'll do that so like credit cards will, will you could play around with like when you're when your data is you don't have to live by their date. So a lot of places will kind of like work with you on that you know potentially like you're like your landlord you know if you're like hey some people are pretty receptive it's like a. Financially, a more stable than a ball, so, if I can pan that 15 instead of the first you know what would that be my start date so little things like that we can kind of like look at, so you were there can be some improvements made um do you have any credit cards."
7780.0,Patient,"I do, I have to."
724.0,Provider,And what what's the status of those cards.
7780.0,Patient,They are. Probably have about 100 each on the I haven't used them in months okay. I try not to. Only for like an emergency thing but there they were maxed out for like three four months.
724.0,Provider,what's your what's your Max limit on those cards.
7780.0,Patient,"Very little one of them is 350 and the other is 600. Okay, so yeah."
724.0,Provider,"not bad that's not bad man oh. So. So when I was in school, I had I had this this teacher and I wasn't even like a finance course right but I don't know what brought the subject matter up, but what he said was what he was like a struggling student, you know what I mean he. Living paycheck to paycheck that he had two credit cards that had like $500 balances on him. So what he decided to do and somebody probably told him to try doing this was that, on the first of the month, he would have a zero balance right on his credit card on both of them. He would essentially. Max that out on all things that he could pay like utilities they'll fall insurance all the things that would accept credit cards as a form of payment. He would pay right because no matter what he was added to pay those bills anyways periodically throughout the month but, like most people. You know rent is due, the first of the box So either we wipe out practically more than half of what our paycheck is for. Our first paycheck of the month for rent or we end up wiping out the last paycheck of the previous bother for the upcoming and then you'll wiped out right, so the hanging out with a budget so you're pretty much most people are screwed right, so this is what he started doing. He pay off all those things you know, even if his phone was do on the 20th he paid up front of the first boom boom boom eBay and all that stuff on the first. And then, what he did was collectively he would save part of his paycheck would budget each pay period to make sure that those bills would eventually get paid off and he would pay the card off by the end of the month, no matter what he paid the card off so we'd have 00 balance the end. That way, he didn't get charged any interest fees right, so that the credit card company made no money off of him, he didn't pay the minimum he paid the balance off completely you know periodically throughout the month based on case paychecks. So that at the start of the month, you again have a zero balance. And then he would pay all their stuff off and he kept doing that and then over time and a short amount of time, the credit card companies realized that they weren't making any money off this kid. So they increases rate, so instead of having five $500 on his card they gave him 1000. Because it trying to trap, you know, and they want you to make the minimum payment because that's where they that's where they hit you with the interest and that's where they make all their money. they're like yeah it's only 80 bucks you know you can you can afford you like, how you pay 80 bucks no pressure. But half of that goes to them or quarter of that goes to them so then you're that's how they nickel and dime you for a while, so. He was like okay cool I don't have to use two cards anymore, I could use one card, and now I have a $500 associates, and your card. And that's what he kept doing, and then you know, he would pay all his bills off and he's like hey I don't my bills are paid for the bottom not stressed out. I just have to have some discipline to make sure that every time I get paid, I take a fraction of that money and I throw it at the credit card. And I need to keep doing that, until that card has paid off by the end of the month, because I don't want to give them any free money and he did that, over time, for years, he did that. right there by the end of it, he was like the moral the story was like he's like I got a credit card like it my wallet. he's like, and I can essentially buy a house with it at this point he's like that's how much his credit limit was it was like this astronomical number. Right and his credit score was super I like maxed out he had excellent credit scores, because when you have credit cards, and you don't use them your credit score gets hit negatively. And if you're you overuse them you get hit negatively so it's like this weird game that you got to play with them, so he did that, so I was like that's that's pretty solid advice I started doing that. And for the year after that I was doing man my life so financially less stressful than it has ever been because I would just do that I would begin in a month go on bills off. That systematically throughout the month make sure that I was you know getting that balance of the zero, and I was good to go and like you said eventually my credit card. Like a limits went up astronomically you know what I mean like in a very short amount of time like like every three months, or like hey do you want five more grand hey do you want five more grads like yeah of course yeah make my life really easy so. I encourage a lot of people to use that model if you have this plan, you know what I mean because it does help is a lot of us are struggling either. In the beginning of the MOD or at the very end of the month, just to eat a lot of times because we were just wiped out a little bit of discipline and a little a little strategy, you know it benefits you increases your credit score. decreases a lot of financial stress and burden it's just a real good tactic and you have i've used it in the past, and I intend on using it again, you know so consider that maybe kick kick the idea around a little bit."
7780.0,Patient,yeah there's there's i've been told to use it before like that I just it got maxed out and I couldn't. there's a time when I just wasn't able to pay it off.
724.0,Provider,"You know, and if that happens, you don't have any like life happens, you know my aunt died and I ended up like spending a whole bunch of money to like fly interview and do all this stuff that like come back home and. You know, deal with that and then like I think my washing my dryer died, the same week and, like like anything else people get buried, you know, but what I was doing, and it was working out pretty well, it was nice yeah for sure so. One strategy amongst many i'm sure."
7780.0,Patient,"No that's it's that's a really good one, I would have to start carving them down a little bit. Right yeah I would love to get them to zero."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it feels really good yeah it feels really good when you do it. So the relationships going well, I tell you get."
7780.0,Patient,"It is yeah. it's a little bit more. lovey dovey than I would like, for it to be. But. i'm sorry we're just gonna let him do it until he carries himself out, I think."
724.0,Provider,Okay you're not into the cute or it's messy or what.
7780.0,Patient,"yeah not really. it'll be like i'm will make plans to hang out, I mean i'll be like Okay, I just want to be fully with you and i'm like shut up. we're fully with each other. You know you just say it. it's just it's not like it's actually annoying it's just there's I don't know how to respond to that. and be like you're right I sure hope we do. So yeah. But other than that, I mean that's like a tiny thing okay."
724.0,Provider,"he's not trying to move in with you, yet right."
7780.0,Patient,"No it's probably well, though. he's like that."
724.0,Provider,Have you have you guys discussed like each other's like dating history or anything like that or.
7780.0,Patient,He is he is much more dating history than I do. he's interesting like moved out to live with his boyfriend at 16 my moved in with another people who live like that's a scare the shit out of me looking like move like.
724.0,Provider,Their first flight on the world.
7780.0,Patient,"Their first three apartments were were then moving in with my boyfriend. But some people are just. To be like that, yes."
724.0,Provider,"yeah do you prefer having like independence. Like in relationship or. Because that's it seems like he's, on the other, spectrum, where he wants to be like attached, you know, at all times, if they had the had the opportunity that's how it would be the you like, like a certain degree of independence and relationships."
7780.0,Patient,"it's it's more just like. it's not gotten to a point yet where I feel a my social battery get recharged by him, you know, like he. it's still a. it's still energy that I have to put out in order to hang out with them so and and so. Spending the night at somebody's house is like the ultimate energy drain right like like I come back with a social battery of zero. And so it like yeah so it's just stuff like that it's a little bit."
724.0,Provider,yeah but.
7780.0,Patient,we've only known each other for like. Three four weeks so.
724.0,Provider,"you're still in the early stages of you know adventure exploration and all that. yeah I know each other that's like the fun part of you know relationships in the beginning, so."
7780.0,Patient,"But the other day. Tuesday, he came over at like 330 and we hang out and then I was, like all right i'm about to go into group and so he went on a walk around the neighborhood and then came back and I liked that that was nice just sort of idle we hanging out."
724.0,Provider,"that's cool. house house health housings it how's the depression slight improvements are you seem happier, you know what I mean."
7780.0,Patient,"yeah um. I would say slight improvements but me missing those appointments is like a cute clear depression thing like. I wasn't like staying in bed all day missing men, but it was just this I feel like I go through this sort of wave of. being very on top of it and then neglecting it and then on top of it and neglecting it yeah. Probably noticed that. Too it's sort of oscillates by. A half of a month."
724.0,Provider,"yeah. But those those are you know what I mean like those are like patterns of behavior as long as you're self aware of those things like like you'll make incremental changes over time to get better about it, based on you know, based on. Success you know motivation is so highly attached to you know accomplishments and goals and stuff like that, and if you're kind of just like man i'm kind of doing this i'm kind of doing that, like really nothing definitive like it's hard to stay motivated know what I mean so. Like a lot of prep you've been on there, like a lot of pressure to for the school, so you still feeling that, like residual effects, so you know."
7780.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Once it dials down and then you get back into school, you might it might like you said recharge you a little bit and you're kind of supplementing with like a relationship to now, so you kind of got like a lot going on. But you gotta remember to make make sure you still get some time for yourself, and I mean between work school, you know boyfriend and life in general, so just make sure you're saving some time for you, for meditation some grounding."
7780.0,Patient,"yeah I am. Reading this book called atomic habits um. My dad recommended. And it's an interesting approach he sort of instead of like if you wanted to eat healthier you wouldn't start. shaming, the way that you eat you would instead just eat like how a healthy person would you would pretend, you are like. Alfred person yeah."
724.0,Provider,I like that what's it called the topic habits. hmm.
7780.0,Patient,"And so i'm hoping that that will. have some good. Information in it, because it's this this like tracker journal that I use. Has a bunch of these like. goal tracker. Oh nice stuff and then like it's basically just a blank notebook that I filled up halfway with stuff. But there's like a specific way to use this book that he talks about sort of in the back of the journal sort of how how he would use it. And and it's it part of his book. So it's like it's like a companion piece to it. yeah so I my dad sent me the book and i'm actually interested to read it, because the the pretending to be a healthy person is actually chaos magic. yeah that's what chaos magic is."
724.0,Provider,"Are you talking about that yeah I like that, like as you stay at like the concept seems like it's like one of those things where. Once people say things like I feel like I already kind of knew that it could be like that's a good approach like just. You know, pretending the exercise, you know so it's like you don't have to know what you're doing just try eventually learned some things as you're trying and opposed to just going in there, some people like. They want a game plan and they get very rigid and easily like detracted when things don't kind of play out the way that they they visualize or anticipated and opposed to just be like i'm just going to keep doing this until I get better at doing it."
7780.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You know what I mean, so I like that I like that idea just pretending to be healthier pretending to be happier. Like you said if if if you can correlate that to you know chaos magic it's already something that you're working out so that's reinforced, you know, music, maybe it's meant to be you know I try. To get all you know. Energy power crystals kind of thing, but sometimes like the universe kind of explains things in its own way, and when you like, when you see it once a while you're like holy shit that's kind of cool. yeah i'm not i'm not big into astrology but sometimes you read something like. Okay, all right that kind of that kind of hit me a certain way, I like it all right so. yeah man like uh. yeah I think the universe, is an interesting thing, so to speak, to people in different way."
7780.0,Patient,"Right, it does and it's it's. malleable. As I think that that's what it's more like instead of self control, he would just be the person that already does that. So you wouldn't need self. Control and sort of talk that's at least how my dad explained it i'm sure that he talks about it a little differently just from the title atomic cap at 10 assuming it's you build small tiny habits, on top of each other over time. You know, typically larger habit. But."
724.0,Provider,"yeah very well put. Nice. yeah let me know how it is because a lot about like this kick myself where i'm like I want to start reading, you know a little bit war, because I fill my time with. You between work and my kids I don't really have a time to to expand, you know my knowledge i'm technically in college i'm just waiting on like which track i'm going to continue with. And some other stuff like in the background. So, like i've been like this holding pattern, so I was like nah I think if we start reading more books right so i've recently bought. Something by Viktor frankl which we may talk about it's called like man's search for meaning and it's about a Viktor frankl was a psychologist and he developed his own way of therapy it's called like a. She was called something like logo logo therapy or something like that and it's about like like general purpose like like. You know if you can find that singular thing that that you value it motivates you to keep moving forward and treasures world then that's all you need it's like your purpose. yeah it's really inspiring and you find out that Viktor frankl was a shoe that was in a concentration camp during World War Two he survived so like. it's all about purpose, so my buddy who was like a clinical supervisor at my very first job he's like my therapist mentor you know he's taught me a lot of shit. When I went on vacation over the summer I like i've made it made it a point to go see him and he was like hey man, you should check this book out. So I got it so i'm finishing up one book right now and then, this is my next one, and then I just ordered off the homer's odyssey and they any Iliad so like the story of like DCS you know I mean beautiful big big book i've always wanted to read it so. yeah I made a conscious effort to get more books in my life so."
7780.0,Patient,yeah I am. This is an interesting looking book.
724.0,Provider,Which one.
7780.0,Patient,Victor frankel's.
724.0,Provider,yep.
7780.0,Patient,yeah identifying a. purpose in life to feel positive about and then immersive Lee imagining that outcome.
724.0,Provider,right here.
7780.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah man search for 16 million copies sold. His attention he's dead now but.
7780.0,Patient,"Okay, is it i'm not there book by him is from death camp to existentialism oh no That was the original title of."
724.0,Provider,man's search for being.
7780.0,Patient,A mentor for meeting as the subtitle I love that that's very funny or I guess that's not funny but that's just an intense.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. Being being an existentialist anyways it's very a Frederick Nietzsche you know I mean you could just find like the negativity and, like the hopelessness. With the futility of you know, like people's outlook there's there's a little room for that, but you know if that's the case, you know that just means you're super disconnected. But I like it, you know what I mean so like for a lot of people we struggle with identity and oftentimes our identity or is attached to our line of work it's attached to like who we are, as a person in a relationship or. You will always want to be part of a team, you know what I mean like i'm a big fan of the red SOx I hate any anything that's a Yankee affiliation so it's just like, for whatever reason, we have like that at natural thing. Probably boils down to a little bit of like tribalism you know, having having a role and then being contributing to so it's interesting like like my buddy he swears up a doubt about it, like he's like a huge fan now because he he works as a clinical director at a. At a hoity toity place and Florida. And he was like he's like I really had to like step my game up for this so he's like so he started researching this guy so it's interesting."
7780.0,Patient,it's really interesting. i've been looking at a recovery dharma let's just try it was talking about. I think it's called recovery term. yeah. i'd never heard about it before. yeah i'd heard about it and stuff and like it.
724.0,Provider,it's an APP to ride.
7780.0,Patient,"And now, an APP."
724.0,Provider,An APP it's like.
7780.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know I do. This one is all about finding a meeting and. yeah in person and online meetings. Oh, my God I clicked in person meeting and it took me to a. zoom. She. Where Am I central mountain Pacific. look like there's a whole lot in. San Francisco. Which. wednesday's 8am."
724.0,Provider,yeah that's that's not gonna work for you.
7780.0,Patient,It really is it. it's online so. There it is Friday six.
724.0,Provider,"So, before I let you go what's the deal with the school, have you heard anything back or."
7780.0,Patient,In terms of.
724.0,Provider,"Last semester, no. No really."
7780.0,Patient,I haven't heard anything.
724.0,Provider,Have you checked at all.
7780.0,Patient,"Yes, actually i've been on my gateway and student portal and actually been looking at some more classes to add because. I think i'm going to drop that for 40 class the one that's like an 8am that I would have to skip anyways to in order to actually get to school um. yeah. i've been trying to be better about also. Like. They have this. APP. That. it's like a little. tracker thing, and so, if I so one of them is drink 40 ounces which I did do actually already. And so. This is dumb, let me just add one it like lets you add. To see I hold my phone like this. yeah it's called done. And it's a very simple thing I had to pay to add more than three things but they're having a new year, they were having a new year sale for a year subscription for like $10 and I like sure i'll do that. I like it, because it gives you a reminder as well."
724.0,Provider,Nice.
7780.0,Patient,"And so, but one of them, I want to do is to like I want to write something. At least every day. journaling or. Otherwise."
724.0,Provider,On a particular subject matter or just your day or.
7780.0,Patient,"Like journaling. or mainly journalists. want to try and start. doing something, and I really, really don't work on getting up earlier, I don't know I used to be able to do it, I really don't know what the Fuck change, I think, honestly, I actually do know James and it's that there's no reason to get up early say you say get up early to high."
724.0,Provider,You scaled back on cannabis use to write. scale back.
7780.0,Patient,"yeah not not awful lot. Yes, though I have, I still smoke. When i'm. at work. Well, and every other day, but. Mainly just I do a little cheeky. Often the morning to be a little bit more prior energy. and yeah that's it, it really is like I. needed something to be able to look forward to. At the end of the day, physically. It used to be crazy. But yeah. I don't know. He says what it felt like I needed, I know that that's probably not what I literally needed, I really do want to. try and be. sober sober and see what happens."
724.0,Provider,Well you're trying to go 100% abstinence on. Everything.
7780.0,Patient,"I mean the only two substances, I use is. Alcohol and we. don't consider it to be like that."
724.0,Provider,"You can always start by scaling you know, like. always going like trying to be 100% kind of just sit like the expectation once a while. is often disappointing, you know you just set yourself up for failure, when you try to go from one extreme to the other, so if you set like an interim goal of just being like if you smoke weed at work, how many times do so, we don't work technically."
7780.0,Patient,Probably three times a day so like probably once every two or three hours.
724.0,Provider,"And I know that you said it, you said that it does kind of improve your quality of work when you're there so maybe. You know, maybe scaled down to twice, while you're at work, you know set a goal. achievable like what an issue welcome be like I could do it twice what you do when you first get there and then, when you before you leave or. You know, or you do that, you know, like your mid day and, at the end of your day but. You tried doing that and opposed to being like yes like six months down the road I don't want to be doing any of this stuff. Because that that will eventually lead to the to the desired long term outcome, but in the interim, you know, I would just be like hey maybe instead of three times I do it twice and then you decide. What two times you want to do it, whether or not you're like I can literally get to work, you know kill time for two hours of that I could you know get to my routine or you know it's up for you to decide. And so, you should apply like a lot of like like you have like one big long term goal or a couple big long term goals with that have like. The inner have a short term goals and those ones tend to be more important because those wants to be able to achieve in a. shorter timeframe, so that you'll feel you know powered up and inspired to keep going, you know if all you had was like crazy long term goals and. Nothing for like the halfway point you know a lot of people get discouraged and you know tend to give up is too difficult there's no instead of right so."
7780.0,Patient,"Just junk it and just john. I don't get what people do when they get home from work. Smoke weed, to the point of annihilation."
724.0,Provider,"Other people have. come home to cook dinner or take their dog out or get ready for school work. know some kind of responsibility, like like if you don't have anything that that holds you accountable and when you first get all that obviously you're going to fill that like fill that gap, but."
7780.0,Patient,"suboxone walks your pain. Like it blocks, but I guess in the walk so I wouldn't be doing that."
724.0,Provider,gonna pay for morphine is for pain management. yeah absolutely. The built a deterrence so.
7780.0,Patient,"So it cancels out any extra so that's why like, if you take from it and it doesn't feel like anything essentially remember."
724.0,Provider,"yeah and it's. buprenorphine is, I know it's a partial Blocker and it goes. bullies yeah and not only that like it bullies the hell out of everything else, trying to come in it's a much stronger molecule so."
7780.0,Patient,it's big. yeah.
724.0,Provider,So it fills up so well.
7780.0,Patient,Is.
724.0,Provider,What.
7780.0,Patient,"I want to look at the structure. Oh, my God it's actually just a. weirdly. weirdly and tensely huge molecule wow. But it's just a bunch of carbon and hydrogen and like a couple nitric groups."
724.0,Provider,you're speaking Greek to me man.
7780.0,Patient,"that's just cool i've always thought that this was. I wish that there was a YouTube channel out there, that would do 3D like modeling of how drug how drugs actually. click into the brain and not just like fucking street drugs not like one of those kids in high school who's all obsessed with pharmacology because he thinks that axes are fun."
724.0,Provider,i'm sure there is I bet you probably find it clever enough.
7780.0,Patient,Chemical machination. mechanization mechanization machination. Is that a word.
724.0,Provider,yep.
7780.0,Patient,You know right but it's different than machination actually don't think machination is the word.
724.0,Provider,I don't think so either.
7780.0,Patient,"This is your brain on drugs. And then it shows me an actual brain using trucks love, but. This is your brain on drugs, and it was a photo of. 10 joint pain communicated to with the like the nerves in your brain sending neurotransmitters. So yeah literally it, oh no actually I guess buprenorphine is really small and in. consideration to let's see. I could have been a good camera I could I could I could be a good anything to him. codeine has a really similar structure to. suboxone you would actually probably have a hard time distinguishing them really if you'd like didn't. Like look at them closely. Actually uh they're the same exact thing. Except you could you can tell that they've added stuff on to an oxy cotton molecule almost. Sorry. Just think this stuff is fast. Because it was like a. Four or five months ago I ate my mom just like shoulder pain and so in our House in Chico, by the way, Was this an hour long appointment."
724.0,Provider,nope 30 minutes.
7780.0,Patient,"Oh, you need me sleep."
724.0,Provider,"No, no, no, but the session I came in after you had to cancel so I was like I can let this one run over."
7780.0,Patient,"um I remember last time I did find it in I ended up taking like 710 milligrams so 70 milligrams to feel. Even the little bit high because it was I was like having to fucking. just throw bike it in at essentially buprenorphine in my brain until the morphine was diluted enough in a Vikings mixture. right but that's The thing is that it was like I remember, specifically, knowing that that would happen, so I stopped taking I. didn't take a suboxone for one day. Two days and then. took them. And it's still it was dumb."
724.0,Provider,Then you feel good I just not really anxious and sad about sealing fuckin Viking in.
7780.0,Patient,From my mom. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah beautiful hang around for a while everybody's chemistry is different, especially if you're if you're skinny. Because it stores and lipids and your body so."
7780.0,Patient,"yeah oh so buprenorphine actually. What it does, essentially, is it fills in. The receptor the receptor so that the. system. which I think is quite funny actually."
724.0,Provider,"So I had, I had a doctor, so when I was working about that, though, I had a doctor explained to me. And I was like hey tell me like show me look like the bro science of how this is going to work and, like receptors so she drew like this little diagram on a piece of paper for me and she drew like like like a row of wine glasses right. And the COPs like this and she's like so what happens is these cups represent your natural opiate receptors in your brain and up receptors are your natural. Like Defense mechanism for pain, so it lets your body know when you're fighting off an injury or when you're just hurt sometimes you Stub your toe and it hurts, and you can feel the threshold of pain like rise and rise rise and and wash over and then subside. But if you Stub your toe and you broke your toe that paint stays right so that that's the body's indication that something is wrong. You cognitively have to decide what you're going to do with that information go to the hospital look down at your toe whatever it is so that's that so what happens when you introduce painkillers opiates you know what I mean for opiates it fills those cups up. So you don't feel the pain and anything that overflows falls down into the blood. So then, it passes the blood brain barrier and also that feels good that's where your euphoria comes over with a couple of flows that's where the euphoria comes from so bad. people get in this mindset where they're like Oh, I know I broke my leg, but now i'm on paid beds, I guess, I can go for that for K Rod, that I was one of the do. You know because I can't feel anything so that they do that, but the brain still knows consciously that you have an injury, so what happens. It produces war opiate receptors, which is why you have to take more to achieve the same desired effect that you did the first time you took it. So, to get high now you're going to take three pills, instead of the two right and you do it again, so the brains like though more receptors because you keep taking these pills and you're still getting guy and then you're like oh. I can take more pills because that's your tolerance is going up. So, then, the receptors have they have to match that and then eventually you get to a point to where you blow out your receptors they're maxed out. You hit a ceiling and you can't go any further that way, no matter how much intake you do with opiates you don't get high anymore you just not getting sick. And they're getting sick part is when your wrist up there start to die off because they want to die off they want to go back down to a baseline. Because you should be walking around with so many pain receptors which is everything hurts water pressure hurts my shower you Stub your toe it feels like it's the end of the world, because you have too many receptors now everything hurts it shouldn't be like that. So they got they have to. They have to die off and that's why you stick, because the body's like I don't want to feel like this, I need more and that's why. methadone or buprenorphine will keep people here like maxed out at their ceiling there's no change but there's no you for your anymore either you're just not getting sick so when people taper off, and I do like a controlled descent on the medication, the idea of."
7780.0,Patient,Their style they.
724.0,Provider,"have very little, so I always use my hands, so they could look like water levels right so here's your receptors your backs here's the view for our feet you're maxed out you're good. Right, so when you decrease the the dosage. You want to do it in such a way, where it's just dropped slightly, and then the this layer will die off that I will meet up with your current ios and you'll feel pretty good. drop it down a little bit dies off and eventually you get down back to baseline you never want to be like i'm gonna do half my dose because now from here to here. you're going to feel like straight shit for however long it takes your body to get down to here, whereas if you do it slowly over time. You know the symptoms are manageable it's not like you're going to get up up you might have like an upset stomach first thing in the morning but it's not interfering with your ability to. perform daily tasks it's like I stop you from going to work it's not going to stop you from having meaningful relationships you're just like operating at 95% instead of 100% like most people are right. And it was a time. You get back to normal. On a chemistry level right. So that was the bro science that's how it was explained to me."
7780.0,Patient,explained it to me also yeah like. that's how I. that's how I get it you.
724.0,Provider,know I think of wine glasses and I just think of water levels decreasing over time to get back to a baseline. And I think it's too late playing video games like HALO you got like an over shield for a while and that gets depleted and that's kind of like what your natural Defense system is it's your opiate receptors.
7780.0,Patient,"Honestly, putting it in terms of video games I find to be conscious. And hurtful."
724.0,Provider,"that's how I see it, i'm not a smart guy so like."
7780.0,Patient,"I know, no I get it. yeah my dad always some. cuz he knows I like video games and he knows I like math and so he always explain stuff to me in terms of video games i'm like. You can just tell me. Like our. I don't need the medium of video game to give it."
724.0,Provider,"Maybe maybe that's how he sees it, though."
7780.0,Patient,yeah no he's.
724.0,Provider,herself yeah.
7780.0,Patient,"Well he's so i'll be playing a video game sometimes and he'll still come up and be like so are those actual other people playing with you, or is that, like a computer and i'm like. You know betting on the game. Whether or not it."
724.0,Provider,People.
7780.0,Patient,"Have you ever I have, I have two things to talk about real quick before release Have you ever watched the TV show the expanse."
724.0,Provider,"i've seen like clips of it, but no, I never liked committed to watching it."
7780.0,Patient,You should watch it.
724.0,Provider,Experience what's it about it's like space colony or something like that or.
7780.0,Patient,"it's a SCI fi space it's space SCI fi sort of drama thriller not so much drama more like. I would honestly say it's it's more like cuz so it takes place in the distant future, when you know earth colonized MARS and then Mars became its own. place. And broke away from earth and so now there's the earth and it's you and it's the United Nations and then there's the MARS Republic communism. and it's just funny that they are so clearly meant to be Communist. Because they're they're all like dream of the single dream of green MARS and it's like I feel like they wouldn't become Communist. But the world building is incredible because not only is it earth and Mars You then have the belters which are this group, this faction called the oh PA which I actually don't know what it stands for, but they speak in all the belters they speak in. what's that they speak like a who's the guy from the Green mile."
724.0,Provider,Like creel.
7780.0,Patient,yeah but you know the green mile.
724.0,Provider,yeah who the. Back on eggs or Tom Hanks you know Tom Hanks a son. patois yeah.
7780.0,Patient,"I speaking like this man. yeah they don't. They don't seal. yeah they don't speak like that, but they they've adapted the this patois so there'll be like a better for me not whining boss man. yeah they have this like very cool fuckin accent."
724.0,Provider,Your.
7780.0,Patient,"dad yeah um. But the belters they grew up so they're like it's multiple generations in and so it'll be like a your seventh generation on the series space station. Meaning that you've never experienced even the hint of gravity. And so you live fine and zero gravity except eventually right if you if we were born in zero gravity our bones would become super long we wouldn't be able to pump blood around, and so they have to do simulated gravity, you know by spinning or whatever. But they wouldn't survive on earth, so they can't go to. earth or Mars, without taking this like hyper oxygenated blood. That they like inject into themselves it's really cool. But the first scene of it is fucking dope because you get to see a little bit of more extreme version of this sort of the belters being disliked alien species now almost like involved. In their setting to no longer be compatible with earth, and so they have a completely different history and culture. So you can imagine, first is earth like Earth is America Mars very much. The Eastern countries, probably a bit more like China that more powerful than us a bit more like put together and organized. And then you have the belters which are like the terrorist faction groups but they're not actually you know terror it's so fucking good and then on top of all of this there's like an alien proto molecule that is. You know. remnants of an alien species from years ago and was wiped out, and all this crazy shit it just gets so good. Okay, and then."
724.0,Provider,you're selling it. yeah I watch it.
7780.0,Patient,"You should you should definitely watch i'd say i'm honestly I was kind of captivated from the first episode and just because of how well they built the world out immediately, but um. I would say, get through getting get into the meat of the first season. story so like probably two three episodes in after they're done sort of introducing the characters and you start to get a feel for the. This like really complex world it's just dope and it looks cool too they don't they don't like they don't shy away from the cgi space station and building the sets for these cool fucking like underground space mining colonies and. All of their physics is cool and correct and."
724.0,Provider,let's go some legit i'm looking at it right now on on imdb it's got some legit actors in it.
7780.0,Patient,"yeah Stephen straight, the main actor. I think I. I think I would murder somebody to be in love with him."
724.0,Provider,yeah my watch and what channels it on.
7780.0,Patient,Amazon prime.
724.0,Provider,Amazon prime prime produce it.
7780.0,Patient,"Yes, produce all of it, but I think it's now. Before I am saying. Okay it's called a prime original but I hadn't heard of it until like last year, when there was already four seasons, which is dope because there's like six seasons or five seasons and they're producing the fifth season now, so it comes out like every Friday. Very good, show."
724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah i'll check it out, I need like something like nighttime you know, like like background like stuff that I could just. Somewhat casually watch like and still be like managing my kids and stuff so."
7780.0,Patient,"i'd say this is maybe not the you might have you might have our time just because you want to watch the TV show so bad, you would actually start."
724.0,Provider,Collecting my kids.
7780.0,Patient,yeah actively forming. resent towards your children for. Better taking you away. um.
724.0,Provider,yeah i'll give it a shot.
7780.0,Patient,"The other thing I was gonna say is that it's weird because create them hits on a new opioid receptor which is like not an actual receptor. or no, I guess, it is the primary targets of strong opioids in the brain, because I was, I always was told that create them worked differently than how I can does, but it still gets blocked by suboxone."
724.0,Provider,"interesting. Alright, so you've already scheduled the appointment with me i'm. going to go over your your talk screen from this this past month positive for buprenorphine and. fences that's your prescription so that's good it's got thc in there, too, but we don't really care about. Your surveys you're pretty active on though so you're good their PhD nine you got moderate to severe so little pleasure feeling down eating less. All scored pretty high so is that just stressing from. day to day activities or."
7780.0,Patient,"yeah. I just feel quite a bit of anxiety throughout my whole day. It feels bad it the anxiety and it's a very physical anxiety, so what I take now is I take my Ritalin and my to my daffodil which I don't know if I told you this, but I was taking half of one. What I meant to take 200 milligrams I was taking 50 because I was worried about its interaction with the riddle and making me to wired. And it was making me feel anxious. Every it whenever I took 59 PM so it's like Oh well, I definite must not work, but then I was like maybe tried 200 your actual dose. To see if it's actually the two little that's causing you anxiety and it was so once I sort of taking 200 milligrams a day felt better felt awake I would still want to switch back to finance because. it's basically doing. A worse job of five amps."
724.0,Provider,Like.
7780.0,Patient,"I don't know it has been nice to be able to wake up and come over here and turn my alarm off and like really quickly take my modafinil and then go back to like and then, when I got back and sleep, I only like sleep on my leg i'll set up almost and then fall asleep again."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
7780.0,Patient,"And I can make it a little sooner. And then I take a one milligram klonopin my cymbalta which I still have been only taking half of the normal dose because. One once I stopped taking the full dose might sleep wasn't so bad like I definitely felt a better sleep after that. And I take a panel, all in the morning, which is anxiety fights the physical feeling of anxiety, but most useful thing is when i'm feeling anxiety is actually how I know it's time to take us so. Okay, so."
724.0,Provider,So you wonder if the suboxone is like one of the main contributors to your anxiety. As far as physical symptoms go.
7780.0,Patient,or essentially yeah withdraw. It yeah cuz. I mean that's a scary drug to to and I withdraw on. suboxone like. If I took to the day previous and then I didn't take any today I would feel it tomorrow. yeah look like halfway through the day I would start realizing that I feel bad.
724.0,Provider,"I think the suboxone like it's like a 36 hour hold I think like it's good for 36 hours before withdrawals. that's what i've been told, in the past but everybody's subjective so like I don't know where that number comes up from where they just took an average from a study and determine that that's like the window of like the goldilocks zone so. It would make sense that if you missed that like that about a day and a half later, you would start to notice it so that's within the window right so give her takes off based on weight, you know age and disposition. All right, well sounds like a plan so i'll see you I gotta go to group next Tuesday."
7780.0,Patient,yeah I started i'm planning I started to plan on going every week because. Every other week I felt like I was just I would just for cake just kept forgetting. Okay yeah I also feel better after group so.
724.0,Provider,Good yeah I mean that that's that's part of the plan to so yeah I mean you can always go with as many as you want and don't feel like you're you you're obligated to only do the two So if you feel like you need more disco all right.
7780.0,Patient,um and then next time.
724.0,Provider,Next time we'll do the school thing.
7780.0,Patient,yeah so school stuff and. yeah I think that's it we'll figure it out.
724.0,Provider,"All right, yeah so yeah if you can to start working on a budget. that'd be somewhat of an easy easy thing to address and then after that says practice with."
7780.0,Patient,You do you have an APP for your budget or do you budget on an excel sheet or in your head. yeah I like to write stuff out so.
724.0,Provider,"i've written it out and then like now I just manage it. Because I actually. I take that back I do write stuff out I get a calendar upstairs and I write down when all the bills are due, and then I check boxes off as i'm paying and so like i'm like a I do have a reminder, I take that book so."
7780.0,Patient,Maybe I should do that.
724.0,Provider,"I preach it all the time and it probably gets old hearing it but we're task orientated and we'd like to check boxes that we saw him and a lot of people that i've talked to in the past, like that's. there's what little reward that I get every time I checked the box off at all like shit I can't do it, I just spent all that money in that building and it's like well, please, I get the check the box i'm not going to stress about it now it's paid for so. that's pretty much how I keep track of it now, at this point."
7780.0,Patient,i'd also like to figure out ways to potentially help me get up earlier.
724.0,Provider,"We can have something to look forward to you know, like if you're just getting up just to get up like it's hard to convince the mind. To do that stuff is it's like what am I going to do so, I get up early and then what so you got to start having that follow up response so like I get up and I do this X y&z Somalia motivated to get it done."
7780.0,Patient,it's true yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Getting up just to get up early is like Okay, so now that about where's where's the reward for overcoming a task that didn't necessarily want to do so. it's going to have a payoff."
7780.0,Patient,"Right. All right, thank you very much. nice to see you again."
724.0,Provider,"yeah likewise all right i'll catch you next week. Great. For transcription That was a session with chase wells we we allowed to go over my follow up appointment had to cancel due to. Some logistics issues that not important. We reviewed his labs one for 2022 positive for before dollar fee, and it bezos bolter prescribed to him reviewed his PhD at 915 and it's got seven of the five we discuss what the what the triggering. effects were to. Equal those scores. he's just he's got a. ongoing battle health concerns anxiety depression pretty standard that he's managing through medication so he's pretty much on top of that, so we'll just continue to monitor that as needed. He stressed about money, so I acquired or indicated, like the development budget so we can potentially add that to his treatment plan so we can address some of that long term. Other than that, nothing else for transcription he has followed the appointments for the rest of the month, thank you."
