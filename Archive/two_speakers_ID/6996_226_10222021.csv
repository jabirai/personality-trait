226.0,Provider,"Sorry, I was on mute."
6996.0,Patient,How are you good.
226.0,Provider,How are you doing today.
6996.0,Patient,Not too bad.
226.0,Provider,yeah How has it been since we spoke last.
6996.0,Patient,"Well, this past weekend. was when my daughter, and my brother came up so that was the first time we've had company here, since we moved. yeah so um. You know, it was stressful beforehand, because I wanted to get more done as far as you know, cleaning up the House moving boxes out of the way and all that but. Then you know we just kind of had to say whatever we can get done before they get here is fine, you know their family they're not going to care. So it turned out, being a pretty good weekend we didn't have the spare bedrooms cleared. But my brother got a hotel room and. Our daughter slept on the couch. So we had some you know went out for a couple meals, and you know hung around the House I. heard a little bit and. So I think that became you know, looking at what we were talking about last time, I think it was a present moment, where I was you know thankful that we had that time with them. For things went pretty well I didn't really have to worry about what we didn't get done. um so I guess I could say that was an accomplishment for the period."
226.0,Provider,"yeah How was it, how was your daughter, how did that go."
6996.0,Patient,"and leave for the most part, it was great um she and my husband had a little bit of conflict, but it quickly got smoothed over and. They both just have to realize. That they're both strong headed and. You know if they disagree on. Something it's okay. And, but she and I got along great we went to the outlet mall and did a little shopping and it was her birthday. So yeah we got along really well."
226.0,Provider,and remind me where she lives.
6996.0,Patient,"She lives in simi Valley, right now, did you say what she does."
226.0,Provider,where she lives.
6996.0,Patient,yeah i'm in simi so she's back in ventura county where we came from.
226.0,Provider,"And she seems to be doing, while she's cleaning she's able she's."
6996.0,Patient,yeah she's working as many hours as she can. With her you know certified nursing assistant jobs. she's actually working a lot. And he comes home he sleeps goes to her next job so she's yeah she's tiring up and.
226.0,Provider,So she has two jobs.
6996.0,Patient,"She works for actually three different facilities at the moment, and she has various shifts with each one. wow yeah either Congress care facilities or she's now working at an eating disorder clinic. which she really likes."
226.0,Provider,wow.
6996.0,Patient,They have two facilities ones for teenage girls and ones for adult women and she has a couple of shifts city.
226.0,Provider,"wow Okay, good for her. same disease good to get things going on. Okay, great. So what would be helpful to discuss today, what do you think it."
6996.0,Patient,"um. I guess it's still just the point of me finding anytime you do something for myself. And I guess to me i'm thinking it's not. That important I mean, as far as i'm Okay, so if I have some time to sit and relax and watch TV with Tom or whatever i'm doing but. I guess I don't see the need to like take up a hobby or do something takes up a lot of time, right now, because I have many other things."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. But do. You know. Is that true, though, like, do you not have time to take up a hobby or to do something that you really enjoy doing."
6996.0,Patient,I suppose I could make time but maybe I don't want to right now.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's talk about that let's talk about why you don't want to."
6996.0,Patient,"i'm just there are so many little things to take care of. Some of them are medical to with tom's health, some of them are my lingering issues with medical getting transferred. And then there's you know financial there's job issues that I really need to concentrate on finding a work from home job. there's every time I look at the paperwork it's like, how do we, you know acquire all this paperwork or something needs to be finished. So I i'm still feeling very overwhelmed I just I guess I figure. I can't add anything to the mix."
226.0,Provider,"So I like carving out time for yourself isn't really you don't want it to feel like it's just one added thing to do. The carving out time for yourself means like Okay, I get to decompress from the day. So it can it can just be like 15 minutes before you go to bed if you're still doing something for yourself that's okay doesn't mean that you have to take an entire day or half a day to go and do something. You do what you can do you do what actually fits into your schedule. And you do have a lot going on, you know me, you know with with your husband and his health and. You know you guys just moved there, and you know it takes time to get settled to get established to get organized all that stuff so. You know, looking at it as okay well. i'll spend the day doing what I need to do, but as long as I carve out 15 minutes at the end of the day for myself that still considered self care you're still giving yourself that time that you need. So that could mean you know and self care is kind of like it, you know it could mean just making a cup of tea. Before you go to bed, it could just be taking a shower. Before you go to bed, it could be. Buying some new lotion and using that before you go to bed whatever you know, throwing stuff out there. It can be now listening to a guided meditation. You know anything that really rejuvenates you. in a positive way. makes you feel really good it could just be doing some breathing exercises, it could be stretching. yeah so like what yeah so we don't want to make it complicated and we don't want to make it this big huge ordeal, because your time is limited, right you're busy you're really busy. And sometimes it's better to stay busy. yeah that's right."
6996.0,Patient,"yeah I agree with that, because i'm if I a lot of times, if I am just. What you know Tom and I might consider relaxing then my mind is open to think of all the things I should be doing or need to do and. Well yeah so either keep busy or do something that I can concentrate on."
226.0,Provider,"So maybe looking at it as like Okay, you get a lot done during the day, and your reward is that 15 minutes at the end of the day. when everything is completed so you've completed those tasks, or you started those tasks and then you can move on to those tasks mark. Okay, because the idea is not to be thinking about oh my God I gotta do justice this next you know, like I can't even take 15 minutes to do this that's by fact the end of the day when you've completed what you needed to complete Okay, so you don't feel guilty."
6996.0,Patient,"yeah and again, unfortunately I don't complete. That I can help to each thing."
226.0,Provider,Like what's the biggest thing. That you want to complete right now.
6996.0,Patient,i'm. Getting our health insurance squared away and. Finding a part time job.
226.0,Provider,So the first thing in order how I will do that is get your insurance completed that get that all squared away then starts then start finding a part time job. So prioritizing it.
6996.0,Patient,Because once you start you both at once.
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's difficult once you start a part time job it's difficult to keep going, you know, like because the thing with the insurance is like you're going to have to be on the phone for sometimes an hour, maybe longer at a time that's. Now lydia bit of. Unfortunately, you know even maybe longer so you have to be able to carve out let's say half of the day, like say, from nine to 12 nine to one. And then do everything in between that you need to do to help your husband. So you have those little interruptions So if you can take take a slice of time to not have as many interruptions that's when you want to try and tackle that the insurance needs to be done first. You get that squared away, then you start applying to jobs and focusing on that to prioritize in order of what needs to happen."
6996.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,"mm hmm so that's What I would really like focus on and work on is just that insurance getting that done, are you have you made any headway with it."
6996.0,Patient,"Yes, and. Actually right now being that it's heading towards the end of October November 1 was the date that they said. It would officially transfer from ventura county to to laurie so I don't have that long to wait. So yeah the, the issue has been that I needed to see a doctor up here and I couldn't do that because it hadn't transferred yet. At this point, i'm just pretty much like okay i'll wait to see Dr. So."
226.0,Provider,"You got about a week, like a little over a week."
6996.0,Patient,"yeah and, but they do still I do still need to get in touch with the people who sign you up with one of the medical. Health groups so yeah I do still need to get on them about you know Okay, we need to do that. yeah there are there are still phone calls to me."
226.0,Provider,Okay Where are you right now.
6996.0,Patient,we're into laurie.
226.0,Provider,I bet are you at home.
6996.0,Patient,Oh yes.
226.0,Provider,Okay yeah okay um. Are you feeling overwhelmed.
6996.0,Patient,yeah. And part of it has to do with. yeah tom's health things to we. were not real happy with his new cardiologist here so. we've decided we really need to get Ahold of his cardiologist in ventura and see if he had said he would be willing to have a phone conversation with new doctor. And we think that's necessary because there's just too many conflicting ideas and we don't know why the new doctor saying what he's saying. So yeah I think that probably is something I should concentrate on as well with medical stuff.
226.0,Provider,"alright. So do you feel like you kind of feel organized you feel like you've got things prioritized me know what you need to do like you know what your next, the next step, like you know, like in terms of like prioritizing everything."
6996.0,Patient,"I think, so I think we need to call the guy inventor and. You know, see if he can have a phone or zoom or whatever you know whether he wants us to be there, or not. With the new doctor up here."
226.0,Provider,"I gotcha perfect. Alright, then, what do you have planned for the weekend, what are you going to be doing."
6996.0,Patient,Not much of anything.
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah I.
6996.0,Patient,"guess there's some kind of car races going on in bakersfield, which is about an hour south of us. But kind of interested in, but then again it's a long drive and we've we probably won't end up going. But yeah based on how we're both feeling physically we're probably just not going to do."
226.0,Provider,"Are you are, you still liking what you know happy with the move that you made and ventura county up there."
6996.0,Patient,somewhere. I have never been like totally sold on it.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
6996.0,Patient,"it's been harder for me. My husband never really minded moving further away from relatives, but I was really didn't want to, but. You know price wise we ended up deciding on this area. So it's still kind of hard for me, sometimes I enjoy the more rural you know atmosphere that then, if I want to run over to store for something like oh I gotta go all the way over here. So i'm still you know, working on that."
226.0,Provider,yeah it's just it's an adjustment yeah. yeah moving moving it's not easy it's highly stressful and. Even when you're all moved in it still. You know there's always that there's always stepped it. takes a while.
6996.0,Patient,"yeah i'm in group yesterday or Wednesday, I noticed a lot of people have moved recently, and you know they were talking about how. You know how it is affecting them and um yeah so I could relate to that."
226.0,Provider,yeah it's one of the most stressful things you can do that. changing job. So the two like really stressful things.
6996.0,Patient,"And, most of our marriage i've worked full time as well. And the past five years, you know, since Tom had his heart attack I is the longest period i've ever been. out of work. it's really weird for me, as well as now, if you know it requires more of an explanation on a resume or when I talked to an employer."
226.0,Provider,yeah well that's also an adjustment to when you're used to working full time and then all of a sudden you're not oh my gosh yeah.
6996.0,Patient,"Even when our daughter was growing up, it always worked and. You know, it just worked into our plans, find it, you know I figured soccer practice and. going on and we were just on the go alive."
226.0,Provider,remind me what you did.
6996.0,Patient,"and marketing indications. yeah all kinds of different office work, depending on whether I was doing a temp assignment or it was a full time job."
226.0,Provider,"yeah that's hard to do yeah everything kind of comes to a slow down takes time to get used to that. All right, well just you know just keep. Keep it simple you know and i'm saying I just like I said prioritize those bigger things and. You need to take breaks take a break, and then you go back to it, but you know it'll get done."
6996.0,Patient,"I hope so, had I guess that's one of the worries is no I keep not necessarily procrastinating but either procrastinating or just like taking more breaks and not getting it done. yeah is it gonna be okay."
226.0,Provider,yeah you'll get it done.
6996.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,"Just keeps chipping away, you know. one foot in. front of the other, you know stay committed to it, you know it's the thing you gotta stay committed. Okay, so should we have friday's work for you is that correct. Yes, okay so like 1230 ish."
