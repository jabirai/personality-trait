9395.0,Patient,what's that.
214.0,Provider,One shield our last. Word gone.
9395.0,Patient,"Real good. So, like that's all i'm doing last week or two."
214.0,Provider,Totally totally good um. So I look at grn and for some tobacco obviously you got to do one for October let's just go over the marijuana again this isn't a medical card right.
9395.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and. And you're you're utilizing it because it helps you with what."
9395.0,Patient,sleep occasionally. that's. pretty much it.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, just wanted to make that note, so this is good that's perfect. um let's take a look at those surveys and see if they tell us anything. So, in your last survey probably mid September i'm assuming, let me not assume that, let me just get the right date yeah So this was done on September 30 to this part is the anxiety and depression and it says in the depression point zero is that an accurate statement."
9395.0,Patient,Zero what i'm sorry.
214.0,Provider,You have no depression.
9395.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. there's you know if I. have something going on, or something that's not happy i'm not happy about it, but I mean I don't dwell on or sit around and get all. i'll know obsessive or. Let it affect me to where I just can't go on about my normal life."
214.0,Provider,"And then, when I look at the anxiety score itself for do you feel you have some anxiety."
9395.0,Patient,"yeah. Lately, I there's been a lot going on with my grown children. and Especially last month, was one of my oldest daughter's birthday and my granddaughters birthday also right after that so. So yeah last month, I was feeling a little bit. anxious about things with them because they're not. Know what's going on with them, but they're not talking to my mom who. has always been basically their go to. or me or anyone and it's just been. Unlike what our whole lives and relationships have been like with each other."
214.0,Provider,Correct So what did they just like all of a sudden disconnect from family or.
9395.0,Patient,"People of interest yeah pretty much it's. she's. put this. there's a lot of background to my oldest daughter and. she's got a great heart, but when she's. about the time she started becoming an adult basically. She got real different with everyone real mean real bossy real, of course, no one can give her advice or we're telling her what to do, or you know and it just went from there, I don't I don't know how else to describe it that's. The way I see it, it started with that and just kind of went from that to where that got to. bickering back and forth, or like my mom and her would even getting you know full on arguments about some of the silliest things. And she's my daughter is a drama Queen, to sum it up the best I can. And she always has been, you know she's the firstborn she was a daddy's girl, she was spoiled her whole life, I mean. Her first birthday her first birthday present was an actual carousel horse, I mean a full size would carve you know carousel horse so that's give you an idea of how spoiled she's done her whole life."
214.0,Provider,"So. What do you. Think, do you think that there's something that you can do to help this process out because you don't know what it is right."
9395.0,Patient,"Down she I mean I. i'm here for both of them, I mean they both know that that's, all I can do is put out there, but she's essentially anyone that's on the side that's not hers she's against them to Moscow and so dramatically so that it's like Okay, all of a sudden we're all basically dead to her. and her daughter, my first grandchild this the grandchild that had the birthday and we haven't seen her either and that's where it's really getting ridiculous because she was never raised in any way around anything like that to keep the child out of spite. away from your family in. And it's. You know upsetting for me, of course, but. I mean I expected it i'm surprised, she didn't rebel and get really. crazy, I guess, for lack of a better terminology earlier because she really didn't she was good, all the way up you know her whole school all her life, she was like. a really good student a really good person or really. Just good person and then. it's like because she I mean you know breaking down basically she was so spoiled and so always given into and given her way that you know when she got to be an adult and start living in the real world and with the child at that. she's realizing real quick that everyone's not going to give her her way. or I just agree with what she said, has you know so and I get that but for my mom it's like how could she possibly do this to me. By, and that is what adds the more anxiety to me because my mother. has had a heart attack in the past it's been a while I mean she's doing good from it's you know but it's been like two years, I mean actually so she's good but she's still. As take the whatever the night true things are nitroglycerin yeah and she still has she's got exercise, and you know watch her heart rate and cholesterol she's got this whole regimen basically. And then, on top of that right when this stuff started getting bad she found out that she was diabetic so she's there's a whole change of lifestyle for her to try to adapt to now on top of. Her you know her baby grandchild which is her baby girl to all the sudden being able to do this at all be capable of being like this toward her in any way. And she just don't you know it's like I I look at all and i'm like well yeah it's it's my fault it's your fault, we spoiled or."
214.0,Provider,You.
9395.0,Patient,Know hindsight 2020 but.
214.0,Provider,"Sure, for sure."
9395.0,Patient,"My mom doesn't that's naive, I thought in her mind it's just the how could this possibly be done to me and I, you know I get that because my oldest daughter, and my mother, have always been very close. So for. Her to be able to just kind of cut her off like. she's No one. wow my mom doesn't know what to do with that and it's. right on her."
214.0,Provider,shoulders very difficult yeah. So um how's the medications working up the view visit laughing all day is it causing any withdrawals.
9395.0,Patient,"No, no stone good and the. Work is always good to you know. keeps my mind focused on something and. keeps me from. It all sitting around and thinking too much."
214.0,Provider,So much sure can imagine.
9395.0,Patient,"And i'm you know, not an idle hands kind of person anyways like. Certain like I come home at night after work get my shower whatever eat then i'm ready to take things slow. My other than that I pretty much um let's go i'm ready to get something done, you know. daylight hours are wasting whether it's taking care of my house or spending time with my son that's still here my teenage son that still comes over whatever it is, you know i'm ready to go."
214.0,Provider,that's awesome that's awesome i'm glad i'm very glad to hear that I mean I think everything's going good it looks like the only thing that we gotta worry about is the October urine.
