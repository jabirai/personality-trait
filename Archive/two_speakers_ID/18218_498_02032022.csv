498.0,Provider,"Okay okay. Are you able to control when they occur when they do occur, you able to distract yourself away from the more stop them somehow. yeah okay okay. and you've mentioned that school is in session now. And you feel like it's a kind. More related to your obligation to school is there anything that stops you from. Having the thoughts before they occur."
18218.0,Patient,"Having the thoughts before Oh, I see prevents effects from happening. I guess I wouldn't know because, if I don't have the thoughts that I don't. I am trying to be more positive in general that's what you mean I don't know."
498.0,Provider,"The question didn't wasn't clear. When when, let me ask this question, as a follow up. Is there anything specifically about school or the obligation to school or the change in environment that causes the thought to occur."
18218.0,Patient,"yeah so. I feel like my ability to perform well in school is. is lacking, so, and that is that yeah if I were to fail, out of school or not do well, it would be a bad thing we really bad."
498.0,Provider,thing. Oh therapist Christina.
18218.0,Patient,"I have a therapist I don't really know she really helps that much she's not she's not with you guys. Okay she's outside of you, but the thing is, is that because of my thoughts are kind of so severe and I know that. I would only be allowed to see a therapist every other week and I would not be available for group therapy, because I, because of my school schedule. I kind of feel like I want to see someone every week and she's letting me see her twice a week, right now, so kind of even though she's not helpful she is, I feel like I need more. yeah."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, do you feel comfortable. Discussing the thoughts me a current other thoughts with your existing therapist outside."
18218.0,Patient,"um I do, but she doesn't ever asked about them like a. yeah we don't ever talk about it i've brought it up, but we don't talk about it ever I don't know why she never asks."
498.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, do you feel comfortable, bringing it up in session."
18218.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,"I think that that's a good, I think it will be a good a good subject of context or in therapy and just because it seems to at one point. When school was out during the break and you had kind of a handle on it. And the truth is, is that there's always going to be something that requires your attention, whether it's school when school is over, with and you've tried to you between that goal that although the The next thing you know, a job or project or something. So exploring you know its origin in alternatives is is worth you know the invest money."
18218.0,Patient,yeah yeah that occurred to me recently there's always going to be something yeah.
498.0,Provider,yeah and. Have you ever tried to have it on personally.
18218.0,Patient,"So does that sound so familiar, is that a sleeping pill it."
498.0,Provider,"Well it's primarily used for sleep is actually antidepressant that's used off label for sleep, because it works so well."
18218.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, I think I had tried it a psychiatrist I prescribed it years ago and I remember, for me it didn't feel like it was helping me sleep and then I would feel really tired in the morning."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so don't you know. And, of course, Dom it does cause like a. You know petite feeling overall. Have you ever tried hydroxyl or sleep. You know. In a histamine. Okay okay so and it's something that's prescribed for sleep them commonly called visceral and if you've had any. History with benadryl it works, a lot of like a lot like benadryl it's a five ht agonist so is an Anti histamine that's the to use in combination with other medications. And it's also good for periodic anxiety and so it may be something that we could implement, along with the wellbutrin in order to improve on sleep and again have the added benefit of of eating with anxiety as well. How do you feel about that."
18218.0,Patient,"um. yeah I have mixed feelings, because I I kind of teeter totter between well right now I don't i'm not suffering from so much anxiety actually but um. I almost feel like I need them out more anxiety just to go through school I don't know I feel like my level of anxiety right now is okay so would it would it make me more tired than or not yeah I wouldn't be more tired."
498.0,Provider,"will say that some some people who use drugs have been some do not complain i'm so like when they take it a sleep sleep is improved, but then they do have that prolonged filling up the tea, so it, you know it could be related to those you could take as little as 1015 milligrams. Take as much as about 50 it depends on where the perfect spaces for you, and if it's not something that you feel like. is getting you to like that sweet spot of improve sleep, and you know manageable anxiety, but you like other wellbutrin provide you with the energy. Then you know we get paper it down doesn't require any long table you could use it, you know when needed, or you could refrain from now and try something like melatonin instead over the counter."
18218.0,Patient,"melatonin for some reason gives me nightmares and it's it hasn't really worked for me. and I mean, maybe I could try it the hydroxyl scene. And and just try like a very low dose of it because it's not. Hard hard hard it's not super hard to fall back asleep but it's just not like it was before, so I could try low dose and."
498.0,Provider,"let's do that and implement a beer, the low dose and you could give it give it a try on Friday night, so you don't have to worry about school, the next day. Depending on how you feel Saturday morning that can be the determinant of. How you like to proceed with it and just follow up with me, and let me know okay. Okay okay we've. We talked about 980 and in times of and. In in times of need, where you feel like the thoughts about self harm ruminate and you just like to talk it out, even if it's in the wee hours of the morning. refresh my memory about your immediate resources available to you."
18218.0,Patient,"When I feel suicidal. and I haven't felt strongly enough about it, to make a phone call to anybody, but I I could call my friend my best friend, but I can't call her when she's working. I would just call the suicide hotline or nine eight can call me."
498.0,Provider,"just want to make sure that you know it's wonderful that and there's some level of control there, but in the event that the adult continues to ruminate absolutely do not referring or have a second thought about picking up the phone okay."
18218.0,Patient,mm hmm this is 90 day a suicide hotline or what is it exactly.
498.0,Provider,"Well it's actually a mental health hotline. So you can. Even if it's not just mental health if you just want to talk, you can talk. mm hmm does, that is fine as well, that if you just wanted, you know get thoughts out of your head, whatever they are."
18218.0,Patient,"it's Nice, and I remember you bringing that up or someone bringing that up but I i've actually never called that number, so we will write that down."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, good, very good, and so we talked about plans to continue. We refilled your wellbutrin a few days ago, so you're good with the quantity for that right now. will incorporate the hydroxyl team again, you can take it about an hour before you interested in sleep to our trial Friday night and determine from there and informed me of the outcomes and then you can follow up with me. In the next group that you're able to attend you, you have one group assignment a month Is that correct."
18218.0,Patient,"I don't think I can see a group at all. Actually, because."
498.0,Provider,We have the outside.
18218.0,Patient,"yeah I wish that we had individual therapy weekly, because then I would. See I would do if you guys."
498.0,Provider,"yeah let me, let me check well, but you have the outside the episode, so the frequency of your existing theory is wonderful I love the idea of twice a week therapy. And so, if if you're able to navigate to a space where you feel comfortable about you know all things you. Then that's ideal. Is it Okay, do you how do you how do you feel about if I collaborate with your therapist would that be okay, for you."
18218.0,Patient,yeah yeah. that'd be nice.
498.0,Provider,"i'm going to reach out to your therapist and and just discuss with them some plans, because if you already have a rapport with them and it'd be wonderful if you felt comfortable enough to use that space to explore however you're feeling. up or down. that's that's what the therapy is for okay. So let's do that first and then make a plan to follow up with me in four weeks, but, if at all, you need to you need me before our next appointment. i'm going to provide you with my email address okay."
18218.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,"And that way you can inform me of any updates with regards to how the hard rock scene is going, if you have any questions and i'll have a direct one to you, but I will make a plan to reach out to your therapist today. No later than tomorrow okay do. This direct contact information."

498.0,Provider,What else can I do to support you in this space.
18218.0,Patient,"And I just feel like depress lately, so I don't know if. Like every day is kind of like getting harder, so I don't know if I if it's just like something that talk therapy would help or but the or if I should increase, though I don't know the wellbutrin I don't know i'll i'll just try to. yeah I don't know to do really. savvy press."
498.0,Provider,"We can go up on the wall between you're on an introductory dose. And so we can go up. To 300 absolutely I mean clinical presentation would support it and then talk therapy is always always always a positive. Regardless of where you are in your mental health journey, so if you're receptive to increasing the wellbutrin today that's something that we could tackle during this appointment as well, and then you can we can still pursue. The collaboration with miss evers all."
18218.0,Patient,"Okay, maybe just increase it a little bit just so don't wait any like sleep disturbance."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and we typically go from 150 to 300."

498.0,Provider,yeah So how do you Where are you with regard to how you feel about the taper up.
18218.0,Patient,"The it's doubling it so kind of a lot. Would the effects also like increase like linearly like that, or would it just be kind of weird effects not increase that way. The dosage."
498.0,Provider,We should follow up i'll say that you should feel about and side effects me reemerge temporarily. But also subside fairly quickly because you're already on the medication. And so you're likely looking at a few days. of adjustment and then leveling out.
18218.0,Patient,Okay. Okay there's no way to go in between those two.
498.0,Provider,"Well, we could go up to. If you're on the Fr we could go up to 200. But the xml is in. 300. And then for 15."
18218.0,Patient,yeah but to stick with the same with the 300 then. We have.

Okay Okay, and then, if it's if the 300 is okay and it's manageable and you don't feel like it's causing any any intolerable side effects and we could continue with that, and then I can refill it at the 300 milligram tablet."
18218.0,Patient,OK.
498.0,Provider,"And then, if it's not then we could you know revert back next week to the 150 and then we'll continue doing what we're doing, but we have some space, you have you have adequate enough supply in order to. play with that a little bit to see what's going to be most immediately, effective and then we'll we'll make next up determinants from the okay."
