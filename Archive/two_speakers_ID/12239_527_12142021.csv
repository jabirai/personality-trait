527.0,Provider,"hi this is Andrea, this is an individual session for show Hannah hutcherson. Joanne an hour you run a few minutes I just got out of group so. How are you doing this week."
12239.0,Patient,"i'm fine I mean there's a lot to talk about so i'll try to. start with I guess the one that's least relative to. um so let's see me at my church, we had a date last Wednesday, it was just a kind of just you know chill day we had this random will be thing the big thing is we're just walking down. You know the town and then you know i've certainly he just says, you know hey Joe what I love you just Abu like that. that's the price by surprise because, like. I told you last time that I was feeling so. Deeper feelings for him and I was thinking Well, no, I definitely it's not just the surface level, you know I definitely would feel pretty bad if I were losing anything. So I was thinking myself like well I definitely do love my thinking by the I just don't know. Like how to say when to say kind of thing. Okay, and so the fact that he said it made a lot easier for me to say anything, because I was thinking myself like how to do it, how to do it. So. That. I did enjoy him it's him saying, and you know all the time we have it's just i'm still when we I guess he's worried about the super like you know we're still the whole like sexual stuff like that right, you know I mean. Immediately we haven't exactly had the chance. To lately to do it, but like. You know. Is he really into it or not, for the thing. I realized that like you know if he's not then it's going to work out, but he still wants to be friends yeah same with your friends, I probably still do it's just. I can't ignore the signs down all the all the past people I say, I want to be friends with it just don't thought I want to, I want to say it's by to be by. outlook on saying no to being friends it's just happens to happen so."
527.0,Provider,yeah so how has that changed the relationship any since that. Since that day or.
12239.0,Patient,It hasn't changed at X torn away I don't think we've done anything different.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12239.0,Patient,"Internally it's. Good like you know it makes me it, I guess, in a way, it says that, like he's a more intimate connection then. Because that actually is a pretty good thing yeah well but there's different thing as in beforehand at this didn't work out probably a good chance you weren't going to really you know hangouts each other again. i'm not saying that we're guaranteed to see each other still accurate it doesn't work out but it's one of those things where I think. We probably will, and one thing you know that, like about him is that he's a toxic personal relationship right so. yeah because he exhibits healthy aspects and that there's a good chance that we can also just be further than the workout."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12239.0,Patient,"The thing, though, is that, like he did say that even if, like the whole such as doesn't work out, I mean he still likes you don't like everything but that you know, like all like the cuddling and guessing on stuff so. He you know, he says he's you know he's thoughts sure, because he hasn't you know he doesn't want to like rush into it like you did with Virginia, with the women. he's you know, he says he stood up well cared for Alto with the exact word he used, and I know that's a big report when you use but he's he doesn't want to rush into it."
527.0,Provider,and your thoughts.
12239.0,Patient,"Are thicker that's just the multiple times I just I mean that I was fired taking it slow, I was just worried that. The longer we go at some point, I have to say, you know boy, you can along and after the sense, because I think at some point you just start interesting it's not so much that I don't want. I don't think he should take it slow it's just it's it's more like I think that he's probably really not interested in at this point i'm just. I said I was wasting my time, but then. we'll see because he did say he still wants to do it at the camping trip so."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"yeah only weren't The one thing i'm worried about that he's he's doing it because he feels like he's doing, because he has to he wants to kind of thing, so I probably should talk to him about that next time I see him."
527.0,Provider,"What are your initial thoughts or feelings from his perspective, like are you. feeling like he's. putting pressure on himself because he's thinking about you and what you need or."
12239.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's. Okay, do you have said, like he feels bad he hasn't really been doing that for the relationship. About side didn't even bring it up me he just said, it would be the carbon he kind of went to like something related to that he was like yeah I feel bad about that."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah I mean it certainly sounds like a good conversation to have Johanna as far as you know. Making sure he's you know he's doing and progressing in the in the relationship as he wants to as well, not just you know, focusing on on your needs are once or you know. Or that he can speak up about his as well, too, so that you guys can have you know, a conversation around it."
12239.0,Patient,yeah I think that's yeah that's. All I had in mind for.
527.0,Provider,Pretty big stuff.
12239.0,Patient,"Well yeah it is. i'd say that, so I. Think I said two sessions ago or something like that that one, the thing that I that was keep holding me back was like you know, like. Easy actually attracted to guy I think we're afraid to kind of like have deeper feelings for him if he's not talking to the guys just going to just you know. talking to work out at some point just time just took over it's like a it's a point you got to have some sort of connection. So you know after we talked last time I did some long thinking before the day it's like you know, like those feelings are definitely some feelings for love it's just. The difference. OK, I will say the weird thing about this one is it's not the same love i'm sorry did not the same feeling of love and I had to forget it too. Well okay that's a forward it put it, I think it stopped the same. It doesn't feel the same as the other two."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12239.0,Patient,"So the first one um you know, David that was with like. 10 months, but we were pretty much mostly over seven. That one. That one was pretty much a bunch of suppressed feelings I ventured let surface after realizing that yes, somebody can bump me and so it's like okay i'd be so. Because of that, it was. It was hard to imagine life without it, but obviously you know this didn't work out. The second one. That was because I found somebody diet really didn't think I could find the world like you know somebody that's really. very, very related to me, and a lot of ways, definitely there is a lot of differences but it's just all the people I bet that is closest i've seen by a very large margin and there's no even second place person that I would say. it's similar it's just just him and that's it. And the fact that you know, he also that we also were sexually compatible and he was also if the guys it's just. It just seemed like it was just too perfect. So. yeah it's. weird difference. yeah I understand that not all those all those are this feel the same but it's just it's weird that with the last two seeing that this one is different, I don't. I want to say with this one is problems i've met this family few times I feel like i'm more I don't want to say berbick like that I feel like I feel more. I mean, I guess. More into his life and the other two because of that. I feel like a bigger part of his life it's hard to it's hard to think about actually."
527.0,Provider,"How different is his family, then your family."
12239.0,Patient,"I don't even think it's it's really a competition that can be added a sense there's, though. similarities really I don't I don't really see. Much similarities to really talk about. Okay, even even the sibling thing they have it's just different it's something I wish I had."
527.0,Provider,"Well that's what I was wondering if that's maybe the connection, you know that's a different connection for you is that. Oh, have been. You know, a part of his family. No few times and and that feels you know it's something that you have have wanted or desired that you didn't have so it feels you know feels good or feels different."
12239.0,Patient,"yeah is a point um. Obviously, the biggest obvious glaring differences that the his parents are together by arts. will get to the actual."
527.0,Provider,And they and they've been very accepting.
12239.0,Patient,"of you and him yes. Yes, also very sure. i'm on my end that was. yeah actually yeah it could just be I feel comfortable. around them."
527.0,Provider,invalidated like him mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"that's yeah that's actually probably the one because. The second one was not reciprocated the first one wasn't explicitly but sure wise, but the first one at white couldn't feel validated."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"So this is one where I definitely am accepting that somebody can you know, like you know stuff. um. All right, I think, got seeing on the social tangent I want to talk about. So I mentioned, I had my little graduation walk. yeah."
527.0,Provider,How did that go.
12239.0,Patient,"Well, I mean the ceremony so was somewhat disappointing. But at least we have the chance to speak but ceremony was just you could tell they kind of have actually put together, there was a rehearsal names are wrong technical difficulties. He still wasn't an. hour delay. and tell us a few days until like you know, to support oh yeah y'all need to get a covert tests, if you don't have a vaccine."
527.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. Oh yes. What a mass Johannes."
12239.0,Patient,"yeah. So, but my parents were able to come so. that's the thing so. That I wouldn't have done this was before my parents well actually my family my sister also came here. Okay, but I wouldn't have done that, without. in the sense that I would have gone this moment. But they really want to see me walk. Okay, I know my dad is more important to my dad that he makes out to be basically I know we talked I you kind of made me realize this is session few months ago. My mom is this is pretty poor to her, I mean she has a thing with her for sport and size, he also technically that graduate from Davis and have a big so. Is that my sister coming was a bit of a surprise. I mean, I gave her notice she always just kind of like you know unsure."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"But she did come why I mean maybe because she got to see both. mom and dad together that's probably it really. And that's the thing right, so they both came and I was worried that they weren't going to be behaved right. Okay, I didn't tell you like, why my mom is in the picture right."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, you've shared a little bit yes."
12239.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, so they didn't really have you know great divorce or afterwards relationship where you both. I really cannot remember, I mean there are some pictures, I remember, but I can't remember in person, a moment where they both wore happy, I actually know there were a couple of other think about that right. And you know, apparently, both sat next to each other and they both were you know essentially happy the sense. Okay, you could tell that they didn't but they tried not to acknowledge the other person, but eventually they had to kind of thing. I mean, so they had different ways of thinking about it my dad he he pauses he kind of you know swallows just throw he's like Okay, I have to talk to you i've talked about my ex wife so. To say something I was like okay how about take pressure blah blah blah. I mom decided to a different route and just because it just come over drunk and. yeah and be that so that's the thing with her right now. She is alcoholic which. is unfortunate right, I mean. I can't say it's too surprising, but. Is it wasn't the last time I saw it wasn't drunk with this time she definitely was she kept kept drinking. And she brought like a flask with her. And she would walk out stuff and so um. We had some talks, you know. So the plan was know we have like a family dinner which the family was very surprised me because. my sister got lost, and I was looking for for 10 minutes. While my. Parents were inside the restaurant alone together."
527.0,Provider,yeah okay.
12239.0,Patient,"Sorry, I was like oh crap I feel like I have to watch the kids and the way. No, they were very civilized like. Okay, you can see if you. Look from the outside, in think they want a day or something and. not see say like they were very good. Okay um."
527.0,Provider,But mom was drinking at at that point.
12239.0,Patient,"As yes, yes, now."
527.0,Provider,"Did she come to your graduation intoxicated. Yes, okay."
12239.0,Patient,"yeah um so I talked to her about it, so the next day I hung out with mainly just her we had brunch with my sister in the food, but. brunch with her. And kind of asked her why why I didn't ask her if she she kind of brought up herself, but she she's become a more reckless person and she always has for breakfast which I happen to wear about my dad's gonna worry about. Oh she's always just you know not really cared about herself exactly so much, but this is a fairly work stream recklessness. And the obvious things are like Oh well, I mean she kind of lost everything because of her her gambling addiction, you know twice, you know she lost this family and then her other families, she made but. At least she's in contact with this family, but she, we all know. Who is going to be saying there's going to be some hard boundaries that will never be cross. So. yeah but I wasn't angry or disappointed that she drank right. Because have to understand that you know she does have a gambling problem that still is active. Okay, and she did lose a lot of things their life. Because of that issue, so, but some of that she really can't control so if her coming here her coming truck is what's going to have allowed to behave. In fine but that's the album really bad to me, I actually not only that kind of facilitate it because I brought some liquor my own because I figured well she's drunk anyways I might as well, drink with her and try to bond with her that way. yeah I mean I do adapt right. I mean, I understand how deep root of this problem is I can't fix it she's going to get it somewhere anyway, so at the very least, I could give her the the memory of hanging out with her son in the way that she wants to hang out."
527.0,Provider,"So, enabling her."
12239.0,Patient,What can I say.
527.0,Provider,"I said well yeah. What, but what can you say."
12239.0,Patient,"Our relationship is very strange where. In order not enable her. I would have to cut her off, but i've already cut her off road like periods in periods of time."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"isn't work. And she's. I don't like to live, exactly, but if I had to get a guess um. she's the one help personally, and this has always been no. Share okay i'm. In second. Why hasn't that works. She doesn't want help and she the gambling addiction is a really bad thing for like this is this is definitely the worst. I mean i've seen many a drug addiction. meant to be okay, well, I can actually play a clip I saw that much because, even though I have seen many people have don't follow the jurisdiction. But doesn't mean I don't know what happens behind closed doors, I don't. know my mom will have to fly by closers either, but I will do that uh. It is the addiction i've seen the longest. it's always just come back to resurface and i'm well aware, he was not their experience, but just through. You know that virtue in the sense that addiction is a lifelong battle right it's once you have it, you always have it it's just a matter of can you tame it. So. I, so I can already tell it will be talk that she says that she doesn't exactly plan on living that long. And that's. And that's i'm not going to say I understand her in that sense, and the reason why I say that is because she doesn't want to be disabled old decrepit I think i've said this to you myself that's the largest, which is why I do fitness because. i've seen plenty of 70 while play i've seen a few seven year olds with fantastic bodies in great shape and in can do a lot more than some obese 2030 year olds so. Saying that gives me hope that it will give my life being to live in a sense, to where I don't have to feel my quality of life is to please so much that it's not going to be enjoyable live anymore. And this started when I saw some guy who was like well, I saw read some guy who was like 90 something wherever the heck he chose to die, even though he had no. ailments no nothing like that he could live on for who knows how long, but he chose diabetes quite like was so low. But I saw that I said don't be that that's that's absolute terrible, at least at least people allowed to die, but that's this. The Shell of its former self with a sense, I know I have two ages of what I know i'm going to fall, you know lose a lot of things that's fine I just don't want to lose too much. Right so because so because of that Alec I have a Kurdistan, when I do understand what you're saying in a decent sized sense. So. And even though we've said i've said to her multiple types of the phone you know, like hey like what are you gonna do about this kind of thing, and she says oh it's. Like she just wants to look up she wants to live, so at some point i'm. happy to stand that she's only in my life at an arm's reach um I only brought her back of my life because but That said, I should, because I don't want to regret not seeing her when I could was not connected with her when I should. So I did think about it, thinking I don't want to grow, the time we have here. Because the ball, would I tell her no alcohol, she would be very, very angry. And that's just going to just be tab that's just starting to find a shame, I just up and leave and take new or something like that. because she just wasn't she is what. She what she's she's kind of relied on something. Donna, so, in a sense, yeah i've been at least tell me about her but it's one of those things where she brought her own alcohol I can't say she can't have it says, I can't take it away from her that's just that's the way illegal. because she did by her money, she has on her person so. there's nothing I can do legally nothing I can say that's going to change her so at the very least, what I could do is I can at least lightly. bama her in a way that she wants to bond."
527.0,Provider,How is that helping you Shannon.
12239.0,Patient,Maybe more specific in there.
527.0,Provider,"You tend to push your needs aside. For the other person, so how is that helping you to. wow your needs aside and and I, and I hear you say you know I want to you know engage with my mom. Yes, you know, even if that's against my beliefs or values or agree what she's you know she's doing and that's in a being like that's dismissing your. yourself."
12239.0,Patient,"well. First off it's not entirely against my beliefs and values like I said I understand that her recklessness and assesses she doesn't want to live I don't agree with the past she's taking but. I can't say I don't understand because, like i'm not saying I was i'll take that path, at one point, but that was a path, I was like well i'd rather i'd really don't want to go down that road kind of thing but. I don't want to be in position if I was in position or they do. The person now or do something would probably you know, like try to fix it up, but. For us it back then I can't tell you will do, I can tell you what the person, the year ago with them. So what i'm saying is like well I did push a lot of these aside to accompany her there were some nisa I have why that I did want I did want to have. A mother son conversation with her and. The way I envisioned it, this was the best way, and this was exactly how I envisioned it would be pretty much the competition we had. We went on campus and we did legally what to a park event just drink a couple of shots that's it of her favorite look that I had in my cabinet for my case when I was on. So, in a way it was kind of me. realizing that like. This kind of used to be me not exactly, but this did used to be me. And then finally i'm, on the other side. And it's interesting to observe like here's what I used to be kind of thing, but she was very tame when we did like she said she did it like she thought like just smashing the funnel so she's you know she's like you know she's like having conversations just to begin with our then. it's more like she did say fix if you will right. So anyways I was saying about my needs, I really felt like I did the mother son conversation too. So. I was trying to understand myself, like, I agree with my dad and saying I should connect my mom. Because I will regret it, but the longest time I kept searching what am I looking for here if I just trying to have this passive relationship that's that's not what I want well that's something I should have at the start with the middle of. i'm looking from something from her and I don't know what it is, admittedly, I still don't know what it is, but something in me is saying i'm looking for something some sort of closure, maybe I don't know. But I did feel like I found some of it with this compensation, I feel like that this was the best way to have just a deep conversation with her. With it, it was just a very candid conversation even, even if it was nothing about what I was looking for it was pretty much what did we talk about. Honestly, we just talked about. Some light philosophy some relationships some evolutionary stuff about humans and mostly relationship stuff. You know. She kept asking why I want kids I kept telling her I don't want kids and, finally, she she spread up against like okay we're finally setting will be talking about this i'm going to give you like, as many reasons I can give you why don't want kids within the time we have. And I gave out most of the ones I can think about and cheers most of them um so. he accepts it. I think. it's just the conversation the act of the conversation is kind of what I wanted and I got that. And or to get it, I had to kind of play on her terms to get I had to go to her on her terms, so I understand that stop what I want, but it is. Not two diametrically opposed to me that I would just feel completely repulsed the whole time i'm there to where what's the point of i'm doing. You know it's, all I can go into like say a KKK rally, for example, that's an example of where I would just there's nothing that would probably go there, because I would just be very against going anything like that right, but you know, this is something that why this did used to be me. That some anymore. It was also reassuring that I had no thoughts at all about, you know that about drinking anymore like that I was just there just to I haven't finished my drink, to be honest, like you know search actually pointed out, the last of it but. It wasn't for the alcohol was there was the enabler for the experience that we had."
527.0,Provider,What did you want to walk away from from with that conversation with mom.
12239.0,Patient,"I don't know, I just wanted to walk away with some sort of have a closer bond that we had within the boundaries that i've set."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12239.0,Patient,"So while it's abstract as as as can be, and I feel like i've got i've received that I can't explain how it's just. We had a deep conversation um and she's actually it's nice our conversations with in that in that light, I mean both my parents are in some way they both could be. You know very. Very engaging with some intelligent points. When they choose to be. The real thing is how to get them to me."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"And i'm almost even just sit sit down and listen to me illustrator like you know Okay, I, for example, there was one point where it's like a population thing, and I said okay. In order to tell you about my point of view, I have to give you like it's five to 10 minute lecture on some math. But we want to listen she's like yes i'm going to listen, but she let's do it just fine so she's it's. Okay, I think. I think I walked so I told you why I walked away with and that's true, but I think even more specific, I think I found an angle to talk to her in a way. back and talk to her, because one issue I had with the biggest issue had with her was I didn't really want to talk to her. Every time I was on the phone I kind of want to just be kept very light it just talk about something recent and all that stuff um and kind of just talk to her for credit, if you will. Okay, which I knew is just what's the hell is the point of it, this is all going to go anywhere. You know. yeah well i'll do it, but that every now and then that's just very candid like we just talked about what we feel that kind of thing I talked about you know something short term to get to kind of just be on the phone to the Santa talk to her that she looks kind of thing. So I was kind of trying to find a way to change my relationship with her, but like I said the boundaries are very hard set I don't want her to be too close to me that invisible bland already like that. Financial nothing like that they simply put I cannot tolerate that so and those are some very hard batteries, because that is very limiting, and so it was cut difficult to find a relationship with her within those bounds, and I think I found something to start with. So I think that's you that that's the answer that I was looking for a bond but, more importantly, looking for something some way to increase our relationship, now and in the future, and that was what I found. I know the cost was a bit of morality, but at the end of the day, I had to be a bit more flexible to get something."
527.0,Provider,Does mom know how you feel about her drinking.
12239.0,Patient,"nope well okay not explicitly a because she brought it up before I had to say anything. She knows i'm not for that lifestyle that but I didn't explicitly say anything against it. Other than I kind of like. I said it and i'm afraid I didn't say it there, but I did say it sometime in the past wish she'd mentioned it. No, I don't think it's true so much BA BA. BA BA BA BA BA BA blah actually we were talking about in the restaurant, you know, like we're talking about like a liquors and I tell our circle, the ones election wait, you know, are you Hello that now you have some taste, I was like I say used to be like a hot."
527.0,Provider,Did you know that at that point.
12239.0,Patient,know what.
527.0,Provider,that she was an alcoholic.
12239.0,Patient,"know. I know is that okay I knew she drank a lot and. I guess at the technical setup isn't alcoholic but I didn't know it was that bad. Okay, to worse."
527.0,Provider,Well i'm trying to think like How would how old were you when she left.
12239.0,Patient,I will remember until six and a half apparent and that's about.
527.0,Provider,Right yeah. Okay okay yeah so you're a little.
12239.0,Patient,"yeah That was the only one that remembering stuff for her awesome i'm Michelle I was at my sister sheet another little bit. But it was nothing because he was a baby, would you like."
527.0,Provider,to share. What are your feelings about your mom.
12239.0,Patient,"we're a bit artificial because of these boundaries, I have. I feel I feel a bit pity for her right, I already mentioned how much she lost i'm. i'm obviously doesn't disappointment for the past and present. In her outlook on the future. um, but I also understand that it's her life, and I, and I cannot tell her how to live her life, I will tell her what I feel so. And if she wants to go on this path to you know just have her. be this way, all I can do is say I don't really like this. But if I were to cut her off again i'm sure that would be the last time I hear from. And that's just and that will kind of feel all the purposes wives i'd be back in the first place. So the very least, and while this is kind of I guess the phrases in a way it's kind of morally. selfish. While I could just cut her off and not see her anymore, I feel like that there is something with her that could enrich my life somehow and so just being. Even so, even though i'm not doing all I can to stop her lifestyle, the fact that i'm still talking to her in a way that's kind of dismissing that part of her life. i'm just because i'm searching something from her. And the way I think about until now, but perhaps I might deserve something from her for what she did it the past."
527.0,Provider,Is there any part of it's an empty well I keep going back to. Hoping that maybe i'll get something different than next time I go or be able to you know she'll be able to give me something.
12239.0,Patient,"No, no it's not that because I know. that things will be the same, unless I do something different, and that was the end that was what decide how was the big part of what they decide to Jupiter because I need to do something radical different that I couldn't have done elsewhere. She told me her favorite liquor and I saw in my cabinet in the back of it like because I went to a party The night before and I just happened to see the doctor was like Oh, I have a couple shots that lets. You know what I mean this it and, while I don't believe in fate or destiny all stuff all i'm here for you, I mean yes and no I didn't. Look that's a whole other discussion, but I don't exactly believe in some higher powers your guide to me and stuff. But uh I will I will accept signs of things that just make complete sense and i'll try to i'll probably just go with the size, with little over just as possible. And the sinus all was I saw her favorite look at my cabinet, which just lower two shots left she mentioned yesterday, I went to see her just tomorrow. ads is your decision to you want to add to you, wants to trigger. The in order to get what you're looking for. And it's right there I admittedly yeah in the middle of that was it since I was kind of temptation to kind of you know, hope or with that, but I thought about it because I didn't have to decide right there there, I saw the Cabinet and I had all night to the site. Up I said. what's going to change if I don't do this. Maybe exact same thing if I do or don't do it pretty much it might be slightly worse, but it could be one of those things where a step back two steps forward, or I could continue talking to her the future perhaps opening up about by alcoholic past. And that might help her, but in order for her to not to even believe I was not a halt like to I believe I was an alcoholic or might be like i'm no true alcoholic kind of thing which, admittedly, yes I wasn't that bad I was. mildly it's still alcoholism, but it was not as bad as, like most people excerpts here and I did kick the cook for myself, but. it's still something that I can relate to. That will take some time it again like I said it's it's it's very moral morally, you know folks like you know my great thing I feel like would open a lot of decisions right a lot of a few doors in a way to walk through that don't have to be exactly as morally questionable, as this. And then I mean that that's not a whole philosophical debate that. Go on, but again I just don't think it is it's it's. it's negative i'm willing to take for the potential outcomes, the potential for the potential positive outcomes that can happen, whether for her for me or for relationship i'm knowing that this could also steps to be even more negative I don't know."
527.0,Provider,So is a negative relationship better than no relationship.
12239.0,Patient,"I mean, of course, in in in abstract sense talks legislation, there are you should occur. I will not say that all of them are equal, I will say there are probably some in life that are better than their relationships, because some of them, you are getting something out of it's. A great example is say you're under age and year with your parents or they'll be so let's say you're in college and your parents are takeaway ship but they're paying for your whole college thousand the situation. i'd suck it up and just could have a paid for me and then, once they're done. Then I could just say okay bye right. Admittedly, a lot of people won't do that and I definitely was yo think that's the moral superiority to do that's pretty clear. But i'm fairly utilitarian and I believe that at some point. Your morality should stand aside for something that is going to benefit you by more than than than the worth of them around the right. not always there's always definitely limits like you know, nobody should talk about killing as a person right, so there is clear limits on that. it's mainly only for yourself if it helps if it's your self, that is, the suffer right, so in that relationship, I gave you that's a lot of money and freedom and stuff like that, like sometimes you do have the dollars to deal with parents, you know five weeks out of your kind of thing. And they're even ways around that. So what i'm saying here, in this sense I don't know the full extent of the relationship. It clearly there's going some negative parts of it, but I don't know. Yet what the positives are and i've been trying to search for that for a while and I think I might have bye bye bye struck something. And while I can, I guess, to continue the you know allegory or something like that, like i'm taking something I found something. Maybe it's something toxic to the river that could that could cure, so that it helps the river, maybe it's something that it could be like a road for me to go there more often, or maybe something could just find like a Gemma taken and leave. I don't know what it is, I just know that it's something that's interesting that will a lobbyist Amos let's shift for a little longer and. luscious can change right."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12239.0,Patient,"But at the end of the day, there are some people you can't choose and your parents are one of them."
527.0,Provider,What do you want your mom to hear most from you.
12239.0,Patient,about it and that's the question i'm going to have so my notes.
527.0,Provider,"yeah because I hear you say you know i've it sounds like you've got a lot of negative experiences and still have no negative experiences with mom and you're searching for Is there something. Is there something worth worth in mom is there a positive within mom like because there, I mean I can imagine the hurt that could. That could be there with her, because she left and and her destructive path like excuse me like watching that with her. And just the disappointment of you know, leaving the family, and even though you're so little like. Not having that role model that person. You know, which is probably why patrick's family feels feels good you know, because you know you see in our positive interactions with them and they're welcoming of. You and who you are like all pieces, you know, and I know you haven't shared you know, like an open book with them, but you definitely they've been very welcoming to me, and you know, accepting of your identity and who you are just all."
12239.0,Patient,"That hard stop true and the open book. Part I have an open book for them, but you have to read the patients. mm hmm there's just there's just some chapters to have it asked if they haven't decided yet."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah and and i'm not saying you have to be an open book with.
12239.0,Patient,I know you know.
527.0,Provider,"You know you that you, you can have those boundaries, but you've been able to share and they've been able to receive and accept. Like what you have shared and I know that that's not something that you've been able to even do with your own family, like there's been things you've had to keep to yourself. And sometimes it's having to grieve those. Losses of relationships that. are never going to be as I needed them to be like mom's never going to be the mom that I needed her to be."
12239.0,Patient,"Oh, oh color I might have been bumped the calls twice a week we'll see um that's a big difference to keep. i'm. going to circle back on is the whole graduation thing. Is. I was, I was kind of looking for closure again for my degree right yeah I think. Obviously co investor for a lot of ways, but. Had so had the graduates to get quote because I just didn't feel like a call it."
527.0,Provider,For the.
12239.0,Patient,"longest time. I, in a way, feel like it now, but I still felt that there was some bows and. I think it's the clothes right exactly why but I got something which is better than nuff. I feel like that is one thing that's holding me back and just how i've been operating, this is the lack of closure from campus or philosophy camps, so I from from a degree. I don't know, maybe I should buy one of those a degree plaques and hang it up."
527.0,Provider,What would it symbolize for you.
12239.0,Patient,"And all the hard work and we talked about some of it, you know it would be the consummation of the stuff I got to get to where, at least where I got to find last year. um, even if the path, I took wasn't what I wanted, I might be talking about i'm talking about more like at uc Davis I kind of wish I was a bit more social, I was decently social, but I was too academic and when I didn't have to be. vulcan I say that, even though I had some stuff lined up but it didn't pass through but that's something else um. Well, actually, I say that, but if it wasn't academic I wouldn't have met friends, I have. hmm. Actually I don't know. Okay, so I guess so explain us quickly um. Well, I got to my English I had an injury between 19 and pretty much almost all the friends that i've met since then have been from that internship or from extension internship. And these are like I like to call powerful people that will, but people who are in the industry with who are successful industry um. and There are some The more I hang up in the morning, get to know them in a sense, some ways i'm like that's like I expected you'd be like that kind of thing, and I can and wait, but I mean if somebody like a. Friends also better change and some i'm like oh I don't know you were that good, for example. This one guy he was a valedictorian at his school and top five from Chico state and I had no idea. He also was like you know, Captain some of the prodigy I see all this i'm like. I had no idea, you were that good like I do you wear something special of the group. But I have read that from him, but I didn't know he was like. That much of a of an achiever um, and the reason why I find that really interesting is because he typically looks at me in conversations, but not as an attraction says i'm saying, in a sense, to let's do I have to say, because he is interested when I have to say. Okay i'm. Like he wants to learn from me, even if it's just something just thought about tech, which I don't like talking about tech but. He just he just enjoys talk about be philosophically mathematically it just. Really anything. Sure um. And so it's one of those things where i'm wondering why i'm because I haven't wonder for a while, why do these guys someone hang out with me when I invited the same thing is it. And you know the obvious thing is like oh i'm the token black guy but no honestly no that's that's not how we operate they play a diverse friends and they put on the DC skin color and that says."
527.0,Provider,I really don't think I mean.
12239.0,Patient,I think it's that i'm.
527.0,Provider,"So what would you what would you write about if you had to pose that question to yourself, like Why are people interested in me. Because that comes up a lot in a lot of different areas for you Johanna. And, and I, and I think that's still a piece of what you were trying to figure out, you know that that drives some of your you know improvements and progression in your in your mental health process to like. You know how can, how can somebody like me how how Can somebody love me like Why do I deserve that how do I deserve that like. there's always that questioning of you know, because I, I can see these flaws within me like why why doesn't anybody else see those or how do they get past those and. and see me, as you know, someone that. has lots of lots to offer."
12239.0,Patient,"But ask them that question, not in that exact way you phrased it. Some way you. Some way of that."
527.0,Provider,Do you need to.
12239.0,Patient,"I think, for some of them I do. I think this is one of them. There are some things I can think about but it's still doesn't make sense, why. Well, the big thing right now is like you know, like i've been working out and they can clearly see my results, I mean hell, I can see my results in the mirror. I mean, I still every time I decided to look I see something new about me that it's like oh that's great, but again that's not why i'm doing this. it's just a positive consequence. So they want to work out with me in a sense, that's fine, but that. I don't think that is the reason why that they still hang out with me that's just something they want to do to hang out with me, because as you're aware it's not about it's not about the event, usually have friends hanging yeah it's just the fact that. it's not about like watching a movie it's not about the working out it's about being. So. I don't understand why. And there are plenty of reason, could be something as simple as I make them laugh, which I do sometimes."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Would you be able to receive whatever they said, or would you dismiss it and question, it still."
12239.0,Patient,"Ah uh well, I would have to question it, not because I don't i'm, not because I don't accept it, but because I don't understand it like I would accept whatever they say, but I would have to ask them some clarification, so that I can understand it for future references right. If they say I that i'm a really funny guy so oh how am I funny there's plenty of ways to be funny. or they can say like you know i'm a very but the guy told you about he called me a genius twice, I want to say. Why do you think i'm a genius. What do I, what do I say what do I do, how did I could see that."
527.0,Provider,"And would you still believe it with whatever response, they had."
12239.0,Patient,"Or would it still you know. 100% like I said he's that guy special in the sense, so if he's gonna call me that i'm like clearly you see something in me, but I still want to know what right and that's the thing to like. I think most of what they say I will believe um, but I just want to know, I want to understand and that's this my modus operandi right, I want to understand."
527.0,Provider,And how much do you want to understand what happened when you were little.
12239.0,Patient,"don't think any understand too much I think that's one of those things where it's just life. it's just a bunch of consequences that occurred from a few decisions and few database with some life, so I don't need to understand I just he understands. I mean, she has a gamma addiction I don't really understand how she got there, she has it it's just something that once you have it, you have it, I don't understand the origin of things I see to understand."
527.0,Provider,Why she left and what did I do wrong.
12239.0,Patient,"First off she didn't leave you got kicked out. Because of the whole food thing I don't think there's much to adjust the to ask to understand because I understand enough about gambling well, maybe for it, I understand enough about addiction. and honestly I could just say oh addiction addiction oh that's from this from this with rejection it's one of those things to where intuitively I could just make a path to understand why a lot of things happen in my childhood now, not everything, but enough that I understand what happens."
527.0,Provider,But connecting with the emotions and the impact that it left on you and and questions about yourself today. is difficult for you to do.
12239.0,Patient,"It is this. All right, well i'll think about those i'm."
527.0,Provider,Definitely yeah definitely some areas to explore.
12239.0,Patient,So it's okay for schedule again for two weeks.
