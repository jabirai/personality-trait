6882.0,Patient,"i'm so I just needed. i'm good on all of my refills. I need my suboxone today. Now for some reason last time you. For the last week, you called in. Only a partial but as far as I know, besides my manny appointment that's missing i've got everything done um, but it also was called in as as tabs and so or sorry strips instead of tablets. And so, anyway, I needed so i've updated my address with you guys, but this prescription and all future prescriptions will need to be called them to manual pharmacy."
298.0,Provider,You updated that right.
6882.0,Patient,"um well, so I actually just found out what one I was going to be using which one was closest and everything so do you mean what so I didn't like call it, and specifically to update it."
298.0,Provider,Right that's what I need you to do.
6882.0,Patient,"Okay, so I can call in right after this and do that because I needed to they canceled my manning appointment as well, obviously um so I guess."
298.0,Provider,Because of individual therapy. past.
6882.0,Patient,All my you as all of my all that stuff's good it's just my individuals that i'm missing.
298.0,Provider,Okay i'm trying to pull that up right now.
6882.0,Patient,Okay um so yeah so.
298.0,Provider,"yeah. you're right you're good on everything, but individuals that looks like. And that's not your fault."
6882.0,Patient,"Okay, so this is an easy appointment i'll just basically call right back and talk to Karen as."
298.0,Provider,They say that I don't know that your group are scheduled the right frequency. should be.
6882.0,Patient,"A minimum of two months. And I did. To in December. I did have to cancel this week's. of it, I was in the process of. finalizing my move to spokane i'm in the in the new House my walls are purple right now but. um anyway so. yeah it was in the middle of moving and I had to put my dog to sleep which. That happened right before our Wednesday Group and I was just I was bawling so hard I just I couldn't."
298.0,Provider,"Remember, reading the email, would you please ask them to update your computer I don't know how to do it to two times a month it's showing weekly and that's going to drive me nuts."
6882.0,Patient,"Well, and I actually don't mind doing them weekly it's just i'm a mean it's nice to have the option. But I do get a lot out of them and. really miss meeting with it with manny because, like he says. This has been a huge year for me like. here's Dan i'm sure I. You and I haven't really talked a lot one online, but. I i'm very used to letting people walk all over me and i'm very used to. I don't know how much I believe in astrology or anything but i'm like i'm very much a pisces. And I do tend to always be the caretaker always be the one who who ends up taking care of things, because those around me don't. And so, this year, you know, standing up to my family. Standing up to my job, which is still kind of lingering on I. I think that you know I mean I told him I was like you either accept the change or i'm leaving. I mean you know it is what it is i'm moving i'm not staying in colville, this is a toxic situation for me. And besides that everything that was promised to me when I first started this is not panning out so it's it doesn't matter to me if I end up staying so I think they're kind of trying to figure out a way to do without me, but I do so many different areas. I mean literally i'm not trying to pat myself on the back, but they would have to hire three people because. People who work in it don't also have all the history and in the accounting and the bookkeeping and the ordering and stuff like that and. I also do a lot of of like management in terms of the people and the when people are hired I don't hire them, but I do all the HR roles and so. yeah it's there's a lot of things and so they're gonna have to find a way to combine those jobs or hire more people. or make them pay me what i'm worth. So, but either way I told him I was like you know. I have to have this change, and so I am i've put my. My foot down and said, you know, this is, this is where we're going so take it or leave it I would love to stay I love the company that we've built. it's it's been a great experience but i'm not. going to be heartbroken if it does. So i'm. Seriously, I have this. Even though I am totally heartbroken about my dog. that's still. Days late there on the floor with him, and it was just so hard but. Anyway, yeah I. I have to make these changes, I have to grow my nieces they they're five and seven and. they're a really important part of my life, and one of the realizations that I came to is like. I was holding myself in in that in the colville area, and I was like you know. I don't want to not be around my niece's I want to be able to see them, I want to be able to help them when. You know, because my brothers always either using me or my mom. And one of the things that manny said was like you know how is it that a partial version of you that's physically there is better than a full version of you that can be from a distance, but still be a part of their lives. And so that was kind of a realization that you know. Yes, I was physically there, but I wasn't there there all the time, and I was irritated a lot, not at them, or anything but it was just anyway, so I don't want to take up your time. I will definitely be on on group next week. And so yeah."
298.0,Provider,So your job right now is to go to the virtual clinic and give them the new pharmacy. phone tablet.
6882.0,Patient,"yeah. And now. Is there a way, so I don't know what the limit is on this um I was told different things throughout the day the different people so like you, you gave me a month's worth of the. My add meds and and someone. Is there is it two weeks, the limit that we're at or I just want to make sure I understand that I. never really."
298.0,Provider,"it's completely subjective in some ways, so if you were in the green, then I have the discretion based on your life and what you've done with us in the past to decide how many. Now, sometimes at Christmas time they gave me unlimited you know I can choose. Where they get where they're really hard on me is, if you are missing a bunch of things you're in the yellow and it's your fault, and I turn around and give you a week's worth at a time, and you haven't done your spot so. I will do two weeks with you because it's not your fault okay."
6882.0,Patient,Okay awesome so i'll have them send you a message as soon as i'm done with the V vc.
298.0,Provider,that'll be good take care.
6882.0,Patient,Thank you bye now.
