4852.0,Patient,at once.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so tell me fill me in. That."
4852.0,Patient,"um. That there's so much stuff and. So I think last time I talked to you, I was still living in the hotel and i'm still in a hotel and six seven months now. we're still looking for a place. I had some court stuff. With a neighbor, but it was I."
418.0,Provider,"Oh, I remember."
4852.0,Patient,"She had assaulted my boyfriend and. So I hit her so I was technically guilty, but. However, all the charges were dropped. Because i'm she ended up just asking for money to be paid her car deductible, so the judge pointless threw it out. So all of the protection orders and everything were dropped, which is good news. which opened up the possibility of finding a place to live, because with assault charges pending nobody would want to be. Which prolonged our hotel living which stocks it's very expensive. So that's all in the past, so that's good news. But we are working so much that we still haven't really had time to find a place or do anything. So. that's the gist of it. Just working a lot."
418.0,Provider,"So, when you say that you are working. alone, what do you do."
4852.0,Patient,"My husband and I have a company. He is technically a subcontractor so we do a lot of remodeling and stuff so. we're working on two condos now and he's doing a lot of other side jobs yeah the sun, working with email, which is nice. To couldn't find how. We can't find anybody who wants to work it's crazy we've been struggling with that for a long time so. He did you finally get decided to work which has been helping a lot that just started I guess last week and. So i've been painting a lot so and then we have like side job like side work we do too so on top of our regular work week expired jobs which just pay us cash. So I can kind of focus a little bit more than those vicious painting and little stuff that I can do, while they do the other dogs. So just trying to build up some revenue, you have to pay employees and stuff so. We work, a lot of hours we work, seven days a week."
418.0,Provider,So you tired.
4852.0,Patient,"yeah well, I was working earlier, and then I just came home to do this and then we're going back. I have two grandkids yes."
418.0,Provider,"Okay, your. grandbaby okay. So right now basically you're working you put your money away because you are eventually going to get a place. yeah and that's all you're waiting for us to get a plan."
4852.0,Patient,Okay yeah just looking for some stability.
418.0,Provider,"mm hmm well six months in a hotel is not stable. it's, not that I know what it's not."
4852.0,Patient,Really really expensive though it's like between four and 600 a week.
418.0,Provider,Oh wow a lot that's a lot.

But yeah it's just a little bit I mean we have our clothes at different places we pay on to storage units it's just stressful a lot of money. it's a lot of unnecessary yeah was really unnecessary. This one girl did this so.

418.0,Provider,"Are you taking your medicine i'm. on time, every day, no. yeah Have you had any trouble with that."
4852.0,Patient,"Now, the only problem with that is that I haven't been able to get over to that lab I know I should really make time to do it, but. it's like we were we wake up jump in the shower i'm clean the hotel room up a bit of a cat here, and so I do cleanings if we run out the door we work, and then we go back and it's just you know we're in so many different locations I just I haven't made time to run over."
418.0,Provider,"have to end, you have to work like that, because of the financial stress. yeah we're living situation. So here's my thing nine times out of 10 most labs open up at 536 in the morning. yeah Oh, if you could get that lab. Before you hit the road. Because one thing is for sure how much, are you going to be able to work if you don't have the medicine."
4852.0,Patient,"Well, and, to be honest, I really want to do the lot because I would like to see, because I know I had hepatitis. And I was i'd like to get those levels checked so it's not they don't want to do it, I just."

4852.0,Patient,"And, to be honest, both of us are so forgetful I mean we have so much."
418.0,Provider,"Well, let me explain to you how. Much I get it, there are. Times, where I simply have to stop at the store. yeah just pick up juice boxes. You know the luncheon. So what do I do I don't stop because I don't have time or it's just never the right time to just sit. there and then after I do it, I feel like why didn't I just do this because I stress myself out. Then he gets all like i'm in, and I have to put something else in it, so it causes me more grief to not do it, then, but I do get where you are because that's where my mind is like I just haven't had time like i'm back i'm in and out."
4852.0,Patient,"Right well and as an example, so we didn't make time to go to the store last night right we get very. Well, we went to walmart birthday, you have anything that we want is we had half a card, we end up just leaving because just decide which is just better for us because that's where we go. To go to progress we get there, we do all the shopping, for the second time get in line and the registers won't take anybody's card and like Jesus, so we just left went home again like that's that's my day."
418.0,Provider,"total waste of time. And you know, in a ruffle because it's freaking kidding me today right."
4852.0,Patient,"Like yeah I finally made the time to do something, and here I am so yeah. yeah it's just that's just my life in general, I have been putting little positive quotes and sayings on the refrigerator every day. Good I tried updated every couple days and."
