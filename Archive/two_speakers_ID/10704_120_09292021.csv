She says so persistent, I have a foster dog right now to that i'm kind of watching and. Possibly keeping I haven't really totally decided yet. But it. i've just made sure it wasn't being naughty This seems to be okay. puppies you very well know and keep your eye on them, but yeah cats are interesting because they can be so stoic, and so they can like not show illness until it's really bad. yeah and then but that's interesting that it got better on social media just had some kind of I don't know. They give antibiotics and stuff to."
10704.0,Patient,"be given our content medication I. mean fluids and painkillers so whatever it was I didn't put her fever even broke, so I mean who knows."
120.0,Provider,Maybe it was some kind of infection that just. Just was causing her body to freak out so much.
10704.0,Patient,"I don't know cuz then we thought Maybe it was the intestinal parasites, that the dog has she was was which was an eating, but the vets, it does not it doesn't transfer from dogs two cats like that so."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah. you've had quite the whirlwind when it comes to animal.
10704.0,Patient,"Health oh my God yeah so i'm like. ready to see what's happening next like. yeah like concerned, like the dog like. You don't know she's a uti is healed and because she's like licking herself down there are lots of they could get is itching are bothering her I don't know."

120.0,Provider,Like like in just not getting things done or not i'm not like doing well on things.
10704.0,Patient,"Not doing well, like her greatest she has seeds in math science and social studies not it seems like a necessarily a horrible thing which is doing nothing to really do better on that."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10704.0,Patient,"And that's so that's where our frustration lies it's like. You know I think you have a test on Friday, what are you doing to prepare for it."
120.0,Provider,Right like she's not. tried to improve things yes.
10704.0,Patient,"She does she work and she got seems to be one thing, but like just to kind of like just not anything is frustrating."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10704.0,Patient,"And I think I mean Obviously we need to work on her studies, because i'm like oh Maybe she doesn't know how to study like. She has a GI he."
120.0,Provider,may have a gap meeting.
10704.0,Patient,"week for her, and I think i'm gonna talk to her teacher about."
120.0,Provider,gee I EP.
10704.0,Patient,gifted I she's gifted.
120.0,Provider,gifted oh. She might be like board then like.
10704.0,Patient,"I don't think it's boredom I think it's. I think she and she is gifted so she's very smart in school always can easily to her so elementary school she didn't do anything other than the bare minimum, that you do well. Then she gets a junior high and she's an honors classes and. She doesn't know how to study that you can't just go in go to school, leave and do well anymore. And I think just and, of course, last year was the first year in junior high, but last year was you know coven."
120.0,Provider,Different yeah for sure.
10704.0,Patient,"really know how to study or how to prepare. mm hmm and I try to help, but she knows everything so."
120.0,Provider,But you know.
10704.0,Patient,You know you try to help her but you're like.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh teenagers are such a pain."
10704.0,Patient,"And then it's just like and then she had a social studies assignments social studies is one of honors classes in her social studies teacher has a no late work policy. It is what it is, and she forgot to submit something that she did it, but yet to actually submit it and she didn't do that. And then she has this you know it's teacher shouldn't have this policy like the policy is the policy."
120.0,Provider,"Well, so like that's The world is not going to give you late."
10704.0,Patient,Some teachers that accept late work and some that don't this one doesn't. that's it is you know it's policy.
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10704.0,Patient,"You have different policies throughout your life and. Then somebody and then. And then, again in social studies it's she did something wrong and an assignment you only got like one point out of five and i'm just like, and so I don't really know what it is, but that's going to just pull her break down. mm hmm and i'm just like. The small things it's like really like, why are we."
120.0,Provider,yeah cuz she's a super smart kid but it's just a. Big organization part she's having a hard times like. You know wrapping your head around keeping track of stuff no.
10704.0,Patient,"Yes, and I have such a hard time with organization so i'm like not the best to help her with that, so I really want to talk to her gifted teacher will be a gifted teacher on Tuesday. and see what they get the school to do to help support our study skills and how we can help her at home. mm hmm I don't know. These honors classes just me so quick them again in another test already like I want."
120.0,Provider,You can make a huge calendar and put it in your kitchen. That has a good days marked and then. test this day test this day and then mark the days go as you go and. yeah I don't know helper track.
10704.0,Patient,"Yes, we can both keep this a good idea, through them both keep track of what's."
120.0,Provider,"Going on like the day before like. You know study 20 minutes study 30 minutes, today, you know, like before so that you know cuz yeah those things are you know some kids kind of figure out how to study and other kids you know it's not intuitive you know."
10704.0,Patient,"yeah and then it doesn't follow her, she time she doesn't. She had season D she's like whatever. I guessing. Right. Like i'm good I get a D minus but i'll pass it it's like who cares it's."
120.0,Provider,Right right.
10704.0,Patient,"it's hard, because in some ways. it's just a struggle."
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, it is tough to when you know if she's the only kid because she doesn't like I remember in my you know, and my family i'm the youngest and so like when I yeah I had to kind of do what the older kids did you know, like in they always said really good, and so you kind of had this pressure. But I imagine like if she doesn't have somebody that she's kind of having to do what they did I don't know."
10704.0,Patient,"I know it's hard, because I don't want to put a lot of pressure on her, but then i'm like. You shouldn't just be accepting sees you need to do some work to do you know what I mean. And that was frustrating to me."
120.0,Provider,"yeah it is, I never have the concept of when I learned that like good grades meant that you're going to get paid for it someday meeting, if you want to go to scholars, you know get a scholarship. Then, like Oh, this is worth money to you know get paid for a while kind of like that number that made sense to me a little bit."
10704.0,Patient,yeah i've tried that and she just like good ever. You don't.
120.0,Provider,Like I don't care yeah.
10704.0,Patient,"And she just inches it's all about her friends right now. I know it's normal, but like she was a frustrating my husband took she is she wears glasses I doctor's appointment yesterday. was so annoyed because you know you're buying glasses and she kept taking pictures of herself and sending them to her friend and the different classes. Like."
120.0,Provider,To get feedback about which one looks good or something.
10704.0,Patient,"get it to a point, because i'm looking for classes, I asked. My husband's opinion. mm hmm but like he was there, and this was before covert but then she's sending pictures to a friend i'm like I get it, she wants to opinion but then he's like I don't want to sit here what she's taking pictures and send them to our friends, you know."
120.0,Provider,Just make a decision it's not that important.
10704.0,Patient,"And then yeah I said, you know you just get what you like it, and she said, well, my friends, know what's you know what looks good implying that my husband doesn't you know he doesn't play. With you know what do you learn at."
120.0,Provider,least not not for a junior high framework yeah he didn't yeah that's funny. man. Poor junior high children.
10704.0,Patient,"me that I don't he wasn't laughing, but it was hilarious."
120.0,Provider,But it was funny you Pilar like not shocked you're like yeah that's something.
10704.0,Patient,I may not make sense.
120.0,Provider,"yeah. Oh, goodness. So how is so How are things with food, you said you're doing a little better."
10704.0,Patient,"struggling or and down, but I think i've gotten better like making lunches making sure like i'm staying on a schedule. mm hmm."
120.0,Provider,What what has been. What has been the hardest part about it but thus far.
10704.0,Patient,"The hardest part is I just I feel so scattered. it's hard for me to even like sometimes remember to eat or take the time to eat if that makes sense, like sometimes they'll get ready to leave for work i'm like I don't know I didn't have anything for breakfast and I always eat breakfast. And then having a puppies just on the last one who leads to work in the morning, like my husband and daughter are gone so, on the one in charge, which is fine, but just adding that and just trying to get everything it just is hard. And then i'm going to call, and I really haven't really forgetful lately actually to call my neurologist to. look at things, maybe go back on like the medication, I was on it, because it's just i'm really just really forgetful."
120.0,Provider,That you think is related to like the lyme disease or like ADHD or.
10704.0,Patient,"Maybe both maybe just getting older, I don't know yeah but it's like ever since I had lyme disease I don't definitely don't think my brain works, the way it used to. And it comes and goes but it's just been really. it's really been just it's been so friggin like i'm i'm having difficulty spelling words like i've always been a strong scholar like i've never had issues of spelling like I do now. Interesting yeah forgetting things like leaving the keys in the car getting out of the car, but the car running like then later on, like where my car keys that either in the car the cars."
120.0,Provider,The cars on oh okay. Great yeah I can imagine that being is that just the last couple of weeks.
10704.0,Patient,"it's been worse, the past couple weeks yeah okay."
120.0,Provider,yeah hmm. And sounds good that you're looking into the. talking to a neurologist so.
10704.0,Patient,"I have one from. A person, you know normally have like from the lyme disease and I had central nervous system i'm and I think it was pretty a checkup. I think that's for someone in October I know reschedule it, because now, the door virtual you don't make your appointment like he used to when you left so i've been having trouble making my appointments because. I began to make."
120.0,Provider,You forget to say because you forget to make them.
10704.0,Patient,"You know, because. He had to go and make your appointment for you to now that change and that's been tough and, sometimes, some of them, you know, and I think that's what's happening in October, so maybe I should just call and check on that."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah cuz that could be something that you know if there's something that you could do to help with it man that would make your life easier.
10704.0,Patient,"It would, but the medic me i've been on medication medication itself, as we know, strong medications you know you're changing your brain around or whatever."
120.0,Provider,Did the medications help when you were on it.
10704.0,Patient,"No, but I mean."
120.0,Provider,Like no.
10704.0,Patient,"not really I mean for different issue. My honest so they but. that's at a point where I just living with it, I really wasn't on it for like the memory, like a longer period of time."
120.0,Provider,But there are some side effects and stuff to it.
10704.0,Patient,"yeah it can cause stomach upset. I know, like everything."
120.0,Provider,"yeah always something. I challenge, though I can imagine how frustrating that would be to have memory issues is it affect your job to."
10704.0,Patient,"Does man managed to survive and then nobody at work, knows this, but I definitely feel like it does. And like and I got I have a bunch of kids I already have a 40 some kids on my caseload which is like really high for this time of year."
120.0,Provider,"That would be really tough, because you probably don't even have. Time to really get to know them or. understand you know."
10704.0,Patient,It is in like a lot of school they're just a lot of needy kids right now and i'm just.
120.0,Provider,What do you do you just go meet with them one on one or try to just create plans that the pair educators and kind of follow are.
10704.0,Patient,"kind of like both I sometimes I meet one on one or just being a classroom supporting them I also work with a teacher seeing what they need to make to really just help the students be successful in class, but a lot of the teachers expect us, just like wave a magic wand. and make everything better and it just doesn't work like that."
120.0,Provider,"I hurry I get. into stuff in my work. You just fix it came to make her stop doing this and, like."
10704.0,Patient,"No, and then like well like you want me there, like every day all day long but that's not my that's not what I do. Right and it's frustrating, because it is hard to get help for children, this young."
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm. These are these kids like. ones with like learning disorders, that are diagnosed, or they behavioral or both or."
10704.0,Patient,"It could be it's both behavioral not have autism mom I mean, I have a one child, with two children with hearing loss. But it just depends it's a very wide range to developmental delay, which is pretty much a delighted that they can't pinpoint because it's still too young for that."
120.0,Provider,Right.
10704.0,Patient,"A lot of those displays will either, just when they get to elementary school they weren't need support anymore or they're turning to like autism or a good learning disability."
120.0,Provider,"Well, I could imagine how how much of a variety of issues, there are I work with a little kid in therapy that. I don't know how to help her sometimes because she she's like 13 but developmentally she can be like eight or nine, and you know, but then she tries to survive in a junior high world and. You know just doesn't he always puts her self in situations that are just like awkward which could lead to bullying and. isolation and. I don't know it's hard to teach somebody kind of social skills when they don't really understand. It. So I feel for you, I don't that will be that will be a tough thing."
10704.0,Patient,"The tournament yeah and it's just China. And then just working with the teachers and some teachers are just more. set in their ways and they struggle with having children with needs in our class today, it was I mean a lot of what I do do deals with behavioral stuff."
120.0,Provider,I would know.
10704.0,Patient,it's mostly the 90% of what I do I deal with.
120.0,Provider,yeah do you ever deal with my kids that are like straight up oppositional or is it more that they really are I.
10704.0,Patient,"have a lot of oppositional kids but. Sometimes I just had one child just getting removed from his daycare and he's in some kind of like partial day hospitalization program and i'm like kids only five years old, I mean."
120.0,Provider,wow.
10704.0,Patient,But he's got some serious issues.
120.0,Provider,"To as a five year old. wow doors airs parents pretty stable. or do they have some problems too, because sometimes it seems like it's generational little bit to."
10704.0,Patient,"The parents aren't together a minute just a whole lot going on. A lot of. Teachers had to like call you know the abuse hotline because they thought. Oh, this step father and the mom just is over, well it's just a big mess my mom also puts them on medication take small small small it's just like."
120.0,Provider,What a challenge and the.
10704.0,Patient,Other kids and keep yourself from getting really discouraged.
120.0,Provider,"Like, how do you how do you keep yourself, because you always seem to be in a pretty like positive place, I mean, how do you not just get sucked into this like feeling like helpless to do much."
10704.0,Patient,"I don't know I just do I mean i'm exhausted, but. I don't know I just I feel generally most optimistic, and I think most of the kids i've worked with will actually go up, I mean and be okay, most of them, not all yeah yeah I mean the kid who's already, in part, you know all ready in a residential program he's gonna struggle."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
10704.0,Patient,that's tough always.
120.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes I think if that way to like my there's a lot of adults around so somehow people tend to grow up they somehow figure it out, even if it's not completely you know if if it's not a perfect plan or a perfect pathway that they take but."
10704.0,Patient,get to eventually.
120.0,Provider,"yeah like it sounds like compared to the stuff you get to deal with it your work, that your daughter doing pretty dang good."
10704.0,Patient,"She is and I guess like I don't want to push it too hard, but I just like doing like meeting a full potential. And she's. know."
120.0,Provider,"I know, like sometimes like I know my nephew and junior high he went through this like goth stage and. Which is like just tanking everything, but then, when he got into like your ninth and 10th grade he kind of like oh this stuff matters a little bit more now, and he kind of. Like his brain kind of caught up a little bit and then he gets pretty good, and you know got scholarship money and things like that you know and your daughter could very well you know just be like in this social world of not being able to like. yeah manage anything you know school wise yet."
10704.0,Patient,yeah and it's just she just you know it's just that she doesn't she felt like she she districts really social studies right now I teach social studies teacher is harder. You know not accepting late. Work and other stuff and. Where they are in class so they're supposed to work a little harder right. They are.
120.0,Provider,They are not as much as.
10704.0,Patient,"Other honors classes that don't. have such rigid policies, but it is what it is it's you know."
120.0,Provider,"yep yep. And I guess i'm not so sure. yeah sure capable of doing it yeah so. Yes, yeah."
10704.0,Patient,"Thanks so much. easier because everything's on the computer now, and they have like a software like school a gene that tells you what to do that day like it's not."
120.0,Provider,yeah you know.
10704.0,Patient,That.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well, I wonder if that's what makes it school like harder, because it is easier, you know because they don't have to learn how to keep track of things because it's all kind of you know, organized for them, because of technology. That we get a little bit lazy I think sometimes with like like for exactly with matt like with math or spelling. You know I I my spelling gets worse as they get older, because I can just look it up, if I don't. You know it's like you have to actually get a dictionary you just put on your phone and it'll teach you how to do it."
10704.0,Patient,"Or you don't like Google search, you know exactly this gets super lazy about. You know."
120.0,Provider,"Even with math like it's not even there's you know. seems like there's not always sense to memorize things anymore, because you can look it up."
10704.0,Patient,yeah it makes it easier.
120.0,Provider,"You know, have a different world."
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So tell me about food, you said foods up and down like in what ways is it going well and what ways is it not going well."

120.0,Provider,"I wish you could just eat it, I wish you could try it when it tasted really good because there's some that it's really good but it's a mental block for you, for sure."
10704.0,Patient,"yeah, especially the whole Mayo thing I really think back. You know, and so on to the good, because you know, like you can use mayonnaise to like make grilled cheese."
120.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
10704.0,Patient,"yeah instead of butter and apply it spreads really well browns but now it's like I don't want to go cheese anymore, because the possibility to use mail."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
10704.0,Patient,"I got a question, you know, like why."
120.0,Provider,"Do you say so, like yeah i'm not a huge Mayo fan either, but I imagine it 10 things I don't even know. You know, things that I like like grilled cheese."
10704.0,Patient,"isn't grilled cheese, it could be in hot wings yeah sorry. You calling me like to look like hiring agencies, I haven't like look for a job and years and they're trying to. recruit me, for I don't like yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Why do they get, why do they think you are looking for a job or they just."
10704.0,Patient,Because I mean I was and I guess.
120.0,Provider,Oh.
10704.0,Patient,You got me information when I was in that she's never like it's been like seven years and. Just still calling.
120.0,Provider,we're still hopeful.
10704.0,Patient,This point like i've been asked to take off list like i'm just I just ignore now.
120.0,Provider,I wonder if it's because there's like shortages everywhere.
10704.0,Patient,That is just the oldest openings in the area.
120.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah I know that they've had some. Schools around here that classes have had to be canceled because they didn't have teacher. yeah so.
10704.0,Patient,"One of the reasons why I got out was because it was such a Shell sub shortage and this is like three years ago and the desktop shortage definitely whereas on your teacher, because the teachers are the ones get an extra kids and. stuff and it's just."
120.0,Provider,So there's no sub so they just kind of divide the kids into different other classrooms. yeah oh yeah.
10704.0,Patient,And that's tough when you're getting kids you know.
120.0,Provider,"When you have kids you don't know where you go for your words, they got beat."
10704.0,Patient,"yeah and they. were doing their own work, but you know. The first enters your second kindergarteners like they can't."
120.0,Provider,You know yeah they need a little bit more structure than. yeah yeah huh. yeah i've lost that's funny that you get these calls still like.
10704.0,Patient,Say like get up.
120.0,Provider,"Or you can say yeah you got a million dollars, that will come work at that I."
10704.0,Patient,know you want to give me more money.
120.0,Provider,"Yes, he is it worth it yeah. I don't know well i'm glad that you're pushing yourself to try some some foods, a little bit differently, and you know explore some other things that maybe you have kind of you know, closed off the idea to for a while."
10704.0,Patient,yeah you know.
120.0,Provider,"um, how is the kind of overeating stuff that you were doing at night, or do you feel like that's being managed better."
10704.0,Patient,The thing tonight eating is getting better I still eat too much or just the wrong food during the day.
120.0,Provider,The wrong food meeting just kind of stacie stuff or.
10704.0,Patient,"Well, just high sugar like mostly high sugar foods like donuts cookies candy."
120.0,Provider,Right right.
10704.0,Patient,To me just an excessive point.
120.0,Provider,Right right do you notice how it makes your body feel.
10704.0,Patient,makes me feel more tired and rundown.
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm. I noticed, for me, I usually feel better for a little bit like it kind of goes up you know and then and then you're kind of like."
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Now those things are it's hard to manage it it's kind of like we have to. treat ourselves almost like you know little kids and that you know you try to encourage them to you know eat their meals and not just have snacks all the time and. You know um but, again, like, I guess, my one of my thoughts for you is like, why do you want to change that behavior because it's not illegal to eat snacks."
10704.0,Patient,"No it's not, but I think I just want to feel better."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay so yeah it's it's about how you want to feel it's not because you're trying to be a good person, because sometimes like there we we get in our heads and a lot of people who are eating issues. tend to fall into this category of i'm i'm a good person if or like if I eat good food i'm a good person it's kind of like this if I exercise i'm a good person if I. do the right things if I do all the if i'm the soccer mom if i'm the church person if i'm the if my house is clean. You know if I do all the things from the PGA person, you know that it makes you feel like somehow you're doing something right it kind of becomes a little bit of identity, and I was wondering, but for you, it sounds like it's more like I want to feel better. versus trying to prove myself to myself."
10704.0,Patient,"Now, I think that might be something I want to prove to myself, maybe others I don't think it's necessary, I think it would be a good person I do definitely do the part of me that wants to just show that I can do it. Or the. You know just feel better I mean also feeling better part of that too."
120.0,Provider,"yeah because it is interesting how. You know, advertising frequently centers around people like I tried this protein shake and then they're super thin stricker they're smiling. lose you know and the APP energy all day, and you know what it's kind of like it makes in your mind like this thought of oh I should be doing what she's doing you know. yeah or you know and they're like like there's this this phony website that like women laughing alone with salad or something and it's like hundreds of pictures of advertisement of women. Eating salad and just laughing hahaha you know, in the joke ginger like when your salad tells you a hilarious joke, because it was like haha. Like they're just so happy salad yeah it's just it's fun and of course they're all like. made up, they all look like they're like beautiful and. And so kind of like can can do a number on us like we're supposed to be doing that, too, and that's we're supposed to be achieving. yeah, but I think one of the things to go back to was today what am I real goals, what are the things that are most important to me, is it to. Do the right do you eat like that, because society says i'm supposed to, or is the value is my value more than my core value being that I want to have a strong body or I want my body to last. I want to have sustained energy, you know or whatever."
10704.0,Patient,yeah I think definitely would like just have more energy. I do think my work is just is draining.
120.0,Provider,"Well, especially when you talk about the rooster he's outside. Especially when you work in the kind of work that you and I do where you care about people and you know, and when you whenever you care, it creates more investment in something. yeah potentially is draining."
10704.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,"You know so. I mean other jobs can be like boring, or like soul crushing like you know if you worked like I don't know doing something like that, on a on a on a conveyor belt or something like that. yeah, but what is the kind of work where. We think about things and worry about people and try to think of how to help them I get that that can be draining and little bit of a different way."
10704.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's one that compassion fatigue.
120.0,Provider,or yes.
10704.0,Patient,"yeah i've heard of that yeah and I think that's true like it's just you know you're trying you hear so much about these kids in the problems, and you know so much about their family lives and someone's lost her job and now they're struggling or this kids homeless and you're just like. You know it's tough mm hmm."
120.0,Provider,yeah what does it mean to they have kids that are actually living in homeless shelters.
10704.0,Patient,wow have a child who doesn't know.
120.0,Provider,me how do you yeah that's going to be so hard because it's like that parent probably doesn't have the bandwidth be helping with homework when they're trying to survive.
10704.0,Patient,"Just we help them in the child's only three to be helping their child it's like and we're trying to support them and, but the same time she needs to be the one. Who makes these phone calls, and I mean she doesn't English is their second language. which makes things more complicated, but there's only so much we can do to help her."
120.0,Provider,yep yep that's for sure.
10704.0,Patient,"You know and and you feel bad because I don't know what it's like to be i've never been homeless. I mean we have financial worries, but I never worried about what i'm sleeping or or for eating. Now, and. it's just tough and then you get you know, trying to help her and you feel so bad at doing this and, like. And he had some stuff here some severe behaviors and we knew the daycare was going to be kicking them out, this is behaviors and just and you're like what can we do to stop it, and then we can't. And it's unfortunate but we can't stop you know. And he was kicked out and and."
120.0,Provider,"You know, maybe, just like aggressive to other kids or something or what is it yeah."
10704.0,Patient,"it's just very he was aggressive he screams a lot, he was also the daycare that really couldn't handle him. do better in a different Center so it's not a desolate bad thing he kicked out just in the sense that now moms in a tough position, but we knew this was. going to have a mom knew it was going to happen, and she didn't really take steps to do anything I look around at other places like do something, because you know he's going to be kicked out soon."
120.0,Provider,Right yeah she should have been a little bit more proactive about.
10704.0,Patient,That you know.
120.0,Provider,And then.
10704.0,Patient,"You know, we gave her like paperwork to like get a wrap up get a wraparound support or something and she's not doing anything with the bundy like. You know. Right she needs help her."
120.0,Provider,"Help the situation, yes she's got it she's got a wants it to be different enough. To do something about it."
10704.0,Patient,And then now there's somebody helping to shelter helping her find new daycare mm hmm so you know and.
120.0,Provider,She able to work and stuff.
10704.0,Patient,what's that.
120.0,Provider,She working as you.
10704.0,Patient,guys were.
120.0,Provider,So she's working.
10704.0,Patient,"And she liked to daycare he was at because it was right across the street, from where she worked."
120.0,Provider,"yeah. Too bad he wouldn't couldn't have handled that they're a little better. Well, what can I do for you today is there anything on your mind that you wanted to talk about or. or check in about."
10704.0,Patient,I don't think so. I don't think so.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, how do you feel like you're doing in regards to or what I guess what would you. Like between like where you are right now and kind of what some of your goals are as far as meeting with me, what would you, what do you feel like would be helpful to work on, or is there, something that you feel like. um you would like to kind of set as a goal of some sort."
10704.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think the biggest struggle, I really am having now is, I have this constant feeling of feeling scatter and I am scattered because my office is a mess. Now we have a new puppy so the you know the House, because just torn paper all over the place and shoes and socks not where they're supposed to be. In my husband he works, a lot so he's not really able to help with that and that's fine I mean I appreciate that i'm not that's not a complaint and then my daughter well she's searching and you know. Highly needed, this is not something that she picked up either and it's. And I really need to work on how not to feel so scattered all the time. And I think scattered is what leads to forget for this. And I do they need to need to contact instead of that appointment with my neurologist but I don't know that's going to help us get to know being on medications just gonna solve anything."
120.0,Provider,Have you been tested for ADHD.
10704.0,Patient,I think I I have I yeah I did have nor psychological exam they found the habit executive dysfunction or. Okay syndrome something like that which is.
120.0,Provider,executive functioning.
10704.0,Patient,"yeah and then Oh, it means the. dysfunction of your Executive functioning skills."
120.0,Provider,yeah it's hard for you to kind of keep track of different things at the same time and yeah.
10704.0,Patient,"yeah it's hard it's hard to stay organized and then I see that in my daughter and i'm like. You know, wishing she had picked up I don't know where she would pick it up from but like. You know."
120.0,Provider,"yeah well it's hard it's hard you know, have you ever thought about. I mean, this is not something that I do, but like a life skills coach or somebody that like an organization coach."
10704.0,Patient,I would even go for that.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I know that there are. There are services for like learning like organizational like skills like like people who help with budget or people will help with. I mean there's housekeepers if you just need help with cleaning i'm thinking about doing something like that, and I feel horrible about up doing it because i'm one person and so. All of the mess I created my own, and I feel horrible, but I also you know i'm like maybe I need to accept that I need some help with this."
10704.0,Patient,"yeah we, I mean we have had a house cleaner before, and it was nice but we just couldn't afford. yeah I mean have somebody come out like every week. Every other week."
120.0,Provider,"Well, one thing about having a dog around it definitely does teach you pick up your stuff because it gets chewed on if you don't. yeah you know so like that was what taught me my shoes upon in a closet is of on the floor. yeah and not leaving like socks on the ground, or whatever, because they end up."
10704.0,Patient,yeah we've gotten better at that will mean I have my daughter hasn't.
120.0,Provider,Yet so there's a few things and then she'll be like.
10704.0,Patient,"I know. And I found her event sneakers in the dog's mouth and i'm like he's gone it's going to add. One day. she's gonna destroy it, and because right now she's in you know, always with somebody. And you know that's you know, like that's eventually going to stop."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that'll be a lesson for your daughter, that is not. it's a great lesson because it's not life threatening is not going to killer but she'll be mad but it'll teacher, you know, he was like i'm not going to buy more shoes that's not in the budget year your shoes got yeah yeah she's got ruined, because you left them on the floor. Yes, you know and then she throw fed, but I get. or whatever like Okay, but."
10704.0,Patient,not going anywhere.
120.0,Provider,yeah exactly well then wear your shoes dog. bites in them because.
10704.0,Patient,You know that's gonna happen waiting for that to happen.
120.0,Provider,"yeah but that's that's kind of a natural consequence of that, but. You know I like I don't know I mean there's a lot of little skills, if you if you would be interested in them there's a lot of websites that offer little skills like organizational skills like that, because I look at that, too, because, like I I get flustered with stuff like that, too, and. But I know one thing that I i've been i've tried to do, I read this in a article, and I was like that makes sense is I kind of divided things. By like a 10 minute task, or like a 30 minute task, or like a 32nd task or two minute task, and then I tried to like say, well, I got 10 minutes before my show starts if i'm if i'm watching a show or I got. yeah 15 minutes before this meeting starts, I can I can do a 15 minute task, like, for example, cleaning cleaning the cat box. is maybe maybe a 1015 minute tax and it's hard but i've got to do it and so like yesterday I was like I got i've got 15 minutes between clients, I can go and click the cat box real quick or. I also had to unload some hey yesterday that I had bought until like I gotta go do that, and so I kind of try to squish it in or throw a little laundry and while you're doing something else. Okay, and things like that can help if you divide it in categories. Okay, I know that's that's one skill that I began, I you're a smart person you don't need this information let's see um she's such a cat. A cat lose. she's she's just like what or. i'm a big list maker to do you ever make."
10704.0,Patient,and make lists I just always following them yeah.
120.0,Provider,Because I love being able to scratch it off.
10704.0,Patient,And then I do like that to.
120.0,Provider,isn't do you ever write stuff that you already did to so you can scratch it off.
10704.0,Patient,yeah. decided i've it yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah so like I did something, but you can even get stickers you know that you give yourself a sticker if you accomplished. Like one thing that i've done again that's been another This is something that I have tried to do is make a list and then pick one thing from that list to do on that day, and so I think, by the end of today i'm going to vacuum, the living room."
10704.0,Patient,Okay.
120.0,Provider,"or whatever just pick one thing, and so, by the end of the day, you're like I can't go to bed yet until it back in because that was what I was going to do it was like a promise to myself."
10704.0,Patient,yeah okay.
120.0,Provider,"You know, and so i'm not going to do all of the things in the list i'm just going to do this, one thing or before going to bed I gotta clean the cat box or. I got to. Like I always have errands I gotta go run like right now, I have a load of stuff I need to take to like the thrift store to you know to donate or have you know some things I gotta return and. Things like that, so I try to like. You know or plan one day i'm going to do that, sometimes, that that can help like a big calendar is great."
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because, then you."
10704.0,Patient,Get her school work on there too.
120.0,Provider,"yeah because then it's like Oh, because I wish it was executive functioning because that was executive functioning it's like you have a hard time seeing a big picture, and like timelines."
10704.0,Patient,yeah i'm a nightmare sorry my daughter is calling from it.
120.0,Provider,"that's fine so then. If you have like a big Calvin I mean do you put on put your paper you can make a really big so that it's very that you can write on the days what things you need to get done that day, you know. You know, things like even simple things like flossing your teeth or. You know, whatever little things you're like I need to do better, that you could always do that sort of thing and that and that can help. yeah with the scattered, you know just because, otherwise, you are do you ever had the experience, where like your brain is spinning with things to do, but then you're like I don't know what to do until you kind of don't do anything. yeah that happens to me a lot. yeah The other thing you can do is make a list and then write a B and C next to the things like what are the tasks, what are the be tasks to see tasks because, like in a task might be get to the cat box because it's gross or. You know, mail the credit card bill because it's do or whatever, and a be you know be tasked might be clean the bathroom and because no one's going to die if you don't. yeah to see tasks might be, you know reorganize the file cabinet or something like that that's not an idiot but would be good to do one of these days. Yes, you know that that that idea, so I don't know if that's that helps to kind of break it into smaller steps."
10704.0,Patient,"command you try to break test down, they could use checklists instead I have some checklists that useful work. To make sure I have everything I need."
120.0,Provider,yeah because it's hard it's it doesn't come natural for a lot of people.
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know where you're you just have a lot of things kind of going on in your mind at any given time. But I think prioritizing is definitely. A skill that can help save time over time. Yes, you get more stuff done. Is your husband good at that or does he struggled with it too."
10704.0,Patient,I guess he's okay with it.
120.0,Provider,"So, like like he's Okay, with it, like he's good with it, or that he doesn't care that much like it."
10704.0,Patient,doesn't seem to be a problem for him. So.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean one thing you could do to with with, especially with Mera, is, I think, once before, but maybe establish some places in the House that are that are the clean places like. yeah like a living room or something like that, like you, don't ever leave crap in here, you know, like you, don't leave your backpack in here you don't need shoes or socks, and like this is a room that you don't leave paper sitting around."
10704.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I have to go back to that, especially now with the dog like nothing. is left in here."
120.0,Provider,"Well yeah and you could have like the not no dog place to especially while your puppy is young, you know. yeah because dogs need containment, just like gets you."
10704.0,Patient,"know, I think, having a toddler like. you're into everything. And she's so much energy and you're like oh my God like."
120.0,Provider,"uh huh. yep that's one thing that I recommend I thought i'm going to do it after this after this meeting is walk the dogs because attire dog is a good dog, so I know if I go out and walk them for half hour."
10704.0,Patient,will be happy yeah.
120.0,Provider,yeah then then they'll come home and rest for.
10704.0,Patient,haven't seen it to my daughter i'm like you have to walk she needs energy needs exercise and. you're having a fenced in yard so she doesn't get to go outside. If we take her out and we take a lot but it's like they're short little walk like she needs to get out and play and run.
120.0,Provider,Around and yeah do all the dog things that. They need to be able to do.
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know it's hard, just like little kids need to have you know structure and stuff to. But."
10704.0,Patient,I use a lot of like the behavior techniques like that we use are the dog the offseasons ad like.
120.0,Provider,"uh huh yep it's raw it's very similar. mm hmm same same principles and and the funny thing is it works for people, but with people kids are people. Like adults to. You know, but we just kind of struggle, a little bit as adults doing it with ourselves, because you're like well I don't really have to do it, you know."
10704.0,Patient,As I could push it off.
120.0,Provider,"yeah exactly we're good at letting ourselves off the hook, whereas we can. hold our kids accountable and hold their animal to a schedule, but ourselves were like oh just watch one more episode of this or i'll just you know I can clean the cat box tomorrow or."
10704.0,Patient,"Whatever he can he not happy about that, but yeah."
120.0,Provider,"I know I know the castle let you know that they're on it they're not happy, but um. yeah I mean another thing you can do with your daughter is just put herself in her room, so you know put yourself in a room with your own you can let your Ruby as messy as you want it to be. Like you can have yourself sitting out here."
10704.0,Patient,"You know yeah and we have been hard on hand and she has been doing better with that Christians to like. Her women's like explode into the hallway she wouldn't want it, but you put it in the hallway. And you're like I. Just know."
120.0,Provider,These past my past this threshold of the door.
10704.0,Patient,"Yes, he. is in your room and. that's it."
120.0,Provider,"Like I said comes out here, I know what I used to work residential treatment, a lot of the kids struggles with that so. If they left their stuff out and we found it like I mean other than that they were just like. Running to the bathroom or something, but if you left something out but, at the end of the day, if it was just like left out, and not put in their room, then it would go in a box for like 48 hours and get locked in a cupboard so they couldn't have it for 48 hours. Okay, so like you know, like what's my homework okay well, you should have put it somewhere else, then it. would have been locked up or. Or, and then, if they wanted to get it out if they really needed it and they could do an extra chore like okay well go wash wipe wipe down the chairs in the kitchen or something like that you know it's a little bit of an extra chore or something."
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,So sometimes that can help but it's hard to when you struggle with it also. Your data to better mm hmm. You told yourself to the same.
10704.0,Patient,thing yeah yeah and that's where it's tough.
120.0,Provider,"yeah really I can't have my stuff sitting everywhere, if I don't make her make her stuff. For sure. The struggle is real."
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,So what do you think about that idea of creating like a calendar me does that sound reasonable to you or what do you think would be helpful.
10704.0,Patient,"yeah do I think we need some kind of calendar, that we can all see with mayor school work on there um."
120.0,Provider,it's actually a really fun. weekend project or something to do with her go get some butcher paper a big poster board.
10704.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,You know and draw it out and you could even put little I don't know you do whatever you want you where they get stickers or something.
10704.0,Patient,yeah you know it will help us all see what's going on.
120.0,Provider,"yeah. My mom we used to have a calendar in our kitchen, but it was like a flip calendar and. which was always helpful to me could see on it when things were what things were happening and whatnot. But what I always was hard was when it was like like today is the 29th and so like oh it's still September but October is not that far away and so unless you can see all the days like. yeah together, you know, like two or three months out sometimes and you forget that the next month is pretty close."
10704.0,Patient,"I know that. Mary has a test on October 1 you know which is fine, just like she said what's on October 1 month that's fine. Right it's. far away, I like oh yeah i'm like it's hard to believe."
120.0,Provider,"Well, especially if you mark the day off as you. get through like that's super helpful because then you can actually visually see it, especially if you're like a visual person. yeah you know when I was in Grad school I it was like I had a two year program and I took pieces of paper like this, like notebook paper and I drew out. each month, how many days and everything on each month and I put all the papers like tape on my wall in my apartment. And then I would write down where that they decide like when the thesis is were do when all the different drafts were do and and then I would cross them off and then even already under graduation. Because it was fun to see like this is where i'm going to graduate and. yeah so it really helps to have kind of a trail."
10704.0,Patient,yeah. it's a good idea.
120.0,Provider,So that so that can be helpful i'm gonna write that down as something that you're going to try to do.
10704.0,Patient,yeah Peter calendar something.
120.0,Provider,"And another another idea that can be helped, I was listening to a book about habits and it was talking about. How, you know habits don't change, you know, like when you're trying when you're dealing with a habit that you don't like it's really hard to change. By just not doing it, you know you have to cheat you have to create a new habit. yeah and that's hard you know, like I you know, like instead of putting my backpack like I thought my backpack on the floor and i'm like no i'm going to put it on top of my dog CRATE because it's on the floor gets dirty and I forget. it's there, and all that, like so just a new habit or a habit of washing the dishes. Before going to bed like don't need dirty dishes overnight. yeah things like that you know can, but you got to create a new habit and not a. sin yeah it's it's a struggle, you know, but you could do start the habit of keeping your chef in your room. yeah or. Whatever I think the reason why so without it, because i'm always afraid if I don't have it in front of me i'm I forget about it."
10704.0,Patient,yeah i'm the same way yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because i'm like I already have so many things going on, that if I don't have it sitting there i'm gonna be like oh yes i've got to get that done."
