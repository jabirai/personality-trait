Oh, my I was just like I don't know if I can go on another roller coaster I said I said, well, let me, let me just do it like maybe like a like a chill one that's not so you know loop de loop and gone way up in the air and.

Because it's very, very complicated but. I I I just have anxiety from being up in the air now and I thought you know. stuff like that i've never really had before so it's kind of a new thing for me."
741.0,Provider,Right okay well today i'm going to ask you a whole bunch of really personal questions so that I can get to know you find out where you're at and see how I can best assist you. And that first question that I have is where do you live How long have you lived there who you live in with tell me about your living situation.
16827.0,Patient,"Well, currently i'm living in my mother's rv in her backyard, which is fine. However, I. Look, for my coffee. And I met my least ended in indianapolis live up until. mang this last year of 2021. And I really kind of. wasn't sure if I wanted to still live in India or or come back to Ohio because i'm from Ohio. So. I was discussing with mom and everything and she had told me she's like well just just come back here and everything for the summer and everything, while you get our thing figured out and get some money you know um you know stacked up and everything and. I agree. I mean mom lives in a little small town called midway, which is about 25 minutes from Columbus Ohio so it's a town of like 250 people."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
16827.0,Patient,"yeah really sucks because I live in indianapolis indianapolis is a big city and I, and I. love. I love the conveniences of the city. I do not like it out here there's like nothing out here, but Cornfields."
741.0,Provider,it's.
16827.0,Patient,"even like to go to the gas station that's like two and a half miles to the gas station which is by the highway exit, which is the gas station even isn't even open all night either so it's like if it's after 10 o'clock kind of screwed. You can. go down to the next exit to go, you know get whatever you need. So i'm still hearing the camper I don't like it, however, I have HIV so there's Ryan white program that does help with housing and assistance to housing. So i'm actually just transferred my Ryan white to Columbus so Columbus has Ryan white Part A, and then the rest of the state has Ryan white part be. So there i'm still waiting to hear an update from them, I think I have an appointment Monday with my regular doctor, just as a checkup and everything. But they're supposed to help me assist with housing because it's getting cold here and I don't know if he's ever been an rv before, but in the wintertime an rv isn't really that insulated. I mean it mean it's not too bad I got it I got everything you know kind of like I put I put a blanket up to the door and everything so that's where most of the one more America escapes from but other than that it's me it's 66 in here right now but it's 56 degrees outside."
741.0,Provider,So I.
16827.0,Patient,"might actually actually warm today. But plans are I really want to move to Columbus Columbus is a very big city very accepting as far as LGBT community is concerned, if you haven't noticed am gay but that's not really doesn't define me as a person. But I do kind of I do kind of look for the acceptance and the you know comfortability of of the of the LGBT community and where I want to live that you know I mean."
741.0,Provider,Right yeah I understand that.
16827.0,Patient,"I want to be, I want to be comfortable and feel accepted where i'm where i'm living, of course."
741.0,Provider,A sense of safety and increase.
16827.0,Patient,"That, and you know being from Ohio. Being from Ohio actually i've been in Columbus and you know i've been visited Columbus Ohio State universities there and I feel rather safe in Columbus so Columbus has got a lot going for them, they have a lot of. Development it's actually since because it's been about three years since I when I came back about three years. Since i've been to Columbus Columbus has completely changed, they have a lot of development and there's a lot, it looks like there's a lot going for them, considering that the price of rent there is cheaper than the rest of the state is really surprising."
741.0,Provider,wow.
16827.0,Patient,"Because it's the capital, the capital city you think so, the capital city. The price, the price of living would be you know. More than the rest of state but it's not it's really actually I can I can find it an apartment or flat for like 550 600 a month. As opposed to Dayton, which is you know the city towards the West, probably the main city towards West side Cincinnati their rent is close to 1700 dollars a month and I just don't understand you know where's the you know what what's going on here."
741.0,Provider,"Right what's the difference. Do you have a religious preference, by any chance."
16827.0,Patient,I don't but I grew up as as a basketball game.
741.0,Provider,Okay um and have you been in a controlled environment in the last 30 days like have you been in. In a hospital or in treatment or in jail or anything like that.
16827.0,Patient,um no and preferably I want to stay as far away from the hospital as possible.
741.0,Provider,and your fan. And now I felt very dangerous because they're.
16827.0,Patient,"they're full of germs are full of people who've got proven and they are full of people that mostly a lot of medical personnel are there for the money and not because they were truly care about people so they're there they don't really give a shit about you, you know what I mean. And i've always felt that way about hospitals and about button at the medical field, so please keep me as far away as possible from it, please."
741.0,Provider,"hi so have you ever been hospitalized like overnight you've already told me, you have HIV, do you have any other chronic medical problems."
16827.0,Patient,"I mean like I haven't been hospitalized overnight recently no it's been quite a few years. I think the last time I actually was at the hospital was when I had pneumonia and I remember that, like, I was on the floor with like. A hot towel like on my chest, and then turning the right back and it's like it's also hard to even take a breath and I knew that you see a cigarette my hand right now and you're probably like oh my God, why are you getting smoking. But, besides the point know like they they with my roommate took him to the hospital and everything and they gave me a bunch of pills, to take, and then took me an x Ray and they kept me every night just to make sure that you know everything was okay. However, I think I might have sleep apnea it's been told by my previous partners that I that the notice that I stopped breathing in my sleep, however i'm still here i'm 30 years old and i'm still here i'm not dead, yet so i'd rather actually must die in my sleep if I was to die. Please take me, you know, taking calmly and I wish my cat would stop like oh my gosh she's driving you nuts. She jumping around, and you know, destroying shit not really destroying she's like eight years old, she just wants to go outside that's what it is i've let her outside four times already this morning."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
16827.0,Patient,"Yes, she does she likes to mom mom lived in a town of 250 people and it's not that busy so she knows where the food comes from. So I mean I live outside during the daytime you know when it's nice outside we're not when it's freezing cold, because obviously obviously it'd be like the POP right the cat fall Brenton snow from outside they're like nope. Ray right yeah but yeah. As far as hospitalizations go no I don't really want to be in the hospital unless you know it's life or death or you know, obviously, if i've got a serious car accident or anything like that. Now, when I came back from phoenix in 2017 I was detoxing from 125 milligrams of acid, and today i'm not. kind of more by choice versus anything apparently my I came back a day later I had a couple take homes with me. From phoenix to get me to Ohio to get me to transfer to a clinic but I came back a day late because I could not drive you know I. I gave them an estimation of how long it would take me to drive, but I have the cat with me and all the shit and everything, so I took an extra day and had to take an extra day to drive one because that was going into detox from you know splitting my doses in half. Trying to make black and white, and I was trying to think about being split you know going into detox but I needed. An extra time and extra day and got back to Dayton and that's where i'm supposed to be transferred to at a clinic there but they said there that since I. My paperwork wind up with the day before, and they had to they had to rerun the whole people working, and it was a bunch of clerical bullshit. And I said Okay, whatever and I walked out of the clinic and I said Okay, whatever and I tried to I tried to just deal with it and I probably should have really went to the hospital. In a medical setting to have to be detox there because i've heard that it's very, very serious. With methadone detox However I sit on my bedroom floor in the fetal position sweating and crying my eyes out for about three or four weeks and finally by like three and a half weeks and four weeks I said screw this and I went and got percocet and. got my tolerance level down with PR cassettes down to a point to where I can make the jump to suboxone at that point in time, because I knew that you know, making the jump to suboxone from that high of a point of percocet or i'm sorry methadone was not going to be foreseeable. Would maybe actually affect me more. what's the word i'm looking for. It would have a bad a bad rebound effect, it probably wouldn't do anything for me at that point. But, but I chose not to be a hospital so because I didn't I just didn't want to be there, you know."
741.0,Provider,So do you have your tonsils and your appendix and those types of things you still have all of that in.
16827.0,Patient,My tonsils removed when I was like four.
741.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so no tonsils."
16827.0,Patient,"I should, I should be going for a gallbladder surgery soon, because it's I have a little bit of problems with that currently. Right how However, I think that's actually the antiretroviral that i'm on Victor Harvey. I think that it's. destroying my organs, to be honest with you. it's."
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16827.0,Patient,"There we go. um so i'm on that every day as a as a as a daily antiretroviral to keep my. My viral load down below and detectable level I think it's 20 as the threshold. And the last blood work I had, I think I have. I think it showed two copies two copies, but when I found out in 2019 I had almost 2 million copies, and my system. And that was really I do, I still don't really understand it. I I look at all the the bloodwork results and everything on my medical i'm not in my chart and everything I still don't understand it, but you know i'm hoping that you know. My my infectious disease doctor, you know would tell me if anything is wrong, or if anything is to be noted of i'm. Fine, but i'm you know i'm trusting that you know everything is okay, I feel okay. I don't understand the fact of. Of the gallbladder issues that i'm having like I have to watch how much dairy products that i'm that i'm consuming I can't have a whole milk shake or also be sitting the whole afternoon and pain. yeah one of the two, and you know I just got to watch, you know dairy dairy intake as well, and a lot of the times, pasta and take two, which is also kind of celiac. Sally excellent activity um."
741.0,Provider,But also probably and. high fat foods.
16827.0,Patient,"Right I don't eat I don't have the best diet i've lived but I love fruits and I try. I try to I try to get like fruit cups of the store any fruit cups I love pineapple. and strawberries and blueberries and I love stuff like that, however, I do love sugar sugar, just as well."
741.0,Provider,"right, of course, so is there a family history of heart disease or. Diabetes or or cancer or anything like that in your family."
16827.0,Patient,"i'm on my mom's side of the family, we have a history of high blood pressure. I think actually everybody on. My mom's side of the family is on high blood pressure medication. and actually I was on the Senate bro when I went to jail, and I know that's a bad a bad reference, but I went to jail. For only 20 days, because I violated protection order. But the the the nurse there put me on less than a pro because my my blood pressure was high, and I am I was actually I had I went to the nurse's station, because I had chest pains. And these chest pains were they weren't like stabbing, but they were like they were very achy and it was just consistent and my monkey and the cell told me so go to the nurse. Is that could be very serious, well, I got out of jail and everything and I went to go see my doctor about two or three days later. And he said he wasn't going to continue to put me on the Senate pro because I was using methamphetamine at the time, and I said, well, I wasn't using methamphetamine entail, obviously. But and but he's like well until you get off the until you stop using methods like well i'm not using math I said. I said I was only using it, because my my partner at the time was using it, and I said well you know you're wasting all of our money on drugs, I said I at least want some of the the you know the. The money that you're wasting on drugs or whatever, but um he he had a lot of social beliefs and he actually. said i'm currently actually looking for another PCP at this point in time, because this sociable he's I said a side of your social beliefs. I said I said, you know that's kind of negligence on your part if i'm telling you something's wrong something's wrong. I said, you should you should consider that and not put your social belief into the point of i'm not gonna i'm not going to keep you on this medication just because you know you have you, you have the history of using this you know it doesn't make sense to me. But. That was two years ago. But."
741.0,Provider,If you have a physical disability.
16827.0,Patient,"um no. Not that I know of, I mean I can walk and I can talk and you know."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
16827.0,Patient,"I do, I do believe that maybe I think I might be bipolar i'm not gonna try to self diagnose, but over my life period just thinking ever since I was a teenager. I would go through. I think i'm on the high end of bipolar I think that would be, I have a lot of emotional highs on a lot, and you know most days I feel really good. Now, and then you know. You know, a couple of times, but you know every now and again i'll feel all have these really low points and I feel like where I I feel like I need to isolate myself away from everybody or I feel isolated always nervous and not alone, a lot of people understand you know get really emotional. And i'll feel like you know kind of alone, and like nobody really understands. But i'm not gonna try to self diagnose myself either, but i'm also not going to try to get myself into a mental Ward to find out."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's the highest grade in school that you complete it."

And like it would not go any further so something's wrong with the transmission of it. um so I gotta go take a look at it today, while it's actually halfway decent outside."
741.0,Provider,"Right Okay, so what was your longest full time job."
16827.0,Patient,"uh. I would say. Oh, my gosh let me think back here. That would probably be I was working at parties and um I had went to it was I started with hardy's with love's travel stops which you're probably familiar with being in Texas, because they're from Oklahoma. And I were I worked with them, I started with the restaurant side in them and parties and I opened up a couple of a couple of different locations. One being in Springfield Missouri I opened up one in Tennessee and then I opened up another one in Dayton here, and then I transferred actually to the standalone store parties so all together. I was with him for probably about three and a half, four years i'm just i'm in total. that's between working with the loves with loves and then working with the standalone parties because I was just kind of a transition into. A different company entirely because I was working with loves and loves has parties as part of their as part of their company, but um I wasn't actually working with parties, I was working with loves at parties so."
741.0,Provider,Then.
16827.0,Patient,"I transferred to the standalone store, because it was easier for me. Time and then. At the standalone store, I think, after the last year I was actually chef manager there, but was very underpaid and overworked."
741.0,Provider,"Right right, and so what was your last occupation."
16827.0,Patient,"um last occupation would be are you talking about current links, I do work currently I just I worked, I worked as an uber eats delivery and also. Shipping delivery the ship grocery delivery actually pays pretty damn well as far as that's concerned but it's still not enough to make the ends meet you know what I mean. Right so but i'm gonna say last regular. Regular job would be I was working with PSA airlines at the Dayton airport for the crew crew lodging scheduler they. Get I scheduled the flight attendants further overlays. I am hotels. And everything which is was enjoyable However I had an ex that actually cost me that job. I was in I was in a meeting, and it was a work from home position and I was in a meeting and I had we had an extra an extra room that I had set up set up, for you know my my office pretty good. and So I had the door shut and everything whatever and you know, I was in this meeting, trying to pay attention this meeting and he's over here, on the other side of the door thinking i'm sneaking people in through the window and having sex with them. and"
741.0,Provider,Okay.
16827.0,Patient,"Go to this day, he actually has come to conclusion that he has mental issues. And everything and I had told him all along that I think there's something wrong. And I don't want to you know condemn you as a person, but you know there's something wrong with you in mentally in your brain because he had cost me that job. Fighting with me through the door, I had slammed his hand on the door frame trying to get him to say leave i'm in a meeting you know i'm at work, leave you know, whatever your problem is we'll take care of it after I get done. You know. So I thought that I had the MIC on mute well the MIC was not on mute and people in the meeting heard everything. yeah so I had a meeting with my manager, the next day, and they let me go because of it. yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so have you ever been married."
16827.0,Patient,Oh no I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wants me.
741.0,Provider,"I wouldn't say that now and Okay, do you have any children."
16827.0,Patient,"No, not yet I do want kids at some point, but I don't think it's a very, very good decision right at this point to do so."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and on your mom's side of the family. Is there any substance abuse history."
16827.0,Patient,"um my mom actually struggles with alcohol dependency. I think she's gotten a little bit better recently I talked to her husband about it, which is he is my step dad but they got married after I was grown so but they live together and here at the House and everything. But he said that um she's a little bit better than what she was so she goes to her, you know it accelerates, and then you know kind of kind of decreases and everything, however i'm worried about the fact that she has. She gets prescribed. What is it i'm trying to think what it's called a."
741.0,Provider,gigantic.
16827.0,Patient,It was something like xanax but value value.
741.0,Provider,Now yeah yeah.
16827.0,Patient,yeah value so she gets prescribed volume and her with her alcohol.
741.0,Provider,Dependency makes us with alcohol and that's a terrible combination.
16827.0,Patient,"I don't know if she quite does it right mixing it right away, but. I just sit she gets prescribed that and she drinks, on top of that, which I know is not a good combination, so that does worry me that she has access to that and she has a prescription for that I don't know what kind of life she's telling her doctor but. it's concerning to me because she's the only my mom i'm ever going to have obviously you know I don't."
741.0,Provider,want to lose my okay. What about your grandparents or any aunts and uncles any of them have any issues.
16827.0,Patient,"So my grandma my grandma my grandpa my dad side is gone and my grandfather on my dad's side was an alcoholic my dad is an alcoholic. my grandmother I don't think I my dad side was was very substance abuse she did have some health problems as far as you know, blood pressure and heart disease, and she had arthritis as well, but she's gone she was going two years ago I think so. My grandma my mom's side she's still alive at 81 years old alive and kicking I don't think she's ever done drugs drink or smoke cigarettes or anything so she's in. Decent house, however, her brother and her sister who should be my great uncle my Green gradient are both gone. migrating and had a pacemaker put in several years ago, and she was dependent on opiates as well, shoes, she was in pain pills, and you couldn't get stop you couldn't you couldn't tell her to stop you know she was like i'm gonna die soon anyways and i'm going to die, with regard to this. You know, so we let her do, what do her whatever. She was very dependent on it, and you know when it was time for her to take for perk. or percocet she was fiddle and threw her purse get really antsy and everything, and you know it's not I didn't I had seen her in years, so my grandma is not dependent on any kind of medication medication, she has to take as far as you know. I don't even know what kind of medication she takes, but I know that she takes a couple different medications and everything she cannot take opiates or anything like that she has. She has not actually happened, she said she has an allergy to opiates and she's to be a nurse, so I you know, I trust that she says that when you know, and she says, I don't i've never really heard. Allergy opiates but."
741.0,Provider,It happens.
16827.0,Patient,yeah it's understandable and.

16827.0,Patient,"Sadly, I have stepbrother stepbrother two stepbrothers and stepsister from my dad side, but I mean that's not really. they're not even really that because that dad. If they're not by the same father or mother or anything like that it's just you know dad met and needed in 2001 and they're her kids. But I, but in my teenage years from like you know 1212 years old, up till I was like you know 1718 years old, I grew up with them and everything so those important years right there you know to their high school and everything I, we were all in the same household. So I spent you know from 13 to 17 with dad. They got shared parenting and did the whole legal process when I was like you know searching resolved into thanks mom had custody of me until then."
741.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and I, you see, I already know you're not satisfied with your living arrangements are you satisfied with not being married at this point."
16827.0,Patient,i'm lonely. and isolated today somebody however i'm not going to settle for for anything less than what I expect.
741.0,Provider,and
16827.0,Patient,"i'll tell you like I i'm kind of on a couple of dating Apps and everything in my inbox is like the line at the chick fil a drive thru i'm. Not gonna lie but and i'll be honest that that line at the chick fil a drive thru I probably will find maybe one i'll be lucky if i'm to somebody intriguing to actually have a conversation with that doesn't just want to have sex with me. know so like i'm. Like i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of cute whatever and people tell me that and but i'm not going to. i'm trying to think of the words for this i'm not once you settle for anything less than perfect in my, in my opinion, I know what i'm worth i'm not gonna sell myself short i'm also not going to. You know. Just because they want to, they want to do that with me that's fine, but I want to be able to have somebody that I can have. A substantial conversation with me as well, somebody that I can say that strikes my interest and somebody that has that grabs my attention which I I i've come across you know one person here recently that's grabbed my attention and that i'm. Very much actually intrigues me and can have conversation with me, however, i'm in no hurry to. make it a race to want to be an you know, a location, you know married and kids in the car and five five children, whatever. i'm in no hurry for that, because you know everything in my gut tells me to get to know a person thoroughly before you want to go into something serious, because then you might find out that freaking crazy and then. I want to I don't want to find that out, you know. To me it's really kind of stuck in though that was with the. The That was the problem with my ex that he kind of. kind of pushed me into one into being in a relationship with him when I wasn't ready for it actually I had just got out in the out of relationship and I need to time to you know heal from that and in he was he was ready for a relationship where I was I wasn't and I said well. I said hold on hold on a minute I said I don't know you, and then the whole entire issue with the whole relationship was you don't love me you don't let me, of course I don't love you I don't know who you are I need to learn you and learn who you are to love you.

Oh, give me a freakin break here, I said and I, and I. I called the dispatch myself, I said there's no emergency here, I said I think he's just in a state of psychosis because he's the one who had problems with methamphetamine use and he would not sleep, and I think that's where a lot of his problems came from. yeah and."

In August 2020 I came with the cake and started singing Happy Birthday I got a hold of need, I said as the home. And she said yeah and I said Okay, I was like well i'm gonna come on i'm gonna comment I got them a birthday cake, I know dad doesn't like cake, but it's the thought that matters and. You know everything was going good and it that it truly valued me that I could actually try to try to mend. A broken relationship of all my childhood together as an adult and it meant a lot to me. To try to get close to him well he kind of threw that out of proportion, one night when he was drunk and he told me that you're going to come shoot me. With this gun over an at amp T Internet bill that he thought I took out his name what i've said dad I said I better credit than you do, on your best day. I said I don't need I don't need your information, to take out take out an. Internet bills in your name I said, for one, is like I don't even have a team to Internet so anyway haven't talked to them, since. i'm and i'm okay with that because I knew he was in the wrong and one day he'll realize that he was wrong, and I hope it's sooner versus later. right but."

And I needed a ride somewhere, I was actually sitting at a hotel my hotel I you know, I was just check out and everything. I didn't have any money to extend the reservation and everything so i'm sitting actually down in the lobby of the hotel and. i'm you know i'm trying to find a ride, I mean it's pouring rain outside in April and i'm on the bad side of town. And everything and i'm just trying to find a ride to get home or somewhere, you know where you know, and I probably contacted at least 100 people you know over Facebook and you know in my phone book everything. Two people two people one person, they were at work and I understood, because I, you know. And I could i'm the on that level of friendship with this person that I can tell that you know hey I would take off work if I had to but I can't. And I understood. I understood and dylan which was I used to actually live at Dillon me and don't remain when I was younger and dylan is like a spitting image of me but black. He was born, the day before he was born a date for me, but a year after me so he's just like he's like pretty much the same person as me as far as astrology goes. Sorry, but he came and got me and everything and he was worried about gas and everything but, once he had one of his friends with him, but he took me to where I need to go and everything and I gave him gas money, the following week when I got when I got my check and everything. So um you know. I was a, you know as far as relationship with my friends, I probably have a good relationship with with my friends the people that I can depend on.
