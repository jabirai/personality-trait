416.0,Provider,hi let me get my headphones sure. There can you hear me.
9530.0,Patient,"I can, yes."
416.0,Provider,awesome how are you.
9530.0,Patient,"i'm okay just been busy I don't know if. You remember if, when we last talked I had completed moving everything out of my storage or not, but."
416.0,Provider,Just on that yeah.
9530.0,Patient,"Okay yeah so still working on all of that, because it's most of its in the garage but the garage was full and now it's half empty so i'm halfway there."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah can we talk to you are about to have a day off with your husband.
9530.0,Patient,yeah yeah That was good. We basically we're kind of the.
416.0,Provider,onset sorry.
9530.0,Patient,"yeah whatever. He always calls me his wife to everybody and i'm like well technically not yet, but whatever close enough. um so uh so yeah we had a day off it was really nice just kind of kind of had a lazy day slept in relax did stuff around the House didn't really go anywhere guest um. He really hasn't even had much time at the House, so you know we just hung out outside it was the weather was nice it wasn't too hawks it's been really hot here. But yeah it was nice."
416.0,Provider,How.
9530.0,Patient,This really enjoyed it I bet. He probably missing Daddy he does yeah.
416.0,Provider,"How with all this moving and everything, how is your pain been."
9530.0,Patient,"My pain it's been. Well, right after. I got back and return the U haul truck and everything die, the next two days were were really difficult just because I had overdone it. And it's it's still there, but it really just depends on what I do that day, and if it's a if it's a day, where i'm just on my feet, a lot, and you know moving heavy stuff around, then it hurts a lot and I have trouble sleeping that night for sure. But days, where I kind of take it easy, and you know stay off my leg I could I could maintain it with the with like you know ibuprofen and tylenol switching. It every. You know, four to six hours, it helps it if I stay on on top of it if I if I let it go too long and I forget to take something, then it's like oh great I gotta kind of get back to that tolerable level. But I feel like I feel like my pain is better now that i'm out of the trailer too, and I think a lot of that had to do with our sleeping because the bed, you know we're we're not exactly level all the time, you know the trailer kind of shifts and. The the mattress it was a great mattress but you know it was just on a piece of wood that open and had like a storage thing underneath so it didn't really have a great platform to it, and I think I think that. contributed to to my pain, sometimes also."
416.0,Provider,Oh for sure. Okay sounds good. I mean it sounds like you're are you still because you were doing like some yoga and stretching and stuff too right.
9530.0,Patient,"yeah I was, and I really need to get better at that I did it the other day and I felt good I was a little sore after because it had been a while, but. I do need to like set alarms and remind myself, because it does help when I do it, I just have to remember to do it and involve Lucas in it somehow because he. You know, he wants to do everything i'm doing and touch everything that I touch so he has to be involved with it, too, and I can't really depend on his NAPs because. Some days, he just doesn't nap and other times it's you know 20 minutes i'm like oh great that I was too fast."
416.0,Provider,But yeah so as a teaser.
9530.0,Patient,yeah exactly. Definitely.
416.0,Provider,um you were we were talking last time about seeing a few sort things for you.
9530.0,Patient,"Did you try that yeah I did. I I did try that and I need to do it again because it did work and it's also it's also teaching him, you know, at the same time. So that's good he knows the difference between you know his his toys and his cars versus his trucks and you know different things like that so. So yeah he's he's really good at that, and he already was good at you know the laundry when I wanted laundry time I sort everything and he's over there, trying to help me and he doesn't exactly do it right, but he's at least. You know, helping."
416.0,Provider,Exactly. yeah I I love putting kids to work and giving them a purpose and yeah so i'm all. yeah stuff.
9530.0,Patient,"It helps like even when he starts, you know acting up and just. You know just starting to be a. Little brat because it's time for a nap and he's refusing to do it, he if I don't give them a task for Tom oh go get that or go do that then he's just he's just me, you know so when I asked he's happy and willing to go do whatever I say so. I do use that a lot. Because it yeah you're right it helps."
416.0,Provider,build self esteem at each system lessons right they want to be harmful they want to feel. purposeful and useful in all of those things right.
9530.0,Patient,"Right yeah I know, sometimes you forget that, even though they're so small, like they they still have all those feelings and needs, you know."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah. Big time sometimes those are even bigger. Because they can relate them.
9530.0,Patient,Exactly.
416.0,Provider,So what's on your mind for today with. What do we want to.
9530.0,Patient,"See. i'm not too sure I did. I did apply for. childcare. So I got yeah. it's through the it's through the county and I don't really even know what programs, they have to offer, yet my submitted application yesterday morning, so I just basically got a confirmation so far that you know they received my application and it's in review. So I don't know i'm hoping that they have something for his age, because I noticed things that they kind of mentioned were. For school age, and then they also had a checkbox you know if your if your child if you're interested in your child for like. preschool three to four years old and he's not quite three yet so I didn't check that so that makes me think that I don't know if they're going to have something younger, I mean, hopefully, because I mean you know even as infants, people need childcare so."
416.0,Provider,Did you apply for early head start.
9530.0,Patient,"yeah I believe it's early head start it's I know I called early head start, and I was transferred all around and then the lady the last person I talked to she guided me to this website where you do apply for childcare, so I believe it's all through that yeah. I was like under the. early education part um. So yeah I I think I think I did right I hope so."
416.0,Provider,sounds like it if not i'll reach out to you and.
9530.0,Patient,"clarify yeah exactly yeah so I got. That done yeah and then my next project is. The travel trailer is still hooked up to my truck and the hitch on it is. This big heavy duty hitch that I purchased in Montana, and I needed it for the drive from Montana back to California. But the problem is my truck is a little low, I think the person that I bought it from lowered it a bit so when you're hauling something it's it's low to the ground, the hitch, and the hitch has this extra. piece underneath that really needs to be turned around and I don't have the tools to do it, but. I say that because the driveway kind of slant up, so I can't back it in with that hitch because it's going to hit and get stuck on the concrete. yeah so I. I picked up a different one when my sister was helping me with the move and. You know I grabbed it from walmart thinking, it would be fine and then just the other day I look at it and it says it holds up to 1000 pounds well the trailer ways at least 5000 pounds so i'm like that's not gonna work. return that one yeah so I gotta return that one, and then I ordered. Mark she ordered another one that holds up to 15,000 pounds so once that comes I could you know reconnected and then try to park it. And then figure out if it'll be okay if it fits for one because I got it I got to measure it's like the measuring meant it it's barely going to fit but it can't go onto the sidewalk at all so. I have to see if it fits and if it doesn't then we're going to have to store it for now until I figure out, you know what I want to do, I really don't want to get rid of it just because it's. You know, like I i've enjoyed having it and it saved us, for you know, a couple years having a. Real for our head. and financially, it would kind of I mean i'm. You know it's it's The good thing on my credit report, so I don't want to just you know give it back and have my my credit go further into the hole, so I do want to try to. You know, keep it and maintain it somehow so that's what we're trying to figure out now um and then yeah just trying to. Trying to. figure out what to do with Lucas, because the physical therapy was just it was. That, I have to call them because they they called me and they they kind of want to know what's going on, if we're coming back, and he has some sessions there that you know he's still approved for, but the thing is it's two hour drive. And so, for me, it's just it's so far and it's twice a week and I just I just don't think I have an enemy to do that so that's what i'm trying to focus on next is. You know, trying to get all the insurance figured out because you know, Oscar says that. he's you know he's a full time employee now so he should be getting the benefits but. You know I just don't know the timeframes I don't know if it's in a couple weeks I don't think he's received the information yet so. Then we have to fill it out, and you have to submit it so there's all that that time there wasted that i'm thinking well should I just suck it up and take them at least once a week to it, or just wait that's kind of what i'm not too sure. What to do there. And it's also my physical therapy to go to the same place so it's. Hard oh no."
416.0,Provider,there's no way to transfer it closer to you.
9530.0,Patient,"um there, I guess, there might be, because I have you know I have medical Lucas has medical and. I guess I, I guess, I guess, I could just apply for it out here or change address and then try to transfer it because. They want you to stay within your county. So that's right because."
416.0,Provider,Those county by county. Exactly.
9530.0,Patient,"I had to find one in specific areas for him to go to because they just don't approve outside of their county, so I would have to you know go through that process which i'm willing to do I just I just don't know which one's going to be faster. And then you know i'd hate to like establish him at one place, and then have to switch them again because the insurance makes you go somewhere else so i'm just kind of in limbo about that I don't really. know what to do, and you know I try to work with them here but it's it's not exactly the same he you know he does better when it's you know his."
416.0,Provider,His there and i'm going to his mama exactly.
9530.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah and you know they have the whole gym there, and all the. Oh yeah toys and tools to flow. rate, though. huh yeah. Oh, my goodness um."
416.0,Provider,So yeah there's I mean those are the sort of things where it's like hurry up and wait you can't.
9530.0,Patient,there's not much yeah you're.
416.0,Provider,Tolerating that is frustrating when you're. A baby things done.
9530.0,Patient,It yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,i'm sorry. i'm so you've got a lot going on but it's also kind of remarkable how much you've done like. How many steps you guys have already taken to just to kind of. Get settled in again.
9530.0,Patient,"yeah it is it's it's it's really been a blessing it just just like it just kind of all fell into place quickly it's like once once he. Once he received the job just everything you know everything went so fast, and you know because he was hired as a per diem which is you know pretty much kind of on call schedule whenever and. Within the first two weeks his boss just made everything happen and gave him all the hours, he wanted, so we were able to you know afford to get into a house and. Get all of that started, and now I mean yeah he's working a lot, but it it paid off and now he'll have a set schedule and you know it's up to him if he wants to you know take on extra days or not, whereas before it was just like yeah I do because we needed it, you know but. But yeah i'm still i'm still hoping, I could find something I just. I found a few yeah I found a few the other day that I want to apply for and. it's like every every morning I try to get up for Lucas, so that I can have time to focus on it, and like today, I got up at seven Well he woke up at 715 and usually sleeps till like nine."
416.0,Provider,"So how things go I yeah the data, you need them to sleep. they're going to wake up and the days that you need them to wake up their kind of sleep."
9530.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah. So I don't know i'm just kind of i'm just hoping that I guess it'll happen once i'm more settled because i'm not exactly you know ready yet I don't i'm not prepared for you know who's going to watch Lucas and all of that so. But it's just it's just kind of bothers them because I am I don't like having that ask for help, or ask for money and I just I don't like you know I guess not being in control of my own finances, and you know, being able to."
416.0,Provider,Right now you're relying on your.
9530.0,Patient,"fiance exactly yeah and I, you know. I haven't really had to do that and i've had to this past, you know ear and now definitely because. You know before my leg I can at least do some you know instacart and side things where I could you know make some money, and I can make my own hours doing it and. But now that that's even you know it's hard to do for one on my leg it's got to be a day, where i'm i'm filling up to it, and only for a few hours and then for to like I have nobody to watch Lucas for me."
416.0,Provider,"that's right. that's right, I mean it's kind of these things sort of do need to happen to some extent sequentially right. yeah there's just kind of know. You can't really worry about child care."
9530.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
416.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully that will get settled pretty soon, I mean. yeah that the application so."
9530.0,Patient,"Right yeah. And you know my mom she offers to help, but I, you know I explained to her and sometimes I just don't think she really understands, because you know she's two hours away too so. it's not really it's not as helpful as she thinks it's going to be, because then I have to spend four hours on the road, you know, taking them there bring them back. or having them spend the night and I don't really like to do that to her, because you know she's older and I know it's hard on her and he's at that age where he's just all over the place yeah yeah."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah for sure.
9530.0,Patient,"And it's you know it's hard on us, too, because we don't like him either way."
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm I get it yeah. yeah and yeah. it's um finding the right person that you can really trust to watch your child and your child in their care. it's really hard to do, and I know from experience that there's like a part of your brain that's so used to worrying about them and making sure seeing what they're doing and what it looks like. All the sudden when you do have someone that you can really trust in that you feel safe, you know handing them over to it's like there's this whole part of your brain you you'll get back. yeah and and you'll be able to focus more right like."
9530.0,Patient,He won't leave the top of your list you'll be able to shift and focus more and yeah But until that happens it's almost like. Almost feels impossible. To get you know.
416.0,Provider,Because your brain on batteries to do yeah it's really free yeah. But it will be because you will find that.
9530.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And when you do you're going to be like whoa I forgot, I have this part of my brain."
9530.0,Patient,"What happened exactly yeah yeah. I know i'm anxious for that, because sometimes I feel like i've just forgot everything you know, like I I opened a box, the other day, and it was different notebooks and documentation of. My job I had for eight years, like, I think I think I clicked in it was like 2014 or something and I just kind of glance through it before I you know got rid of it and i'm like wow I don't even remember Knowing all this stuff I sounded so smart I don't."
416.0,Provider,know what have you I don't.
9530.0,Patient,know if it means anymore. But it's just like crazy.
416.0,Provider,"back there you'll get back there. yeah yeah and when your brain is very occupied, this is the stuff that, like, I think. People don't prepare us for as moms but also. Especially when you have a child who has some level of an exception to lead right. Right it's different. And I think probably most moms feel this way, but especially when you have a kid who's you know, has a need that isn't kind of typical. Norway stuff. Yes, that there is. There are these like sort of fundamental changes that take place long after you actually give birth in terms of your attention and your focus and it is. Vital I mean it's the reason our species have survived is because moms. Protect right we watch out for our kids and our brains are very attuned to them, I mean we literally grew them right there half of us so. Right um so yeah it's like it is really hard to make that transition people do it, and you will too, but again it's really about like once you know your brain knows that he is safe and happy wherever he is."
9530.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,Then you will all that stuff will come back it's just there's no room for it right now.
9530.0,Patient,yeah yeah. You haven't lost you that's where it. was like. yeah. Now you're.
416.0,Provider,"you're still in there, all that stuff in there you're just yes at that age where it's it's really hard right because he's he's up and moving he's more of a handful than he used to be, when he was. Like sleeping all the time. Actually, and he has more needs and yet you know it's harder to find a place that. works."
9530.0,Patient,"yeah works and you feel comfortable with and trust yeah. I know because I so true, too, because I feel you know my first thought always is well everyone doesn't understand that yeah he may be running around, but he doesn't understand that. His balances off he doesn't lift his right leg as much so, when he's running he trips a lot he falls a lot like you have to be right there with him and. You know, even just everything he does he he's a little unstable and I just don't think that. Everybody knows that they just think he's like every other kid and can just go, you know take off and do this and he's going to be fine and not fall and can go up and down stairs because they think oh he's he's big enough now and it's like. Well yeah he can do some of those things, but he needs help doing those things still. that's that's what I worry about with my mom sometimes because she'll just kind of. You know she'll walk away and he's in the playroom all the playroom is like two steps down from the rest of the House and. I am like mom is going to try to come back up and follow you and he's gonna he can't come up the stairs on his own you know and he's like oh yeah I forgot it on so that's I just feel like other people are going to be like that, too, so so yeah it's just right it's just a you know."
416.0,Provider,you'll find the right spot there. yeah i'm somebody who gets him.
9530.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,I bet he's really fun to watch actually.
9530.0,Patient,"He is he is and my mom misses him so much he's like what can I see him again i'm like oh you'll see him soon and. During the movie yeah during. When I was you know moving stuff from storage she she watched them all day and we spent the night there and then my my nephew was there and he's so good, with him too he's four and he just he's like. he's super smart he talks he jumps he just he never stops going to and he looks out for lupus and he's always like oh Lucas don't go in that cabinet it's dangerous. it's so cute like and it'll be like a cabinet that probably has been cleaning supplies or. something you know but."
416.0,Provider,They had he's looking out.
9530.0,Patient,His yeah he looks out for me helps them up the stairs and it's just it's just really cute. My mom just loves it she baked with them and did all types of you know fun stuff so.
416.0,Provider,"it's gonna you know you are doing a lot of work, it does not have to happen right the second I know you put a lot of pressure on yourself."
9530.0,Patient,I do yeah.
416.0,Provider,"But it's you'll you'll get there and it'll be it'll be right when it happens, you know you'll."
9530.0,Patient,you're yeah.
416.0,Provider,"you're taking it your time to be thoughtful about this it's just some of this stuff is sequential and it's hard to slow down, but sometimes. You know, sometimes life makes us."
9530.0,Patient,yeah that's true that's true.
416.0,Provider,"Mike, this is a good time for some mindfulness and some yoga."
9530.0,Patient,To kind of keep you studying through.

416.0,Provider,I look common had faith yeah I like insight timer to if you know that one.
9530.0,Patient,"yeah I am I can't remember if I downloaded that one too, I know I wrote it down, but I probably just don't recognize the APP right away on my phone, so I can't really picture it right now, yet, but I have that one to look into do."
416.0,Provider,"I, like all of us they're great. huh I do when I go for walks stick one year, but in my ear."
