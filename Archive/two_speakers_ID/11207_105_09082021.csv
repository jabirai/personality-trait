105.0,Provider,hi. Good morning.
11207.0,Patient,Good morning.
105.0,Provider,I just need to take about 30 seconds to open up a note this would be good timing for you to get anything you need i'm tissue water another pillow anything you need.
11207.0,Patient,No i'm good go ahead.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so just take some time and think about maybe what you want, from today. I think you've had. You mentioned in groups that you are on leave from work for a while."
11207.0,Patient,yeah when one of the last ultrasounds I was getting they've they found something called a. what's called a sneaky I sounds like sneaky I.
105.0,Provider,But it's yeah.
11207.0,Patient,"Like a like a like the hemorrhage in your eyeball is a Tiki I it's a sneaky I. So it's a. it's just a scarring of the uterus which is strange because I haven't ever had any kind of surgery down there anything but they said some women have them and they haven't ever had anything happen so. yeah so it's a. it's a scarring on the side of the uterus that can cause the so the. placenta has to attach in a certain way. To stay still and if you have one of these, it can just randomly detach itself and start bleeding. So, all of a sudden, I have to stay off my feet I can't lift I can't get stressed out. I haven't tried to. Take really good care of my stomach now, even more so than before, so okay. So yeah My job was to. It they said just the emotional stress, I was describing was enough nevermind all the the physical side to it."
105.0,Provider,"And how are you doing, how are your thoughts around this change."
11207.0,Patient,"it's it's a little scary but my my husband just got a really good job. So I don't really need to work. Anyway, and it's it's just as well, I miss my co workers, but the customers were really rotten pretty much all the time, and I was getting really tired of that."
105.0,Provider,You mentioned to kind of taking things personally.
11207.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it was. You know I had I had an old lady literally like. She wanted to she gave me a certain amount of pennies wanting me to take the pennies and give her a nickel. But she didn't explain that to me, and so I have a computer telling me you're going to give her certain certain amount of change a certain type of coins and because she didn't explicitly tell me know switch that to a nickel. i'm i've got a line of people behind her I just don't I don't have time if you don't tell me exactly what you want the computer is going to tell me what, to give you and that's what i'm going to give you. But she got so mad she pulled her mask down and got in my face and said how fucking stupid, are you. And I and that that was that was on my last day there that that happened, so I was like man, this is, this is a sign and understand with this. Now that was just ridiculously rude."
105.0,Provider,It was rude. You ever run across anybody who's flight to you there.
11207.0,Patient,"yeah yeah there you know i'd say there were less really polite people, and it was usually the regulars you know if you you go in that store and shop every day it's really not in your best interest to be a Dick."
105.0,Provider,Right.
11207.0,Patient,"I might as well be nice if you're going to be seen there every day, especially because if you're really nice we you know we can haggle with you. You know some of the regulars like a little kid would bring up a toy, and maybe I wouldn't notice that the kid had the toy until we are already done with the transaction, I had the. The authority to just let the kid take toy and not make them pay but you know few fewer rude I didn't do that."
105.0,Provider,"So. Well, how are you filling your time at home."
11207.0,Patient,"there's lots there's lots to do at home so there's chores and my my dog here chapo he's he is pretty demanding you. We live on the third floor of an apartment complex. So he doesn't have a yard, to go out to so he likes lots of walks which you know that's good for me too it's just the the area outside is really nice we have like a big courtyard and there's a little they have like a little dog park in the middle of the whole apartment complex so. So that's that's pretty much what I do just leisurely tours and dog."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. This is, I want to take a minute go over some of your goals, make a couple statements here looks like. right on today right on target here as far as a monthly review. something you want us to feel good about you said, I want to feel good about myself and boost my confidence. In August, you shared I feel alright, not as good as I should but way better than I did a month ago. Current core belief open quote I am less than and is experimenting with using I am equal. And what are you noticing around your goal about good about yourself."
11207.0,Patient,"um. I I think I think i've leveled out pretty well with that and I am noticing now that I thought the job was really good for me. Because the of the whole you know the hierarchy of needs in the sense of belonging and you know being needed and my co workers could depend on me and I like that that was good, but. For all of that good really the way the customers were treating me was really dragging me down and I didn't realize it, I mean I knew I didn't like it, but until I quit and i'm now at home, and then I just have my interactions with my family, which are all positive. I you know i'm realizing now i'm i'm doing much better. So, as far as far as feeling good about myself, I feel much better now without the job."
105.0,Provider,Tell me about. All your interactions with family or good tell me how that.
11207.0,Patient,"tell you about that, like I I am get along with my husband I get along with my mother in law. I get along with my sister in law, I don't talk to her as often but. She lives, all the way in California, but. I have talked to a couple of my neighbors I get along with them really well it's just it's just all. pleasant certainly know. moments like I was having at work, where I, where I was you know. Fine, one minute and then somebody would say something to me and then next thing I know i'm having to go hide in the bathroom because i'm crying because my feelings are hurt that doesn't happen here."
105.0,Provider,You mentioned. Mother in law sister in law has been a neighbor. Any any other family on your side you're interacting.
11207.0,Patient,"I text occasionally with my grandmother, but for the for the most part. I don't speak to my family. that's been. it's been that way for a few years now."
105.0,Provider,What are your thoughts about that that distance.
11207.0,Patient,"Well, I was so right before my mom passed away in. was at the end of 2017 in November, I was really heavy heavy into my addiction and. My fit my most of my family had problems of their own to my my older sister had the had the exact same addiction in fact and. Then, when my when my mom passed away we kind of had a big falling out because. My will my sister's had nothing to do with my mom leading up to her death my older sister hadn't talked to her for six months, and my little sister was always fighting with her and being mean to her and not letting her her see her son my mom's little grandson. And, and then my mom passes away and they cut me out of everything. They blamed my addiction, even though my older sister had the exact same addiction was I guess she was just better at hiding it and. convincing everybody she was wasn't addicted anymore. And they. didn't let me have any say so in the funeral decisions, then they played a bunch of songs my mom didn't even want played at the funeral I was lucky they even let me go, it was just all mean and weird and kind of. scapegoated me it was, like all the family problems are all my fault so. I after after the funerals over and everything and I went on to eventually get help and go to go through treatment and get a bunch of therapy there. And it was pretty much decided between me and me, and that therapist that I would just grieve them like they were they were dead, because they wanted nothing to do with me and they still don't so it's pretty much like they're they're gone i'm dead to them and they're dead to me. I don't really know why they did that, because before my mom passed away, we were, I mean we had our problems, and everything, like most families do, but we were pretty close. And then things got weird really weird and I they started treating me really bad and i'd asked them like, why are you being this way to me. Why why, why are you being so mean to me, and they would be like you you're acting psycho right now you're being crazy, you need to leave it there's it got weird i'm telling you really freaking weird. I I could ask till you know till the cows came home why they would be in that way and I never got any answer. The the only answer was to just. Go on my way. leave them alone. it's it's upsetting. It still is a little upsetting."
105.0,Provider,And it's been six months or more.
11207.0,Patient,"Oh it's it's been longer than that the last, the last time I. Last time I saw any of them. Was. February of 2018."
105.0,Provider,They tried to reach out.
11207.0,Patient,"My grandma, yes, but very. seldomly. She does she does text me and check in with me to find out how I am and actually the way that she even started talking to me again, which was in set at the very end of 2019. So right right, as I was getting to the end of my treatment, she didn't even have a phone number for me, she finally. reached out to my ex husband and asked him if he had a phone number for me so she could try to find out how I was doing. And then he asked me, he said, do you want me to give your grandma your phone number, and at that time I was really upset so I said no don't give her my number, you can give her my mailing address here. And so, she wrote me a letter and then I wrote her back, and then we started corresponding like that, for a little while and then, when I when I saw that she was. She was she never she never had a problem with me, it was my nieces and my older sister and my younger sister that we're all being weirdos I went and gave her my phone number, and we, we have kept in touch just her and I."
105.0,Provider,You said it's still upsetting for you.
11207.0,Patient,"yeah yeah because it just it was just so weird and sudden like we like I said, you know we we had we had our problems, we fought sometimes but I felt I felt. close to them. So I didn't I didn't really understand why all of a sudden, when my when my mom died they first they tried to there's my little sister is such an idiot really. Not not to you know, like stoop to her level, but she saw in the in the. autopsy report the medical report she saw the word dive in Hydra mean which my mom had unfortunately a very toxic level of in her blood at the at her time of death. She had taken a bunch to try and go to sleep then had some kind of weird brain neurological issues in the middle of the night and took more and more and more and ended up poisoning yourself with it. yeah i'm sure it had a part to play in the heart attacks, you know, having the next morning. So my little sister sees that word and just sees the amine at the end and then comes and screams at me that I gave her methamphetamine I never gave my mother methamphetamine ever. that's that's crazy that's just. insane. i'm sure my mother did it in her life, but she never got it for me, certainly not right, then in the 24 hours before she died. So I told her, let me see the paper, so I can show you your your mistake. And what you're reading. yeah and she punched me in the face and would not let me have that paper, so I could show her her her screw up. And so I ended up having this like big family fight in my grandmother's living room where I was like you guys, please look at this paper and see that she's wrong and they were all just like sitting there like staring at the floor. I was like what is happening, are we in the freakin twilight zone right now. yeah This is ridiculous, they just let her control everything and she's the youngest she at the time she was like barely 21 years old. Standing there with this paper not letting anybody see it. Well, I was able to get to she tried to act like she had some monopoly on it like like nobody was allowed to have it, but her because she paid for the autopsy okay. So later I went through a court process and petition to that doctor, it was a doctor actually here in albuquerque, even though we lived in rudo so her the doctor that did the the examination was here in albuquerque. And I I was able to pay like $45 and get a copy of it. So I got to see it, there was no methamphetamine on it. But that's what they all that's what they all stand by I gave her methamphetamine and it gave her a heart attack and she died. And it's just a big fat lie. wow yeah it's weird freakin weird. And so, rather than admit their mistake, they just shut me out completely they won't they won't hear reason at all my grandmother knows."
105.0,Provider,That she's. Your mom's mother.
11207.0,Patient,"yeah she she knows I didn't give her anything she knows she's she's she's a smart woman she's she's read the paper and everything she knows, but she wants. She wants to be able to have things to do with her great grandkids so my older sister has kids and they have little babies and and my grandma you know likes being able to. Have a relationship with those little kids and if she takes my side too much they will punish her by not letting her have anything to do with those little kids."
105.0,Provider,that's dysfunctional.
11207.0,Patient,"yeah yeah tell me about it, but they they still all act like it was all me. yeah it's just it's a big mess and. i'm sure you can you can tell by hearing about it, why it's just better that I just have. done my best to try and forget about it, though. There may be no family."
105.0,Provider,"yeah they may mature they may grow up um you know this this connection, we have to family, sometimes it can override some pretty. dysfunctional things I hope it does help they can come forward and they may not apologize that might be too big. There might be an opportunity to reconnect. That happens for you."
11207.0,Patient,"yeah well I did Finally, just a couple of weeks ago tell my grandma that I was pregnant and I showed her little pictures from the ultrasounds and stuff and. She was really happy and. May you know, maybe, maybe they'll talk to her about that, and maybe that would be the thing that interests them again in me but i'm not holding my breath."
105.0,Provider,"right since wise prudent yeah. You and I talked last time about we had created a new goal, which was, I want to talk about emotion regulation and anger management was something you've had said. You want to talk about emotion regulation so. Tell me tell me more about that."
11207.0,Patient,"Well, I was, I was getting so bothered. By the way, that the customers were being at work. That I was thinking, it was my fault, where it was my problems like that, if I was crying or getting angry, it was something I needed to do. to fix it myself. Which yeah, I guess, I guess, even if they were being really mean it really you know we all we have to own our reaction to things. But since i've quit the job I haven't had any problems. So. I mean isn't it, not to say that I won't some still Sunday come come upon rude strangers, they can get and get upset but. What less of a. Emergency. So."
105.0,Provider,"And you said two things you said, I want to talk about emotion regulation and anger management so."
11207.0,Patient,"So the the crying you know when I would start crying. Some of that was, of course, I was getting my feelings hurt, but I would get so angry. That and then not be able to do anything I couldn't react so like I could slap the customer. That I would then start to cry so I was, I was thinking it, you know well, though i'm crying and i'm sad and i'm hurt now part of why i'm crying and upset is because I just got so angry. And I couldn't do anything about it."
105.0,Provider,"You ever seen anybody be treated that way at work and you like, how they responded."
11207.0,Patient,"um. It seemed seemed kind of like. I guess I That was the the guys there. They were always just able to be like oh just brush it off just blow it off like they didn't even care. All the all the females had a pretty similar reaction to me, though. They we you know, there was an older lady that work in the front with me. there's two two younger girls, both from from arca so they both had the developmental disability issues and we all had about the same reaction we would get really upset start crying and have to go be alone for a minute. The. The guys just didn't even care. I don't know I don't know how they were able to stay so calm. Sometimes I mean, I guess, sometimes the customers were not that not that big a deal in their rudeness, but some of them would get personal they would say really rotten stuff."
105.0,Provider,Do you want me to close this goal.
11207.0,Patient,"um. yeah go ahead and close it and then, if if I if I start feeling like it's creek creeping into home life i'll ask you about it again."
105.0,Provider,So what do you do. When you hear know there's a misunderstanding with your husband it's fun right.
11207.0,Patient,well.
105.0,Provider,Your husband's name Kwan.
11207.0,Patient,Know it's angel.
105.0,Provider,Thank you.
11207.0,Patient,wrong one.
105.0,Provider,"So. relationships are not perfect, so there's misunderstandings that are going on. Where you could decide to be offended What do you do instead of. doing that."
11207.0,Patient,"Well i'm i'm really fortunate that with with my husband if I get if he doesn't if he says something that I don't like or that kind of rubs me wrong, I I can just say wow that really hurt my feelings. And then. you'll think about it for a second and then he will usually tell me i'm sorry. Or, I will just walk away and be quiet and here in a second he will just come and hug me we don't like to stay fighting we we both really feel like. Life is too short, and this is this home with each other, is the one place where we're with our best friend and we just want things good here all the time, so. And it's this it's the same with him, I have a little bit more of a if he says, I hurt his feelings I guess super part two i'm like oh my God i'm so sorry, so I you know we're we're both just really. We take we take care of each other's feelings okay."
105.0,Provider,"Take a second. I want to stay clean. And how many milligrams are you at right now. And what is your plan, do you want to stay it to are you tapering what's your plan."
11207.0,Patient,"Yes, I still i'm still planning to taper but now that I meant to and it took a little bit took a little bit to stabilize it to I had a few. A few bad days and taking it taking the two in the morning wasn't working for me anymore now I take my to when I go to sleep right before I go to sleep. Really yeah it's weird because you think after a whole day of like drinking and eating that it wouldn't even absorb as well, but what was happening, when I was taking it in the morning was I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling withdrawal symptoms. So and but I don't like to take the quantity some some people I guess can just take clonidine at bedtime and then get be fine I don't really like to do that I. And I don't really know if it's bad to even I haven't looked it up to see if floridians bad when you're pregnant, but I just I just feel like it's not yeah. So, so I take my my my two milligrams strip at bedtime and then i'm good all the way through the next day to bed time again. Great yeah but yeah I do still want to taper because I found out that if you even if you've been clean and doing good and you're on a program your whole pregnancy. And you've been followed by a doctor you've got all these you a's from your from your obstetrician from your you're if you're on probation you've got them from them you've got them from your your. therapy program, they will still open a CPS case on you when when you have your baby. and child protective services here in albuquerque are really bad about yanking babies away from people for no for not really any good reason. And then getting them stuck in that in that system. And I don't want that. So when that when when my baby's born I don't want it on nothing. I don't want any suboxone shown up in it."
105.0,Provider,"So, what are you doing with that plan and the concern."
11207.0,Patient,"About. yeah what what what i'm thinking is. i've got i've got time because i'm barely entering 16 weeks right now and i'm already all the way down to two milligrams so i've got a pretty long stretch of time to taper little tiny bits off of that too, and then get to where i'm on nothing. To the end at the end of my pregnancy. Be being able to go slowly enough I shouldn't really have any problems with it, and then, after the baby is born, if I feel like I need to get back on it i'll get back on it. But at least, then I won't have a CPS case. I just don't want the baby being born on it. And then know if it if it means I you know if I if I feel like I have to start up immediately on it again and I can't breastfeed whatever lots of babies are fine on just formula that you, you don't have to breastfeed to be a good mom."
105.0,Provider,"I heard your plan, which is to slowly taper I didn't quite like, if I were to type that I could say your intent is to slowly taper but there's really no timeframe, unless I didn't hear it."
11207.0,Patient,Well i'm barely 16 weeks pregnant. So I you know I have months. I. Can taper down that two milligrams that's really not that much. I had.
105.0,Provider,yeah I think what's happening is you have months. what's missing is the deadline. Is that.
11207.0,Patient,"deadline is the deadline, the deadline is February. The very beginning of February, of course, because my due date is February 28 so I kind of want to give myself the month of february's because of course the baby's not all babies wait until the exact day they're supposed to come, sometimes they come a little bit early now. If it if it comes a lot early accidentally then, I guess, I have a CPS case being opened on me and there's nothing I can do about that, but if things go to plan I would be off the suboxone and then have that whole 28 days of February. To expect the baby to show up and the baby to be clean of anything."
105.0,Provider,Let me see if I heard you correctly. You have attention to clean date of. Maybe like January 31st or something.
11207.0,Patient,yeah January 31 February 1.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, have you. Looked at that, at a calendar and. put together a taper plan, let me Michelle you. hey you."
11207.0,Patient,"know I haven't I haven't really done that. I have, however, already started to just when I when I have my two i've started taking the little scissors and I cut the corner off level. And i'm seeing if that is making a difference, so far, it has not, it still feels like i'm just taking the two and then what my plan was to do is every couple of days or so just cut a little bit more. In a little bit more and a little bit more, but i'm doing it really small pieces."
105.0,Provider,Are you telling your doctor you're doing this.
11207.0,Patient,"I have since since I last talked to her, I have only barely started to do this, so when I last saw her we didn't have group yesterday, right. We didn't wait, did you I thought you in her wanted Monday off because there's a holiday, so we didn't do group yesterday."
105.0,Provider,isn't today September 8 Wednesday.
11207.0,Patient,"Oh Okay, I mean the day before yesterday, right you got to have the day off we didn't do group on Monday. Right right okay. Okay, and I don't do group on Tuesday, so it doesn't matter. I meant I meant we didn't do group on Monday, which is when I would have talked to her to tell her that i've been cutting the corner off of my two milligrams strips."
105.0,Provider,I think I see what you're saying so you're planning on talking with her. yeah.
11207.0,Patient,So the next. The next time I go to group I will inform her that. I started to do that okay.
105.0,Provider,i'm. Sorry from I want to stay clean. And I want to feel good about myself and boost my confidence I don't see any other goals. So. What would you like to work on in the coming weeks.
11207.0,Patient,um I guess just. just keep keeping up with the keeping up with the tapering.
105.0,Provider,So i'm looking at what normally have a very full. want to call them. imagery and usually have the protective nurturing and wise figures emotional container distance metaphor anchor room now could be that you and I did some of these and they didn't. Get transcribed and are moving along and the new notes to any of those sound familiar to do when I do any imagery if I said let's put together your resource team. That sound familiar no okay why don't we do that says we've got got some time i'm just going to grab. My wrap. So in any of your practices. Do you do any visualization. When you. you've learned some things you were in treatment. Do you use imagery and visualization as part of your. Coping skills.
11207.0,Patient,um. I use. I use mindfulness and stuff for anxiety.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, how do you use it that's it a general term different people have different needs."
11207.0,Patient,"um I guess just if I if i'm in a. If i'm in a crowded place like a store or something and I start getting nervous I. Well, I have a little raccoon tail attached to my purse, so I use that so it's like a you know, a textile thing I will."
105.0,Provider,have to.
11207.0,Patient,"Look at it. it's colorful i'll touch it and you know, and after just after you doing that for for a few moments, and you carefully breathing. You know the. sweating in the face and the turning red kind of start to go away a little bit."
105.0,Provider,"So. i'll call that mindfulness. practice. and that's a tactile so that's touch that's using the sensation here, and then you also said that you were using my think. which you could see. So it sounds a lot like what I would call grounding in the five senses. It doesn't matter what you call something. So that's perfectly that's great there's really not a lot of imagery in that so that's what will shift will just add to your your toolbox today so let's do this let's go to this will be right brain stuff This is just out of that that creative mind. I like to think of this and I usually I usually develop these because i'm doing em Dr with clients, you and I haven't done that. doesn't matter, this is this is useful for everyone so let's um let's put together your resource team and it'll be comprised of three images they can be imagined or real okay. One of them is a protective figure and it needs to be pure protective figure, so it really can't have ambivalence about it, so let your imagination drift over to imaginary line from a movie or TV or a book and. It really is just an image doesn't have to be a person for some people, it is just let your mind wandering drift off to this sort of. protective figure that. Is singular and its objective is to protect you. And what comes to mind."
11207.0,Patient,"first thing that comes to mind, for me, is a link from the legend of zelda. video game character."
105.0,Provider,"Excellent. And so that we have a link from legend of zelda now think of a nurturing figure, so this would be. A character that wants for you, your full development it sees in you also your potential and it's just sort of this champion of your potential doesn't necessarily have the affection piece, but really is just like up yeah I see you, and you can do it and nurtures that encourages it. will be. What might."
11207.0,Patient,That that could be that can be zelda for the fiction of zelda the Princess.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. And the third one of this resource team is a wise figure so it's a character either real or imagined right that not only has stored knowledge, you know, but also has the experience of knowing how to apply it so has wisdom. What character my Daddy. Or what figure my Daddy."
11207.0,Patient,"Okay, that can be that that can be sorry from the same video game. I played that game a lot as a child."
105.0,Provider,As a.
11207.0,Patient,House a car.
105.0,Provider,"Okay got it alright. So i'm going to come back to it in a minute and then go over to. A distancing metaphor, so this would be something. That has a process of moving away. So, for example, some people will think of a river and they're like I got a little leaf, and it can see that leaf and see that leaf moving further and further away to the point, they can't see it or shooting star or an airplane rocket ship or a boat speeding boat or. Car kind of coming in the opposite direction, you can see in the rearview mirror to get further and further away. You know and kind of catch that So the idea is, we could maybe take something negative and put it on that leaf rocket ship boat. Car in opposite direction and that it's moving further and further away to the point you can't see it anymore, some people put it on a balloon they write hate off it goes disappears you can't see it anymore. The idea is that it's in process and it's moving a way people resonate with different metaphors are different images, what does it make you think of."
11207.0,Patient,A boat something on a boat moving away water.
105.0,Provider,Moving away okay. So anything else you want to describe about it is because i'll bring you back to it will save both moving away.
11207.0,Patient,I guess the the type of boat that comes to mind is just like a little wooden rowboat okay.
105.0,Provider,"So is it moving quickly or slowly. Another. Another imagery and you could think of this very much probably something that you already do most people do they compartmentalize in some way they're able to sort of use thought stopping to just kind of go. No, I don't think about that, right now, this is doing it intentionally and it's saying let's come up with an emotional container and the instructions of it are these that it be big enough. and strong enough to hold all that negative stuff. So this is your image oftentimes there's a system of keeping it in, and what that I might ask what what's the system of that, but really what comes up when you think of a container that's big enough and strong enough to hold all your negative stuff what's the image that comes up."
11207.0,Patient,A safe.
105.0,Provider,Can you tell me more.
11207.0,Patient,Just a big really big metal safe.
105.0,Provider,How big.
11207.0,Patient,This is as big as a small car. i'm done i'm picturing it with like several locks on the front of it somewhere like three combination locks instead of just one.
105.0,Provider,And who has the combination.
11207.0,Patient,Nobody. me just me.
105.0,Provider,"Okay excellent. So the idea is. let's just say. That somehow this is remembered through practice and maybe write it down and you're with someone this rude lady or any one customer anyone, and if you had remembered it. You could take. Her frustration her ugliness her attack. And and sort of putting. Putting it on that that rowboat. i'd like you to imagine, where you will be as that wouldn't rowboat moves away from you. Whether you're on the side of a. an ocean seaside in the sand or maybe on a rock or mountain or maybe you're at a river lake try and picture, where you will be as that robo. moves away. and tell me what comes to mind."
11207.0,Patient,"So there's there's a there's a game I play called rising world and it's like a it's like a base building survival game. And my base on the game is up on the side of a mountain and down below the mountain is a big lake and you can. You look out very, very far and not see where the lake ends where the other side of the shores and actually i've never explored that far, so I have no idea how far it goes. And at the at the shoreline right there, I actually have a rowboat in the game so i'm just kind of picturing that game like i'm standing up here in the base and then the boats down here could go away so far out that I couldn't see any."
105.0,Provider,"boats are saying about. Well, so far out can't see it anymore. So take a minute and picture up on the base you being on the base. And then perhaps you see that. That ugliness maybe from this woman or whatever ugliness. That you've been offended by and hurt and this anger do and you've maybe felt frustrated and tracked and cried but instead you put it on this boat. Just notice yourself how do you get it on the boat. How does it get to the honorable. It can be anything you want this is imaginations."
11207.0,Patient,I guess it would be like. Like a giant rock I just roll roll it down the Hill and it just kind of lands in the boat and that's kind of what propels the boat to start floating away.
105.0,Provider,"sure that happening. Where you get to sort of encompasses in in a set structure rolls down and lands on the boat. propels it away. But not only that, as you see it moving further away i'd like you to be aware, one by one. of your resource team as they join you on the base, and that is link. notice your experience of being around this protective figure as it enters your awareness. What it's like to be around the link noticing your interaction with it. And you're having sent this rock on its way. Just notice, you have to announce anything. And then notice zelda the Princess shows up as well, and the interaction between link and Silva. protective and nurturing are interacting there. For and in the service of you. notice what it's like to be around them. Just feeling that. feel the truth in it. And then sorry uh from the video game shows up with wisdom. And is interacting also with link and Silva and you. And you are abundantly aware that this is your resource team and they're there with you, with the base. have them perhaps take a look at that rock as it moves away. Maybe they have opinions. Maybe they share them with you. To pay attention to your own body, as all of this sort of merges together to different kind of moment. notice now what it is that you feel compelled to do after this imagery. Not i'm interested in knowing where your thoughts when."
11207.0,Patient,get another boat ready. yeah for the Net for the next time I need to.
105.0,Provider,yeah I just it's just. uh huh yeah. So I wonder if you might use that on occasion.
11207.0,Patient,"I could, I could use that it might you know that's something that in the in the very moment, it might be a little difficult to use, but you know things things upsetting things stay with you. Or you wouldn't tell you know, like late later in the day after, something happens if I you know. i'm telling my husband about it, that means it stayed bothering me so so something I could definitely use later after the fact, when I really need to just get rid of it and not let it continue to bother me."
105.0,Provider,"Just curious, what is it about what this particular woman with the pennies What was it that stuck."
11207.0,Patient,She she called me stupid. And that. A real problem with being called stupid. But. that's because i'm not. i'm not stupid. And I don't and I don't like I just don't like being called that it's like she could maybe she could have called me. A lot of things that would not have bothered me but because she chose that word it felt. Really personal.
105.0,Provider,"yeah. It wasn't on. Let me just bring two things together, so you had mentioned before these boys men coming in and dissing your profession. It sounds similar does it seems."
11207.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, those old men, making the joke about me being a button pusher and. not making any money at it yeah."
105.0,Provider,"Would it be okay, if these people thought it but didn't say it out loud."
11207.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz I don't care what they think if I don't know about it. I might not think very pleasant things about them, but I wouldn't say it out loud to them it's it's really it's really insulting how how some people can. Have have the balls to be so imperfect themselves, which is okay we're all imperfect, but then tell somebody else something about them like look i'll be imperfect over here you being perfect over there, we don't need to tell each other. All work on what's wrong with me you work on what's wrong with you, I would never go up to somebody and tell them. What I really think about them, you know I should you know, in fact, when I think bad things about people I usually am like you know self How dare you really what what right do you have to think those things just stop it. So I I have what standard I have for for my way of thinking about others I feel they should they should have but that's just not the reality of life people just don't do that. Now."
105.0,Provider,"And I know that i've done this before, but still, if you want to use it. If you just took that button off and you really believe that you weren't stupid less than not good enough. You would be really curious about this alien creature that could take. Their. thoughts and. then put them into words out loud right did you know you could be curious about those kind of people. purely from like let's say, for example, a scientist, or maybe from a therapist perspective it's like I don't. Care how you do that it's so different I would never do that. I don't know what to say to that i'm curious about how. how you see that that way i'm not sure how to address it here at the counter I can't remember, did you want cream with your coffee, you know. there's all of these other ways of dealing, but I wonder if you really get. That in the moment. that's going to be difficult for everyone. to remember anything notice, I said I can do it later, but in the moment oh."
11207.0,Patient,yeah it's hard. It just takes it takes a lot of practice.
105.0,Provider,"It does, but. What you're wanting to do is remove a goal right I don't do it, you know moda emotional regulation anger it's not provoking me so but notice, you said practice. So. You could be practicing with angel and it's, not to say that you can't say oh feelings got hurt. But it's a chance to practice it, not because there's anything broken or wrong, but because you may want access to it. Your brain will not remember unless you've been practicing it. that's all."
11207.0,Patient,Though. So you mean instead of what I would usually do in telling him my feelings are hurt maybe just. Try. feature is just not yeah like just.
105.0,Provider,"So so there's different there's different behaviors of thought, as a behavior speaking is a behavior. Right feeling paying attending mindfulness is a behavior they're all behaviors so if we say if the first one is. Remembering like gosh I remember, and so, then maybe you can decide to put put something up that shows it and then what would that thing say with this poster say if there was something on the wall and you were to practice this What would it say."
11207.0,Patient,"As like the reminder to do it. Yes, it would say remember the button."
105.0,Provider,"So, and then you'll you'll you'll remember the button. I don't think you'll remember to do this behavior which is. I want to understand how you came to that conclusion. I want to understand it looks so alien. I wouldn't have done it like that, I want to understand it's very different you've heard me say choose curiosity over being right come at this a zillion different ways, but to seek understanding. Instead of being insulted. Not saying you don't have a right to it i'm saying, if you wanted to switch the order of things. could still say it, it can be the very next thing you could do the behavior of thinking, I wonder how he came to that conclusion. I could ask them a question. I can watch kind of analyze it a little bit how I got to that, but it mean you don't have to be insulted by it, you could just be curious as if it were literally. Any alien. is another human We really do put realities together so differently, given our stories."
11207.0,Patient,"yeah it'll be. it'll be interesting to i'm sure i'm sure the, the first time I do it it's not i'm not going to think of it quite like that. But, but I. If I at least can remind myself, not to let the button get pushed quite quiet like I usually do, then, then maybe I can try to remember, then to. to at least just stop and think, and if I get to the alien stuff you know it might happen later, but it's going to start with, at least just. Stopping my emotional reaction for a minute."
105.0,Provider,Okay well let's see how it goes.
11207.0,Patient,i'm willing to try.
105.0,Provider,i'm ready let's up schedule something for. And i'm thinking. To. Say maybe September 29 even I don't think you have a lot of processing stuff going on right now let's see if that works.
11207.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
105.0,Provider,"You want to keep it at at nine well, it can be nine you there's nothing scheduled there because it's so far in advance."
11207.0,Patient,yeah.

105.0,Provider,So September 29 at nine. And do I need to message the Doc anything.

105.0,Provider,that's a yes.
11207.0,Patient,"Okay, so hold unless she already set one, in that I didn't pick up yet. I don't I don't know I. The pharmacy usually calls me a bunch or they blow their little automated line calls me, and it has it hasn't called me so."
105.0,Provider,"i'm going to read out loud what i'm writing, and you can correct me okay. Hendrix. I see. an appointment was. It him. She supports not having a refill sorry."
11207.0,Patient,"I I don't think so hold you know what let me, let me do something here, let me just check something. Okay yeah it says, I have no. I have no prescriptions in progress, and none, no, no orders."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I wrote she reports will."
