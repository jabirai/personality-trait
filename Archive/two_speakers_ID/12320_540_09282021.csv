540.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, all right, I just wanted to get that damn that. So you've been feeling emotional I has just been the past few days or."
12320.0,Patient,The past week.
540.0,Provider,"I would. If you can try to chat track those moments like for the next maybe few months and see it could be like um I mean, so I used to have my DEMO shot and I wouldn't get my period, but I would get all the symptoms and my period. And so I would get the hormonal for like the week, so I I started tracking those things, and I would understand it like okay i'm on my period time but just not period. That makes sense right, so I definitely track that because you may be able to see when you're going to have the mood swings so you can prepare for that that's like the one thing about the DEMO shot, is that you still get those emotions."
12320.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"yeah so what happened yesterday, where you emotionally yesterday, when he was there."

But i've also just been laying back to you, so I don't stress myself out. Like I told him I said once I have school when I start school like i'm not really going to focus on anything but that work in the kids I was like I mean, obviously, like our data we have data like look hammers books, I mean kids in school."
540.0,Provider,And what is he saying that.
12320.0,Patient,"said okay looking for a part time job or now, so we can kind of like help out a little bit until you can choose this program and gets an empty job okay."

540.0,Provider,And sometimes I mean I don't know about you and the market over there you're sometimes it's cheaper to buy something versus renting a lot of people think that that sometimes is. So as keep that maybe as an option of looking as well.
12320.0,Patient,"yeah trying to stay above also because I know the markets, not going to go down into soon yeah no permits are kind of like increasing their right, because the markets going up. And people obviously need to live places, so they have no options that's like hey like i'm gonna run for this and you know you want it or you don't."
540.0,Provider,"yeah so it's kind of when you think of putting even like 1500 dollars to an apartment somewhere, you could get a mortgage for that as well, so it's outweighing. yeah it's crazy how inflated it is right now. yeah definitely renters are increasing it more and more, because they can."
12320.0,Patient,yeah.

But she kind of doesn't clash well with her, because they both have very strong personalities hmm and her and her husband are having a hard time let's kind of an overview. But she always says like Oh, except the garage for her, and this man i'm Okay, like the people in one bedroom you know 12 by 12 sterling trying to fit everything in it. Like I said I don't have anything if necessary, like don't, mind you know, like you see me over to. not offering me."
540.0,Provider,"And what's the setup for you do, you have your own little spot in the House like what's the setup of the House."
12320.0,Patient,"So I have my bedroom obviously me my kids are there, so I have my bed is the Raven the toddler bed. pretty much my dirty still have her play area which is no dogs area because I moved inside. And she had her in the living room what's that all moved backwards so there's no toys inside unless they're in my room, which is very small, like six to 12 by 12 rooms not not that big to fit three little beds in there. And then I can't have like any thing out if it's moved and it's not her bag, by the time she's either at home or comes out of a room she says it's a mix the Mamas OCD very bad. that's why also usually I used to try scale work and i'll be home when I couldn't make a mess and see what time I kids did I just become clean it."
540.0,Provider,"sounds like lot of pressure to have kind of everything squared away at home, not be able to let anything go really."

And then, when he's asleep let's turn that off and then i'll kind of close the door. For my daughter that she doesn't think she can leave now, so I think I get locked and until I go to bed like 10 minutes later, but she'll cry a little bit and then obviously the night, she doesn't see me my son still see miss crab but my daughter she's my dad so her grandpa."
540.0,Provider,"Okay sorry Oh, she likes it, but the grandpa."

540.0,Provider,"Unless Regiment or less very, very specific Regiment. yeah yeah. Well that's going to take pressure off so having those time restraints it's it's definitely. worth restricting for sure. So, other than I everything's been good."

But she's able to also get speech therapy twice a week for 30 minutes, without this offer that sounds like a good try to go to a school to do them."
540.0,Provider,"So that would be good for her to go to the school don't be nice yeah not setting that's for kids grow more and more is when they get out of the comfort zone, a little bit. And what the teachers just letting them know how our best ways of being able to calm her down, even if, like little words is there anything she does that helps calm her down."

But it does seem like things are starting to. stabilize for her in her life, environmentally and emotionally mentally. it's all part her for an hour sessions for the next two if we don't get through those for the next ones when i'll probably put her for 45 minutes and go from there. and other other than that nothing for transcription."
