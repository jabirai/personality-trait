9095.0,Patient,hey.
480.0,Provider,How are you.
9095.0,Patient,i'm doing okay.
480.0,Provider,How are you hey what's. going on.
9095.0,Patient,"I mean don't get me wrong, everything is good i'm just having one of those days, where I don't feel that well I don't know if it's like the weather it's a little bit chillier than it's been being boy so."
480.0,Provider,it's making me feel a kid isn't. autoimmune especially lupus isn't that. really affected by fast changes in temperature and we had a really warm couple days and now it's cold again.
9095.0,Patient,yeah it actually is yeah my doctor told me that that I saw. A couple weeks ago. That the weather definitely has an effect i'm back smoking cigarettes again.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so that sounded really jaggi your tone let's give yourself some grace for that."
9095.0,Patient,shrine. Though it was it was very josie because I am judging yeah so.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so that's half the issue is let's get rid of because, especially when you don't physically feel good as a mom and a woman in general it's really easy to beat ourselves up over not being able to cope, the way we normally can when we physically don't feel good. So that's probably the most harmful part of what's happening right now is you're judging yourself, for not. physically or emotionally feeling good, which is adding. emotional pain on top of already not feeling it."
9095.0,Patient,"yeah and my. me and my baby's father, where I want to get along, so we were just I was just kind of you know. Leaving him alone, you know doing that whole thing and we're we're back getting along again now so that's good that's really good. Like things weren't tumultuous, to the point where it was like bad finding things were being foreign or thing anybody yelling anybody, but there was there was tension, there was. There was there was definitely some tension there. So. i'm glad that's gone because I don't want I don't want to spend your holidays. feeling that way. I mean honestly that's why. I am kind of so glad that i'm on their medication, because it really does help for moments like that I feel like i'm going to snap off. and"
480.0,Provider,"So do you feel like when there's tension in the relationship it's more on your end versus on his end or because you're an empath remember when we read about the empath book, do you feel like you're sensing his tension."
9095.0,Patient,i'm sensing his for sure.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so. is so when you send his tension, are you pretty good at like let's talk about this and get to the bottom of it and Does he know how to name what he's feeling or is that a struggle."
9095.0,Patient,"it's a struggle for him, for some reason i'm not sure why, but it is a struggle and always has been. Not."
480.0,Provider,Normal for men with naming. feelings and stuff for sure.
9095.0,Patient,"Because i'm like what's going on yeah like. yeah. Are you mad, are you which his grandfather just passed away so he's also dealing with that well i'm trying to give."
480.0,Provider,You said the grandfather was kind of like his dad figure right.
9095.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,So that is that. Probably his grief is going to come out sideways as anger and anxiety towards you. Because that's just naturally how grief comes out.
9095.0,Patient,"yeah and it has, and I remember when my granddaddy passed away mine came out him that way. So I can't really. I can't really judge I just tried to give him space, you know. and That usually works. Because I don't know what else to do. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Well, I think that's exactly what you should do in that situation is he probably is. Dealing with a lot of things coming to the surface internally that he isn't aware of, so he just needs time where someone else isn't over stimulating the process, you know what I mean. So it's not even anything about you it's just the fact that you're the closest one to him and he probably just needs alone time."
9095.0,Patient,"yeah well, I was thinking because outside of work, I mean he doesn't emphasize his son. He doesn't really have too many, too many besides like his mom and stuff like that he doesn't really we're the only ones who spends most of his time with so."
480.0,Provider,yeah. Is everyone ready for the holidays.
9095.0,Patient,"um yeah we're getting ready we uh we got our gifts and stuff taken care of and then we're gonna get some more tomorrow. So. The gift part, though, if we want to be, it was over with Thank God. So that's good. and yeah so. The baby's been doing pretty good. she's been with the night for them as far she wakes up at like four or five in the morning, but other than that she's really she's really doing good. she's starting to throw."
480.0,Provider,Now i'm just kidding.
9095.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah like lower throwing herself back you know, like once she doesn't get her way she like cry and throw herself back. So she's definitely getting her personality. So, and my lights went out on my Christmas tree, so I had to go and get. The only life they had."
480.0,Provider,"Those are so fun, though, are they giant."
9095.0,Patient,yeah they're huge they're. they're like these big kind of kind of big blue and white snowflakes but I love them.

480.0,Provider,"i'm impressed because half of my tree lights are out right now, and I was just like that next year. Not fixing it."
9095.0,Patient,"we're not even judging because that's that's how it is like. When you have a lot going on, you like the least. You want to worry about is Christmas lights."
