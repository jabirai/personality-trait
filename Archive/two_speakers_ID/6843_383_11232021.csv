383.0,Provider,"awesome. I just looking at up here. Well that's really neat that's That gives you, you know that's that's very present time focus your current LIFE what you're doing now what you did this morning, all of that's really, really healthy, you know, for your mental health."
6843.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah. yeah yeah I was i've done it for years, actually, so it kind of that's what kind of keeps me motivated to writing, I can see like how i'm progressing this month, and you know that kind of thing so. Then I can compare it to even past years. So it shows me. All my data. It like if I ride a certain trail this morning, it will tell me, you know how many times i've written that trail in all the all the years it will say okay that's 127 go at that trail."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's neat that's neat that you can track that So do you put the tracking device on your is it on your phone or where is it."
6843.0,Patient,I you can actually do it through the phone like if something's not functioning on my computer I just turned on my phone and my phone does it. I actually have a really nice little garmin computer that goes on the bike and it has some little map that can pop up and.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, I see."
6843.0,Patient,"So you if you're in a new location, you can follow a map and stuff and it's it's me."
383.0,Provider,wow hey high tech.
6843.0,Patient,"yeah It is like when you get back it actually shows a whole map of where you wrote it, it shows everybody like the exact trails and everything that where you were and yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Well, so what are you doing for thanksgiving."
6843.0,Patient,"um my daughter, and her boyfriend are coming over and then my son and just immediate family are all coming in, spend it with my mother in law and. she's doing you know she's I can see her like every day she's definitely like losing her strength. Like me and my wife have been talking kind of like are realizing that this is probably going to be her last thanksgiving with us and. it's kinda it's getting tough for my wife, she actually. fell down she fainted a couple times so she spent a couple nights in the hospital. Oh, they were checking her out she didn't have to stay, but they wanted her to stay because they just wanted to monitor, to make sure her heart was okay and stuff. yeah I think it's just she's just dropping a lot of things now like she never used to drop anything, and now it seems like her, her grip is gotten a lot weaker. The least losing stuff out of her hands. yeah."
383.0,Provider,It was your mother in law that painted and spent a few nights in the hospital. Correct yeah. yeah well.
6843.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,it's a process.
6843.0,Patient,"She just turned 79 she turned 79 on the 17th. We had a had a little party for. It kind of like booster her spirit she's kind of like actually doing a little better, right now, I guess, because thanksgivings coming and stuff so her her she's like a it kind of picks her up a little bit."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
6843.0,Patient,"I know it's really hard for. getting harder for her to get in and out of the car I know we're going to probably going to finish in short order, have to get a nurse because I can't there's a lot of things I can't help her with. I mean, I can but if she just won't be comfortable she'd be more comfortable with and nurse helping."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Are you do, you have some resources for that are you are you. help with the kit."
6843.0,Patient,"yeah like my wife was talking with my sister Angela because. But. Towards the end wall she took care of everything from enormity and, and so there was a point where they were getting. was more for my dad that they got these nurses to come in, help and. So she gave her the information, so we could get those people. Good yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah that's good it's good to be kind of prepared in advance, in a sense, a bit you know kind of know your resources and even maybe starting to make those phone calls, so you can you know know what the cost is going to be and. What hours you know you might want. To start to think about it, just so that."
6843.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,Absolutely ran into an emergency and then then you're dealing with the crisis and that and having to find you know resources for help.
6843.0,Patient,"yeah No, I do realize that that is like very especially like my dad he had 24 hour care where they were with him all the time. yeah it was really expensive."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. well. It seems like you're doing much better, that is."
6843.0,Patient,"Actually I haven't said anything but actually like when my insurance lapse. At that point, I was the one medication and I I should have said something but. I kind of panicked in a way, I was a aggravated and I stopped taking my medication, and so I have a little bit of medication still in case I have an emergency, but it's been like over a month and I haven't taken any medication. Why yeah i've been sleeping. Okay, and i've been doing good. wow yeah so. i'm kinda like over the hump I feel like in. here."
383.0,Provider,"that's great China, and I think also you kind of gained a lot of we've you know you've processed a lot, I know you process a lot with your other therapists but you've processed and talked about. What you've been through you know in our appointments different parts of your life, and I think that that helps to kind of integrate your experiences and and also you know there's there's a reason that you have had some of these things happen, I think. They are you also kind of. gain a deeper understanding of do agree."
6843.0,Patient,"Yes, I agree with that. Absolutely. My wife, he because, like at first to I was like. Because I stopped taking some vacation and I was like telling my yeah you know I really don't don't think I need therapy and stuff to keep going, and she was like kind of disappointed that I said that, and she. No, no, no, please keep going, because it really helps you and it brightens your day, at least, and you know, and she saw it helps you she's all it does, and I believe it does I. I feel like coming to therapy for sure is at this point, right now, it's still helping me it's good."
383.0,Provider,"Good good yeah they say that you know, some people that just want medication. And, and they don't want the therapy, but they do say that medication and therapy delivers the best outcomes. So that proponent of talking about your experiences and looking at them, maybe. Through a few different lenses you know us and gaining again like more understanding of why things happened and then what you can do differently to to feel differently or to you know to manage your your life experiences better perhaps. is found to be. You know it's good to do with the medicine and if you're feeling like you don't need the medicine and you just want to stay in therapy for a little while longer so that you can kind of hold on to those gains and. And kind of just like like the APP you know kind of track how you're doing. that's that's good to know. yeah so I was just thought we could run through your the goals that. We had set and some of these are ongoing that so. For instance. That so i'll just read the sort of the last ones, to take a glance at your calendar during the evening prior to appointment so basically you know, having a daily schedule having your calendar. And I know you had mentioned, you know you've got it right there are you using your calendar and finding that that's helpful."
6843.0,Patient,"Yes. yeah and i've been doing that, too, or been looking at the calendar The night before and. Trying to look at the calendar more absolutely."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
6843.0,Patient,Especially on when I have an upcoming meeting.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and then i'm bolster your mood by reminding yourself of the personal, meaning that you derive from helping your family. The other one we had here was to practice boundaries with your son regarding involvement in his housing issues, and it seems like you did that to kind of let that go and let him. resolve that I don't know if that's still an issue for you or if you feel like you."
6843.0,Patient,"Nor has infinity I kind of looked at GU bit. More miserably before more been the issue my my daughter has this puppy that I end up taking care of a lot and so that's a real tough thing for me I spend a lot of time with her dog and. A problem is is when her dog is at home. it's by itself and the dog, I think, is is. it's not restrained or that much she she does sleep in a cage at night, and in that, but when she comes over here she's so free and so she's so wound up. That I have this dog that sister not and it's really hard to take care of her because she's still in the puppy stage and she wants to tear everything up so i'm like you have to be. right on her all the. Time and that's."
383.0,Provider,kind of.
6843.0,Patient,"So she'll bring her in just lever and all she brings that dog is like a job, but. i'm Okay, with it, but it just it gets a little bit stressful for me like they went to Disneyland the other day, all of them and I stayed with mama and she brought the dog and then a call late. It got really late, and I was getting tired, and so I call I was texting with them, and I was like I can't do this, you guys have to come home, but it was already very late in the evening. they're real Disneyland people and I kind of have never been the greatest at Disneyland I don't know why it's rare that I go there and I am able to like be really relaxed not tense. I think it's just so many people even they said, like this time it was supposed to be a lot less people for them and the crowds were really bad, so I never do that oil when it's too too much."
383.0,Provider,"Well, good thing you didn't go. The way being. The dog yeah. I probably make that decision to i'll play with you i'll play with the puppy day. But ya know that's well you know you can always you can always say no, or i'm not available that day, you know i'll do, how about we do it the next day that that choice is always yours, you know. When people ask us to do things we have the we have the option to assess and look at our schedule and then make the decision based on if it's you know if we can do it, or if we're up for it too. So. So, other things we had down here was you would watch comedies or any material that would lift your mood or induce laughter have you been watching any comedies."
6843.0,Patient,"yeah nothing that comes to mind But, all in all yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Okay it's a good one to remember you know to to throw on a comedy now and then because, particularly with health issues of a family member can be so. You know, tough has that that can be a tough thing to have a family member living at home that's not not well I took care of my dad for almost five years, I mean he was he was not well for five years. And it's I know what kind of you know there's beautiful moments and there's wonderful things about it and it's also can be stressful at times very stressful like incredibly stressful at times. So it's important to glad you're doing the bike riding and getting out, and you know doing stuff for yourself it's really important to get a break from from the sometimes the stress of. Just care, you know I remember, I was kept to, you know water by my dad's bed and made sure that you know he had. You know I mean just there was just always always something to do you know if maybe he lost his classes, or it was an ending and several times, I just I. I had to get away I had scheduled certain things that I did every week but and we had a caregiver so but that caregiver knew that on that day, I was not going to be coming home, you know directly from work and stuff so. it's good to plan things for yourself."
6843.0,Patient,"that's part of the reason I started going really early in the morning because first of all I like it i'm more consistent that way i'll get up and I don't think about it, I just go. And then also i'm not worried about her because my son is either in the backyard or my wife is usually getting ready for work at that time. So I can go out and burn up everything and I don't think about you know, like Oh, I hope she doesn't need me right now and there's nobody there. But that's why, during the day, like I hate to go and do anything in case, something you know arises where she does need me it's like I will leave I have done that, where I go and it's just not you know she's okay with it and I go but it's just not comfortable. yeah especially right now, where she is i'm like no not anymore so. that's a good thing that I go well, people are still at home in the morning."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah good um and then um let's see we have you're going to just have you know positive social experiences and reduce the social isolation, how are you doing with that."
6843.0,Patient,"yeah i've actually been doing a little better with that, too, I went to the coffee shop, the other day and I. I went there actually to buy a couple bikes supplies, but I got to see the people in there, that I, you know ride with and stuff and. socialize a little bit and actually on thanksgiving morning i'm going out with a bunch of my guys that I used to race bicycles with. So we they do a thanksgiving right every year and I used to do it every year with them, too, I haven't done it the last couple, but so this Thursday morning i'm getting out early and going with them."
383.0,Provider,Oh nice it's kind.
6843.0,Patient,"of Nice, I told my wife, that I was going to write with the group."
383.0,Provider,Oh wonderful so.
6843.0,Patient,yeah it's so that's kind of coming together a little bit more and stuff too.
383.0,Provider,"Good good i'm glad to hear that on and then. We talked about exploring doing kind of changing your routine or taking a different route, or just changing things up so two things don't get too. You know boring. How are you doing with seems like you're doing different stuff."
6843.0,Patient,"yeah I kind of changed it up a little bit. I need to like. continue. I do a little bit more during the day, because it does does like kind of fire me up when I do that in the morning but. If I could just be a little bit more productive during the day that's that's one of the things I kinda today i'm actually going to get a lot of things done, because my wife is going to be with me. I felt like when she's there it's easy but. haha he tells me what to do and I just I don't know, I guess, if she gives me a list, like in the morning, when she gets me a list of things to do, I always kind of get the things done, that she needs so. Like when she needs it then it's easier for me to do, then, if I want to do. It I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"Well, maybe you can maybe brainstorm together about joint things that you know both of you have there's a certain closet that's needs to you know needs to be cleaned out or. I don't I don't know if there's something a way that you guys can sit down and say what what are some projects, you know that that needs to be done around here, and then you can kind of both brainstorm about that and. And then, and then you know you can put that on your list, and now that she'll she cares you know about it and you care, also about it too."
6843.0,Patient,"yeah I need to get better with this, because yeah This is my biggest problem is and I don't. I have a pile of things that I can do here in the House and I kind of like let them go."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. it's easy to do, because nobody really cares you know outside of you and and maybe your wife, that those things get done, I mean they might care down the road, if you know your errors get left with a bunch of pain in the neck of stuff to do but. Other than that, you know, nobody really cares. about it and there's not really a super big consequence if it's not done, you know. not like, if you don't pay the bills, or something like that, or you don't renew your insurance and those things have more you know they're more weighted. So those things so it's easy to put off stuff I mean, I have a I have a box i've been telling myself i'm going to go through that box from it's been four months it's still at the foot of my bed and i'm just like oh my gosh you know so. I get it it's like but, once you do it, you feel so good that's the thing."
6843.0,Patient,that's true yeah that's very true.
383.0,Provider,yeah so it's like meeting your own. expectations.
6843.0,Patient,that's true.
383.0,Provider,"But then it's you know it's good to get it done early in the day, or something so, then you know you can you can relax in the later part of the day, if there's stuff that you know. That you enjoy doing that's not like task oriented that you would like to that you do every day, you know, maybe. You like to relax in your special chair and like look at instagram or something like that. If you get stuff done earlier in the day, you can sit there and do that relaxing activity and not feel like you're just wiling away the time you know."
6843.0,Patient,yeah true very good yes. Very good.
383.0,Provider,"So we'll keep that on your goal list that you're going to work on some project. regularly you know, in your day to day just you know not thanksgiving week but, like you know your your other your your day days when your wife isn't is that work and you don't have caregiving activities to do. sure that you're going to work on some of these projects that that you both of you, maybe have decided together that are important does that sound like a goal that you'd like to work on."
6843.0,Patient,yeah I need to do that absolutely.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so being more productive during the day, but I think if you get specific with your wife about what those things are and put them on a list. it's that closet it's that box it's the top shelf in the garage you know, whatever specifically that it is so that it's not just clean up the House in the garage you know."
6843.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Well yeah we discussed that to it like. just pick a small. thing to do, each day and and then. You know, at least that one thing is getting done, you know you get one. accomplishment every day, instead of not doing any of it."
383.0,Provider,Right right we.
6843.0,Patient,"just get so much mail we get so much mail and it pile we kind of like At times it gets piled up and we don't go through it. Just junk mail kinda. You know the the the mail that's important will come out and then the the junk mail gets piled up and I don't like to just take it and throw it out, I want to either shredded or like take our names off to the. Right so contribute the other day, and you know that. that's an ongoing process all the time, too."
383.0,Provider,"I know I just did that last night it's just like such a. it's just ongoing, but it needs to get done and. Once you do it, you know um, but I think that maybe adding some things that are like you know other projects, maybe with your wife."
6843.0,Patient,"gave up. I have some yeah. Okay reset actually needs to be cleaned out and. Like I don't know why we have this stuff that we do, but. yeah there's a couple of rooms that need to get. stuff is just a cute gets put in there, that I don't know why why we have this stuff actually."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Okay, so we're going to work on that you're going to continue to. You know, stay engaged, socially and doing your biking and. And maybe watch a comedy now and then."
6843.0,Patient,yeah. I don't have any further appointments with you at this point.
383.0,Provider,Okay let's take a look here.
6843.0,Patient,I don't think I do.
383.0,Provider,"I mean, take a quick look. Well, do you want an appointment on we usually met on Fridays at. 959 o'clock 915 or nine actually nine was the appointment, do you want a appointment December, the 10th. Okay, and then. Two weeks following is Christmas Eve morning I don't know I mean, I think I will be working that day, I believe. So, would you want an appointment that day or would you want an appointment like Monday the 20 well we just see."
6843.0,Patient,working.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. I might I don't know if i'll be working that day or not, if not someone will probably call you and reschedule it if you're okay with that no. Or we can just schedule the 10th appointment and then i'll maybe know by then."
6843.0,Patient,Whether it's easy to.
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay so let's just do the 10th at. Nine 9am. and Well, I am i'm incredibly I think you're doing so well, I mean I have. Whether you take medication, or whether you don't that's that's between you and your prescriber and and also, I mean i'm i'm care about it but. And I don't have an opinion, one way or the other, you know it's great that you're off medication or. ordinance or scary or you shouldn't be or anything like that, but the fact that you've been off for about a month and you feel stable you're sleeping you feel good you're getting up you're doing your life I think is very, very positive. So."
6843.0,Patient,"yeah I was trying, I was wishing that I could kind of get off of it and I don't know like I tried a couple times to stop taking it and it just didn't for my sleep. And they had to go right back on it in this time it's like it's a lot better doing."
383.0,Provider,"Well, of course, if there's any problems your. Lead chantelle know and you can. You know, get your refills or you may want to have some refills just on hand, so that you can. um so just let her know."
6843.0,Patient,"I still have a couple weeks actually worth of. 13 days worth okay. yeah i'll i'll send her an email and update her and let her know what's going on, too, because I haven't told her like when i'm done with the group's I usually just wave and go out but. i'll send her an email, just so that she knows."
383.0,Provider,Okay. and probably be good. yeah all right well have a great thanksgiving.
6843.0,Patient,You to them and the thing.
383.0,Provider,"Thanks okay. So clients next appointment is December 10 at 9am, thank you for."
