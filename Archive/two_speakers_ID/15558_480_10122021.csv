480.0,Provider,Hello.
15558.0,Patient,"hey I found you. Empty room by myself just. sitting there like. I don't think this is right and then, when I call. The waiting room."
480.0,Provider,"them and I was like are you sure. yeah so. My boss was like asked him if he was waiting forever in your waiting room because apparently some people have had zoom issues were like it won't show that someone's in the waiting room, even if you are so but that wasn't the case you were just in an."
15558.0,Patient,"emo it was like when I checked in they're telling me okay click the link. So I clicked it, but then rather than it going through to like opening a whole new zoom and like closing that one. Like I just clicked it and then left whatever room, I was in with that and then after that it showed up because you got to remember i've never used zoom before this. Experience like everyone else here I started working here, it was a learning curve. All of a sudden, I guess, I had somehow I had accidentally like created a new room for myself, so I saw listed on there, like new appointment 8am with my name so i'm like okay that's obviously my eight o'clock appointment so i'm clicking it. And then it's showing like new participant me and it's just showing me in the room, and after like eight minutes, I was like. I think something's wrong here. called back and she's like. click this link click it until it goes through if i'm still here keep clicking it do not leave the room."
480.0,Provider,"So. I was wondering if you fell back asleep i'm like I know it's early there, maybe he just passed out."
15558.0,Patient,"It was just stupidity I wish I had that excuse. Right. But it's like everyone else is so used to zoom by now, but like i'm just now starting it so like they're telling me all this basic stuff and i'm like I don't know I don't know."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's all right learning curve for everyone.
15558.0,Patient,Still. Driving somewhere.
480.0,Provider,Exactly how has your anxiety bad.
15558.0,Patient,"it's actually been pretty good. But I haven't been doing a lot the past couple days so that could be helping it, but it seems like. I think my mom having a stroke, the other day might have pushed my anxiety so high that. When I was feeling better it wasn't like quite as good because I still had shit to do begin, like. Even though I was on medication everything i'm doing stuff is still kind of thinking, even though i'm not really worried about it, you still kind of think like oh wow my mom dies i'm not gonna have any parents left like just dumb stuff like that. yeah but then. Past couple days it's I haven't had anything to do it's just been not worried about anything chillin like it almost feels like. The medication is like working better because I don't have all the added stress to compete with so like I was just chilling watching football, just like calming down. And then also like you don't know this because I was talking with chantel about it before, but like I just had so much anxiety from financial stuff. Before the first of the month. So, now that that has passed to like everything's just kind of calmed me down like I think that had a great effect with it as well, but. And then, a lot of it is just like, finally being able to actually get the help. And, like the medication stuff because it's been like a year long process to get to finally get to see some more help yeah."
480.0,Provider,Why year.
15558.0,Patient,"So basically it started like about a year ago, I would say, probably here like October November. I just started getting like basic anxiety. And just gradually got worse and worse and that's when it started progressing, while I was driving."
480.0,Provider,Do you know what the trigger for that was was it financial at the time was it Colin I.
15558.0,Patient,"Think, so I mean obviously the natural covert stuff but during coven because I have three different sources of income and they're all contractors, so I qualified for all the programs like I could get. I could get unemployment, while I was waiting to get PPP loans, like all this stuff so financially it actually gave me some leeway like, if I had to. Go to a nine to five job every day when the stuff was happening like it would have been a disaster like Ovid the financial I guess safety nets of koba actually helped me. Okay um but it started getting like the driving thing was really weird That was really weird because driving something's never bothered me. yeah and then it progressed, we started getting like to just not wanting to do stuff not wanting to go out and then. I started having physical like weird physical things like hands shaking and, like my face starting to go a little numb and stuff like that and that's when it started to feel like okay well if i'm having a stroke, or something I need to go. To the emergency room, so I go to the emergency room and like they give me all the like all the tests CT scans ekg even like drug tests to be to make sure i'm not like a math like all that kind of stuff. And then, like they were saying like it's This could be a neurological problems, so they. wanted, you know you need to see a neurologist which with my insurance it's a nightmare I supply backtrack backtrack to. One problem with coven was, I could not like literally could not even get a hold of my primary care physician like leaving messages not calling back like literally could not even speak to someone. yeah so when that happens, obviously it's just like go to the emergency room the emergency rooms tell me, I need to see a specialist in order to see a specialist I have to."
480.0,Provider,Have.
15558.0,Patient,A referral for primary care I can't get Ahold of.
480.0,Provider,yep.
15558.0,Patient,"And like a have gotten like really weird like just where I was only comfortable like basically like being in the corner in the dark. But not like like you would think something like that, like would be depression related but it wasn't like. Depression like I never felt like oh woe is me like i'm in the corner like sitting there in my head i'm like. dude get off your ass and do something like what are you doing that it's just like just not. Just feeling like Oh well, if I go out try to do something i'm just going to like feel like i'm gonna pass out if I try to drive somewhere and like where, am I going to lock to like what am I going to do, but and then. So with that it I couldn't get approved like I couldn't get hold anyone so eventually I just. Like the women in my family are freaking out screaming at me like just go see a specialist pay for it out of your own pocket. So I went to a neurologist that the doctor from the er recommended, and I just paid out of pocket and just to see them is $300 straight up up front. And she just does the normal stuff like take your blood pressure stuff like that make sure you're not gonna like drop dead in front of her. But then I start talking to her about everything she's like you know it could be a neurological problem however you're extremely young to have an or Article problem, and it could be. Such severe anxiety that. You literally get the physical problems of like having a neurological problem, she was like and I don't want to because you're paying out of pocket she's like to test you for the actual neurological is thousands and thousands of dollars for. Each test. yeah she's like so you don't want to pay all that out of pocket and then find out, it was something that was anxiety. But she's obviously not a specialist in that kind of stuff she was like look I don't really it's not really my thing to deal with anxiety, but I can't prescribe. So she was like you know, is there anything in particular on my wall I don't know i'm not a doctor so i'm just like well I don't. Like knowing what I know about anxiety stuff like I just didn't want my fear was to be given something that's like going to tranquilize me all the time, because I didn't want because the my problem was like. Almost being to tranquilize like sitting in the corner and shit like I didn't want it, something that would tranquilize me she's like well. You know, obviously this is my expertise she's like but you know paxil is. Normally, an antidepressant she's like but it's also can be used for anxiety and it's you know something that won't make you sleepy she's like you know, but you need to let give it weeks to build up somebody all right, whatever so I start taking it and. It At first it almost did basically. I don't want to say it did nothing because it's not supposed to take effect right away. But I didn't have any. Like side effects or anything after about a week. My anxiety started getting worse, which could have been the anxiety of feeling like okay these bills aren't doing anything now I did all this stuff and nothing's happening, but then I started see everything started looking really bright and like blurry. But, so I started talking to family and there's like well you know don't come up with an excuse not to take something that you're supposed to take four weeks to let it build up. But I was feeling uncomfortable but because I had income streams. I just left here and I went to Florida where my mom and my sister everyone lived I just stayed with them waiting for the pills to kick in so that way if there was any severe racks or something i'm not here by myself, like there's someone right there, we can take me to the er or whatever. And Oddly enough. I insurance and oddly enough, with my insurance it's easier to get help when you're out of your area, because you don't have all those limitations, because my primary care physician, is that in Florida. So, if something happens in Florida, I can just go."
480.0,Provider,You can go.
15558.0,Patient,"To California I can't. Do that I have to go to it's it's sure it's it's really weird like that it's hmm that's. really the problem yeah. So they're like they could see okay okay Obviously these pills are making it worse, so I stopped I slowly came off the pills there and stop taking over. And then obviously I was there. So I could come off and then everything started getting better and then I was there for a few months. And then, after just like chilling out and like not doing anything for a few months, it seemed to it got better, to the point where I could come back here like. coven with where they're starting to release the restrictions, because here they released so and then put it back on the release on put about. This is like when I. started releasing it and then like the vaccine had come out and I got the vaccine like when it first started coming out like an April like to me to be perfectly honest with you, I just live. Like, I just wanted to get it over with size lied and told him I was at risk, so I could be like in the first line and got the Madonna."
480.0,Provider,Everything was going Florida at the time when he got vaccinated.
15558.0,Patient,"No, it was right after I came back here, I came back here. outside of Miami Hollywood. Fort lauderdale area."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh we were close I just moved to South Carolina from West palm beach area, so I was down there for all of coven to that was fun."
15558.0,Patient,"I could even I could see it from where we were so obviously you'd be able to see it West palm, but it was like I want to say I left here like right after thanksgiving maybe and came back like. march 1, I think, but I was there during the whole election stuff so they were flying banners around calling trump a loser over his house. Which is like the weirdest thing it was like so weird being there during that but."
480.0,Provider,"There were also people flying the banners That said, like trump 2024 and stuff. yeah you had all of it."
15558.0,Patient,"And it's just so funny but you see how overblown everything is like being in both places like being in California Florida are like the two places that. Nationally everyone kind of wants to make fun of like there's the Florida man and then like California, people are like just idiots. idiots yeah like all this stuff but you could you start to see. Being in both places at a time when everything was so hyped up like everything was so overblown like when I was in Florida people were dropping dead of coven because the restrictions relaxed had like. Everyone in California isn't a lazy idiot like you just see like how like stuff like that so overblown yep but it definitely helped me like relaxing and stuff But then when I got back here everything kind of they relax restrictions everything like kind of kept going. But the driving things still was kind of there but it wasn't nearly as bad."
480.0,Provider,And then drive in Florida at all and was it any better there.
15558.0,Patient,"Rarely, I would only drive like sometimes when it would just be because my sister would be like you know you need to try to drive and see. If it's helping or anything but it was and then also there i'm driving someone else's car, so I got to worry about wrecking like here I don't care like if I wrecked my car my car by insurance everything like there. But there it's like a whole nother issue with other people's stuff. But here, like everything started to get a little better, and it was I was only really getting bad if I was driving long distances on the highway. And then it progressively started getting a little bit worse, and then it got to the point where. It affected, like my main source of income was doing it's like industrial commercials which is basically. Like orientation videos for corporations like if you start a new job and they make you watch the videos like basically where they show you like what not to do what to do. And like I basically have a good little niche where i'm going with the acting school and stuff but I i'm very easily can portray what not to do. So, like the guy that's easy like the job like you said, like sexually harassing coworkers like saying stupid stuff like that, like it's easy and then also I have like very, very. thick hair that's like a unique like a copper color like it changes between like copper red blotches it's I don't know it's just very unique so like super cuts great clips like corporations like that. always just use me because it's they like to teach people showing with like hair this difficult to work with, I guess, and like when it's super it's really weird so it's like the easiest job because, essentially, even though it's acting like i'm basically just sitting there. yeah it's a job, where you sit there so that was my main source of income."
480.0,Provider,So when. Is your hair colored right now.
15558.0,Patient,"No it's just it's hard to see because all the lighting matters like it'll look like it look like a brown hair, basically, but if I shine a bright light it'll look read. My hair is. wet everyone thinks I have black hair."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15558.0,Patient,"I can look like like an Italian dude like if I get out of the shower and slick my hair back, I will look like an Italian man like. That dark. But then like if you pull out the individual hairs like a like a barbershop or something that individual hairs wall look blonde."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15558.0,Patient,"But it's something I don't know it's like this weird thing. So, like, I actually because California Sunday, I wear hats everyone's always asking like why the hell do wear hats all the time when you're when you have hair like you should wear it's because I don't want it to change the color because it will turn blonde if I get son all the time. But then, so I had That was my main source of income and then I also have a good friend of mine had who used to be my landlord I used to live with them, but he. Had a company, where he trains dogs for like lapd la fire and because he has them as clients his bread and butter is he gets like. high profile celebrities because they all want the person who deals with police and fire. And so, he has a niche with like all the big music stars like big big big time actors like brad Pitt all these people bring their dogs to him. And it's it's an easy gig and he basically just needed a little bit of help with someone who we can trust, because when you're a dog's property, however, when you're dealing with people like that. They can make your life a living hell like they can put you through. Financial hell, even though a dog is property."
480.0,Provider,When lady gaga dog got stolen and shot. yeah that was very dramatic so yeah there.
15558.0,Patient,"But it's I mean by logs just in theory by law if there's something opposite of dog you're only responsible for whatever the cost of the dog, which I mean the cost of the dog can be expensive, but it's nothing but. People like that will just drag you through court for 10 years just to make your life hell, just to get back at you. So he's really particular about who he had because they have to be introduced to these people like usually the dog comes to his house, but, however, there are times, where you have to go to these people's House so obviously they don't want random people coming in there, but again. easy job i've always worked with dogs he trained me how to do it very simple even problem dogs, however. If you're dealing with problem dogs, one of the things you do is, you have to actually like get down with them get down on the ground, get down at their level, so they feel comfortable because standing over a dog to them is intimidation right. So, to get with a problem dog, you have to like develop trust, and all this stuff like that okay easy job, however. If you're having anxiety issues a dog picks up on that you have a trouble pitbull that the problem was is biting people you're down at a level like that something happens and you pass out and the people grabs you by the throat you're dead. So, like it affects stuff like that, and then my third source of income was just. Oddly enough. Here in La know, and I think someone talked about this in our group, where nobody wants to drive like the kids don't want to drive. Like to them, they would rather sit in the back of an uber be able to text, and all this kind of stuff. And gas everything's like it really does cost you about $1,000 a month on a car here I mean it's very expensive, so if you're paying less than 1000 a month and uber I mean you might as well over, but because of that. If you drive uber here, you can make 40 $50 per hour sitting sitting like this, I kid you not I was doing it in my free time because I was bored before all this started happening. Like in my free time I just be bored like hey, why not make some money and drive around la and it was like I mean if you really. just sit down and drive eight hours a day you'll make three to $400 a day easy and maybe you add that up that's $100,000 a year. Driving your car around in circles around town and. You just have to be comfortable with like somebody who don't know behind you, in your car which Oddly enough for somebody with anxiety issues that doesn't bother. I don't have stage fright i'd like none of that stuff bothers me, but what like when this this bout I guess we'll say this recent bout happened It started with. I was on set filming one of these industrial, for I once I think it was a car dealership so it's literally just me in the car dealership. Like I think it was like Toyota or something wearing like their gear just sitting there doing the routine stuff and I think it was just something simple like commenting on a Co workers like. Female coworkers shirt being tired or whatever like just you know, showing what you don't do at a corporation, and like as we're getting ready they're setting up the lights stuff like that we're just sitting there I just like turn white and faint. Like just a very. Typical like anxiety attack pass out. And like they're required to have medics on set, but the medics and said, obviously it's not a. psychiatrist it's somebody from the fire department, like a fire department medic so they just have to give their expert opinion which is just like okay look. This obviously could be something simple just feigning But what if it's you know, a heart valve or something like that they had to shut it down so. You know, with something like that, if you're it's a contract or you're a contractor for that gig so it's not like an employee job, where I can just take. A sick day and they're required by law to they have to let me come back all that stuff so basically by that happening, they had to shut everything down and with those it's usually a one day job but it costs them probably 100 grand a day. Because you're paying all these lighting. People script people like I mean there's 100 people working there for that day that all get paid they don't get paid by the hour they get paid by the day, so they all get paid everyone gets paid for the whole day, but nothing gets accomplished. So they just move on hire another person and just move on, because they can't afford to wait it out so basically I lose that job like essentially. Because it costs so much money and the the liability issue like they're never gonna like i've where i've been working with them constantly for. four to five years just regular don't audition nothing they just know we already know what we're getting with this guy hire him. And just go so i'm not an employee i'm just such a good contractor that they don't consider other contract, but because I cost them 100 grand they can't take that risk again so like that. Really, like, I think that really set and made it worse. yeah because."
480.0,Provider,"What happens with anxiety is when you have a. Physical thing like that, where you actually pass out, then you become anxious that that's going to happen and get right."
15558.0,Patient,"And, before that, had I had gotten that feeling while driving but I wasn't actually passing out because I recognize a few and I just okay it's not going to pass out, so I get off the next exit of the highway or whatever. or don't drive on the highway take the long route stuff like that, but then, when this happened, like I gotta be honest with people and, like the other person I work with is also my friend, so I had to tell him like hey. I can't really work with a problem dog right now I figured out what the hell just happened all this stuff and then with him it's. His business his personal business on his personal property he has liability insurance all this type of stuff so obviously with the liability issue he's like well I can't have you here."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15558.0,Patient,"And then something happens, and then I lose my liability insurance or something like that, so that I lost the other source of income was like wow OK, so now i'm down to only being able to drive to make money. So this is like Okay, well, I mean I can make like I told you, you can't make money doing that, like this, not the problem is not the money being available you just got to put in the work so, then I started like striving for uber and it just got like. to the point where I was. feeling, to the point where I was going to pass out every time I got behind the wheel and then started getting like really weird OCD stuff like I was washing my hands and felt like it was just not getting clean enough to the point where I mean. I would say it felt like an hour, I would say let's play literally 30 minutes under hot water to the where it was like damaging my hands."
480.0,Provider,Because you're having them under hot water for so long ago I started to crack and stuff.
15558.0,Patient,"And then, in the shower I was doing weird stuff like. doing the routine stuff like your armpits armpit or whatever, but I would like have to swoosh under my armpit and multiples of seven and, like weird weird stuff. started like. Having i'm now I have like a habit were have to pull out the little like. For women I assume they're more like those little white hairs that people just normally have like other ears and stuff but. As like an older do they start to become more like you can kind of feel them almost more like a whisker and now I have a habit, where, if I if I like feel any type of whisper and then I have to like tweezers and out. weird stuff and I dated girls like way back in the day that would have like we're habits like that, so I know it's like a kind of a common thing, but I never had. Any of that until recently, and even like when I was Tony like a year ago when it got really bad it wasn't OCD or anything like that, like with that it felt more like. I mean it felt like a neurological thing like almost like I was getting like it was like parkinson's or something weird that was like a takeover, but this is like where I could feel it being like a total mental thing and then like once. Okay, and I should also mention, I was able to finally get a hold of my primary care right before I got on this right before I got a hold of you die. or before you got on me, it was because I. literally been filing like federal complaints and should against them like, so I think that's why someone finally called me."
480.0,Provider,Like we gotta get rid of this dude.
15558.0,Patient,"But then when i've talked to her like over the phone she's like. The typical thing like anyone not in psychiatry is really we're worried to deal with anxiety so she's just like you know i'm. really worried about anxiety medication so she's she gave me I forget hydro something, and she was like, and you know this see if this helps or whatever. And all it did, I mean it made my anxiety way worse, and then a super dehydrated me like so bad like I was drinking two gallons of water, a day. And every time I took a pee it was still like dark like like not even yellow like a dark like orange like somebody who has like not drink water in three days it was like dehydrated me that bad, so I stopped they told me to stop taking that and then. she gave me authorization to talk to some other Tele health thing. I don't know what it was, but. But they were able to get the authorization to go through bright heart and get on this, so it was like this weird thing and then, once I talked to chantelle you know and told her everything she's just like you know. This is seems like you're having serious anxiety, obviously, and like you need to get to this you blah blah blah and then she gave me the it was the xanax during the day. Do not take it use it to fall asleep. And then she gave me it's like a Murcia. hasn't I don't know the names of the stuff but it's like a very low level antidepressant that it was I want to say serotonin or whatever for because I was having insomnia, to. And then. Since it's been on that. Besides, like the couple days, where the shift was going on with my mom and even then it was working. It was just it felt like. A little underlying anxiety when that was going on, but even when that was going on it, I could still feel like this stuff is working and it doesn't I don't wake up feeling groggy or anything like that, like i'm getting. I basically get like eight nine hours straight sleep and then wake up, with no anxiety like now it's just the the anxiety wall driving on the highway. mm hmm I will get if I don't take the xanax like a couple times i've tried felt like well if i'm waking up those it why don't I try to."
480.0,Provider,And I know.
15558.0,Patient,"If I can. At least drive like one time, like and see and then and then build it up or whatever, but it's still it's like when I get on the highway it does the same thing."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15558.0,Patient,"But it's mainly just I mean it's definitely working but it's, just like in my mind. I feel like I just don't want to. be taking pills all the time, like, I want to get to a point where I feel like I can at least. Have the pills there for when I feel like i'm going to have an anxiety attack, but not like have to take them all. Right you don't let it go thing is like I never worried about it before. Because I i'm not an addictive person like even when I get prescribed like opioids and stuff like I never I really don't even really take them because to me. The like the 10 minutes of nausea I get from. The end or something like that. Before the painkiller kicks in. And annoys me enough to the point where I rather just deal with the pain and not have that nausea like so and. And i've never like cigarettes alcohol I don't drink alcohol and in California, when you say something that everyone assumes like you had a problem or something like. People here we go out drinking like i'll get like a soda they assume like Okay, this is like. Oh, like. Honestly, the reason I don't drink. is literally because the bus isn't worth the money like I."
480.0,Provider,The bus tonight you know watch it all.
15558.0,Patient,"it's just kind of like in like the buzzes is kind of a and it just like in an order for me to enjoy the bus, I have to drink a bunch of water, because otherwise I feel dehydrated. So, like yeah i'll feel the buzz of being drunk but then I gotta pee every 10 minutes so it's just like not fun and then it's like it's the same thing, where. Like back in the day, like when all my friends were in their little like phase where like in like 2000 2001 like cocaine and sse were like really big. Like even when that whole thing was going on. Like I would try that shit and it would be all right it'd be like two hours of fun, but in my thinking because i'm so stuck or the next day I would wake up like hundred $50. For hours. At this at this time it was like. Everyone was smoking weed a ship to so in my mind is like pay for four hours, like that $150 I could have bought enough weed to last a month. And like and that's what my thinking. Was whereas I never had the thinking of waking up the next day of like man, I want to do more coke or wake up the next day like man, I need a drink like I woke up the opposite like I wake up feeling i've."
480.0,Provider,Never do that again.
15558.0,Patient,"100 bucks at the bar last night, like. Nothing fun happened like. I have a headache like. Like nothing good happened out of it like even the time so I did one I would think like. yeah I had fun, but then I really need to spend 150 bucks like those chicks we're going to be there, whether I drink those beers or not. Exactly so like."
480.0,Provider,"stubbornness, though, that just means you're very logical and can think. Through consequences."
15558.0,Patient,"But it's also but the stubbornness comes in and I don't even like talking like this during group because i'm afraid of offend everyone else, but to me it seems like. I don't like the mental weakness like I can deal with physical weaknesses, but I can't deal mental weakness, because i've just always. i've just always been in situations where mental toughness always conquered all like I went to. A private Catholic school where I was on without question and not even close by far the poorest person, probably the only poor person at that school. And it made me mentally strong like where other people become weak like I learned right away okay. i'm not going to compete with these kids trying to get the girl like i'm never going to be able to be the good kid with the new cool shoes like i'm not going to have the cool stuff so I learned right away like. i'm just going to be the funny guy or something that these kids can do and that worked even like when I transferred to public school where that was not a problem, like that was always something and I think that helped me, even with acting and stuff is like. Having something that can't be bought i've always felt like way more value like I grew up. With people that were parents were millionaires one of my friends dad was a billionaire that owns the indiana pacers Simon malls all this stuff and he is one of the most unhappy people i've ever met in my life. And I witnessed growing up it's because he had all the. cool shit everything and that's all he was. Very people would be hanging out at his house. Talk and I would see I would be standing right in front of him watching his reaction as his so called friends would be on the phone with their other friends. bragging about i'm at this kid's house his dad owns all of this they've got toe cards he's got a basketball for all this stuff bubble, and then I look in turn and look at my friends eyes and you can see the look on his face it's. Just like. I don't have any fucking friends. Right i'm just like this thing yeah and so like that. It and i've always felt like because of stuff like that, like. i've enjoyed my stubbornness in a way. Like I felt like it has gotten me through a lot of shit and like. i've had a lot of people get sucked into a lot of. holes of bad shit and then for me it's just. I could always be around it like. I could have a warehouse full of drugs next to me, and not even consider wanting to do them like it's that simple, whereas other people like. Just me saying that sentence with set something off in their mind to do drugs but it's like and but with the anxiety is that the one thing I could not. For force out like I mental toughness is almost like. what's killing me in this situation, because I feel like I shouldn't need any of this shit like in my mind I feel like I should be able to just force this out like because I know this is purely mental. Like I almost wish I had some severe trauma while driving or something, because then I would know."
480.0,Provider,Have a cause yeah.
15558.0,Patient,"Okay, this is the thing I need to work on, and then I can focus my my stubbornness basically on Okay, I need to force this out."
480.0,Provider,"And i'm not convinced you don't have a traumatic event to link this to I just don't know if you're aware because here's The thing is a lot of your. symptoms, so, while you were talking about the past year, my head when a couple of places one is Have you had coppa have you been positive for coven. Because there have been studies that okay so that's not even an issue okay. So then, my other thing is, it sounds very ptsd ish as opposed to just generalized anxiety, like the way you described it coming on so fast and it being so physical. It feels very ptsd ish, which is why i'm wondering like sometimes for people trauma isn't like what most people think of as big T trauma like you don't have to be raped, or have. killed somebody or witness someone being killed to still have trauma like basically trauma, in essence, is something that happens that surpasses our ability to cope right. So there might be something that this is linked to it's just figuring out what it is and you mentioned your mom having a stroke your head went to i'm not going to have any living parents, so your dad's not living anymore."
15558.0,Patient,Correct.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so when did that happen, was that traumatic."
15558.0,Patient,"not really it was. June, why I will say that I think I mentioned this in group, too, but he died on my mom's birthday, which would you think would be traumatic but that would be more traumatic for her than me but, basically, what happened is. It was during coven, but not because of coven so like when we're on lockdown I want to say, the beginning of May he tripped over himself putting on his underwear and like broke his."
480.0,Provider,hip.
15558.0,Patient,But in some weird position where it's.
480.0,Provider,Like.
15558.0,Patient,"He broke his leg, but it was like the upper leg work connects to your hips so it's like this weird. situation so obviously you have to have surgery, and all that kind of stuff so he was in and he had to have surgery to string kovats obviously everyone's quarantine so he was in their surgery What fine just recovering. In like the icu or whatever, and then with that progress to everything was fine so they moved him like a nursing home, but obviously still cove it so you have to be like lockdown or whatever so. He was going through like the rehab and everything like that, and then it was actually I wanted to say, like two days before he would have been able to be released. They had. I forget what the term for it, but not a blood clot but where. Something like a blood clot where your. bloodstream like gets blocked or something in your heart and you just like immediately just die I forget what it's called."
480.0,Provider,"like an aneurysm but, in the heart."
15558.0,Patient,Not an aneurysm but. I don't know why I can't think of the metal medical term it's a very common thing embolism maybe and.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, that sounds familiar."
15558.0,Patient,"Something where, and it was basically like because you'd been laying in the hospital bed, because the surgery because of what it was obviously we're walking around other than the rehab."
480.0,Provider,"So it was like whatever some kind of embolism something where it was just like whatever he just instantly died, but."
15558.0,Patient,"So, like we're sitting there getting ready to eat dinner it's my mom's birthday and then like the nursing home calls it's like go, you know we don't know how to tell you this, but your husband's heart stopped and."
480.0,Provider,When you're whatever. wow.
15558.0,Patient,"it's just he had it was during kovats so. You have me like everything's like separated so like we weren't at like you couldn't go visit him at the nurse, you know."
480.0,Provider,"And this was may of the year that your anxiety started that October same year. Okay, so I think this might be more related than you think."
15558.0,Patient,"But I should point out that. I talked to him a lot, but I hadn't seen him in a long time, like probably seven years, like because I just don't fly out there not, not because I any problems or anything like that, but just haven't seen him, but I talked to him, but we were never. Like we had a nuclear family and everything's fine, but we weren't like close close like my dad wasn't like. That."
480.0,Provider,"Right, but even if you're not close close so for men, this seems to be a bigger issue overall than women as men enter those ages like. it's the the focus of your thinking becomes more on the fact that you're not going to live forever right so having. Having your dad died unexpectedly, and then you all of a sudden, having all these physical symptoms that have no seeming underlying cause it's kind of like showing you how. Life is fragile right so that."
15558.0,Patient,"Again I should. I should go into further detail it's Okay, he was. But he was like luckily I got most of my grandpa's jeans so like i'm not short and fat, but my dad was five foot six like to 80 and I can honestly say i've never in my life that I can remember witnessed him drink a glass of water, he drink soda all day long. Like raw hey like literally raw hamburger like steak like a pop for when he ate popcorn he literally belted a stick of butter in a measuring cup and dumped to the whole stick so like."
480.0,Provider,For most people. crying now.
15558.0,Patient,"it's like what i'm trying to say, basically, is like we're most people would be like oh my God gone too soon, something like that, like honestly. I feel like he was very, very with his lifestyle, he was very, very lucky to live to be 78 like I can't believe he lived to be 78 because I mean I have parents, my friends, parents who just. Were vegetarians and stuff and drop dead before they were even 70 so like I feel very lucky From that standpoint um I mean obviously how it went down wasn't the best. Right um, but one thing that could be, if you want to talk about. Things really more related to that the one thing that bothers me more about that than anything is that. randomly after my dad died my brother just cut off communication to everybody. He didn't show up to anything. Like a phone calls want to talk to anybody. I finally talked to him and like i'm good friends, all I was thought I was like good friends with my brother like and he's. Like me, like when I talk about stubbornness like he's like me times 10 like very, very stubborn but he's also far more aggressive than me like he's the type and he drinks to drink. But very aggressive like i've liked the type like he's the dude that like bored with friends in a bar go up to some random person like just literally pick a fight with them like that type of. person so like we're different in that, but like we were close as far as like. I never worried. at all about ever been bullied as a kid because."
480.0,Provider,He older than you.
15558.0,Patient,He was four years older than me and like he. He was bigger but not like a huge dude but he was like the rugby football player hung out with the Dudes like so anyone messed with me and I was small like I grew. Like junior senior year high school is when I really grew before that I was always like the shortest person growing up like I was like five foot tiny person and then like midway through high school I sky I went to like six one like really fast.
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15558.0,Patient,"And then, so, but obviously I was smaller when I was younger, but I never worried about it, because if it came down to it, and like my father was kind of preach that to where it was like. If somebody bullied us it was like well he's bigger and you go out back grab a fucking two by four ride your bike over that bastards house and beat the shit out of them and, like that. I mean it works, I mean you don't want to say that this day and age, with the lawsuit era, but it works like if you step up to the bully they are not the bully anymore, but again."
480.0,Provider,"Bullying comes from fear. So, like if you call them out on that somehow they're going to back down."
15558.0,Patient,"And usually they can't fight because they're used to be on people who run away so they don't actually fight people actually get in fights stand up for themselves it's a whole nother story, but. Like with that I never worried and, like everything was fine even after my dad died when we're planning everyone going to Florida, and like he wanted to be cremated and have his ashes, you know, and all that stuff so it's all plan and everything is fine and then literally, the day before. He made I say made excuse, obviously I wasn't there, but just knowing him I know he made an excuse, but he my one of my older sisters had bought his plane ticket to go there, for some reason and didn't include. The fee for an extra bag, because they wanted to bring an extra bag, or something, and he used that as a lightning rod. As some fucking. crybaby excuse oh now i'm not going blah blah blah wow which is weird To begin with, but. with him, I could kind of see that, like a one time thing like that I could see like if some argument happen, and this particular sister is If anyone was going to start a fight it would be her like she was like. The one who always snitched on us when we're kids wow she was a tomboy like. pit like tried to pick on us like so I could see her causing something that make him not want to be there because she's there. hmm but that turned into just not responding to any texts no one's phone calls responding to know voicemails. long after for a long time and then this was before I started getting really bad and then, when I started getting bad. Everyone started calling him and stuff like telling him like whatever if you hate us that's fine, but you need to call your brother something bad's happening, he was just no response to nothing so eventually. I just got sick of it him not responding to me, so I just called I know where he works, so I just called where we works I got him on the phone and like I just called him out like. Why you're not going to answer home, like all this. Oh, trying to act like he doesn't know who it is like. Rather like you know my voice so he's like What do you mean i'm like. weird I said something i'm like you're not even going to answer like your own brother when he calls and he tried to say I don't have a brother who is this, I was like oh you don't have a brother. he's like he's like yeah i'm like yes, you do have a brother and he's like Oh, how do you know that, like because i'm your brother you dumb said when. you're talking to and then he's like oh hi hi how you doing, and then I like call him out like, why are you not answering like all these people are freaking out like like they think you're dead like blah blah blah and then. just out of nowhere he just went on this tirade and he was just like. Fuck you Fuck them i've always hated everyone in this family now I have an excuse not to talk to anyone anymore, everyone needs this pretend i'm dead, like all this shit and then just hung up on me and I was just holy shit. So you, basically, I was in a brother, at the same time. yeah so basically like after that i'm basically the only man in my family, essentially, which again. I can't emphasize enough it wasn't like none of us dependent on our back for anything."
480.0,Provider,"Right like. He was there and everything, but like never like."
15558.0,Patient,"If we wanted to go on spring breaks all with friends and stuff like we had to pay for it, like. My dad never taught me how to tie my shoes, how to ride a bike like any of that should never helped us with our homework any of that shit. they're always there we always had a house to live in like we always went to school, like all this kind of shit like it's like. Nothing compared to like people who grew up with no fathers or with horrible fathers beat them and shit like that, like not even comparable to that like I don't want to compare it to that, but I also don't want to make it seem like it's like. losing the Patriarch just like made the family rudderless or something like that, like that's not the case. Right, but it was definitely very strange that this point is when he chooses to do all this stuff because I get I mean if you'd have done this, when he was 18. It would have made perfect sense. Like you know what I do everything myself growing up blah blah blah like it would make. sense, but why at this time and the Dudes dead, so if your problem if if there was some. underlying problem he's dead. yeah problems over so like why choose now and then. On top of everything else, my two older sisters have a different bad. And they have nothing to."
480.0,Provider,Do with.
15558.0,Patient,"Any of this stuff and they're older so like my two older sisters were out of the House, by the time I was like six years old, I think."
480.0,Provider,interesting.
15558.0,Patient,"Okay, so it was never like. hey it was."
480.0,Provider,"It was never super traumatic there's still a lot of dynamics. playing out here that could cause anxiety, a lot of times the most common reason for anxiety and most people is children that grow up without like. Specific structure rules communication right so it's kids that are often left guessing. What their role is in the family, how other people are going to act or behave you know people that. have one day they do something and it's acceptable to the parents and the next day they do the same thing and then the parent yells about it, like that's typically how anxiety develops is getting those kind of mixed messages. So it doesn't necessarily have to even be a one triggering event, but I feel like it makes more sense given context of all these different family dynamics why all of a sudden, you would be experiencing it. But even so I don't think it's necessarily super important to focus on the why right because it's happening, so now we just have to deal with the symptoms."
15558.0,Patient,"And again, I just don't get. Why driving up the only thing I can get with the driving is that. it's. A point I guess or an activity point of the day, or whatever you want to call it, where you're kind of forced to be trapped with your own mind. yeah, for example, like on the highway is a point where normally it's like Chilean like that's your relaxed moment don't have to worry about anything like you literally just have to keep the wheels straight like that's, the only thing. And that's like where i'm at the worst like it's not so bad if i'm navigating through traffic or something like that. Because my mind is kind of focused on this, that this that kind of boys, looking around but. Like on the highway even like jamming out to songs I love stuff like that, like even that doesn't really help like it's just something about being confronted with. I have to sit there, and like deal with my own mind like there's no way to get around it and it's like the stuff again I get back to the stubbornness, where I can't distract myself, because I know i'm trying to distract myself. yeah which the medication helps with 1,000% but at the same time I don't want to be dependent on a medication, especially after like going through with this what i've dealt with with this medication where everyone's like. Okay, I feel like i'm either gonna like die in my sleep, or like become like addicted to this stuff because everyone's like makes such a big deal out of the anxiety meds but to me like they don't I don't wake up feeling like I need to take exams. That reason i've been. taking notes, because i'm prescribed to them."
480.0,Provider,Right.
15558.0,Patient,But when I drive I feel.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I do have to end because I have to go get a sick kid from school unfortunately um, but I want to schedule you again, what are you thinking as far as therapy, do you want to do weekly do you want to do every other week."
15558.0,Patient,"I mean weekly is good for me. Okay i'm like for me i'm more. focused on figuring out what the Fuck is wrong. than anything else, because if I feel like if I just half acid then. i'm not going to and then. again talking about with the anxiety, like, I have some of the good things that are going on right now, like because of my background and stuff i'm. i'm able to pitch ideas for TV shows and movies and stuff like that, so I have something going on on the side starting to production company which is gaining steam, however. My friend that i'm partnering with on it. Well, what can I tell I could say anything on here right."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15558.0,Patient,As long as i'm not. telling you i'm gonna kill someone or something right.
480.0,Provider,"Right, as long as you're not going to harm yourself or someone else."
15558.0,Patient,"OK, so my friend, that I want to partner with on this who's going to help me he knows everyone right, but his dad is allegedly the boss of the Chicago outfit right now. So i'm worried that i'm not worried about anything that's going to happen with this, because this guy's. They keep their kids out of everything, is this the guy i'm friends with this 100% cleaning, which is why he needs money, however, I know for a fact his dad is under 24 seven FBI surveillance so like once I go into business with these guys then i'm like literally."
480.0,Provider,Your mail is not going to be a paranoid feeling of somebody following me. know if someone's.
15558.0,Patient,"calling me. yeah so it's just like and then uh. i'm always just worried like just like what if they try to sneak some shit in there, like I just don't know like but. Again, but i've dealt with people like that all my life and never had a problem because, generally, even in P, with people with that life if you just tell them from the get go I just don't I don't care what you do, but i'm not going to be involved."
480.0,Provider,yeah. They respect that.
15558.0,Patient,As long as you're not. here.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so your schedules pretty open right now right."
15558.0,Patient,"yeah but the best time would be mornings, because I like to just be able to that way if I do have something to do I don't ever have to reschedule I know i'll be able to do the therapy and then go out find."
480.0,Provider,out early do you wake up in the mornings.
15558.0,Patient,I usually get up between seven and eight Pacific time but you're on eastern time right.
480.0,Provider,"i'm on East so my issue is next week is pretty full. I could do a six o'clock your time but that's really early for you or I could do, one of the days on my break next week and then the following week we can do like a consistent. um so starting starting on Thursday the 28th I can consistently do 8am for you eight 910 yeah that's 11 for me, so we could do Thursdays at 8am your time, except for next week we'd have to fit you into one of my break somewhere."
15558.0,Patient,"Well that's fine and then also. If you wanted next. Like for next for next week, on Monday i'm going in the morning at like 1130 I think I go to quest to do my blood work and stuff. So, on that day, I probably won't do anything all day so Monday like if you had something on Monday that was like just that, one day, that was later in the afternoon, then it probably wouldn't be a problem, because after getting blood work and shit like that I usually don't want to do anything."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so Monday the 18th we could do noon your time but will you be done."
15558.0,Patient,Oh yeah I probably wouldn't it be done yeah i'd be at the place.
480.0,Provider,"um my other option Monday would be. I could do for. I don't typically work that late so don't tell anybody, but I could do a four o'clock just because it's a one time thing."
15558.0,Patient,yeah I mean we can do that as long as it's not a pain in the ass like. I don't want. I don't want you to have to work weird hours or like not.
480.0,Provider,"Already hours and stuff so that's why i'm kind of like whatever. But I do have to run and get my kid because I supposed to get them an hour ago, and just couldn't leave so he's been sitting at the office poor kid um. But i'll put you down for four o'clock next Monday, and then the following week we'll start Thursdays at 8am and I can email that all to you, so you have it."
15558.0,Patient,So we do that.
480.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
15558.0,Patient,Definitely.
480.0,Provider,"i'm gonna write myself a note to email you later if you haven't heard from me by tomorrow, you might need to remind me to email you but i'm pretty sure i'll remember."
15558.0,Patient,What group in between that anyway.
480.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yes true so if by Friday you haven't gotten an email during group just remind me to email you. Okay, all right, well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day I wish we had more time to talk to her like coping skills, but the first session is always kind of a blur because it's a lot of background so."
15558.0,Patient,yeah well it's better to get your kid now or your kids gonna be having a therapist to talk about you.
480.0,Provider,"I have three of them it's Okay, I can mess, one of them i'm. kidding I didn't say that."
15558.0,Patient,didn't hear it.
480.0,Provider,"All right, i'll. See you Friday. bye."
