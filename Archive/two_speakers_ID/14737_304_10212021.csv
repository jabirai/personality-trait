Did you come from a prior treatment program prior to this."
14737.0,Patient,"yeah I was with Dr holds for at lighthouse recovery for a little over a year, I had met him actually through the jail program because I was in there for a dui. And then just continue my treatment with him outside it was I mean everything i'm doing is just me doing what i'm doing it has nothing to do it's not court assigned i'm not doing this for my. license or anything it's just you know me doing it because I want to. I didn't think there's the qualify for my license i'd have to go to a different type of facility for. That so it wouldn't even matter."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, so you do, you do have just that one dui pending."
14737.0,Patient,"You right now yeah that's all i've got is the dui and it's not pending it's it's done, I already served my time."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, just your driver's license."
14737.0,Patient,yeah it's revoked for five years.
304.0,Provider,Oh wow oh that's yeah.
14737.0,Patient,yeah trust me I know.
304.0,Provider,it's loud but.
14737.0,Patient,"You know what it was my stupidity, you know and no business drinking I had been sober for. About 13 years got a divorce met a girl started drinking got a dui."
304.0,Provider,"Okay. Had you had a prior dui from three okay so was was alcohol kind of a big issue for you in the past. Oh yeah yeah Okay, and what about now any craving Mr drink okay."
14737.0,Patient,"Well, I actually am i'm. I don't know if you want to call it lucky, or what but something happened probably about. Two or three months after the dui because it didn't stop me from drinking and. anytime I would just have like one beer one SIP of water like one half a glass of wine anything. I would get so violently sick, the next day, like a hangover from you can't even believe it like from one beer I would be I would be useless for like a day, and then the next day after that I would be pretty useless to so. got it to the point now where I physically can't drink. And i'm so grateful for that, because mentally apparently I couldn't do it, I mean I I had sobriety under my belt, I live, I mean I don't know how much you know about the a program that they have these promises. are true and they did I mean I was. When I got sober I was a tree trimmer making 16 bucks an hour, you know, at the end of my in 2015 my w two or seven figures. And I had the House the kids the dream, you know the three kids the picket fence dogs everything you know and no a lot of money in the bank and then I met pills and. it's all gone."
304.0,Provider,"So what yeah what happened, you feel like you sort of swapped the pills for the alcohol or how did you. feel it yeah."
14737.0,Patient,"I mean well, I mean. So initially I swapped it and then you know I I never drink, while I did the pills um but if I didn't have pills I would drink just to not be hung over and sick. So, but yeah I got in a car accident and then. It happened when I was sober I refused all kinds of pain medication for years, I did aquatic therapy physical therapy surgery back injections i've tried everything and. It just wasn't it wasn't doing it like the pain was still pretty bad, so the doctors like listen. he's like will monitor you will watch, you will help you with prescription, you know you're an addict like, but I really think you should try this new stuff fits all blah blah blah well the new stuff about the piano which. Is the strongest opiate besides fentanyl on the market it's it's hydromorphone which is stronger than oxy cotton and it's unbelievably strong. I didn't abuse it for a long time and then finally one day it's just my back hurt really bad and. I took two and that's that's it enough to make me feel like this holy cow which three going to do what's for going to do, and you know, at the end, I was shooting up 150 milligrams of oxy directly into my veins it was really, really bad I mean I was really fucking sick. and I was going to hospitals to get myself checked in when I didn't have drugs, so I could. You know abuse there I would shoot into the ideas that they gave me because they would you know start giving me my own mads it was just it was crazy. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on pills, because the stuff I was doing one pills 30 bucks and I was doing five at a time six times a day I mean it's 1500 dollars a day. yeah crazy. crazy. But. yeah so December 2016 I moved out of the House number went back got a divorce, about a year later, I haven't used since December of 2016 I haven't drank I don't keep track of the drinking honestly but it's been over a year, at this point um. I don't know I got I don't like sobriety dates, personally, I feel like. it's like the person that's got the most sobriety is whoever woke up earliest that day."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah but it but roughly yeah I think I think sobriety dates and if you've you've been in a they make a big deal about that. yeah but I mean the clients that I work with like I like to look at your life like Where are you in terms of your life now you know and i've heard you share, but you know you're. you're trying to just make healthy choices you're trying to repair your relationship, you know with your son. And maybe he's not ready, you know, but just to hear the way that you talked about that in group to say, but you know what like it's okay for me to protect myself, but just let them know like. i'm here, you know so so I hear you just making really like it, a new way of thinking that's healthier. And a new way of coping and and yeah I think that's you, you could have someone who's so you know, been in sobriety or recovery whatever you want to call it for years that you've probably heard an A you know they talk about like a dry drunk. Right so maybe a person's not drinking, or maybe a person's not using but if they are still engaging and dysfunctional behaviors and harmful relationships and they're not really to me like that's not really recovery."
14737.0,Patient,Right you're just you're not using the drugs but you're still your disease is still active.
304.0,Provider,"Exactly yeah so um but it sounds like yeah you're now you're facing things right, like you know if the dui you know you're not supposed to be driving like you're not. You know, doing things you shouldn't be doing so those sorts of things um yeah seem like you're in a lot a healthier place Neil, and knowing that you yeah wanted to continue your treatment. you've already come this far so. just keep going."
14737.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I wanted to do this because, like for me there's a lot going on it's just more than drinking or drugging there's a lot of depression there's a lot of anxiety there's a lot of things that i'm not familiar with i'm not. i've never had anxiety or panic attacks are issues with just being chill all the time because i've. never had a problem with it, but lately, I have been so I wanted to do this because I need a healthier way to deal with things than drinking or drugging you know and know if that means that. I don't know what it means you know i'm saying I just I just needed more than what he was doing, because as great don't get me wrong but it just. You know, like one of the one of the guys was talking about how people are on his ass because he's taking suboxone and saying that he's not clean and stuff like that it's just. You know, it was getting to a point where you know, they say, to take away what you like, and leave what you don't and it was getting to the point where there was just so much I didn't like about it that there wasn't. There wasn't a lot to take away so I still go occasionally, but when I got nothing against it, I mean it got me sober For years, the first time. I just this time around, I feel like i've got more going on up in my head than I did last time because last time I got sober. You know my life wasn't where it is today my life, I mean I apparently felt like I needed to go out and get a fourth dui before I could really. stop doing things because you know it sucks right now, and my biggest problem right now is just money and my ex wife, because she's absolutely just. I stayed in the marriage for 20 years 15 of those years, I should have not been there, my mom begged me to divorce her all my friends, because she just. Long before I became a you know, a raging pill addict you know, like I said I had sobriety under my belt and. You know I wasn't alcoholic when we first married for years, but she was bulimic and she about four years into the marriage is I found out about ahead, absolutely no idea. I found out about it and, of course, you know I wanted to get her Hall, if I wanted her to stop I want to hear to get treatment and stuff and. She just stopped cold Turkey she never talked to anybody never got therapy never did anything and she'd been doing it for 14 years, so the problem was is. that she stopped throwing up, but she turned into a complete rage monster when when I say that I it's it was it was to a point where. You know the last seven to 10 years my marriage, she would make me cry almost every single day break my heart sing terrible hurtful things to the kids dig her nails in their own, to the point where they would bleed. And so I stayed in the marriage, because I knew if I lived that those kids were going to be with that and. You know, it may not be the right reason, but I just couldn't I was right to because you know I lost my daughter was 12 and now she's 16 and. She finally just told me that she's still really mad at me she barely talks to me and she's the things he's most mountains, that I left her with with the mom. And it was really, really hard to hear because she wouldn't put it in tech she wouldn't. put anything in writing, she would only tell me, because he was so afraid that her mom would find out that she said something bad like that. And it's just it's traumatizing because she's really messed up all these kids I done my own share of my thing that a mom i'm not. i'm not trying to say that my my role in this is mood, but she really, really has done so much psychological damage and continues to do it to them. She keeps me out of their life when she civil towards me my relationship with my kids is great when she's not civil towards me my relationship with my kids is. Terrible and I know why, because it has to be because they can't be nice to me they can't. deal with me and they and if they do, they can't let her know, like, I have a relationship with my oldest son up until this last. Two weeks ago, and she didn't know about it, she didn't know we went to the bears game together she didn't know that we would talk and go to a meeting she didn't know any of this because he. wanted to know, because she treats them differently if she knows he's hanging out with me same with my middle kid. You know he's got a point where he doesn't care, we have a really good relationship him and I right now right now we're working on it, I mean it's not good, but it's it's in the right direction. And yeah he doesn't tell her anything you know he doesn't he won't tell her other thing about us talking. So it's just it's really, really hard, because my daughter is not my life and. My. team she's 16 now yeah. And she was my shadow and then she like when I when I saying stay in the marriage, you have to understand Lisa that I did everything and I first off. I didn't do it because she couldn't or wouldn't I did it because I wanted to, and I always wanted to I started my family when I was 23 I wanted to be a young dad I want to be done by the time I was 35. I got it all accomplished and. I did that because I wanted to be able to be a coach and be active in their lives and go to parent teacher conferences and boy scouts and I did all that and I took them to every doctor's meeting every. Unless I was out of town, I did every single thing and I loved it and I think that that's another part of it that's hard because. I went from doing everything to now, not even being there and I know that there's a ton of resentment from my daughter. And she just doesn't deal with things talk to me about it, you won't talk to anybody about it, these battles it up and just chooses to to push it into the ground and it's hard. it's hard, I am so afraid, for I really am."
304.0,Provider,"You know if she would talk to someone yeah friend or a teacher, you know anybody a pastor. Like that would be so helpful."
14737.0,Patient,"I agree, I actually. I took my ex wife to court about four months ago to try to get a court order so she could take the child. And I lost. So. I don't know i'm just yeah i'm just gonna just keep trying to make money, I think, right now, the. Only way that's going to improve anything in that situation and money. So. My both now and trying to make money at my work and do my side jobs and consulting I do marketing and sales consulting for a small boy. So right now i've only got three clients, but you got to start somewhere."
304.0,Provider,"yeah oh wonderful Okay, I know, Neil gosh not all gloom and doom, but like I think your recovery is just probably the biggest thing. That you're showing your kids you know you're living it like you're not just saying it in, but like you're actually living it. And you're not just going through the motions of counting days that you've been sober but you're actually you know living it and making these changes and showing up for them. And I think like yes, if you can't you know that's so tricky if your ex wife is such a an influence. on them, but yeah I think as much as you can just letting them know that you love them that you're there for her that you know. That you're there. You get to see her."
14737.0,Patient,"I mean, I have joint custody and I have assigned parenting time but it's difficult because it's. Like i'll make a long story short, so when I when I when the divorce was finalized and everything. I would go to the House and part of the divorce agreement and I agreed to like my ex requested that. Before I pick up the kids to take them out or do anything that I take a drug test and the intention was to make sure I wasn't doing any. opiates or hard drugs or anything she knew I smoked marijuana the judge new I smoke marijuana at the time that the order was written. The order was written with the language that basically said I had to take a drug test before I was able to take the kids didn't say anything else specific. When fast forward to about it was like the third time that I had actually done anything with them she's like hey. Can you take a drug test and i'm like sure no problem and the way we had it set up that I would go into the bathroom and we you know we got a master bedroom upstairs that's huge and. The kid when my adult boys would come up with me and leave the door open or they would go in with me or whatever so. We wanted to the bathroom but to the tasks I left it there, like I did like like you know normal. She goes in by five minutes afterwards and he comes out just screaming you mother fucking cock sucking to freaking out just screaming and I had i'm like what. she's like there's no way these kids are going anywhere with you freakin drug it i'm like what are you talking about what is wrong. i'm like I know you're I know the test is negative negative positive i'm like it's not positive but i'm not doing any drugs he's like. Really cuz marijuana's in your system like what's like marijuana's in your system okay so she's like you're not taking them i'm like you've got to be effing kidding me. So then, at that point i'm a very fine i'll stop smoking pot, and I did, and so I waited 30 3035 days and i'm going to take another drug tests. She wouldn't let me come into the House to take the drug test he wouldn't let anybody go to burger King or mcdonald's with me, so I could take the drug tests there. So she said that the only way I can now see the kids so I went and took the drug test at a facility and the facility was going to charge $150 which at the time, I mean, even now, I mean I can't do that anytime. So, then, I took it back to court and the Court said that if she wants me to do that, that he had to be half. And so it's just been a nightmare, he has blocked me at every road from trying to have a relationship with my kids once my my plate my sticker expired, the day that I picked them up and expired and she's like can I get in your car your plate expired. Jesus. yeah another so. it's just. really hard."
304.0,Provider,that's so terrible.
14737.0,Patient,"Sorry, I didn't mean to. Talk about it very much so, I guess, I just back."
304.0,Provider,"yeah get it out, no i'm so sorry that she's hurting them, and I think like hopefully they will see that that it's not you. yeah but you're doing like what you can and yeah just trying to support yourself financially, you have your own place. Your own apartment and things are okay in that department."
14737.0,Patient,"All my liver my girlfriend yeah. Okay, we actually rent the House."
304.0,Provider,"Good good okay so yeah so you're just working. yeah you know the a meetings like yeah I mean I, and I do like that, like takes take from it, what you feel is helpful and read the rest, but if there was more that you were leaving than you were taking check out Mara international I think we mentioned that in group."
