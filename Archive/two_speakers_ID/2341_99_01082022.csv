You know, late two things is that something that's you know."
2341.0,Patient,"Not massive trip, where I mean it might be a minute or two i'm every once in a while um but for certain themes like hanging out with friends or something like that I might be I. can be a procrastinator subtext."
99.0,Provider,Is it something that you want to shift is it cut does it cause problems for you.
2341.0,Patient,"Nice problems but. It definitely. yeah, I would like to share."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so what can you do let's just think of some strategies so that you're able to just show up for whether it's for sessions with me or for your friends or potentially down the line for work, what is something you can do differently."
2341.0,Patient,"it's actually pretty it's actually really simple just get my get my ass up. i'm early so that cuz you know when i'm get when I get ready, I might like to take my time in the shower or you know what I mean just the warm shower feels good to wake you up in the morning. i'm. You know, going outside start in the car, making sure it's warm before I get in there just it's it's it's super super basic just gave up earlier and. And I know that you know I just cut to. Be. it's you know. And I am working towards it just discipline myself to do it."
99.0,Provider,What gets in the way of what has gotten in the way of doing that.
2341.0,Patient,"Just being like waking up and being like i'm so comfortable and the heaters right there and it's so warm and. I can other five more minutes and i'll be i'll get there in time hey maybe another five more minutes, and then you know, maybe another five more minutes, and then you know, and I was like hey i'm starting my closing just go to work. yeah but yeah it's it's it's it's super simple you don't have."
99.0,Provider,"Nothing to it doesn't sound like it's happening that often are and in you know, causing you problems in your life yet."
2341.0,Patient,"I don't know it's it's really been like a huge problem, I mean like if i'm ever late to work it's like. Like to work, you know to. Three minutes every every week or something once a week or something. Okay."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so what um What would you like to work on today, we still have some time so anything in particular. You want to talk about or something that's up for you."
2341.0,Patient,"Know really bad like my life is kind of. You know um. I mean, of course, there's gonna be times when there's gonna be like things that come up but, for the most part the last few weeks has been pretty basic you know just going to work, and you know hanging out with friends and. And dance. yeah I haven't made one to the gym but then the other day, when you play tennis. went for a run yeah. Pretty pretty basic and then, when i'm. And then, what when I get off for her you know when i'm not hanging out with friends i'm watching a movie. And some you know. get some rest."
99.0,Provider,So it sounds like there's a good balance of taking care of work you're being social you're taking care of yourself sounds like things are in balance.
2341.0,Patient,yeah yeah they really are. They really are. And the the um the the doctor did make a mistake with the medication she she I don't know if you heard me ship put it up to eight milligram. and
99.0,Provider,Catch that.
2341.0,Patient,"I think. About like her, the prescription or whatever, she had put it up to eight milligrams and I was at four milligrams and I kind of just didn't pay attention to it, I just kind of took it as. I just didn't think that much about it and. So I just took the medication a milligrams. And the."
99.0,Provider,big difference.
2341.0,Patient,"yeah that's for more milligrams then there's. After and I did that, for she prescribed that for two weeks. yeah so I don't know if. I should have asked her and sometimes I don't think of it will work when i'm in a group um if I should have asked her to win it back down like maybe like flight, since it was on a flight go to six and then five and then back to for because they wanted it would only been three weeks."
99.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know anything about the pharmacology of suboxone and it's really not my realm to to say yeah that's a good idea, or what, so I would. reach out to her and have a either address it on Tuesday or have a session an individual session with her on Monday, if she's able so that she can be aware that I mean I imagine she's aware though, if you were at before and it got bumped up to eight. yeah."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah but in the group all she said was and and. And I think twice today. Because I shall she said it was. What you were out, for she thought she's she's our value prop for she's she said, my bad, but uh you know it's kind of a kind of a big difference."
99.0,Provider,it's a big difference yeah I mean that's as much as I understand it's like you know you owe you keep freezing.
2341.0,Patient,Oh cuz like if I take four milligram i'm. Like why i'm taking now i'm that'd be like taking. A he milligrams is basically taking two were taking now in you know so it's a little bit it's pretty big difference.
99.0,Provider,"yeah it's a big difference and and. I mean. I don't want to put ideas in your head, but I would I would be like I should you know you work hard to taper down and then to be back up it's like."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah and and. that's the boxing like I mean I get off at the the maximum out, which I think is three eight milligrams a day. 2923 2424 milligrams and i'm down to four milligrams so i'm. Because I started. and And it really it doesn't make me feel any certain way anymore. It just It makes me. and But you know, as I taper down. It makes me. It just makes me feel like i'm like I like I should feel like not with withdrawing or anything like that. And, as I taper down it it continues, it just feels the same like now that i'm taking four milligrams it kind of feels the same as when I was taking. 25 or whatever milligrams. But the. But the taper different it the taper definitely has a big deal to do with it."
99.0,Provider,"yeah okay. So, yes."
2341.0,Patient,"What I was i'm sorry um what I was trying to see is just. yeah so like when I take the suboxone the medication it doesn't make me feel any sort of way it just makes me it just is my medication. And then, when I don't take it that's when I noticed a difference, like if I if I go a day without a like i'll definitely feel like you know withdrawal symptoms stuff like that it makes me feel like we."
99.0,Provider,yeah sure yeah I mean I don't know what is your goal Is your goal to taper off completely.
2341.0,Patient,"i'm. Eventually, but I feel like i'm at a very low milligram i'm that. Like you know just that, along with the counseling for a while I feel like I feel like that that's the best goal and idea for for for a bit longer not some since i'm such a low milligram you know."
99.0,Provider,"yeah for sure, and one thing to know is that even when you've tapered off completely you can still have counseling with me, you can still come to the group's you're not out of bright heart health you're still able to come. For that support yeah because you know and again it's really not my room to say much of this, but I do know that any medication it's hard on the body in some ways, so ideally if you're able to. Keep tapering down at your own speed when you're ready it's just one less you know foreign thing in the body that that's you know it is hard on the organs really."
2341.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah for sure.
99.0,Provider,"So yeah right, so if i'm hearing you know, right now, the support feels good to have medication and counseling as you taper even if you're super low and eventually get off you wouldn't lose the support of the Group and counseling if you still wanted it. yeah yeah for sure."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah because you know um yeah because any kind of by foreign substance can be you. can be rough on the body, you know, especially. Fear like overdoing it. yeah yeah."
99.0,Provider,"Well gosh it home you remember, I know, we had talked about you wanted to work on something, and you said it was it was something you wanted to be working on in our sessions and you're excited about it, and I have a feeling, it was like art art therapy related. Creative process."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah it was um somehow it was, I think, when I talked about like mixing like. The more like cuz i'm a really. The way my brain works, has always been kind of. Like you know how you have the right side of your brain, the left side of your brain and one's more creative in one's more logical. just learning how to use them in in conjunction or in Union to you know to. Just handle situations."
99.0,Provider,"What is the last maybe challenging situation you had and. Well, tell me that first let's start with that question first and I have another question."
2341.0,Patient,"Well, maybe if it was like so a job in the past that was like real methodical and it was just like. You know just. Just. You know something like suit just something like you're just doing something over and over again, like i'm. Especially. it's horrible to say this, but like i've had some jobs that didn't pay very well and they're just like really super methodical and I was like. Oh, my gosh i'm not getting any like savings in my account i'm not going to be able to travel, where do any fun things you know, this is just getting me the bare minimum, and they can be real methodical and. And then just what my mind tends to like not be able to focus like focus on like room with audit methodical things."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, see you have a hard time when it's kind of just like repetitive kind of not that challenging mentally it's hard to stay engaged."
2341.0,Patient,um. I mean if it's super super like methodical like say you're like stapling paper is all to hear something like that you know what I mean some some.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so. So what's your wish to. Your your curiosity, how to bring more creativity into situations like that, or what tell me what. What you're wanting to."
2341.0,Patient,"I guess so but like I, in the same way, like I also. Moscow like content right now with with the way things are. So I, and when I said that I was just trying to like you know. You know um. Have a because we were we were talking about goals and where we want you know, but like i'm pretty content like actually with things right now."
99.0,Provider,"uh huh good great i'm happy for you um I guess the one question that comes to mind is is there some area in your life, where you want to be bringing more creativity in or more of your logical capacities."
2341.0,Patient,"i'm. Sorry, you popped up and I appreciate it."
99.0,Provider,"yep wondering if there's some area in your life, where you're wanting to bring in more creativity or you're wanting to bring in more of your like logical rational self."
2341.0,Patient,"I feel like there is, but I feel like i've also been like doing this for a while the the group and account seen that i've kind of learned color and have been implemented in implementing it like saying like relationships like I used to throw myself into them like like. Without. Just for i'm. Like no logic just how I felt. Much more by. Like trying. Obviously, yes, I feel some reason, in your heart but, like you know you have to be logical about it, because you know, I just want to protect myself from getting hurt or having a coin to another piece of relationship or something like that."
99.0,Provider,So it sounds like you're slowing things down that's something that's different.
2341.0,Patient,yeah for sure yeah.
99.0,Provider,"yeah, so in that relational realm letting your mind come in a bit more, and maybe assessing the situation taking your time."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah for sure yeah just pitching my time and. My you know if I see a pattern of maybe like an argument clean up that I might have myself to like. Get extremely angry about or something like that um if I see that coming i'll walk away. And then. Go be by myself and. and stay by myself till I figure out like like i'm not being i'm i'm not being rational, or maybe that other person isn't being rational and I need to figure out what i'm going to do about it."
99.0,Provider,that's a huge one that's a huge one to slow yourself down from a habitual reaction in order to get your brain back online.
2341.0,Patient,"yeah because in some in some my past relationships um. I hey someone um we were an argument came up or something like that, and it was actually something maybe um when I look back and think about it, maybe the person had been cheating or or doing something they shouldn't have been doing and I actually would like, for some reason i'm. find a way to like. Make it feel like it was my fault for some reason, like I had. You know. I have, maybe if I wouldn't have said this or dumb or something you know what I mean and and that's just not that's completely now I see that's completely irrational and doesn't make no sense."
99.0,Provider,"Your X, it sounds like you're really actually honoring yourself and saying hey like this is what I want and, and this is not okay with me, and this is your stuff."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah yes. I think it was, and it was also thinking of like being afraid of being alone, so I would try and like. Find and and and like you know the you know that maybe the person i'm thinking of right now wasn't a horrible person, but just maybe. In like a sex addict or you know something like that they were little you know, to see if they're receiving around or something like that and. I would either ignore it or try and find a reason to might be like Oh well, that you know when we were cooking or when he he could do you know I buy sets up in about his food that would like just find a reason to make. put it on myself, and it was. Now, when I look back i'm just like that is completely ridiculous I at the point that I found out some of these scenes I would find out like I should have. distance myself from that person to show that person that you know i'm not gonna put up that i'm not going to put up with that you know."
99.0,Provider,"I mean, I think you know what I heard in all of that was. Maybe you overrode some of these rational things because he didn't want to be alone. I mean that. That sounds like the heart of it actually."
2341.0,Patient,And i'm another thing. I know we were only supposed to do. But.
99.0,Provider,We have about three minutes left so. three. minutes here yeah.
2341.0,Patient,"Well, it goes back to just um there's I have there's something in me. That I am working on and i'm working on very hard, but about not what of about being afraid of being alone."
99.0,Provider,yeah.
2341.0,Patient,"I mean, and some people I look at some people and they can be alone in their pay they get to enjoy thing. That I do like my alone time don't get me wrong, I actually took like really enjoy my alone time but i'm. Sometimes, if i'm not in a relationship and i'm alone that's what scares me."
99.0,Provider,"hmm that sounds like a really important thing to keep to pick up on like you know what is it that scares you around really being alone, if you don't have someone in your life."
2341.0,Patient,"yeah and I think it's. My it's like. If something comes up like who am I gonna like who's gonna who's gonna who am I gonna be able to talk to about it. You know. I back I guess you just. Like if I, if I can have an argument with somebody at work or just pretty simple stuff but still, you know."
99.0,Provider,"yeah i'm going to invite you to journal about this and the prompt is going to be how far back does this go this fear of like who's going to have my back. Because oftentimes these things they can go really far back and it's like early childhood stuff so so there's an invitation to journal about it, you know how far back does this fear ago."
2341.0,Patient,"And it, I think it does. It free for sure i'm probably stems back to childhood and maybe like i'm. kind of abandonment or something maybe we could die can journal about it and talk about it to more next."
99.0,Provider,yeah let's do that.
2341.0,Patient,Because that's that's something actually i'm. actually know somebody that journals and something i've never done so so.
99.0,Provider,Totally yeah and it's. It you know it can just open up so much when you start writing you might you know you might want to keep going with it and and just writing. come out come out.
2341.0,Patient,yeah you you got stuck for a long time.
99.0,Provider,Oh shoot yeah anyways I was saying it's a good it's a great practice and just letting whatever wants to come out come out on the paper as you start turning and memories may come up and other other things.
2341.0,Patient,yeah yeah. i'm excited.
99.0,Provider,All right. Good.
2341.0,Patient,journaling book and.
99.0,Provider,"awesome I don't know if you caught it because I got frozen up but there's a practice of. doing it in the mornings, you know waking up and just first thing before you start getting into anything else in your day even just write one or two pages just let whatever wants to come through come through and it's kind of surprising sometimes you know what comes out."
2341.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. yeah okay. yeah and I guess I can. yeah yeah that makes sense.
99.0,Provider,OK. OK alright man have a great night.
2341.0,Patient,"All right, thank you, sorry sorry I was late, I really didn't need it, but um we'll start start putting in the phone, so the phone reminds me."
99.0,Provider,"Yes, next time we schedule something i'm gonna make sure you put it in before we. Okay."
2341.0,Patient,"Okay, your music I don't want you to I know you'd like your music and."
99.0,Provider,bye bye.
2341.0,Patient,"All right, bye bye."
