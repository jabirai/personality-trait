7441.0,Patient,Hello.
271.0,Provider,Can you hear me. or not one day all the time and I forgot to turn the on button on.
7441.0,Patient,Oh.
271.0,Provider,"Well i'm Dr Oliver and we've not met, but you've been in bright heart health, did you move states. Yes, where were you living at. We were 11 at now. Right and we're at in indiana. Okay well i'm in evansville indiana Kentucky guy."
7441.0,Patient,Hello.
271.0,Provider,"So that's where you get sent to me I look through your chart the other night. and Sorry, I missed this monument I spent yesterday, trying to get them to set up an appointment with you and, at the end of the day, they hadn't set one up yet, and then they sent me an email at five o'clock this morning I didn't see obviously it's just like this morning. Was the way."
7441.0,Patient,"I thought the lady was talking to the way that she sounded when they were setting up the meeting was like they were talking to you, so I didn't know what happened this morning, but I figured you just got busy."
271.0,Provider,"You might. notice that you're on three subjects daily. All right, and. Are you. Have a reaction to the suboxone or nausea or what."
7441.0,Patient,Are you asking about the actual suboxone.
271.0,Provider,"yeah suboxone has. If you have an orphan, which is the active ingredient, with no oxygen and somebody attacks is beautiful orphan without knocks on. which we usually give just a pregnant woman. yeah I know you know why they put you on subjects."
7441.0,Patient,"yeah because. it's my stomach and. It just do better like it, this works better, with the only people morphine. I don't feel is he and I did my stomach don't hurt."
271.0,Provider,"Okay, well, a couple things one is the those aren't reactions to the knowledge zone that's a common. A common. misconception that people have the knowledge, so one is actually a 10 milligram pill, which is not even absorbed by mouth. They make a 50 milligram locks on pill that would give to alcoholics because it helps decrease the i'll call it cravings and all of my alcoholics that are taking the 50 milligrams locks don't don't have any nasca. The lock sonus and the suboxone is only a two. yeah so so it's it wouldn't be possible for that to cause nausea the 50,000 plus they make it so that the two is not even observable what you put the two milligrams zone is that if you crushed it up. And and snort it, you can start it, and it goes into the bloodstream. Or you can shoot it up IV, so they put the lock stone and to keep her for shooting up because you're screwed it up, then it locks on works that's like taking archean with it, but if you think about mouthy to mark i'm oxygen isn't even absorbed. The feds don't want us to give them the subtext of them without no locks on to anybody unless they're pregnant because i'm like so I might possibly potentially. be harmful to the baby, otherwise they want us to give just the suboxone because that prevents them from being chartered are shooting up that's why they put it that way. And I believe that you may not do that, but it's got a higher resale value on the street, the one that doesn't have oxygen in it. So unless you're actually have a document allergy to have meaning that you smell like a pig and can't breathe, then we can't keep it as a box set up your tax. And I know they had been doing that, but the person that was doing that was an error and i've just checked with the right heart health pharmacy and the right her health. Medical. Medical manager and they both have stayed in the same thing."
7441.0,Patient,Okay.
271.0,Provider,"Now the. The bright heart health pharmacy is going to contact you and go over with you the correct way to to use the suboxone so Chelsea limited aza. There is a certain technique to use. that limits the nausea with it. With both have the same suboxone in his name organization knows what works, the same way. Now what How long have you been on a separate tax. When did you start."
7441.0,Patient,"This suboxone or just the subjects. Either i'm poo i'd say like year and a half, maybe two years ago."
271.0,Provider,Right well kinda drugs were using before that.

She was a crackhead in she used to get pain pills because something was wrong with her hip she was in a car crash or something like that, and like it started off by like just taking them from her is her parties and stuff and then. My mom got addicted to them so like she'd have me go to doctors and get some and give them to her, and I was just like oh he's a. Interest interested, I guess, I, like the way they felt, so we started taking them and then, when I got pregnant the doctors gave them to me after my surgeries and stuff and then it like took off really well after I kids I guess.
