Good morning Ashley how are you. i'm okay Oh, I hear a birdie. So, give me an update how the last couple weeks been I you know appreciated your honesty about the relapse. How have things been going since that and you also said boyfriend was back from Oklahoma and you all were talking more candidly and I you felt like we're back on track, so give me an update what's it been like."
5718.0,Patient,"So far, everything's been pretty good at singing with my boyfriend. Which is good he's been helping me a lot so it's less stressful push the babysitter sleep a little bit more night now so we're both getting more sleep, which has been. helps a lot, but there has been another little setback, but it's not really on my turn, but like my dad used anything like 30 years. Oh now he's still like he's still on this stuff and I don't know how you can when you said he's done, but he feels really bad and stuff and it's like."
510.0,Provider,"Oh wow so he had 30 years sobriety. And just recently relapsed and what is his drug of choice Ashley what what would he use. Oh, goodness gracious what do we know as well, and if he's actively using it's harder to get a level of insight, but any idea what you think from your perspective. What prompted it."
5718.0,Patient,"I don't know I hope it wasn't me doing send it off because I kind of like I wonder if that was aspect of it, so I hope it works, but it could be there, we actually live so close to a dealer he's actually right next door so there's that but, like, I still feel like it's a choice."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
5718.0,Patient,Like yeah that's right good he is everywhere. it's literally Everywhere you go to the gas station or she was like smoking a pipe. For drugs like. Now so.
510.0,Provider,"It makes it difficult, I mean literally you are walking around and constant triggers, and that makes it really difficult i'm sure to kind of protect your own sobriety but now. Now within your own home. yeah that's really unfortunate to hear and you're not responsible, but at same time you do have children, you are responsible for their safety and protection. How, you know what, what do you think the plan is going to be has there been any you know boundary setting and it's his house, I think it gets really dicey because they think you live there with your family. yeah yeah."
5718.0,Patient,For sure.
510.0,Provider,"yeah, what do you think's going to happen, what would you like to see happen."
5718.0,Patient,"i'd like to see it all just go. like to see the cleaning up for the next few days, it takes, and that too yeah. yeah figure it out from there because. there's already so much going on that's good work, the last one, so I wish that would happen so if it doesn't look too I hope it's not like this, but, in my eyes, it might be hard to get off of it."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5718.0,Patient,"So, like. Say hey feels like crap, and all this. stuff we could tell and those like kind of aware that a lot. In so he's like it'll never happen again. You know if you really want. to worry, we can safely my mom is like devastated right now."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, I bet. i'm sure everybody on some level is like yeah."
5718.0,Patient,"yeah it's horrible like so my brother that you came here and that's kind of how I did every lapsing and i'm wondering if that's how my dad he's well because it wouldn't be free for sure so it's like cuz he actually relaxed about a week and a half ago now, just once. But he um. He just. He actually had to go to the hospital because he did so much scared or something. So after that he wasn't supposed to be using now. And I actually thought it was weird can I get up at like three in the morning I can't sleep, so I came in here to my like it's our laundry. and crafts, I created and stuff. And it was about that time during the war and then maybe get who's coming in from outside, and I was like that's weird yeah but I tried to my mom. My mom asked her, she was like. Did did he leave like the outside, why do you never work for him. In so I guess that's how he got something cool yeah it was like. You could I could tell her like right away for you, because I knew, you know my own personal stuff I knew. She doesn't know how to judge it she's never done so it's like but um yeah no worries it's my brother was here that triggered it kinda. Like it was for sure you know what I mean. Because At first it was me."
510.0,Provider,"mm hmm. I mean I yeah I think there's probably some good insight into that but. I you know well we'll see what happens and that's going to be a really dicey situation. Because we know if he goes down that path, all goodness and you're saying he's still using from what."
5718.0,Patient,"Your yeah I hope you guys, it is again. Today, definitely not tells you did. yeah I don't know what to think because I just know personally if he's anything like me which he is um it's gonna be hard for him to quit you know, but, for me, I was able, this time around i'm proud of myself, I was able to put it down and be like okay i'm. Like crap which is it over family like I just couldn't be comfortable around my babies. And I just I put it down. For him. The lungs kinda like. You know innocence innocence kissing his ass really cuz she he's talking about committing suicide and stuff which I don't blame her for being supported and not want that to happen, which I don't either, but she can't think it's okay either."
510.0,Provider,"way you repeat that, as he he's reporting suicidal."
5718.0,Patient,"Statement nice he's talking about it. And i'm just like that's definitely not what we want, so i've been trying to help him out to support was like telling me rather than saying like don't even talk like that, because nobody's judging me like that, like. It cannot get any better without you hearing stuff because now he's all like embarrassed because. he's going through so emotional parts of it, because he hasn't done it so long so it's like. I feel like it could just be as emotions, which I hope but it's whisker nearly."
510.0,Provider,"Well, it is, and I mean i'm a mandated state reporter Ashley i'm concerned that he might need a welfare check when was the last time he endorsed this sort of suicidal."
5718.0,Patient,"It was the first time, the first time in like this time around you've just been like really upset and my mom said that she's worried about that, so I don't think to stand up just the first time lapse, like the week and a half ago, he did it and so he hasn't done. He hasn't said it out loud again or anything like my mom just warnings about it because she could tell that that's not. Like. he's he's I guess the main reason for having used as being depressed so it's like."
510.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean it often goes hand in hand. But then, once people start really when they're really under the influence that's where the danger of you know, an impulsive Apps you know it takes one thought of you know what i'm just going to off myself and There you have it, and that's really, really dangerous. yeah What about trying. To get him to be evaluated. i'm sort of wondering if I need to."
5718.0,Patient,"know I don't think you need to do that, but I do know i'm going to take it upon myself to go ahead, you sleeping in like. A get some stuff going for him, especially in a housewife like I wanted to please man like you've never had evaluated for pressure never talked to a doctor, but any problems. And I don't think he really he judges me a lot about the meds that I take all the time and you're just out of my head. Show and then now we got to go through them like they know that's where they come in and they helped a lot, but just just. To give you a middle ground and so i'm like i'm gonna. i'm gonna wait, but maybe. A day. Maybe tomorrow or something as long as you. Know kind of too crazy or anything so i'm going to try to take into the clinic I get to that and."
510.0,Provider,what's the name yeah because you are connected to a clinic that's a good point what's the name of your clinic is it close.
5718.0,Patient,To be healthcare and it's kind of close yeah i've actually the one I live by is close just I just have been assigned to. The same clinic so so yeah it's close.
510.0,Provider,So shasta community.
5718.0,Patient,Health care health.
510.0,Provider,"Yes, gotta do that yeah what's their intake process, I mean a lot of times they do. and I wonder."
5718.0,Patient,Would that be. doable yes it is. Okay it's just a matter of maybe.
510.0,Provider,Getting him there.
5718.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah i'm gonna have to happen, no matter what nature does because i'm not gonna let it go down a hill and you know it's just. That it's going to get better So even if he doesn't end up on them that's fine too, but he needs to at least. You know yeah be evaluated stuff just to see if there's something we can do there's something here, then you could possibly take that would you know or just even if he does it that's fine too, but I feel like we need more of a professional sense to it."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, yes, you need to get eyes on if he is under the influence and actively using they're going to want him to probably detox it's really difficult to evaluate someone for mental health and he legit might have a lot of mental health diagnoses, but when."
5718.0,Patient,"People are under the influence, you have to get it out of your system to kind of have a better idea."
510.0,Provider,"What do you think his level of motivation, if you said hey dad I want you to come with me, I want to show you kind of where I get support and see like do you think he'd be open to it."
5718.0,Patient,"I think, so I think we're all kind of do it i'm hoping that he would go through with it."
510.0,Provider,Because.
5718.0,Patient,"You know, we talked a lot and sometimes he doesn't always fall but i'm hoping that he for sure rather do this again, you know."
510.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5718.0,Patient,Like free that works out to.
510.0,Provider,You know.
5718.0,Patient,it's like. it's scary because he's been my role model.
510.0,Provider,"Well yeah now the recent suicidal discussion is, are there any weapons in the House if he indicate how you'd want to hurt himself."
5718.0,Patient,"No, no okay yeah because I want to sell any provision so."
510.0,Provider,"that's a good point, yes, good glad. you're saying on the point where the art, yes, you know we have a kitchen knife should."
5718.0,Patient,be good just because. He knows you're not that scary.
510.0,Provider,"Yes, so you do your best to kind of make it difficult to get hands on anything that really could be used sounds like you all have done that, and obviously Ashley don't. don't I know people get scared of calling for a welfare check or calling 911 but, honestly, if you feel you can't manage it, that is what you all need to do, because that brings somebody to him directly, so he can be evaluated on site briefly and then. yeah transport it to a hospital, because you."
5718.0,Patient,just want to be wondering if he and especially if you'd like refuses to go to the clinic is like no way like you know.
510.0,Provider,"And he's still making those comments you, you really don't want to feel like you have to manage a suicidal family member, it becomes sort of. Where you need additional support and it sounds like you get that I know this is tough, this is really tough."
5718.0,Patient,"It is actually and you know that right now i'm like hey don't know how he's feeling that I know for a fact he's not feeling like 100% because i'm pushing and pushing Nice and i'm like crazy. Like pushing it and making sure he takes like a bunch of houses not like over the amount, but I make sure you takes enough like push it out with me not me because. he's only wanted out of the system, and he asked me what we can do and i'm like there's not a lot we can do to just straight flush it out of your system, because if that was the case, how many people would drug test clean. Exactly exactly."
510.0,Provider,yeah.
5718.0,Patient,yeah it's not possible for them like there is nice then and that helps a little bit process to kind of flush your system so it's making super eight and super he and he's like I think i'm having an allergic reaction to them like.
510.0,Provider,"The night yeah That was the niacin I know I know you sounds like you definitely have a lot of influence on him because he is talking to you about this. yeah that's a good I know it's just one more stress to your having to grapple with but I, I think you have a good plan I just this is definitely a dicey tentative situation, though. yeah i'm for years."
5718.0,Patient,Like family he doesn't want me to go to the clinic or if it gets worse and anytime I need to do i'll what i'll do is i'll take my baby holly for a little bit and i'll just call on how how somebody picking up to do a 72 hour flight home.
510.0,Provider,"cuz yeah 5150 yeah exactly a. gives everyone a breather gives him, you know he is safe he's being evaluated by a doctor typically I used to do these not in California, but in Colorado and you basically are evaluating. The mental health, but it also allows for even longer, and other referrals for a detox if it potentially because if he's actively using it's going to be really hard to evaluate him cleanly right like. I know, in the er we couldn't evaluate till someone was sober because of course they're coming in saying X, Y Z. They sober up from alcohol it's a different story So yes please, and I know it's hard to call you're not getting him in trouble he's not arrested, this is a mental health substance abuse issue he's it's he's not a bad person he needs additional support if it worsens. And it's sort of creeping up to that line it sounds like but it sounds like you're clear on the steps you need to do it sounds like you actually have done so already initial safety planning, which is good, you. Do you think your mom is a good influence or you can, or is it just us sort of talking to him about these steps like. What she go with you and him to this clinic."
5718.0,Patient,"I would hope, so I don't I mean I know she I can really see her saying now. I know that she's not used to having to do that kind of thing or like she doesn't want a business out there, or whatever, but i'm the letter I won't i'll make sure. i'll get it. i'll make sure she she does i'll do is i'll take both of them with me."
510.0,Provider,"I just yeah cuz sometimes it can just take the physical presence of a wife or spouse whomever just to be there and say I love you enough, I want you to get the hell I don't know if that would be the impact."
5718.0,Patient,"You know she's. Ever since and. Which is really good i'm glad she's a good wife. Secretary. Okay, one SEC. And it's me and then my it's me and then my mom like she doesn't use have never used so what she says it depends on how he says, or what no it depends on what she says what you know you kind of insight she has on certain stuff, but when it comes down to what this situation rock he boy. Because meals I just did it start over it. kind of wanted me to like help him to."
510.0,Provider,"That makes sense that totally makes sense. Your your mom might be a really good candidate, have you ever heard of Al anon. She might just get get support has she ever attended Alan on."
5718.0,Patient,or no.
510.0,Provider,"No okay. All right, it just that would be a prime place she could really get support I know not everybody is into support groups, they do virtual ones, obviously with a pandemic. But. it's got to be tough, for her just having different family members struggle with addiction."
5718.0,Patient,"yeah actually she's been going through this for a long time, especially with. Especially with her all our kids like it's just. it's crazy it's for her, but she doesn't understand it there's no real there's no real like excuse to say hey. Like we're going to use or whatever there's nowhere for me to tell her that because that's not true or. Not but there's no way for me to like get over it it's just something you don't understand this more like. I tried to like make it as. broad as possible with explaining like we have a different perception once we start using."
510.0,Provider,Right right and that's where Alan on talks about those things like she could get them. The perspective of understanding what it's like to be. On her yeah. I don't know she's a reader there's great books that you know just so she could be validated because i'm sure she's struggling with the. Why like what can I do and.
5718.0,Patient,yeah that's true she is she's she's always thinking and somebody.
510.0,Provider,I know. An understanding sort of the boundaries and how that works. Do you want to give him something to drink I know. He really. He really wants something.
5718.0,Patient,yeah. i'll be right back.
510.0,Provider,No worries go for it.
5718.0,Patient,Thank you. So. Much. They make. me feel like. I don't need. So at least I have been. In and then he's got that to like he's or grandchildren and they really close so i'm.
510.0,Provider,Like.
5718.0,Patient,"i'm not trying to pull him away right now so i'm like i'm trying not to let them be exposed to as well, but like you know, trying to get lucky what he could be missing out on like everyday life for us isn't always great but it's like it's better when you're sober for sure."
510.0,Provider,But.
5718.0,Patient,"For me anyway it's too hard to be around my family when I mean like that you can really guilty. So, and he feels guilty to I could tell I just don't know if that's. Something that Jesus I just hope he doesn't get us all so. yeah I want him to know. grandbabies love and just as much as they ever have any you know. Of course I know."
510.0,Provider,it's like yeah.
5718.0,Patient,"it's just hard because he's got he's got that mentality right now it's like a drug, you know so. that's painful that I can at least I can relate to that part, so I can tell him that hey we're just going through a mind trip right now calm down not let it control you. need to just get through this stuff so i'm i'm like kind of speaking to him, where he needs to be spoken and stuff so."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Well, I wish you and your family there's a lot of it sounds like pivotal moments coming up and, hopefully, he will accept the help and get some help because that's a really dicey situation. um, I guess, in the last few minutes i'll say, I just wanted to give you. Any you know time and states if there's anything you wanted to talk about it's our last session you got to meet the new therapists who will be taking over yesterday Karen Clark. Will. be assigned to you after the end of the week, all my cases will be officially transferred. But just curious if you wanted to you know talk through if there's something that's been helpful or something that you want me to forward on to her, and as for their goals you want to continue to work on wanted to give you that space it's been a pleasure to work with you."
5718.0,Patient,"You know, you know there's not really I got pretty much got it out so, then you know it's been really great to have you there Chris as long as we have. And I hope things go for you go well for you were you know life takes us, though."
510.0,Provider,"Oh thanks Ashley well, I wish you the best and you continue to take care of your own sobriety it sounds like you have definitely regrouped and you just take each day as it comes you don't have to get ahead of yourself. And it sounds like you have additional support from your boyfriend which i'm really pleased a year because that was one of the biggest stressors that was. really happening, you were just completely depleted like you were just taking care of it all and it's just that's not sustainable, as you quickly learned."
5718.0,Patient,To. finish with that party.
510.0,Provider,"yeah good all right, well, I wish you the best Thank you so much, glad we're able to do a final session today you take care be well be safe. You too, thank you, you too bye. session with Ashley tutors over zoom room close."
