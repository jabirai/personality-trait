15557.0,Patient,Okay sounds good. alright. Okay.
540.0,Provider,alright.
15557.0,Patient,"So Paul my first like I picked three blog posts and. Three and a half poems and one possible song sorry okay so, then this one, I wrote march 7 2011. I labeled it shut up so it's like any word that I think any thought that flows inside me just hurt i'm being left empty again, I just want to shut up forever. And then modify was written in June 20 which was just went like i'm. modifying change everything about you from the color of your eyes to the substance of yourself, no one sees no one sees past this creature you've created given life to. There behind the wall you've hitting your operation tools to use one too many times sterilized with the chemicals that got that got you all wrong in the first place. The trade by the absence of your breath when you left when you left left to tie all those all the loose ends all the seams and it seems it's not going well change everything about you, but you can never change your mind. And then July 11 was the other day I can feel this rise up from somewhere below my trust this need this thirst to stand neck deep and reckless waters i'm going to drink a lot tonight. I know this is something I can't chase away it's not even something I can see, but it's there it's digging a hole bigger to accommodate its growth and in circles turns lives and. turns lives lives inside me or licensing me i'm going to drink a lot tonight it tastes like acid and Aaron ache something I can never say all that faults meant to fix i'm going to drink a lot tonight. and Even like got them all separated like super prep. Oh, actually, it was a 111 little short story and and one that was like a little tiny bit of a song like I don't even remember what the team was supposed to be, but it was it just went like. This first thousand 11 and mobile she stands staring straight ahead, you can tell from her is she somewhere else completely she spells in such a way so small, yet or where that her dresses torn and thorns rent down her legs. This mirror this mirror the door that stands before her closed off and shattered her home completely. But still, she stares and smiles her mind made it through social blades and she won't scream and Saturday scars her face this mirror the mirror the door that stands before her closed off and shattered her home completely and insanity scars her face. And this one is just like a little short story called it spite. He presses down the accelerator persistently as to dry faster than the natural law red lights from the tunnel reflect off asleep black Harley and reveal on his face and malicious grin that has taken residents on his lips. A lack of satisfaction escapes him in spite of the fact that he just set fire to his principles car he has spite after all. and did not like being told how he should behave. As he sped through the tunnel, the memory of fire ignited has black eyes and adrenaline shot through his body up to his neck and face it wasn't until he was out under nights by again that his smile faltered. He hated this part hated remembering he was at the end, and he slowed at the end at the end of them both you see spite had once fell in love. he'd been willing to bury his hatred and give her all of himself, but apathy could not love him back she couldn't really feel much of anything at all. He had loved or cared for her, but she was callous this isn't exactly the part that caused him the most agony, it was what he did after. he's used to confidence and disgust walking around as if he were a ghost with haste and determination, nobody ever took notice of him when he walked by unless you want it to be. His eyes fears and alert he could nearly like fires with them his voice is not loud, but his words are jacket low, but not soft. Was beloved's refusal to love them he'd let himself become blind in his rage and well she wasn't around anymore. She was nothing more than ashes up on the road he'd left at the end of the tunnel in his mind he heard her voice soft and unfeeling any felt the tiniest bit of sadness in his heart but mostly he just wanted to write faster than light itself. Like being back like sometimes like with my like stuff that I write a stories. Like it actually kind of like reflected maybe some something of how I was feeling because it's like sometimes I would just like not feel anything and i'd be fine and then sometimes it would be just sad. or just angry and like I think that's the one that I hated the most because it started to happen more often, I was just so like livid and. I didn't like it. And I think I can in the blog posts, I did also post about it. See. So there's three. July. Is remember. July OK i'll start with this one like I titled it like ERM babble. i'll be 18 in nine months i'm pregnant with freedom insanity during my first trimester I shall get my license and do my homework and get all right grades it just doesn't work. eek learning how to drive well sort of driver's ED i'm trying to finish it before I leave to Mexico, so my plan is. Get permit by the end of the week or before I leave get onto tissue to drive in Mexico, she has a stick shift then practice with an automatic. I don't know how to drive it all yet come back practice more with dad I guess no way around it, I don't like being in a car alone with him i've managed to avoid it for a year. Go take tests have licensed by September, October November we'll see how this goes I dyed my hair green the kind of goes under black light mother was so pissed but she's so double standard. That was an actual word, but my sister has had pink and purple hair she's fucking 12 and I only died, the highlights streaks I had in my hair and you can only see two. So screw that she's mad at me for literally everything lately but it's all right just nine months. i've been drawing a lot past week in my little notebook from Persia Lol or somewhere foreign and awesome i'll be in events aren't next year, so we'll see how that goes. How many times have I said that in this post law and Oh, the other day I went kind of crypto again, I had a really bad start of the day, with my mother, so I walked into a store and took took a walk around the store must get. To mascara six now flush things and fancy pens small things but they made me feel better. I don't think it's a good thing, but i'm really good at it, I don't plan on getting caught, but I know if I do it's going to be so bad. The thing is i've been doing it for four years now almost and i've never once been caught so shrugs my mom hasn't noticed how much my wardrobe has expanded. i've been feeling a lot less chipper lately, though I was really all right for a while, but, like everything it fades I didn't even cause it this time it just happened. i'm going to try to write I don't and I don't drink anymore, and last time I tried I couldn't keep it down, which is so weird because I used to be able to go down straight hard liquor no problem. The last time I really got fucked up, it was mad so maybe that's why haha but i'm kind of glad drinking is really bad for your health worse than we'd if you can imagine. And I really can't afford any more scars I can't show my stomach at all, as it is and i'm just waiting for those to fade I decided not to be a complete ofili again. No are hurting myself I just hope I don't go ape shit and hurt others let's see what else can I do right draw um I don't know i'll be good, though. I have, I have to be good if i'm going to be living out of home next year at the at the time, I thought that that meant moving out of home I didn't realize kind of like working out of home is working at home, but um. Oh job yes i'll get one of those i'd love to work at a movie theater eventually it's costume mentioned dimple records or thrift store I used to have a graphic design gave with my own goal, but then he died. i've been missing him so much lately I wish he could be the one to teach me to drive he's like the only adult I have a trusted when he died, I went straight downhill, I noticed. shit and if he could see me he'd be so disappointed patient and have died, he was only 32 of my favorite person in the world. So that's something that's going to help me, I think, pretending he was here with me helping me and listening to music with me everybody else in my family hates my music. and telling me not to worry that things work out i'm such a scatter brain I don't think this post will flow it all, but I think I got out all I needed to get out enough moping for one post. And then, a few days later, blue i'm going to some religious with do but i'm but i'm gonna head is or like when people go to go to a weekend. Things to get in touch with the spirit, for women, sometimes religiously mom wants to go, so we have to go to i'm not into religion, really, at least not organized religion religion. is one of the things that cost humanity so many problems religion is separated mankind and every religion says i'm right everybody joined here. I respect people who are dedicated to their religion but I can't do that as cliche to say i'm more spiritual than religious. Because a few years back, everybody started to say that I just feel that if I were to try to be more Catholic I do it more out of fear, because everything. And my mom seems to be telling me i'm going to go to hell, but I really don't believe that will so yeah reading a list of sins, a few years back, I realized i'd done almost everything on the fucking list. Now i'd be worse and for some things, I am sorry but I can't promise him I won't ever do it again i've got this recklessness in me that just doesn't. That just doesn't think I do things not worrying about the outcome, because I think I can deal with it. When it goes bad, though, is when I end up hurting others i'm used to betraying myself, the more often than not people get involved, where was I going with this oh yeah well shit forgot again. Okay, so many things about religion make me mad when I think about it, religion, should have been something to feed the soul, but what have we done we've corrupted it like we always do it becomes a tool to get what we want. To send and keep sending all the while telling us that he still loves us and that. we're going to heaven, because we could never go to jail, I mean hell, so, while it is still beautiful for some people, it can be for me. i've seen people within with this intense look of peace, on that basis happiness and it's wonderful really but it's rare to find. Last year I went to some Bible reading and study thing it wasn't Catholic or Christian or any branch right but uh read passages and explain what it meant and such a real way. It was fucking beautiful and I went for a while and actually believed it could heal everything in me I cried almost every time I went. But then move back in and the COPs didn't even do shit and my mom was all let's just be a family now and we started doing going as a fucking family and he tried grabbing my shoulders being all fucking fatherly. And I would scream so loud in my head at the time I hated him from then on, it was it wasn't same for me. They talked about forgiveness about embracing the one who has done you harm, but I couldn't you can't fucking forget shit like that. Every day in my head I fucking felt him saw him remember remembered it went insane and nothing book and he changed everything he did it years of what he did forgotten, because I went out and had sex trying to forget him, you know. and ended up being the bad guy sister said what the Fuck is wrong with you it's your fault, that is in here mom said you're sicker than your father and get over it. dad said we're going to be a family now and sometimes i'm still i'm still screaming nine months old and nine months. And sorry for just going on and on Lol I get a little intense when I start to talk about things my uncle would have been there for me, I think he believed in God a lot. And he believed in heaven so i'm sure that's exactly where he is music really helps me SMILEY face. Loud hardcore music calms me down and my parents hated they say it's the devil. But there are things in music that attracted me to it lyrics I don't listen to, like the kill kill kill Fuck Fuck Fuck heavy music, but I listened to the real shit. And once in a while, something I can't understand, like, for example, we bought our the bread with butter, which is a German scream of band my deal. My deal used to always introduced me to new music he gave me half his library, which he spent most of his like collecting. I feel connected to him, through it, every time I hear something he showed me he gave me like this music video, which is intense and creepy her voice is very high pitched though for the verses but the rest is really awesome. And it was. I forget the name of the band because, like the video got taken off of YouTube. And then the last one actually like I. Actually hadn't gone on this one yet there's only five posting it, it was like an entire blog that that I dedicated to my uncle it was just titled like direct the onyx. And I found five posts in it. But. This one I think this one is the one that made me cry earlier so let's say dear Felix on November 15 2011 I plan on moving out and. My best friend Anna I don't know if you ever got to meet her you probably didn't. it's a shame really she's really sweet and tiny and funny and Russian you would have loved her her whole family is Russian and her family has been. In the Russian revolution World War one and World War Two I remember a lot of your friends were Russian I wonder what this would like what that is why, Russians and Mexicans get along so well, sometimes it's pretty awesome. Also today ever tell you about my obsession with languages or passionless most likely. I love languages, and I want to learn at least five before I die, and at the top of that list is Russian after that there's Portuguese and Italian. And i'm already learning French I know Spanish in English, and that gives me at least five most likely, I know, most likely, I will know five by the time i'm 25 I want to go to Europe and poke around and all the beautiful rural rural. Rural RU RU RU ra l areas have such a hard time pronouncing that all the time i'm so i'm such a lover of nature. anyways about the moving up, but I will be living in this little apartment with Anna in her backyard rent will be 100 a month and there's an entire mini kitchen in there. And a fancy bathroom it's in her backyard, so we won't be we won't be like every other 18 year old out on the loose. We will have curfew and still be very near if we need any help, but it will give us perfect practice for living on our own. While we're in school, and when we move out to San Francisco like oh my God i'm so excited about everything. We want to go to one of the four articles, we like in San Francisco but are all expensive, we need to save up for sure, and we need to get used to living on our own, because in San Francisco. There will be nobody there for us, except each other, so our backyard is perfect in every way my parents don't know yet. I can see you making that face at me I know my mom is going to be really mad and for sure she won't like it, but it's something I need to do. and makes sense and nobody can deny that, but that doesn't mean they'll go for it. You know my mom and dad I mean i've never been to sleep over never gone to the mall with friends. never gone to a movie date or any date, and they are really, really, really pissed when they found out a pod boyfriends and i'm almost 18 it's just difficult living here. To them i'm such a disappointment i'm a responsible and stupid on a drama Queen and i'm always the first to get yelled at for anything but and I get it they're upset with things and i'm the easiest target because I don't fight back. But I wish the relationships, I have with my family could be better I wish I had someone else like I had you. you'd be the first person I would invite over to see what my life is like in San Francisco you'd be the first person i'd seek approval from have boyfriends and stuff you'd be the first president to talk about problems with in school, and what I want to do with my life. Because I know you wouldn't see me as a disappointment, I know you helped my best interest and you were so nice to me. I could tell you cared and you never tried to show authority over me I trust with you all on my own. And I know that since you've been gone i've changed and they've done terrible things but believe me, I only meant to harm myself. There was some there was something wrong with me I grew up with a different world in my head, but I would change everything to make you proud of me, because you never demanded of me. You just showed me love and that was all this is kind of hard to write don't deserve this is kind of hard to write deal my eyes are tearing up a little bit, because how I wish you could read this. And that you can know me and that there were more people in this world, like you, and how I wish your sons have gone to see what a wonderful father, you are and how much you love them and their mother. And how I wish you weren't dead right now I wish I never had to remember that your I love you so much, the only breaks my heart, every time I realized that you're gone. You deserve better than to get sick like that and i'm sorry I never got to see you in the hospital life they never took me along. When they told me, you were dead I seriously thought it was a joke, I was so mad at my desk for even saying it, and when I realized, it was truth, I couldn't stop crying and when I held your cold hand I swear it could feel a real warm. And I swear I could I could feel you squeezing back, and I wanted to see you smile, and I wanted to see that dark shade of death leave your face. But it never did I feel your absence, every day, and even more so when your memory is ignited by the many things around me like the music library you contributed to so generously and the way you spoke to me about art and graphic design. You knew I was serious about my art way before anybody else did you believed in me know you believe to be you believed in me and i'm so thankful for that, for the happiness you ever brought me feel I will always always miss you I love you always are there, I believe."
540.0,Provider,You rewrote to all of them.
15557.0,Patient,"All right, what."
540.0,Provider,Did you rewrite to all of them.
15557.0,Patient,"um yeah basically just like i'm like I don't write back to each individual one, but just kind of like a cluster."
540.0,Provider,"How is it reading, especially this, how is it reading that."
15557.0,Patient,"Some of it is sad. Some of it is like super drama like with high school boyfriends. There was one other, one that I had picked But then when I read the the ones to my uncle I thought that that one was a pretty important one, so I was like you know what yeah like. High School boy drama like man let's do let's do this and. It hurt to cry but it but but with some of the stuff that i'm very positive about and like. I think I think I sit on the thing. Okay, good morning for y'all good night from therapy homework number two. Okay, I read many blog posts from 2011 and even looked into the blog site completely about writing to my deceased uncle and I cried a lot Lol. OK it's not funny it was pointed out recently about this generation, how we put Lol after everything and asking us to stop only to be responded with no Lol. 2011 was crazy geez That was a whole decade ago man, I feel old, but there was still a lot of drama at home about the legal case failures and treatment at home. Since then, because of that still it's like sorry for asking for help, it was awful and then summer rolled around and I went to Mexico to visit family and had a fun time seeing everyone there and spending time away from my dad. Then, when I returned and started senior year in high school, I was seemingly much more positive striven. Does that work in a sentence and had many more goals and good intense about life and all. But I can see how much more shame, I felt for so much that I wasn't responsible for and therefore anything I actually was responsible for felt much worse than it actually could have. It sad but it's not the worst I just always i've just always been so hopeful, I have to be even though i'm too trusting on others and times and in life that doesn't mean i'm going to stop. Maybe with people, but not with life Lol calling good energy makes it come around eventually plus if I really was in any ways as negative as I could have been I don't think i'd even be around to write this right now. Yes, sometimes I still believe I am in some sort of purgatory being tested as to where I really belong. But if you think about it, life itself is that way, I believe in Karma and every time we live, we have a chance to learn more and more until we finally find our bliss or so closure or what the Fuck ever. I believe in past lives and the same way, how we can learn something new now every minute of every day we can learn something new, we can also in every life everybody. I have to believe there's some good, I have to know there's some good, I have to make it be good if I could talk to myself back then it'd be like this. Year 2011 me hey you wasabi I love your positive attitude I love your dreams and hopes and any attempts at all for so i'm so sorry that from how serious you were about it, it wasn't always met by other people and their words on it. i'm sorry you believed it so well, what I would change is the drive is the drive to find family or connection to anybody else or your best friend's the way you thought you needed it. I wish you'd seen just how strong you were in driven resilient as Fuck if you would have strived to do it all alone and independently you absolutely put a. I wish had been slightly more selfish, even though your best friend said they wanted the same things you should not have base your entire life plan to work, but only with them, you could have had two plans you know. You know that now, at least if one way it doesn't work there can always be another way don't feel sorry for leaving people behind. you're not leaving them behind by choosing to go forward when they are not ready, it is them, of course, sadly, by own choice that can hold you back. ohana means family family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten it's such a beautiful message from yesterday alone stitch one of our absolute favorite Disney movies, of all time but honey, you are your only family sometimes and that's okay. You didn't get the best experience growing up the best support the best treatment from family even but that can come from others beyond blood friendship doesn't magically become what you needed you weren't even trying to consciously but sadly believed you'd find it from someone else. It is possible don't get me wrong just don't put too much hope in anybody or everybody. The biggest stepping stone in your life is nobody but yourself love yourself don't listen to the negative external internal and mystery source voices all the time. Unless it's funny those brain radio stations can be quite funny sometimes you're a beautiful weirdo adorable this book, please let's hope we don't lose it again love me. Just pretty positive."
540.0,Provider,"No, I love it. And how does that How does that feel coming from yourself and knowing where you were at this year in these."
15557.0,Patient,"hmm it felt good I was happy that I found a way. To cope, it is just kind of sad that I gave it up because it's like I like it, I saw a lot about how I really wanted to drink with you any drug and like basically I was afraid that if I was around something. New that I was definitely going to do it, so I am very happy that i've never come across heroin. except maybe there was a time that that I feel like it was put in me because I felt like I was. Like I was really heavy. And like kind of like melting as in goop as if I was some sort of tar that was like it felt I did not like it. It was supposed to be an upper but it had to happen, I think, in 2017 when I went to the hospital. But but yeah it was like my ex and stuff you would just like you would say something, but then turned out to be something else too so or he would be mixed shit so I don't know. But. But just seeing all the positivity that I had and like just how much is coming back to me like I see now that it's like that the reason I lost it was because I just because the only way that I ran was with alcohol or drugs and that that was an Okay, and like distracting from the past. recurs the past so. So just like seeing all the positivity that I had or just like the dreams like I just like a kind of. And like i've been pretty positively least sometimes i'm, just like in such a good mood randomly and I all I want to do is like smile or say jokes and sometimes in my head i'm just like like forget when. I went to like a Christmas and stuff with with my sister's girlfriend's family. And I think I said, a total of. Four jokes and nobody laughed at the first three and in my head, I was thinking myself, I was saying it they probably didn't hear you, but then the fourth one everybody laughed, and so I was like okay awesome there you go so that was cool. And yeah it was nice and we didn't see my dad we don't even call him we're gonna have like the late Christmas and my mom gets back from my school on January 10 so but, until then, to get them gifts so that's good. And should be good. Would you do for Christmas."
540.0,Provider,i'm just fun time with the kids just at home did a nice small well dinner.
15557.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,We like it small.
15557.0,Patient,"I forgot for actual Christmas oh my God yeah funny story so for actual Christmas, I went to go see spider man, and I was. And then I also had sushi but I was in the front row, and so I was sitting here and then right here, there was like this lady who had a kid who was like three or four years old. And like us really little really small it was really cute and I was just so excited and then it was like the like. This is like one thing like that maybe, just like mine dirtiness but it's just like if it's a marvel movie you know that there's two little like after things that play there's one link right after the short. The short credits and one after the long credits, so I was waiting there and i'm like and then I was like sitting there wondering. Like i'm like the lady got up she went to go get the the kid a drink or something, and so the kid was sitting next to me. And then I was just watching and waiting for the for the show or for the little clip. And and i'm like in my head i'm thinking as I come, I really wonder what it's like to be able to touch the floor when you're sitting down because I. Rarely can because, like my legs are short and then like, then I don't realize that i'm like swinging my legs and seeing my legs. Until I look to the right and the little boy was state swinging them the exact same way exact same feet and he wasn't even trying to copy me so it was just really hilarious in my head like I was slightly embarrassed but I was like Okay, nobody sees this. That me on almost 30 year old behaves the same as a three year old in a movie theater. But this is fun."
540.0,Provider,movie.
15557.0,Patient,Have you seen it.
540.0,Provider,"Yes, absolutely."
15557.0,Patient,"It finally makes so much sense, and it was so funny like I don't think it's like i've seen one quite that funny it. or not, but I can remember."
540.0,Provider,"Yes, definitely good. Have you been doing. As ex boyfriend I know he has a new girlfriend right now has he been reaching out at all."
15557.0,Patient,"Yes, sort of um he actually met me at the movie theaters we did just go to the movie theater we went to see the movie because I had two tickets. So I was like letterhead credit for two tickets and like I feel kind of bad that it's just like he's got like no family here and nobody's alive his son is in a different state. And like he did have some presents for me and I had a little bit for him so then we just we met at the movie theaters and then I came home and he went home and Sally with that chica like I think he didn't buy with her too much, which is good because it's like she's 19 and he's 37. So then, it was just like at least he saw he didn't like just pursue it and stuff just physically, which, like which is kind of good, but then I got at least I know that he's open and something's gonna find something and. Besides that, though he hasn't been bothering me he doesn't like reach out to me all day every day he's not being a bump man she's not like. asking me to explain everything about my life anymore, so it feels it feels really good but, just like sometimes it's like sometimes like he was like my only friend for so long that sometimes it's like we do miss each other."
540.0,Provider,And did he reach out during the holiday.
15557.0,Patient,"Oh well, that was when we went on Christmas."
540.0,Provider,So if you guys want.
15557.0,Patient,Okay that's what i'm sorry.
540.0,Provider,You must have skipped out on when you say whoo. yeah um. So do you guys still hold hands kiss anything like that.
15557.0,Patient,"um he contract kiss kiss me, but then I turn a turn around like that, and no no hand holding. like that is like he seen me just as me, but sadly i'm starting to think that me just getting my my regular energy and, like my regular actual. Private personality back you know, like instead of just feeling like like I don't know like a pet. he's starting to read to like see more of what he's lost and he's saying want more something in okay like that every tracked way more. Because it's like if he gets like super attached again, then, that won't be good."
540.0,Provider,Are you nervous but you're going to get attached to him.
15557.0,Patient,"And i'm very proud it's like you see how many days as it been it's been since the 10th since i've drink anything. And like see. On the 18th day. i'm very happy and very proud. Does would come bleach account because it's you know it's got like. No okay. All right. not worried about that, but like even even at the holiday thing like they offered cider and I was like what kind of cider like. Because cider sounded good, but not the alcoholic time so i'm just like. Like I really I really think i'm going to be good."
540.0,Provider,"And the further that you got away from it, the easier it will be for right now, you just have to be mindful of it, mindful of the triggers. stuff that triggers listen to them. And and try to say Okay, you know I am craving right now, but then work through it."
15557.0,Patient,"mm hmm. It also helps to that like since i'm working 40 hours a week i'm like yeah it's like most of the time that I spend is working or sleeping or working or sleeping so it's kind of I don't really have to. To crave it for too long, or deal with craving it too long, because then i'm just like I get distracted Oh, and I finally finished the shining but Dr sleep doesn't get delivered until tomorrow so gotta wait. For. him so good."
540.0,Provider,that's audible you said.
15557.0,Patient,"And then, as, and I also ordered the physical books, but then I also have this i'm like a little like a short story one of swimming King like i'm like did you ever watch the room 1408 or the movie 1408."
540.0,Provider,I i'm not positive off to. write it down for.
15557.0,Patient,john Cusack is in it and Samuel l Jackson. It was pretty creepy it was um it was pretty creepy but I haven't read the story.
540.0,Provider,"that's the story, you have."
15557.0,Patient,"or one of them in here yeah because it's like um I think I figured it out, because it's only from page 458 to. Well, I don't know but but it's short stories so like in here I think there's 14 total. yeah it's just like a."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
15557.0,Patient,yeah I love a bunch of short stories.
540.0,Provider,Oh.
15557.0,Patient,"i'm there, there is one thing that I keep forgetting and stuff to bring up like I write it down over and over. But like i'm like I don't know if I mentioned it and stuff that i've been kind of thinking about maybe a deep tissue massage because i've never had a massage. And, or will I mean you know, besides, you know, like partners or whatever, but like i've never had like an actual and then like i've always got like the biggest tension around here then sometimes like just daily sometimes it does start to hurt like never too bad do anything but um. But then also I just like I get tired of getting. Like the little draft things of like memories and stuff and especially because there's so much more that like. That I can't remember, but I think i'm at the rate that is like if i've survived everything but i'm going to survive. But I kind of just want to get it out of the way and leave it behind i'm thinking, maybe of like trying to schedule, when I got it or know like because I think you can schedule 16 minutes. 30 minutes 60 minutes or 90 minutes so i'm thinking of starting it like small like even though it's kind of expensive, but then just maybe to see and test it out, to see if that would help me just like leave more of the past in the past, not by forgetting it but by dealing with it and. Moving on kind of thing."
540.0,Provider,"Well, and so I mean your body holds on to trauma. So we've yeah and there are many people that they'll do acupuncture they'll do deep body massages there's a few different and then there's yoga there's different like spirituality that. into it too um I think that it could be beneficial and it's also a massage so sometimes it's an aspect of the mental health but letting your body have that healing. yeah yeah which will help all around."
15557.0,Patient,Three yeah i'll try it then i'll see about when. And what else like i'm starting to do a little bit more of like like I mentioned that that i'm like into like magic stuff or no.
540.0,Provider,No.
15557.0,Patient,"You have no Okay, well, I think i've mentioned, maybe the Taro. yeah yeah so there's the Taro. But but i've actually been quite a few spell books i've been like learning about them, because a lot of the stuff I believe is very connected. And like a lot of the stuff that is considered like you know, like is there anybody that most people when they hear, which is they think of the pointy nose and like eating children or they think about you know, like Salem and. And all that stuff but then like really there was so much done too many women that were like really innocent that they just believed in certain things which is like a lot done in an accepted religions. But there's always something to try like, and you know how they're like how it's like such a big bad with like. For example, with like stones or with with like meditation and with essential oils all that stuff how it's got it can connect to different parts of the body and the mind. Basically, like. or witchcraft or magic like it works with all of that too, so, even if it's not something. Absolutely real, I believe that it that it can help because you know, like if you do a spell from for money or positivity it is still putting out that positive energy out. To call it forward so i'm like I don't really like tell a lot of people and stuff because it's like some people do find a lot of people that I know like would find it awesome. But then also feels like it should be like a little bit more like a private thing, but I do actually have like a whole drawer thing with like everything they need a backstage incense. stones the. oils i've got little tiny bottles so that can even make it like candles and. Now i've been working on a lot of stuff like that, like sometimes like there's even one spell and stuff to like send away anger that it's like that, when i'm like. Like suddenly feeling too angry i'll do that and then there's like there's been some about like leaving past behind where Britain like wherever it in my data letter and then like after like it says like once we feel ready, we can bury it facing the. North yes not wait I don't know, one of the directions, but um but i've been doing it more so in the last. year and a half. Because it's like i've always felt kind of like drawn to it and, like i'm. Just to find it but it's like I think now it's like it's being like accepted slightly more as like a form of science, because then everything is connected we just can't explain it all so it's like worth a shot."
540.0,Provider,"and On like a weekly basis, do you like, or even daily like, how do you do practice it daily, or at least a little bit."
15557.0,Patient,"I kind of used to, but then, like the Carson so started telling me that there's a certain part I forget which one that, if it comes up it's basically telling you is like chill like you're trying to too much it's like. Because you know when you ask the same question over and over like the answer is not going to change you're just trying to get something different. And so i'm now lately i've been doing, maybe about a reading every few weeks and spell wise, I actually haven't done one in a while. But i've been feeling kind of ready for it and stuff like More recently, because, like I kept getting. Getting like interrupted console I would do one and, as I say, like there's one that was a candle that I have to burn like 30 minutes every night. And then I would see James and I would forget it here, and so, then it wouldn't even go through, or sometimes I would go with the one that I had to bury had to be buried after three days, but then I would leave. And then it would just like not be touched so, then I just kind of gave up on it for a while, but I think i'm feeling centered and up again and, like more. Independent stuff again that I can start trying it again."
540.0,Provider,"And how much, would you like, would you like to do a daily my goal wise What would you like."
15557.0,Patient,"i'm at least once a week, but hopefully not daily not like not like obsessive with it cuz it's like I think for a little while I was like that that I was just like. Even if any day, but it was because I needed a distraction, and something the alcohol wasn't doing it then So then, but then it doesn't really need to be a hobby for destruction it's like more for like creation and like building, so I need to like focus on it that way."
540.0,Provider,"One time. Alright, so mechanical. On top of the blog post."
15557.0,Patient,"So it took me a minute and stuff to say here, I think I had mentioned it with the Taro and stuff but then like I don't know how like. How some therapists would take it and stuff or if they would consider silly or you know."
540.0,Provider,"I am i'm well i'm sure there's many therapists out there, that are not open as much as I am i'm very open minded."
15557.0,Patient,To.
540.0,Provider,"see everything and anything. I think that there is a lot of power in belief, I think there's a lot of power and your spirituality and the next person spirituality so I i'm game for everything and anything that you believe in have that connection to so yeah and you should embrace it."
15557.0,Patient,"Okay, do you ever tell you about how that one reading about i'm like right before James got arrested like right before the whole thing happened or or did I not. So then, there was like on August 1 I was like I like I drink a ton and then I was like in such a. I felt awful and I felt in so much pain and I was like okay like I need some help like universe like what the Fuck is like what should I do, but I was too drunk to actually I did a whole a Celtic cross or something I don't know how to pronounce it but. But then I was too drunk to read it, so I just flipped them over I did the right way, the right setup and then I took a picture of it. And I didn't read it up until the 10th and he got arrested on the seventh. What or I didn't read it up until later, but I kind of wish I did because it actually literally warned me about stuff with home and relationships and how, if something didn't get tamed it was going to go really bad. And the cards even warned me and stuff about about like like the process of prostitution thing, and I was like why the Fuck are the tarot cards telling me something about prostitution. And then that's when that when that when that lady lake or that girl. That when she tried doing the whole thing, so it was just like crazy precise how much a warm and there would have been no way for me to know before so it's just like sometimes my energy really can see a lot more I don't know it's like, not that I consider myself psychic and so."
540.0,Provider,Like if you allow for your energy to see more.
15557.0,Patient,"mm hmm because i've always had a lot of deja vu and like lucid dreaming like lately no my memory doesn't really work very well, so I can't really lucid dream, and I am like working really hard on Remembering my dreams. because sometimes there's so pinpoint and to like feel like I do like I used to feel like a deja vu about like three times a week and so it's just like you know, like. You know I like time is like we created time so time doesn't really exist, but it does, but it doesn't like I don't know that there's just like a very big bass connection with everything like. Even quantum physics, you know even like music, you know, like we all, we all communicate, I believe that we all communicate in different ways, some people are very good at music, some people are good. At actual science some good people are good at math some people are good at say terrell but everything is so connected in like in that same way that the Cone shape. That we can really understand, and I can I wish I could, but you know, maybe a different life."
540.0,Provider,yeah our brains I don't know we could wrap our head around the things that we do and don't know.
15557.0,Patient,"The fact I think don't we only have like three color cones in our eyes. So we can only see the amount of colors that we can see it's very small and then like butterflies have five dogs sadly only have two. But then even like the praying mantis shrimp I think I forget how many they have, but they have like either 10 or above 10 so they can see like a crazy amount of colors that we don't even know exist at all."
540.0,Provider,yeah yeah there's I mean and then there's other species that can hear sensitivities that we can absolutely like that's I mean what they can see what we can't say. it's amazing what the species has and everything that's connected and.
15557.0,Patient,"Beautiful thing. I got myself a cheap little alarm clock until like my my nice one is getting here today, but I was like this was $3 and I was like maybe just to be safe, because I really didn't want to miss any more appointments. And then I can always have a little backup one."
540.0,Provider,and worked out.
15557.0,Patient,yeah it's worked so far.
540.0,Provider,"And so, what are the, what are the posts that you're going to be looking at this upcoming week are you still gonna be doing 2011."
15557.0,Patient,"i'm hearing, so I think I think I already read through most of them. Okay um I think 2012 will work if there's a certain years, like, I think, for example in 2016 the the poems are a crazy amount. That wasn't like some some years and stuff might take, like a few sessions probably but, but so far with these from the collection of what I can find and stuff like it's it's not too fast. or sort of but not really because it's like I like because I blogged about everything is like so it's like I don't really need to read like the blog posts about like see what kind of breakfast I had all week you know um so yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so yeah so pick out the ones that have, if you think that, like it's shaped you to where you're at where you can connect certain things even like your anxiety depression. Trying to pin. You can look back on and see about like dissecting and those moments that you wish that you had someone there to be able to talk to you like, through those emotions those feelings. and"
15557.0,Patient,"I think there is maybe one more from 2011 there, I read you like it was one of the ones to my uncle and I think I was asking about the family stuff. See. But then, after that. Okay, this was march 5 2012 actually. More minutes we'll get it out, because it's like with this one is like really only has like five posts or six posts total so so as a gift to Alex. On do we have a history of mental illness or instability in our family I know we have a history of tumors and cancers, but i'm wondering if there's any proceed and to what i've developed. Or maybe always had or is it purely environmental or created be self created. Or maybe even false, but then how sick what I have to be to think this way to feel this way and to hear see what I made me think I hear see the sound the sound memories, nobody else has them. And they were the one thing I never thought much have. never thought it might be norm, it might not be normal to hear all these random sometimes funny snippets of conversation when nobody's around. And i'm not thinking like I don't know, maybe it's on me, but it would, but it would be just me otherwise whether i'm crazy or only one to want to be, but i'm sure as hell not okay. I wonder if it would have if I would have talked to you about any of this, I wonder if I would would have talked to you about any of this if, when you were alive it or if I only share this with you because you're dead I. Was."
540.0,Provider,"Back then, you I mean you were you had a lot of insight from for. Someone going through what you're going through you had a lot of insight when it came to the mental health and. understanding that I mean, even when you said, to the point where you said that you needed alcohol was bad for you that it was worse than we that you had to find alternative ways. you've already talked about some coping skills, I mean that you use today so. You say they're just like you said you may not have had that support their family wise and just those connections that you needed."
15557.0,Patient,mm hmm. But but it's good to find it inside myself finally. Like on my own and.
540.0,Provider,"And that's unfortunate thing, too, is a lot, a lot of families aren't like what people would look as families there's a lot of these. situations that happen that you feel alone, and you feel like you're the only person, but there are so many people out there that feel that same way and if they all came together they could be together and they wanted to be. Well, understanding that connecting with yourself and being able to rely on yourself that's that's, the most important relationship in your life is you yourself."
15557.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's my biggest drive right now just basically mostly myself, but then I feel like if I spend too long, and so, in my head I forget how to talk to people and then I get nervous and anxious and i'm like am I doing this right like. How the Fuck do I person like so like I don't want to get too far, but I do definitely."
540.0,Provider,Not. Even balance.
15557.0,Patient,yeah that's that's that's the difficult part. it'll it'll work.
540.0,Provider,"it'll work well and doing the work you're doing it all right, so why don't we wrap it up for today and then i'll See you in a week. And we. Will so right so read your poems and your posts right back to them and then try once this week to try to connect but then I if you want to do like more like still work if you want to do the tarot cards and just let me know what you're doing with it okay."
15557.0,Patient,"yeah i'll probably just well, I mean since it's going to be like a new year like instead of doing like New Year resolutions or whatever that that I never follow I can like. Just do like a spell at least or something like because it always have it depends like i'll have to see what kind of moon it is so am."
540.0,Provider,I perfect and let me know.
15557.0,Patient,"Okay, I shall."
540.0,Provider,"All right, go have a good week and enjoy work get some sleep and. i'll see you in the New Year."

540.0,Provider,"You too, all right bye okay. bye bye. For transcription That was my individual therapy session with Olga Kaldi low and we're continuing to work on all of her treatment plan objectives. Continuing to dissect her blogs, and then her right back to them, and I want to add, in a short term goal of reconnecting to her spiritual beliefs. When it comes to her casting spells. And then connecting with the terror cards so just really connected with that higher power of herself um other than that nothing else for transcriptions."
