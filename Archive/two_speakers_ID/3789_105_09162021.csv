105.0,Provider,hey.
3789.0,Patient,hi how are you.
105.0,Provider,"I am okay. Did you do, you need any minutes to do anything you good."
3789.0,Patient,No i'm good yeah. it's been a. crazy week.
105.0,Provider,i'll tell me.
3789.0,Patient,"Well, first of all my mom had disappeared my brother. reported her missing. screen so it's. um she disappeared my brother said that she was doing some kind of walk about in sachi where we used to live in Louisiana but she just never called him back or anything so he called the police. They ended up like searching for her with like cadaver dogs and search teams and stuff. Like had to be diverted from all the stuff in Louisiana you know because that's where it was. And finally, and I was really worried, I was like convinced after I talked to him, I was like convinced she's dead like something happened to her. uh you know, and I was starting to feel like really sad about this and then she came out of the woods naked and they had told her car because. my brother reported her missing So the first thing I did was go look at her car that she had lived there until it. So she ends up coming out of the woods, this is all stuff I know, through my brother and the police i'm like naked and I guess she said she was doing a nature walk and something and then they took her to a mental hospital or a hospital to have her evaluated and then they let her out. So that's pretty much all I know about that I know my brother when picked her up. But I guess I don't know I mean I feel like she was trying to get attention you know from maybe not for me, but for my brother and. She succeeded."
105.0,Provider,that's pretty dramatic.
3789.0,Patient,"yeah um. I mean, but the thing is something bad could have happened to her."
105.0,Provider,How long was she out naked walking around.
3789.0,Patient,Eight days.
105.0,Provider,No that can't be just for attention that can't be.
3789.0,Patient,"she's also crazy, I think you know, but they didn't obviously they didn't think so, when they evaluated, or they said they were doing a 72 hour hole, and she had somebody evaluate her and then. They let her go again. I mean one thing is she has money, and I feel like if you have money you can kind of do crazy stuff like if you can afford to buy to have a lawyer or something. Like i'm sure she was threatening them, I mean, I know how she is i'm sure she was threatening them saying you can't keep me here i've got a lawyer, you know, whereas if it's somebody who doesn't have money or a lawyer, they tend to not I don't know I mean i'm i'm drawing all kinds of. i'm drawing all kinds of all kinds of assumptions and stuff All I know is that she disappeared for a number of days, the police and cadaver dogs search for her and then she was taken for an evaluation and then she was released. And that's the bad thing that's happened this week, I guess, not bad ultimately she's fine, but it was worrying. Right and then the good things that have happened this week are fully employed again."
105.0,Provider,No yeah.
3789.0,Patient,"I yeah well, I mean it's two part time things, but like I reached out to one of my old employers with this company called thrive and he was like yeah we have all kinds of work come back on Sir ready for us again."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, my God oh."
3789.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm doing that and I can make as much as I can do with that job, and then I also hold on rudy's at the door. And then the other thing is the thing that rudy and I are doing together doing this promotion for. A rock band a progressive rock band that storing in California like he's doing the music writing and i'm doing the. social media posts and like boosting and stuff like that not a ton of money, but like we the the initial outlay for like the first bit of work was like 1000 bucks so not bad. Okay, oh and she's paid half of in advance, half of the rest, so I mean work wise and worrying about money wise things are a lot better um. I guess the things i'm thinking about right now, or the thing with my mom and I have suck at doing yoga this past week or taking any videos but I don't want to give up on it, you know I want to. Okay, I don't want to give up on it, I want to try again. You know um it's just it's just this week's been so crazy. I figured i'd come in talk to you about it and then try again."
105.0,Provider,"yeah oh my gosh Well, first of all congratulations."
3789.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you, I mean i'm still hopeful that maybe i'll find a more full time job at some point but money was really starting to stress me out. And it feels really good. To be useful again and to be getting positive feedback whether it's a post getting post getting approved in the thrive job or the lady from the band Sharon saying Oh, that was a great video or oh you just what I meant, you know so. I guess I hadn't realized how much I missed that you know how much I missed like hearing Oh, you did a good job or the assumption that I did a good job, or you know. All that stuff."
105.0,Provider,"Now I want to check in that's all positive, you said, all these positive things has there been any stress if there has has there been self doubt has there been anything where we need to touch on on a review any skills in that area."
3789.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think the main thing that's happened is as i've gotten busier I get more stressed out it's more important, like the more responsibilities, I have, and the more things I have to go back and forth between Am I kind of reset and. I i'm. Sorry, I lost my train of thought."
105.0,Provider,As you get more more pressure. Right feel more stress.
3789.0,Patient,"Right and I have to refocus back and forth like for and rudy's doing some work like he's he's still looking for a full time job, but he needed to make money now too so he's been doing some pizza delivery and stuff."
105.0,Provider,Which is. Fine.
3789.0,Patient,And he's making money um any actually seems to actually seems to be fairly relaxing to him to not have to use his.
105.0,Provider,Brain over to Dave yeah. yeah Nice.
3789.0,Patient,"um but I guess I just okay so he's gone to work and then i'm i'm responsible for everything here, you know. And i'm working, and so I guess, I mean stuff like I mean i'm doing okay with stuff like the dogs, you know, even though they're really high a couple of her I need. You know when they need a lot of repositioning and going in and out helping to drink water but uh I guess the thing that is stressful for me, is when. it's really hard for me to refocus on something I think that's one of the things I really struggle with is that when my attention when I have to pull my attention away from one thing it's really hard to get back. To the other thing it's getting better but i'm just sort of forcing myself to do it, and it will be nice to have a strategy, you know i'm breathing i'm strategy that's the strategy."
105.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah. Well, so well let's just see if there's actually any problem with what you're doing. Are you saying, if I walk the dog I then wander into the kitchen I start eating Oh, I start reading I start watching TV I call a friend, are you saying you can't come back to that desk."
3789.0,Patient,"No, I mean i'm good at getting physically back to the desk but like I get back here and then. yeah, then I tend to get i'll get distracted because it's like oh i'm doing two separate things like i'm working on one job that's thrive and one job that i'm monitoring social media so maybe I need like stricter."
105.0,Provider,"blocks of time, a lot of people they have block they work enough so. Maybe organizing I won't tempt myself to go look. For every half hour I don't know how frequently that update is meat. is needed. Right, but if your product."
3789.0,Patient,is not needed more than. Every half hour that's for sure.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you are really if let's say you do it in blocks of half hour you're very productive and you resist you say no, no, I already know there's an alarm set i'm going to check it in half hour I don't have."
3789.0,Patient,To do it.
105.0,Provider,That that that will help because you won't be burdened in your memory. yeah.
3789.0,Patient,You have to think oh when's that time up because something will work.
105.0,Provider,"you'll have an alarm for it if if it turns out you're not that productive after a half hour, you might need to change it to 45 minutes or an hour, because you might end up needing more uninterrupted time to be, as you know, productive as you want. Right, how does How does that sounding."
3789.0,Patient,"That makes sense, I mean, I guess, one of the things that stresses me out is, I guess, I worry I feel like i've gotten better in my conception of time, but like I worry that like when I have to keep track of it my head, it does take up space, and I do worry like oh. I guess I don't know I mean i'm still really struggling with. i'm still really struggling with my own criticism of myself and i'm still. You know, interpreting. Like okay rudy say, for instance, like rudy calls me, for he stressed out about something nothing to do with me to do with his work, but slow day or can't find an address or whatever, and then. it's so hard for me to not take it on."
105.0,Provider,uh huh okay let's have. more about that.
3789.0,Patient,"I just. it's so frustrating to me that i'm such a people pleaser and that I am. So sensitive, I mean this is what we just talked about right."
105.0,Provider,It is yeah.
3789.0,Patient,"And I, and I, and I realized that I think rudy's like that, too, in some ways, but like I am so sensitive to criticism i'm so sensitive to not doing something right or. well. I guess I feel like the feeling in my body when I feel that i'm being criticized or actually being criticized or anything like that it's like it feels like i'm being attacked, you know it feels like. i'm I mean, even if i'm not being yelled at which i'm often not you know it's like I feel like a be. it's frustrating to me that. I can make so much progress on so many other things like, for instance, like. You know time management someone you know getting jobs again taking my health care seriously. getting off drugs, you know i'm are getting off opiates other and I. And then these other things like not being so sensitive to criticism or. Not having so much self doubt or like so much more difficult. And I mean i'm sure my mom the whole thing with my mom had something to do with it, you know I knew that I was like. Taking on things that had to do with her and I knew that my feelings about things were amplified because if i'm back of the mind in the back of my mind until they found her, I was like. I haven't talked to my mom for two years, she might be dead, I might never get a chance to talk to even a basic conversation like like we've talked about you know. Where we talk and it's like she says something maybe unpleasant or whatever, and I say well you know that's that sounds important to let me think about you know I mean i've actually been practicing those conversations in my mind it's like. I don't know I mean I feel like i'm getting I feel like i'm getting off track or i'm talking so much i'm doing that thing that I do."
105.0,Provider,"But let's pick one thing then there's the general one which is you watch this video you recognize yourself in it. You know, remembering that this is you living your life feeling your own feelings now there's no escape there's no running from it, you got to feel them you're going to be sad. i'm curious Sam I recently looked at a little documentary sort of documentary on Buddhism, and I wonder, I wonder if that's something have you explored, that the the dharma is the."
3789.0,Patient,yeah definitely. I mean not I mean I haven't read all this stuff but I like a wet one of the last books I checked out was how to communicate with Buddhist.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so. that the whole objective was that the Buddha wanted to understand. suffering. did a lot of self induced suffering a lot a lot, a lot of looking at how to overcome it, how to overcome it what's the solution and ends up realizing that it is in. That the joy is in that we're already broken that the connection between us all is that we are we're already broken. And the the relief that can be too I don't have to be perfect it's already you know I get I get attached to. This pretty sweater it's so prettiest perfect color it has no stains on it. And then. It and then it does. yeah or my favorite one I leave it at a restaurant and it's gone."
3789.0,Patient,yeah right.
105.0,Provider,"it's that all day long I get it just the way I want it. Someone gets sick. I get fired. I get a flat tire and i'm late for my first day of my job it's so it's terrible. yeah but. If you already kind of have this this notion it's already broken it's already it wasn't yours, to begin with, it wasn't. it's not actually rational to think that it's. it's this one thing and it's going to stay this one thing it's going to stay pretty it's going to stay clean it's going to stay. And it."
3789.0,Patient,goes right so.
105.0,Provider,"If you want to start to find, not just for me, but if you want to just sort of start to investigate on your own it might be fun to do that with your sweetheart to start to look at some of the teachings because it gives it gives your Rules to live by. right on you, you a lot of times you know you you. kind of you're looking to me like give them to me i'm not used to having them I want them I want them, I wanted to. But these are ones that you, you can pull and draw from and anytime you know."
3789.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I kind of feel like my sweater. is like the. way i've always leaned on using my brain trying to do things the best I can i'm. not making this for trying not to make mistakes or reacting against when somebody says i've made a mistake, you know. I make mistakes. Right it's like i'm human, I guess, I think I need to focus more on that and maybe meditate on it, and you know and then whole thing he said, like we're all broken, like the. The Japanese like they prepare all their stuff with gold, you know, to emphasize it like i'm not perfect, I impossible for me to ever I can try to come better I can try to develop skills, but i'm perpetually being disappointed when I am putting these standards on myself or whatever."
105.0,Provider,"So that's philosophically. A way to come at this now specifically. You. Have you have skills you're able to use your breathing. Why don't you, you know i'm not sure if you're all is there, but what if what if you were very. Maybe you're on the phone with rudy. What was it that you heard that it activated you."
3789.0,Patient,"whenever I hear um it's not just him but whenever I hear any sound in anybody's voice that makes me think they are unhappy with me, they are judging me they think I didn't do good enough, they. I mean, I know a lot of this is. Related to my parents. yeah my mom. um. it's just hard to me, knowing it is one thing and doing something."
105.0,Provider,"I know, and I gotta tell you this thing you're talking about hate to say it, and we haven't done mtr in a while, but this is where the desensitization and reprocessing kicks butt. yeah what you're talking about, because you you're visiting it again and again and again and again it starts to change bodies feeling different. The the. The self talk is starting to be different, I think we should do, I think we em Dr on this one, because it has been around for a while we've touched on it in different ways. You have no yeah and we've done a bit of it but we've."
3789.0,Patient,"not done anything, I think, maybe we did something about criticism one time with it, but."
105.0,Provider,"But sound there's there's something about yeah, and so we might be able to to really focus on that let's let's I want to see something what what what is a typical if we were to meet right away like next week, I know, normally we're meeting every other week. But let's say we were to move it up just to address this for let's say three weeks, where we went at this a little bit more intensely. What would your next week, be like. What time, are you getting up."
3789.0,Patient,i'm actually getting up road eight.
105.0,Provider,Could you meet with me. Next Wednesday at nine.
3789.0,Patient,yeah I could do that.
105.0,Provider,Okay September 22 at 9am. You.
3789.0,Patient,saw me mtr about a.
105.0,Provider,yeah yeah it's going to be around that sound those loud sound.
3789.0,Patient,"yeah. that's a good idea, because now. i'm not making a lot of progress with it on my own sure."
105.0,Provider,we've tried it. you've tried to cognitive behavioral. let's let's see how we do with this let's do mtr September 22 will do 9am.
3789.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,And then let's get something in place for the following week to. That one I happen to have. I have 11am open on Sep tember 29th.
3789.0,Patient,it's Thursday.
105.0,Provider,Now it's a Wednesday.
3789.0,Patient,Wednesday okay yeah that's fine.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, then we've got a couple weeks in place together. Right, and so the key thing for you is to have those two objects that are."
3789.0,Patient,Right and to. apply your out the setup and make sure it's all ready to go.
105.0,Provider,"yeah you know, things are there you. know you don't wanna wasting time, but what we can do to move it along, even more so, is, I can start to target. To target that now. So that we don't have to. do that, let me just make it really obvious that this Notice for you. Sam say target. sounds. And this is. nine six. Okay, so. Is it. Loud sound, or is it someone's voice."
3789.0,Patient,"I think it's both I think. I think if I hear something that's loud noise that. is maybe in another room, it does, but also, but more so it's tones of voice that make me feel like i'm being judged or criticized angry at me. i'm being dismissed stuff like that."
105.0,Provider,Okay i'm.
3789.0,Patient,migrated.
105.0,Provider,"sounds you don't want might be interesting to do. is to record rudy saying something. And just do it on purpose deliberately put it on your phone. And a little recording and send it to me for fees open to it. Because, then I can play it I can use that as my my subject matter."
3789.0,Patient,"Right. And then, it was like very specific."
105.0,Provider,"yeah who would be very specific. And you might even try little things like you know hey rudy just say, have you walked the dogs have it just be his regular town like this really low Grade one hey have you walked the dogs and then have him say. hey if you walk the dogs, you know, and so we can kind of get this progression going and then i'm not sure how angry things get and how loud, but even louder."
3789.0,Patient,"No, not really I mean it's. that's that's the most. I mean honestly it, it makes people very frustrated with myself because that's like these are things that I feel like a tough or resilient person wouldn't have to be working no."
105.0,Provider,"No, no, you can let that go. You can you can you can let that judgment go plenty of people, the day, this is this get locked gets lodged but probably before you even had in word so to give yourself a break on that. But this would be really useful, because then I don't have to do, that the role play to just be therapist I can press press a little maybe on my phone and hit play it play it play. You can get those if you don't get to it that's fine to."
3789.0,Patient,"know, I think that totally makes sense. Because the more specific, it can be the more the science behind big word right."
105.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly so so we have the tone, we have the volume. um. Does it matter what is said does it matter the content."
3789.0,Patient,"yeah I mean there are definitely some things that. i'm trying to think like what are they like. i'm. assumptions like assumptions that. Either I am the way that I was and they haven't changed. or like. You know, like that the same problems that I used to have are not the same problems that I have now. um yeah. it's like I don't know I mean I guess it's hard to get too specific, but it's like. Anything that. I also need to. I mean, I also know, I need to work my in my own head on the thought stopping you know that. When stuff like that, when I feel like i'm being good or I feel like i'm being criticized whether I am or not, in my mind there's a dialogue that's going on, which I have to listen very closely to hear but it's something like you know. you're so stupid, you know you don't know how to do anything you're we you're. you're. Not sensitive that sounds too Nice, you know you're."
105.0,Provider,"Well let's go with let's go with the I am on this one, because we need to get there, anyway."
3789.0,Patient,"yeah why am. I am stupid, I am lazy I am. In consider it I am. I am not paying attention, I am. hard to get along with, I am a prickly I am you know okay."
105.0,Provider,"So we want to we're going to pick one. My guest is the. i'm stupid, this is really primary one. Because you could probably break down and i'm hard to get along with, I mean consider it. I think so we're going to go with i'm stupid. So let's just see how true, that is, let me just check in on it. This one, the truth is. So i'm stupid which one is one to 10 so this one is zero to 10, this is a zero to 10 one. How true Is it right now I am stupid."
3789.0,Patient,Right now. yeah very.
105.0,Provider,"Like give me a number. Three Okay, and what is it the thought when you hear rudy say hey have you fed the dogs, what do you want to believe about yourself."
3789.0,Patient,I am conscientious that I let me just be more basic that that I am paying attention that I am being aware.
105.0,Provider,The other way around. I think you had it. I think you had it more basic. Before so. If you weren't stupid. And you liked what you believe about yourself what would you what would you believe.
3789.0,Patient,i'm good.
105.0,Provider,i'm good. More there we go okay.
3789.0,Patient,that's really good accomplices all looking.
105.0,Provider,"Okay okay. So let's do that one that one's a let's go zero to seven. How. Oh shoot, it was a three, on the other one right the i'm stupid. Again okay good right, and then the i'm good that's from zero to seven. How true is that right now."
3789.0,Patient,Maybe apply.
105.0,Provider,"Negative cognition this positive cognition okay. Without a little bit of time let's keep going so I went on, I want you to do so don't want you to bridge it back. To the earliest time of. i'm stupid. But memory, that is."
3789.0,Patient,"it's hard, I mean I don't know if i'm focusing on my mom because of what happened this week, but I. But I see her. Her face and it's. And it's like laughing you know. yep it's like. Like it's funny."
105.0,Provider,That who's funny what is funny.
3789.0,Patient,"Like it's funny that that i'm stupid or that. I don't know stuff. Or that. I feel like i'm not good, you know."
105.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's powerful about how old, are you with this this memory, while she's has this laughing face."
3789.0,Patient,"Like you said I feel like it's you know yo like. Maybe pre verbal you know, maybe. No like she. Like she's I feel like she. I feel like she always used to be has a point of comparison. Like she's okay. she's smart because i'm not or because I don't know thing."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so she used you to elevate. Her. intellect. Somehow."
3789.0,Patient,"You are Western boy, you know. Okay, I feel like a lot of this is really more related to the earlier stuff that happened, rather than later, because once I got to a certain point my intellect got to a point where I could hold my own, you know. But, but the feeling. Yes, that. i've a little kid. i'm stupid and not good lazy."
105.0,Provider,"So interesting because. there's no way that you compare yourself to a kid like that doesn't even make sense when adult would do that, but there, she was doing that."
3789.0,Patient,"Well that's what it felt like. I don't know what she was doing but that's what I felt like I felt like I was being judged and that I was. A way for her to like either I was way for her to boost her self esteem, because she produced somebody that was large or capable, or whatever, or I was a point of comparison, for how much."
105.0,Provider,"Better yes, I. Was mm hmm so."
3789.0,Patient,That was about be I didn't do any of that all that was what she created that's what she gave us a field.
105.0,Provider,So you were either it was elevating her self esteem to compare to you or you are a bit of a show pony once you started to. write okay.
3789.0,Patient,"But then immediately as soon as I had any kind of problem like say I was smart until I got pregnant and then I was embarrassing. And then. I was you know, and then it was oh I don't want you going out of town your stepfather is going to take you to. The next town. see an Ob gyn you know."
105.0,Provider,You have such a quintessential narcissistically wounded mother it's really amazing how how like textbook she is it's remarkable I.
3789.0,Patient,"didn't feel weird whatever I was like oh okay yeah no it's my I get it now what I could say that's true is like yeah today my mom came out of the woods naked, not even thinking about the fact that the whole week like we've been worried that she's dead. That like. police have been looking for."
105.0,Provider,Resources wasted resources.
3789.0,Patient,"Right, which I would feel really bad about if I did that. But I don't I mean I don't know I don't talk to her, so I don't really know how she feels but yeah I feel like. we're hitting on something. Both of us with this. it's not a rational feeling. You know I don't think i'm stupid or lazy or any of that stuff because of anything have recognized about myself it's because of like early input."
105.0,Provider,"yeah you absorb that, and so we won't need an actual tangible memory that's fine it's enough. You know that i'll say I want you to you know picture your mom's face laughing or the worst part of that we don't it's fine you've got you've got a you've got a thing to use a bridge, a bridge memory that's just fine and then the somatic awareness. You know I didn't check in earlier, but when you do picture that. That almost feels as old as you are, where is it in your body that you feel that that distress. here just yeah."
3789.0,Patient,The baby in the arms to.
105.0,Provider,You know.
3789.0,Patient,Like grab you know.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and arms and what's happening with the arms."
3789.0,Patient,I feel like I like I need to like grab on to the Chair. grace oh.
105.0,Provider,grabbing got it.
3789.0,Patient,yeah which is interesting that's the same thing that happened to that car accident so maybe that's some kind of weird for also.
105.0,Provider,"bracing yourself yeah just racing Okay, and then you mentioned some some emotions earlier. And I mean, I can see that your tearful. D, do you know how to label what the emotions are right now."
3789.0,Patient,Thanks so. I feel. weird it's like a combination feeling like I feel I feel sad I feel angry. yeah I feel. embarrassed. Those are the main ones.
105.0,Provider,"So maybe just for the time that we have now i've got enough information for the am Dr but let's just use the parts framework for just a second if the if the potential for embarrassment and sadness. were to be avoided, which part protects you from being that embarrassed again what part is the protector."
3789.0,Patient,The. caregiver remember what it's called.
105.0,Provider,But yeah you don't have to.
3789.0,Patient,enter asshole. My no.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, oh right so um so is an asshole a a teenager is asshole."
3789.0,Patient,"In Colombia, Peru."
105.0,Provider,me okay.
3789.0,Patient,My inner mean girl yo he's like I don't care whatever you're you don't know what you're talking about. You know.
105.0,Provider,"girl. And just mean girls have permission to the angry, to show anger."

105.0,Provider,"So for a lot of people this this teenage self. Is such a cool part of US people that aren't good at anger, but they can do. We might need to change its name from mean girl. yeah what. yeah but something else cute and fun."
3789.0,Patient,Like sassy girl or.
105.0,Provider,"girl I like it sassy girl, because we need this, we really need the power that comes from her ability to push back right and. It can. You can actually call upon it. When. So so just let's just take this for a second Now all we did was just focus on sassy girl, it could be some of their part of you, but just imagine that you hear a criticism. And instead of going to a shame activated part the little girl of embarrassment like I did something wrong that's so she had to believe. Instead, you went to sassy girl. Watch in the room, if I hear across the room hey. Did you feed the dogs. I might say a sassy girl. We don't hear a bark and doing it."
3789.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"Okay now so sassy girl you laugh. yeah sassy girl, unlike mean girl not bitchy but sarcastic. And kind of funny and kind of ironic so maybe getting in touch with her little sassy girl. would be there to, we could say she might show up if she was babysitting little girl and say oh I got this I got this don't cry kidding me we got this let's make a joke out of this let's have some fun with this. No i'm trying to starve them to death, the two i'm trying to save money, I need I need a new pair of shoes."
3789.0,Patient,yeah. yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and you're just the Gal to get in touch with sassy girl because sassy girl meets intellect to have a decent job you get to."
3789.0,Patient,Make sure it doesn't go too far to go.
105.0,Provider,"wow it's tricky and i'm not saying it won't crash and burn sometimes but i'm trying to be access to it. Which is different than me mean girl saying Fuck you. that's not my job. i'm not there bitch you know. Okay, wait."
3789.0,Patient,Well right.
105.0,Provider,Right so that's why maybe something a nicer.
3789.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah yeah no totally and I think that's an important distinction for me because. When I feel the shame my immediate reaction is go to me.
105.0,Provider,"me, you know."
3789.0,Patient,"But it's a big difference, but that's totally different like I would have laughed at a depiction of somebody me but I laughed and I felt like a relief in my shoulders, you know, and my chest like when I was observing that so."
105.0,Provider,"So we change the attributes and we change the job description. It is not to cut and to cause someone pain like we feel. Right gets. To speak, while you're learning how to do it, maybe sassy girl will only show up every once in a while, maybe some other part will shop, but with the time we had, I thought we play a little bit with it, she gets this is maybe a sarcastic part. Right tickets to be playful yeah."
3789.0,Patient,I like I read I like the I like the joke that was like no know i'm trying to start you know.
105.0,Provider,Okay. Now that's not an answer because he's still gonna wonder if you found the darn dog.
3789.0,Patient,"Right right. But but it's a. it's a thought or it's a it's a job that is followed by yeah, of course."
105.0,Provider,"that's followed by that's right now you've channeled that. And you got to have some playfulness and now so just picture that those little girl sees You see, is this teenager doing that, how does she take that in."
3789.0,Patient,"Like joyfully I think like oh my God I didn't realize, you could do it that way, or that seems like such a better idea."
105.0,Provider,or big sister. you'd write texted me we don't answer them we had some fun.
3789.0,Patient,And funny. And for not being funny.
105.0,Provider,"Well, that was fun. yeah you're so you're so smart to come up with that funny joke. Now i'm not prescribing that you go do this because they don't know what you're doing with it, I don't know if you're going to end up having a fight with rudy over this kind of thing, but my point is to say. let's change the responsibilities let's change the names let's give them job duties that harness the energy of anger. yeah into mastery into turning it into mastery and that's what we could do here and you sit there you go I don't want to cry. I want to do something. What part can I pop call upon right now."
3789.0,Patient,yeah part or parts for sure.
105.0,Provider,yeah hmm.
3789.0,Patient,"Because there's I mean I don't know I get I definitely feel like i'm having a breakthrough moment because we've talked about all this stuff but i've never really been able to picture it in my mind like like I am now where. I just was seeing like the laughing you know, like not just my mom but I pictured that but, like yeah like how the little girl would react with that Joe or like the funny sort of dry funny facial expression Oh, the. sassy girl."
105.0,Provider,yeah well these dogs will eat when I when i'm not hungry yet. 20 minutes ago.
3789.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's a lot that's a lot better feeling than. than feeling is shame or feeling.
105.0,Provider,Right so picture picture and if visuals are helping you you got to remember that if you're really a visual person start to draw some of these little things down dry your little teenager. You picture this holding little girl's hand this younger sister even holding her and saying watch this watch watch me get a rise out of rudy watch watch watch.
3789.0,Patient,To see what I think that's actually a good idea that drawing i've been working on i'm trying to use to draw just to use pain stuff like that and stick figures I can do.
105.0,Provider,"yeah that's all we need that's all we yeah I like it Okay, we already have our next two appointments day was a little short just because we got a late start. But we've got plans for em Dr if you happen to get Ahold of some voice recordings with rudy even one if you can pull off one that'd be cool. If not, I can find stuff from the Internet, you know."
3789.0,Patient,"No, I feel I feel like. I mean this is definitely something that we're talking about that we have a dialogue about. I know that he wants me to be able to. Whatever I mean I don't know if he has to apology, but he wants me to be able to feel better and to not react."
105.0,Provider,So it's so interesting because how you you present in here. Is cheerful. But out there you.
3789.0,Patient,"I I think I think it's part of my wanting to please you, you know, like in a way you're an authority figure to be and positive figure so. there's still a big part of me that doesn't want to be completely I guess honest or forthcoming about stuff because I wanted to be, I want to be farther along, I want to.
