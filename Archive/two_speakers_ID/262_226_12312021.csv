Good pretty easygoing. I think that was the same with with Christmas just very low. not going to lucky yeah you know drama. you're just kind of talking about how. I was even a kid you know it's. Just not a lot of like. Most you like. cats, I guess, to be sister. yeah. Well they're not engaged and i'm sure they will be the father's girlfriend's daughter six. Total bitch you know, on Christmas and teenager and. Just hearing about that and. You know there's a lot of potential for. bullshit with you know personalities and stuff and. yeah I was just kind of. Just really. grateful that. This is everybody gets along. Now, and there's no. Little slights and you know things aren't kept under a rug and and all that stuff it seems just very simple and sincere. yeah yeah."

226.0,Provider,So lucky.
262.0,Patient,"yeah. and So yeah got back together with her boyfriend. After July August one semester really six six months. Because they broke up in July already it's been that long I didn't realize it really would have been that long. yeah. I know i'm trying not to be upset or I really feel any way about it. or life and. She was still really sad after all this time and. I, like you know I like to see her happy. i'm gonna support that decision. see what happens."
226.0,Provider,"So, has been. Some things going on."
262.0,Patient,"Well, there was and that's what I cuz I know that she was. She still had a resentment towards his online bullshit. So I just kind of wonder where that is you know and yeah especially like during the break up like how far did he did he get back into that are. They both. said they both data they're both on tinder. He knows, she was on tinder during that time, and she knows he was in Spain, have decided not to talk about it. yeah I don't know if that's gonna really stick, you know or not to. want answers to things like that, but. it's either gonna work or not, you know I mean it, you know, but one possibility is that this is it and they're going to get married. Today, you know. or it's. going to be in a. futile attempt in right. So I was just those definitely disappointed."
226.0,Provider,yeah when I heard that. I can yeah. I was gonna ask you if there's some disappointment there.
262.0,Patient,"Because I thought it was just very strong of her to to do that. Well, I know you even in light of being said, I haven't told my son yet, because I think he's gonna be disappointed. as well, I think I don't know I mean. he's he's a nice enough guy and stuff like that. I mean. yeah I don't know I mean i'm not gonna you know absolutely gonna walk them back into the you know. To fold, and all that. For the best. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So Okay, so this is a long distance relationship for them correct."
262.0,Patient,"Yes, where is he now not anymore he's lives closer to her now he lives about 15 minutes away oh shit. yeah."
226.0,Provider,So.
262.0,Patient,"it's hard for me because. Like i'm just totally triggered to use a stupid word. Only triggered. by Brian and Ian don't like kayden like no will we know this now like you know, like let's not pretend it's not it's not it's not a we go like. This now and now it's I I had a marriage of my husband not liking anybody and making my life hell. So anytime any inkling of this comes up like I know that you're not him and I know that that's not what this is, but I i'm like getting hot just here like hearing it i'm like physically getting. late and i'm thinking of like socialization for the rest of our lives, like if he's in our lives, for the rest of our lives, like that's. yeah so i'm just putting it out there. it's not that we don't like him a minute and that's even a strong. You know just in terms of who cat is and. I know, but it's also like. she's not week before letting him back in our life. No. that's not what i'm thinking at all I don't think so. yeah i'm definitely. You know curious to see how it goes and like I said, you know I like I like I mean I like to help her father to like it doesn't know I mean he he's Okay, he knows better now after. All the years with with me to not just dismiss people. And he knows that it would really harmed his relationship with this cat. But he you know, in general, thinks he's a loser and doesn't want to go to school and doesn't you know he's not the same level that cat is. Right right so like it's one of those things like it's Okay, if I feel it Okay, if I say it it's like I can rag on my mother all day but minute somebody else says something like my mother, you know."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
262.0,Patient,"So we are I guess. yeah I mean in in in all honesty, there is no feelings of. Like I know people that I would fucking definitely have issues with the types, you know. And it is there's you know, none of that. There were just some. dynamics within the relationship that I, you know I guess she has discussed with him yeah I hope that they work that out there was just a lot of like babying and. coddling Dan can kind of putting her in a. What seemed like an awkward position and. But I you know, so I think that with what's happened novia change them curious to see what it is, but you know I don't think that. You know it's the kind of thing we're like we fucking hate the guy. And we're gonna have to put on masks every time we're with them it's not like that at all at all. Like at all, you know. You really don't think so. No. See I and i'm so like frickin damaged by. My life that that that's all I think now that. That, I have to be anxious every time everyone's better know. And I. would certainly. Think it's a degree at all. And I mean this is gonna make me, you know, look at what you know there's obviously something there, that is. You know that this girl loves and needs from him, and you know I accept that and I, you know, want to see what it is. You know. But. yeah it's good it's like I mean I was sad when when he messaged me and we had to say goodbye and i'll you know he texted me about. You know, saying like you know you know thanks for how nice your family has been, and all that stuff and it's a good music is a good person. You know I don't have there's with sin he and making you know, can we speak for him, but it's not like he's a fucking asshole that we got to put up with you know. That I wouldn't I wouldn't shy away from saying it is, it was true who says he was addicted you know you would certainly know how I felt about that."
226.0,Provider,"Well, I think it sounds like he needs to. I think it's going to take a little bit of work for him to get back into the good graces maybe you know, maybe just showing some good faith and just that. Their relationship can be healthier than what it was."
262.0,Patient,"yeah yeah she's working on that told me they've talked about a lot of issues they had a. lot of stuff she never even told him. Like she she just broke up with him over a text and. didn't. Just had all these issues with him, he never told him. So. Hopefully, this is a chance to. it's like a restart and it's not long distance so he's going to be meeting her friends, she has new friends they're. Just gonna be meeting his friends. never really felt like she could integrate him with her friends. Well yeah because those are the friends that she had before him, you know so now it's two new worlds that they'll be. they'll see if it works or not."
226.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. You know and that's it that's a good point you just said, you know it's it's really about, I think this. What they're in right now it's really to determine will determine if this is something that can work out, you know they're. they're kind of in two different worlds, you know she's in the college world and he's not and it's really about how is he going to integrate. With her friends and what's up going to what uh how's that going to be, you know it's going to be comfortable with that is she going to be comfortable with it."
262.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah you know, this is also really you know. it's it's um. You know. Trying all this stuff on learning growing you know, being in relationship that's how you learn right that's how you go oh that's not for me. And it's it's so common for these kids to break up and go back together and break up and go back together, and you know with with coven and with like, there are so many people on dating Apps dating sites, right now, because of the isolation of covert. And what's. what's happening is that they're not really finding people that. it's changed, you know, like the dating world has moved to doing it through Apps these you know online dating Okay, but it's also changing a little bit to what i'm noticing i've hi I have a ton of clients that had been doing this trying to find a partner like really wanting to. Start dating again and they're. disappointed at what is out there. male and female it's not just men going Oh, the chick suck for the guys, you know it's it's both. Right and. And so I think that there's. Okay, so when that said they were both on tinder they obviously didn't die with anybody that didn't really work out the way they might have wanted it to so it's very comfortable to go back to that you know, and that you had a relationship with and that you're familiar with. And you don't have to deal with that that dating it's I am not hearing good stories, I mean i'm not hearing horror stories i'm just hearing like. there's nobody out there. there's nobody that i'm connecting with God that i'm driving with there's nobody that I really want to feel what."
262.0,Patient,yeah and I hope that I hope she didn't just do it for comfort.
226.0,Provider,"yeah and i'll tell you at this age, they do it for comfort. They like to. Do."
262.0,Patient,When she did tell me that she realized that there's No one. In her life that she wanted to tell things to.
226.0,Provider,buy like.
262.0,Patient,"Like him, like he was in everything the new show or whatever anything she saw or came across she thought about."
226.0,Provider,Telling right.
262.0,Patient,Like he would be the first that she would tell. yep and like is related to that so much. who's to say that that's wrong to feel like that you know.
226.0,Provider,"So don't forget guys they're still that feeling of loneliness and isolation, because of covert what code has created it's the aftermath it's the post effects of what that pandemic has done."
262.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"I see it, i've been seeing it for the last year. yeah people are having a difficult time. getting their stride back getting the groove back getting their rhythm back. it's taking time. longer than we would have wanted or hope we're still people are still trying to figure this out and come out of this. Specially these younger kids they lost like a frickin year of socialization because of this pandemic of not being on campus. yeah yeah. yeah of not being you know with their peers. it's been really impactful there's there's apathy there's lack of motivation that's happening it's in this across the board."
262.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So you know. Remember, these things that kind of take these things into consideration Okay, so you don't know what the future holds right, you know you hope that there's going to be emotional growth and emotional intelligence and you know all of that kind of stuff so. yeah. fighter on it she's just going to go towards it more."
262.0,Patient,yeah that's what I see her dad doing like he's calling me oh my God I can't believe she's back with him and he. Is that you know. Okay that's your choice you're making. For your relationship with her. i'm making. My. Freedom so guys. will fully support this girl.
226.0,Provider,So. You know it's about her she's in this stage of like letting her figure this out on her.
262.0,Patient,"yeah. I guess I just wonder. Putting myself in a situation like. is not that breakup always going to be there yeah like. That happened, you know kind of I feel like they're even now like, he did a horrible thing to her, she had a horrible thing is breaking up over text, a few years is terrible. yeah and I wasn't I was not proud as a mother. yeah it's really like her, you know one person. She did it the way she did it and. yeah I do feel like okay here, even now. Clean clean slate."
226.0,Provider,How old is she again.
262.0,Patient,she's 2021 in May. 20 oh yeah he's not. he's in February.
226.0,Provider,So what is he working up there is that what's happening.
262.0,Patient,"He actually isn't he's a Community college. is trying to transfer so he's like a year behind her. He wants to transfer to a four year after Community college and he's working. As a server. restaurant, just like she is. In a different town. He didn't move he moved out, it was. Parental home and got a job and started college. All during the break up so that does say a lot about he could have totally gone the other way and then. Good grew a beard and play video games in his father's house yeah. Totally want to let you pick up and all the porn shit online and eat food. Because it gets very good."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
262.0,Patient,So that's how it could win. yeah so that's good so maybe she saw that. One supporter actually.
226.0,Provider,"And, and you know don't forget to that when one person graduates and another person has a year of school left. that's a big deal. Cuts enormous. Like by the end of college, you want to get out of college and get into the adult world and you don't want to have much to do with that college lifestyle. that's a big determining factor. If these kids stay together it's difficult to stay together with somebody that's still in school when you're out working."
262.0,Patient,yeah so we might be dealing with this again. yeah good I keep telling myself like this isn't uncommon for. wow it's to heaven on again off again.
226.0,Provider,So.
262.0,Patient,"i'm actually glad that she did have some wild dating time because she never had that she had a boyfriend all through high school and then she had kayden. So she did have you know all these new friends at her job and tender and plus boys that she met at the job parties. 656 months. yeah I don't know if it was finding herself, but it was realizing."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, he. was important yeah and even just being able to experience that is super important. You don't want to look back and go. I wish i'd done that, like you know you're 25 years old and now you're trying to you're you're acting like you're 20 years old it's got to get it out of your system."
262.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,look good for her.
262.0,Patient,yeah we'll keep you posted. anyway. Everything is going good. seems to be going. Through la i've been. Continuing with my growing up by blackness sons car. registered. Title transfer. insurance. And now trying to figure out this health insurance thing it's made some calls today. got my taxes into the account. So all that's kind of falling into place is feels like. Whenever took took however long it took or whatever to do it. But it's definitely very relieving.
226.0,Provider,Absolutely.
262.0,Patient,"All that stuff. yeah Brian is going through a super productive. Days. Not not phase, but new era. And i'm like kind of the opposite lately i've. been very like barely doing the minimum. With work and administration of. All kinds of things and trying to snap out of it. But. i'm very grateful to. Her so. energized. The dog businesses doing really well and. Is busier than ever yeah."
226.0,Provider,yeah Thank God that's fantastic yeah.
262.0,Patient,"yeah I. need to get the creative thing going and. I think, once all these other. Solutions tied together, I can feel more free to do that. Yes."
226.0,Provider,"Sir, your headspace up."
262.0,Patient,yeah right. yeah sure.
226.0,Provider,"what's going on with the student loans, then, are you paying those."
262.0,Patient,"yeah so. We wound up, I told you, we had a conversation with them and. i'm still I was that was part of what I was going to be doing now, but they've now post on it again. yeah for three months three more months. So sort of bias some time. We sort of I mean because right now. I give them an amount for the test one, and then the agreement was you know I will give you what I can towards the whole thing so. i'm still waiting to find out what mine is going to be. Because mine is fucking retarded crazy. But I mean it's it. You know i'm going to talk with them, and whatever and hopefully be able to give them when I could give."
226.0,Provider,"Who is your lungs, to again."
262.0,Patient,They just switched over to some new.
226.0,Provider,yeah it's like.
262.0,Patient,"it's federal the. federal. But yeah I mean there's been I just added a bunch on the biggest mistake I ever made my life from graduate school. So I mean it's just an astronomical amount I don't even know really what all together. But. yeah i'm not looking forward to that, but whatever. yeah i'm gonna stay square with them, however, Nice. But with with the and. Then there's no more anxiety in regards to that, I mean the understanding is, I want to, I want to, and you know I will I will pay what i'm able to. But he's good with that. yeah the relationship that we have is. Definitely much. Different than what he has going on with his mother there's still a lot of shit going on, you know between her and it and not talking in. Passive aggressive bullshit and its really, really killing him. But he's he's been doing really good and letting a lot of ago. She tried some stuff. This is from her ruins things this way she is you know and just about how. You know, oh you don't have to give me any thing is, is that you know don't go out of your way to get me they let you know well let's not give them anything to anybody each other anymore, you know. That kind of shit you know. nonsense. No, no trouble yourself getting me anything let's just not do it anymore Fuck you. craziness. So um but I did messaged her mother, my ex.

I should more often anyway. i'm you know i'm a slow driver and the weird driver and it's just not a great driver for me. easy for her it's easy for her though she gets her like 40 minutes."

I don't want to play on my 50th birthday party that's my that's what I want. For your birthday party. Whatever is so i'd be mad i'm not sure in terms of what. is socially right now. The thing like would. Would people shy away from the gathering."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. Probably not I know you know what's a really good Question No I don't know everybody's kind of it's so weird you know, some people are okay with it because they've got been vaccinated some people are avoiding it right now, because of this new variant that's happening."
262.0,Patient,"Well that's because if this was a for this very thing I wouldn't question but. With all of you know, it seems to be spreading like wildfire very fast and even though it's mild it's still the thing you know and. So that's what I want to do."
226.0,Provider,"Well, and also there you know it depends on you know how they in California, how they handle it, you know I mean right now, you guys just have mass mandates correct."

Just slacking on are there remedied in a matter of hours. or a day tops like that's the thing like what am I doing why can't I do this feel like it's a roku down go through talking hoops to get it fixed. Like fucking health insurance i'm sitting on it for three months. How many things like that just dangling dangling. dangling. And it's just it's just fear fear of opening up a pandora's box. yeah taxes are. bills I got my own insurance coming up for renewal health insurance. Just not fun not fun things."
