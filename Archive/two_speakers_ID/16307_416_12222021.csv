416.0,Provider,today.
16307.0,Patient,Great.
416.0,Provider,Not good not great what's going on.
16307.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't a lot of stuff."
416.0,Provider,Where would you like to start.
16307.0,Patient,"Well, last night I looked over some of the book. I was looking at chapter."
416.0,Provider,That.
16307.0,Patient,"keen on self esteem, you had a chance to look at that."
416.0,Provider,Chapter before.
16307.0,Patient,"yeah so I could resonate a lot with it to certain extent and. You know, without critiquing it too much. guess the i'm looking through it now, because I was reading it on my tablet but i'm on my tablet with you now, so I have to look at another copy here. But there was a section that talks about like stuff that was covered in Chapter eight about. The victim, the critic. The."
416.0,Provider,Sub personalities uh huh.
16307.0,Patient,"perfectionist and the first one, I forgot what first."
416.0,Provider,i'm. worried worried yeah.
16307.0,Patient,"So definitely feel like. tracing my way across those categories and really suffering from the warrior one. and yeah just a lot of anxiety relating to the. To the warrior one and then. Very impatient like today. I was scheduled to do antigen test and I drove over there, and there was a line of cars going around the block. Like 70 cars and I was assuming no there's no way i'm waiting in this line, and it just behoove me that, like I couldn't believe that I didn't know think of that ahead of time like oh there's going to be so many people in line. let alone in their cars. And kind of pissed me off a little bit usually all get upset about how stupid of me or. And then i'll start going into how. Irresponsible the the services are like just the whole thing about like you know why couldn't they prepare for this in advance, you know we're going through the same type of. lack of preparedness that we went through before. Around testing. So complaining internally that's more like the victim."
416.0,Provider,yeah. Lots of blaming.
16307.0,Patient,"So, and then realizing like. You know I just go into like obsessive a big controlling mode like I called my my primary care clinic I was trying to micromanage them being like look I need to. I need a second booster cuz you guys don't know shit and you got to follow you know you just wait to be told what to do, and all of that's going through my head about from the CDC and you don't know the latest information that the CDC is getting and i'm just like. Trying to."
416.0,Provider,"tear demanding a second poster from them, because you felt like they weren't up to speed on the CDC recommendations."
16307.0,Patient,"Well, the CDC isn't up to speed on the Madonna recommendations, the return a did a study that said, if you had 100 micrograms of the. There booster that you would have like a four time fold, and you know we're. Have titers produced so you'd be much more protected and all the while I probably already had an account and by the time I get tested, there will be nothing to show. You know, and I had a cold and I wonder whether again hypochondriac mode, just like everybody else wondering like oh shit is this. You know the the. sock the virus again like when I had a runny nose and slight fever and what not and it's it's crazy because you don't know whether you have a head cold or whether you have SARS."
416.0,Provider,"So what i'm hearing from you is a lot of like. These sort of Sub personalities kick in the warrior the victim and then you start kind of spinning and spinning and spinning, and then, when you start to spin you clamp down and try to control everything."
16307.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Right it's like that's what's going to help you feel safe because you're spinning, and you don't feel safe."
16307.0,Patient,yeah and.
416.0,Provider,"spinning isn't necessarily. what's a result of what's going it's influenced by what's happening in the world, but it's really the spinning is happening in your head so clamping down on the world around you isn't going to stop the spinning."
16307.0,Patient,"yeah it's the go to kind of coping mechanism right it's. A habit of. Just well condition that was learned habit right, I mean it was even the stuff that I learned in school wasn't able to bypass that earned habit for my family of the neurotic clamping down part perfectionism to I think perfectionism."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16307.0,Patient,"Can to that. Wanting things to be perfect getting really impatient having to be like everybody else i'm like Fuck that you know, like I just don't want to be the subject of. In line, like everybody else. You know i'm always looking to kind. Of tired of being in line, like everybody else because i'm going to be mind waiting, like everybody else getting sick. You know. Either my thoughts are from the actual reality."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16307.0,Patient,"You know I can't. i'm convinced that I, you know I can't be around even small groups of people for a long time because it just made me vulnerable to things that don't outweigh the costs there's the benefit of being social does not way to outweigh the cost of me getting sick."
416.0,Provider,The rest camp. Okay.
16307.0,Patient,"The covert. I mean just in general, like. Even the risk of like. feeling nausea from what. Other people may think of me I guess not worth that costs."
416.0,Provider,yeah and.
16307.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I can appreciate why you feel that way, and why do you think that way, the concern about that is that. When we start to isolate in that way. I mean essentially those thoughts create isolation right, and when we start to isolate in that way and. Every time we isolate and we don't get sick it's sort of reinforces that anxiety in your brain it really your brain goes Oh, thank God, I didn't hang out with anybody, because now i'm not sick."
16307.0,Patient,yeah that I was right i'm better off.
416.0,Provider,"And you're right. Except that your brain is telling you something is dangerous that may not be. Right, because we know that there are ways to be around people right now that are not dangerous or that are much safer rate like outside socially distance masks on vaccinated."
16307.0,Patient,"But even when I do do that and I might have a moment of socialization I walk away from it thinking like. useless. Just in n plus it's just like. feels authentic to me. as well, most of my relating with people is like shooting the shit and I walk away from that like it's just retarded what's the point."
416.0,Provider,"So. If I assign you a video to watch, will you do it."
16307.0,Patient,"Maybe. My watch part of it, I might grow and patient have it be like i'm above it."
416.0,Provider,What do you think you're above things.
16307.0,Patient,"Because I know about him already i've already been through those fucking rings, you know i've already either watched it, you know if you're going to tell me to watch a DVD video."
416.0,Provider,it's not a DVD video but yeah.
16307.0,Patient,"or i've already encountered it or have a. opinion about it, based on something some similarity if it's like a topic or some but look, I mean it's a there's resistance, I was just very frustrated. Also. And and kind of talking away from the core the problem which is like I couldn't I couldn't sleep last night because of an anxiety, I actually had. The first night in a while, where yeah I was just like couldn't sleep, because just. You know at all my problems are starting to compound on me and like three in the morning. Other things that I feel victimized by. yeah and. it's interesting."
416.0,Provider,"He also victimized and yet, and yet when someone's offering help you. You feel sort of above that help. Which to me, I see as another way to push people away and to isolate."
16307.0,Patient,"well. yeah I mean but it's almost like a. it's a mask essentially right it's just. And it's sort of a variation. I was reading through this chapter, because there was a lot that really. Was. On point looking at these different types of. You know. Ways of having grown up the parental things like parental neglect parental rejection parental overprotectiveness and parental overindulgence, especially the last. yeah I mean being able to trust. The world or or. People around me, you know there's things there's recommendations here about like you know go out and make some friends like like it's a fucking easy thing to do, you know it's just not especially. it's like one person shared before. You know everybody's facing this stuff during the pandemic, you know these social. An anti social kind of constraints, this is how I was before the pandemic."
416.0,Provider,yeah it just the pandemic just sort of gave it.
16307.0,Patient,"was kind of happy that everybody else was going through it. You know cuz I was like it was a reinforcing and a reinforcement learning of like yeah and now you guys get to feel what it's like to be in the real world, you know, finally, your fantasy worlds that you guys have called breaks down, and now you have to do with fucking reality way. You know people who were. and dealt with. Not being able to play the you know the social games before had to deal with. i'm just. i'm tired of feeling like a people like that the victim right that. People use social relations and language to take advantage of one another to get."
416.0,Provider,"So I hear that you feel very much like the victim and the thing about it that sort of some personality around the victim is that our self talk when we're in that place same thing with a worrier or anything else. Our self talk reinforces that for us right, so we met start out with a legitimate experience that is victimizing us and then, as we go through it, the way we talk to ourselves continues that whether we continue to be the victim in reality or not right."
16307.0,Patient,Right so i'm playing that card and that narrative and you know this chapter does try to focus on changing some beliefs getting into like more affirmations and stuff.
416.0,Provider,"Not just affirmations but specifically I mean if affirmations if by affirmations you mean positive counter statements, yes. yeah it's it's really starting to challenge that language that you're using with yourself and that you're using with me, I hear it, even in this discussion right."
16307.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,That talk matters. A lot Let me give you an example Alec. So my favorite example of why self talk matters let's just pretend for a second that my car's parked outside of my house somebody comes by smashes into it.
16307.0,Patient,We don't have to pretend that happened to me like about a month ago.
416.0,Provider,"it's happened to me too before so Okay, so that happens, so I. My first instinct is to go. Man this sucks, this is the worst day ever, why does this stuff keep happening to me it happens over and over and over again, it cannot catch a break i'm going to not be able to make it to work now. i'm going to be financially stressed in a way, I wasn't already this really sucks this is awful right so those thoughts are going to produce certain emotions in me how do you think i'm going to feel with those thoughts."
16307.0,Patient,"Well, again, you know, at some point yeah you feel negative you feel angry at some point they might change over time, but they're going to be of a negative inclination right."
416.0,Provider,"Then I might feel powerless, I might feel like. i'm ready."
16307.0,Patient,yeah okay.
416.0,Provider,"So that's one way, so same situation, the facts and the life of this situation, have not changed somebody comes by hits my car and I think."
16307.0,Patient,yeah when you have to deal with the mechanic.
416.0,Provider,"Right well I think okay so same situation I think my initial response, instead of the last one is. Well, this sucks that, thank God, nobody was hurt nobody was in the car, thank God, I have insurance insurance is going to help I might have to pay some out of pocket. i'm going to figure it out, I don't know how i'm going to do it, yet, but i'm going to figure it out, I am a strong, independent person who's going to make this work. I have friends that can help me get to work, I have other ways I can problem solve through this. yeah so same exact situation very different thought processes one. lens madrassas is going to produce a lot of negative emotions, the other one is going to produce."
16307.0,Patient,"It works, but like both happen, they may happen. sequentially like, firstly, might I might arise with some negative thoughts, but then I will have positive thoughts to start coming up with the solution. So both happen for me, but I still constantly have to. deal with. That way of just and it's not a you know it's not a successful way."
416.0,Provider,"So you're missing my point in this, my point in saying this is that our thoughts produce our emotions right our interpretation of events in. And that determines where our emotions go and where our emotional response happens, which then determines our behavior so the part that we have control over. Is our thoughts and it might not feel like we have control over those initial thoughts they might come anyway, but we can influence them. And that's where these positive counter statements come in, so if your initial reaction. And, which is normal, because if you've been conditioned to be the victim or the warrior for a really long time, those are going to be your initial thoughts. So starting to create those positive counter statements to those that's going to influence your mood it's going to make you feel better so instead of going down that path toward anxiety and depression. Those positive counter statements are going to switch you a little bit into hope into feeling a little bit better."
16307.0,Patient,"Okay well that's I appreciate you sharing that with me that's kind of what I gathered from this chapter two i'm not trying to discount where you're saying, but. Yes, I get it."
416.0,Provider,"So you get something you'd like to try like so there's some worksheets in here that I think might be great for you to do you can start with the victim one and you think about a situation. In your you're not working or going to school at the moment, but you can think about something that's happened in the past, or you can think about in relationship. With regard to your anxiety symptoms, or whatever, and then you write it down and then you think about what are some positive counter statements I can come up with about this."
16307.0,Patient,And this workbook.
416.0,Provider,yeah it's on page 195 okay.
16307.0,Patient,"Okay, when. You go to bed Okay, so there are tall 195 and the heading for it, or the."
416.0,Provider,Particular personality worksheet the victim is the heading.
16307.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"And you, you can also do a worrier if you want to. If those are your two kind of predominant sub personalities."
16307.0,Patient,Well i'm not really a fan of believing in the whole sort of Sub personality things as being crystallized like a thing you're kind of like states that people. move through you know back and forth.
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean let's not get caught up in the in the semantics of this it's not necessarily whether you're calling them sub personalities or state of mind either way. The important part is the exercise itself, which is how you're going to influence those thoughts that thought process."
16307.0,Patient,"Alright, so I will look that over."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah let's let's assign you that task for before our next session. And even just starting out with noticing those negative thoughts right noticing like okay i'm interpreting this in a particular way that is is influencing my emotions is there, another way I can influence or interpret this."
16307.0,Patient,"Well, the. Question around work, you know. This type of pattern happens a lot. Where I go from. feeling like i'm not capable or. All these adverse things are working against me and that's keeping me from like taking various action and there's anxiety there and that arises in the space. That keeps me from taking action to there's that. You know what people call procrastination. But it's a good very palpable like. I defer you know, like all this all do it after I take a rest, you know something like that, because i'm so anxious around it and. i'm running at a time. Before I have to resort to negative codependency or financial dependency again i've asked for money. and yeah and then it's. That. snowballing effect like oh. My you know I just have a lot of financial problems."
416.0,Provider,heavily.
16307.0,Patient,"yeah without solving those my life. I struggle with success, the path to to try to. Have a little bit more success, you know, like, I was doing all this. philosophies group stuff and it was basically a distraction, you know, there was no monitor monetization factor with that. And I was. So. yeah i'm definitely aware where you're when it comes to the time lapse, that I have with work and. Then the thinking of the controlling a controlling factor, the perfectionism kicks in where it's just like. I think I know what all the possibilities are when applying for a job, what. What are the rules for that engagement what. Basically. which eliminates. Any possibility what may be going on."
416.0,Provider,Whoever yourself right out of it.
16307.0,Patient,"yeah so that's really a key problem right now, because i'm pressed for time. And i'm afraid of that kind of a change. So stuck where i'm actually comfortable being stuck and so long that i'm. constantly coming up with. scenarios where it's like I won't last more than a day or two because it may just be people demanding ship from me and i'm not look i'm a struggle with being in a position of of. of doing what other people want so all the negative frame comes into play and."
416.0,Provider,yeah your your future is a foregone conclusion in your mind.
16307.0,Patient,yeah that's a good where.
416.0,Provider,Have you and your all your dpt studies have you looked into a lot of radical acceptance.
16307.0,Patient,yeah i'm familiar with radical acceptance and I listened to her bra.
416.0,Provider,what's your understanding of radical acceptance.
16307.0,Patient,"Well, being able to touch into accepting one's given circumstances. But I feel like it's only a beginning right like radical it's like that's the acceptance part but then you have to you have to. resort will right after that, like you have to have your will kick in after that, I mean."
416.0,Provider,disagree with your dog and. He knows that. Can I offer you a different definition.
16307.0,Patient,"With radical acceptance, but some things are really difficult to accept and it's a great ideal but it's hard to really, really accept the fact that there's a. bathroom stall across the street from me and a homeless guy that's been living there for five years. And all sorts of other shit that I could tell you around the burning couches that radically accept the fact that I live in poverty, that I came from better circumstances than I am in now. sure. That. I have moments of that radical acceptance around that but it's not enough, I have to move from there. I have to do something."
416.0,Provider,So that's not what I mean by radical acceptance.
16307.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,What you're suggesting.
16307.0,Patient,That only the first part of that.
416.0,Provider,"Is some to some extent it is but mostly it's not me it's missing a key piece. The idea of radical acceptance that that the definition of radical acceptance that I find the most useful is based on the idea that suffering doesn't just come from pain. It comes from our attachment to the pain. So everybody experiences pain right it's part of the human experience. And some people get way more than their fair share. But how we attach that pain, the amount of energy we put into the pain, the the connection, we have to it, the way we interpret it the the way we grab Ahold of it. determines whether or not that pain turns into suffering."
16307.0,Patient,"Okay, so i've already had all of that happen numerous times."
416.0,Provider,"Right so radical acceptance is the idea that we would accept the pain, as it is. without attaching to it. Without with detaching from the pain it's not it doesn't mean not feeling the pain, it just means you aren't going to follow it down the rabbit hole. into suffering. Great so we would still feel the emotions, but imagine the emotion as a ghost right it's this like ethereal being this non corporeal thing, and you would walk right through it, so you would experience it and it would pass through yeah. So that you don't stay in it, you don't swallow it. When we do it turns into suffering. So it means watching your thoughts and feelings to start identifying when you're allowing yourself to feel worse than is necessary. When you're holding on to the pain to create that suffering."
16307.0,Patient,What if that's too difficult.
416.0,Provider,"it's a practice it's not a perfection so it's going to feel difficult. you're never going to get it exactly right. But starts with an awareness right and start looking at like how am I holding on to this pain. Am I attaching to it, and am I very attached to this pain, am I reinforcing it with my thoughts and my reinforcing it with my behavior or am I letting it pass through me like a ghost like a cloud. And in order to let it pass through you, there is a level of acceptance that has to happen that this pain is part of the world that this pain is part of a human experience. So I don't normally have conversations like this with my patients because it's a little. annoying. But you are you're a philosophy guys, so this is not above you."
16307.0,Patient,"Right i'm familiar with Buddhism i've lived in the Bay area and I practice and there and. it's a very you know. psychologically psychological mill you in the Bay area and stuff I get all that. I hear what you're saying, and yes, there are certain. Things that I do need to think I do need to work with that it's true maybe try to add some mindfulness and awareness around attaching to some of the pain or suffering. Yes, detaching being aware that i'm attached to it."
416.0,Provider,Right exactly.
16307.0,Patient,"yeah First, I have the gaining awareness like Aha, this is a moment where i'm attached to that pain right, because if I don't it's just running me."
416.0,Provider,you're following it down the rabbit hole into suffering.
16307.0,Patient,yeah well the suffering. Is a given it's always there there's always suffering.
416.0,Provider,yeah but what i'm saying is that you don't have to there is always paying it doesn't have to turn into suffering it always has for you and you are suffering.
16307.0,Patient,For me pain is the more extreme thing actually and.
416.0,Provider,"Thinking about how you can detach from it so i'm. Somehow Alfred we are Alec sorry I know you prefer Alec somehow we got scheduled for only a half an hour today, I thought we were scheduled for 45 minutes."
16307.0,Patient,yeah I don't want a schedule or.
416.0,Provider,How did that happen we're already scheduled for the fifth though right.
16307.0,Patient,i'm not sure I have to double check whether.
416.0,Provider,I haven't done. The fifth at 9am.
16307.0,Patient,Okay. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So, unfortunately, I am going to have to let you go here in a minute, because we got scheduled in a funky way i'm sorry about that. So did you I."
16307.0,Patient,Probably should call them any contact I made sure they scheduled for 45 minutes.
416.0,Provider,"The next one says 45 minutes. And so, for these couple weeks, I mean i'll see when group as well, and actually we're going to talk about radical acceptance in groups, so this will be another topic, but i'm. So i'm going to challenge you if it's okay to give you, I want to give you homework my challenge to you is to do these worksheets. As part of radical acceptance, think about statements you can make to yourself, when the pain comes up when the when the. Hard thoughts come up when the unhelpful thoughts come up that cause you pain and suffering, how can you make counter statements to detach from them right and that's really what these worksheets are about. that's a tough order don't worry about perfection don't worry about getting it right just free flow let it go and we'll we'll talk about it we'll revisit it together and the next session. Okay okay. All right."
16307.0,Patient,All right.
416.0,Provider,it's fun working with you because they can get I can get all. Challenging with you.
16307.0,Patient,"Good yeah well yeah I mean. challenge is going to be good, because I have to accept that, first, I have a lot of resistance i'll hit with back."
416.0,Provider,"Resistance, but then."
16307.0,Patient,You know i'm willing to. To try to change so.
416.0,Provider,"Well, and i'd like to be helpful let's let's see if we can get there."
16307.0,Patient,Okay. Alright alright.
416.0,Provider,See you in our next session i'll see even group.
16307.0,Patient,"All right, thank you Julie. However, there's one day."
416.0,Provider,You too.
