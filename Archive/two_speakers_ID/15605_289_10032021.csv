15605.0,Patient,I am.
289.0,Provider,"Okay, great and my name is Dr Gala welcome to bright heart hell. yeah hi nice to meet you and let's see tell me a little bit about yourself and what brought you here today."
15605.0,Patient,"Oh i'm just a. brief four year old guy like going on. I don't know i'm not a part of my life, where I don't really get to be doing the things that I want to do with my time and I find myself only doing things I don't really want to do and I can't really do what I want to do so. i've just been in you know. In stone and drunk. To pass the days when you know more often than it should."
289.0,Provider,"So that's kind of the stuff that you don't want to do, but kind of taking over your life."
15605.0,Patient,"Smoking weed is fine with me i'm fine with doing that I want to be out like on a farm being healthy and like eating healthy and drinking water and getting enough sleep. That you know so alcohol use ties in with all that I don't want to be using it, but. i'm eating junk food and not getting sleep anyway so it's. more of an all encompassing thing i'm ready to transition to a more healthy lifestyle."
289.0,Provider,gotcha okay yeah and have you tried anything before.
15605.0,Patient,"yeah i've done it on different fronts multiple times but it's never been like i'm ready to do everything healthy. consistently, but at the same time that's because i'm not in an environment where it's like. Even possible first of all, but then second of all like nobody really gives a shit here if you're healthy or not and. I have to do it myself, I have to go find a place that I can do that."
289.0,Provider,yeah do you mean like where you're living or in the city that you're at.
15605.0,Patient,"yeah and it's not like the city that i'm in it's like i'm in a city, so I can't I can't escape these problems by going to any city ever Is this the problems are every single city. So I have to go out into the hills now."
289.0,Provider,"Oh, I see yeah Okay, and all sounds like this has been going on for a while, what made it like what brought you here like this time did anything change."
15605.0,Patient,"So this is like a legal requirement for a court case. I had I got into like trouble with an ex girlfriend and i'm trying to get that case dropped completely off of my record. and part of that is a mental health diversion it's called a mental health, the version, and so what we're trying to do is get me on a solid plan to show the courts that like i'm doing everything I can for my mental health to get a stabilized. Okay, this is part of that."
289.0,Provider,"Okay okay sounds good, and so, what are you looking for other than like fran for legal issues like anything in particular."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah i'm hoping to get the tools, I need are the tools that you guys have to offer really i'm here to get any support that you guys have since i'm here anyways is the way I look at it so. I don't like meds I don't really want to take meds and i'm not out of place where i'm dependent on alcohol at all like i'm. I didn't drink last night, and I feel fine. And I don't drink consistently every single night, so I don't think I need meds I think it's more of a mental issue, and so what I would like from you guys is probably counseling just to help guide me through the process and. help me too, because you guys are professionals at getting people to. be healthier so. pretty much just asked you guys what you could do to help me getting a more healthy place just by talking things out and stuff like that."
289.0,Provider,"Okay gotcha yeah we do, we are the substance abuse and division of bright heart, so we do have a lot of patients. who use on alcohol, but there's definitely people who use medications for it, and then there are other people who don't take any medicines for it too so either way it's okay with me, whatever you feel like you need at your time. So we definitely can offer therapy and counseling that's actually a requirement of the program anyways so that's good that you're interested. And what we do is we have group meetings once a week and if you're with me and the therapist I work with we do it on Wednesdays, but really any time that works for you is fine. And so you get some group therapy at that time, but then you also are required to do one on one therapy outside of that tied to. So we can get you started and signed up for that. And yeah and you know you'll get to hear other people's. Experiences too, so you can kind of, let us know when things are working, or if you're going to need a step up with medications or something like that that sounds like we're Okay, without it, right now, which is totally okay."
15605.0,Patient,"With them like. Because i'm ready to make the change but not right, this second so we can hopefully make that transition."
289.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and you know a lot of it is like stare at least starting the process so that you can get the tools, so that you're ready to cut down. and ready to kind of change your life so that's okay. Do you have any other like medication that you take."
15605.0,Patient,No.
289.0,Provider,"Okay, otherwise pretty healthy."
15605.0,Patient,Mostly.
289.0,Provider,Do you have a primary care clinic.
15605.0,Patient,"No, I just go to like urgent care, but I haven't even been to any doctor."
289.0,Provider,"Okay, and yeah we always recommend getting connected to primary care clinic just to look after you for like all the other stuff."
15605.0,Patient,"too, and you can I wish."
289.0,Provider,yeah sometimes it's car hard like with locations and.
15605.0,Patient,Trends yet so that's a mess right now the financial. and logistical part of getting seen by a doctor right now it's not really realistic so.
289.0,Provider,Okay yeah you know just always recommended and.
15605.0,Patient,"i'm trying to move out of State this is like the thing that throws a wrench in all of these gears is like, I have a court case here that i'm waiting on trying to get settled but i'm also trying to get the hell out of here and buy land. At the same time, so I got a lot of stuff up in there."
289.0,Provider,"yeah okay lots of transition. um well the kidney says right hearts ritual and there's other groups and different you do have to let us know when you change states, because the group will change. But there's other groups and other States too. So you can just change that easily and and do you have any question."
15605.0,Patient,"Ah, not off the top of my head. Okay i'll just let you know I just cut in when I have."

289.0,Provider,"Okay, and then do you have any family history that I need to know about."
15605.0,Patient,My mom is pretty consistent with their wine and that probably didn't help me get used to beer. You know.
289.0,Provider,"Okay, actually that's Another thing I forgot to ask you how much do you drink when you drink."
15605.0,Patient,"It started with like two beers and then it was about once every twice a week, maybe, and then it got up to about three beers every night. And then now it's probably out like. Every third day every other day, maybe something like that and it's usually about three beers and then I stopped."
289.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and it sounds like you don't have any withdrawal selling stuff."
15605.0,Patient,"No, I get I get really bad hangovers that make me want to quit, though, like the hangovers make this shit not worth it. And then, sometimes I feel fine, but then some days I wake up and like I don't want to lose I don't want to be around man i'm just like. Throwing from the minute I wake up and then i'm just like trying to not throw up for five more hours but it's just it doesn't work, you know how you're throwing up for five more hours."
289.0,Provider,Oh gosh okay yeah does not sound fine.
15605.0,Patient,"A little bit of alcohol, so I think it's just my body's. telling me to. cut it out. To do, and I think it has to do with like how much i'm drinking water and how much like food i'm eating that night."
