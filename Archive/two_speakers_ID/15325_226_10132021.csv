Thinking about what other people want."
226.0,Provider,"me yeah. I just did a grip on people pleasing I think it was yesterday so. um. Okay, so when do you think your anxiety started."
15325.0,Patient,"When I was a kid for sure, because my mom kind of was abusive and I know it was because of her mom, but I feel like it started, then, because I had some problems with bedwetting when I was a kid. And I stopped when I was like 12 but she like would get so upset about it, and then it would like cause even more anxiety and. happen even more often. Right and like you know my mom did one I have a lot of bad bad memories i'm trying to get over and it's been hard to like have a relationship with her as an adult because of it. yeah she definitely like. I remember one time she put me on timeout because I peed my bed, and like put my bed sheets in my face and stuff and like like a dog basically and like i'm not a dog. And she's a nurse, and she she knew better so it's like."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you have a relationship with her do security speak to her."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah I see her, she lives, not that far away from me like 30 minutes I see or maybe once a week some sometimes a little less than that."
226.0,Provider,Are you in California.
15325.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,Do you have siblings.
15325.0,Patient,"yeah but a little brother he's my whole brother and then, I have a half brother that's 11 years older than me."
226.0,Provider,Are you guys close.
15325.0,Patient,"My half brother, we were pretty close because he was kind of like my dad when I was a kid even though he's a lot older than me he would like pick me up from school because my parents got divorced, when I was five. So he didn't like help out and then that he we haven't talked to each other, since I was 17 because he just kind of left and didn't want to talk to my mom you are either so. Just a lot of things happen to him his his dad ended up being a child molester so he his dad went to jail and then. My mom was a single mom and then my dad my dad and and being mentally ill and trying to kill himself, when I was five and that's why they got divorced so there's just a lot of trauma."
226.0,Provider,Do you have relationship with that.
15325.0,Patient,"um yeah I do have a relationship with my dad but not that it's he lives in Pennsylvania, he lives in Pittsburgh and. He calls me or maybe like once in a blue moon and we talked for five minutes he just asked me like how are you doing and I just say try to talk to them for real and tell them what's really happening and then he's like okay well I gotta go. Okay he's mentally ill, he has he is so effective. So yeah i've dealt with a lot of his problems to throughout my adulthood, and like had to help him out when he decides to. Go on a manic manic episode and not take his medication when before he was living in a nursing home, he would just be living with my grandma he had a car, he was able to drive and he would just decided to drive all the way from Pittsburgh to San Diego. In three days. And then come to gamble because he was addicted to gambling he didn't do drink alcohol or anything but his addiction was gambling. And then I just got out of the reason why I decided to seek out therapy is because I have insurance that covers that right now, and also because I just started during the pandemic, I was dating. An addict that really was addicted to alcohol and cocaine and it just brought up a lot of these traumas for me and feeling abandoned and not being cared about and ELISE things and like. I was doing a lot for him because I felt like I wanted to take care of him and help him like I was trying to help my dad."
226.0,Provider,"yep right So do you see the patterns that start that started in childhood, this is what many most people right the pattern start in childhood. And unless we break those patterns and cycles that continues into adulthood, and then it plays out in our relationships and our marriages in our jobs. You know just. In life in general, so it's really about, you know and you've already made that connection okay. No. He chose you chose a partner who was really. somebody who had to take care of like had to take care of your dad."
15325.0,Patient,"mm hmm yep pretty much. It felt like goes taking care of my dad and then. his appearance like changed so much over the year, the year that we were together and like he gained like 50 pounds from all the alcohol and stuff and he looks kinda looks like my dad. dad doesn't take care of himself either, and like it's really has a big belly and all these things and it's just like whoa."
226.0,Provider,"Probably not know so you know, the first step is to be able to identify that and then be able to start making different choices. So understanding those patterns and why you choose. Friends relationships jobs and then learning how to make different choices that are healthier for you, that aren't based on what you think other people need or want. So the focus has to come back to you. And sometimes that can be hard, because you feel like oh that's selfish you know i'm. guilty yeah yeah. But really it's it it's if you're not. If you're not solid and if you're not like if your own house your your internal house is not an order. and clean and taken care of then it's really hard. To go out into the world and create this life that you deserve and that you want. You know um you know it's just realizing that that you have to come first and that's not selfish that's just being really healthy."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I thought I when we broke up by like I was crying a lot every day and like really hard and then cry like that, for a long time, and it reminded me of when I was crying about my dad. going to Pittsburgh, because he lives in California and my grandma his mom came out to help with supervised visitation stuff because he had to have a supervised visitation when he. was watching us because he, like basically he left us in a hotel in Laguna beach he drove from San Diego to we're going to be with us and his car telling us he was going to get ice cream, but we never got any ice cream and then he left us he liked decided that he couldn't handle us. Maybe he's like trying to run away with I don't even know his thought process was at that point, but then he decided to go drive off a cliff and. The police came and picked us up and he didn't but my dad didn't die he, like was like like an angel save them somebody did I don't know but. He just broke his he, like punctured some of his ribs and broke his legs and then was in the hospital and had to get pins and stuff and his leg, so they get eventually walk again just like it would hurt him but um. yeah. He my mom didn't want him to be in our life at all. yeah dad was about to give her anything because he didn't care. And then my mom. My grandma my dad's mom came over and like fought for him and kept him in our life, basically, and was there for us i'm really close to her. With grandma and she's gonna be 99 years old this year."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, my God. wow. yeah so. um. Okay, all right so you've never really you've never dealt with like you've not had therapy in the past right."
15325.0,Patient,"My mom tried to get. us to go to therapy, when I was a kid because my dad when I was like going through puberty he kind of. went to his therapist that the va and told told them some stuff and then my mom or they told my mom because it was like he was having thoughts about like. Sexual things I guess or whatever, and then she was trying to get me to get therapy, but i'd never really. wanted to talk to them, because I felt like they were just trying to take my dad away, but I didn't feel safe for her house, because she was like abusive so. It was just kind of hard I just felt like I didn't feel safe anywhere, so I was like I don't want to have my dad taken away from me i'll just yeah and then I just I didn't feel like I could talk to that person just felt like they're trying to. get information for the Court or something."
226.0,Provider,"yeah right. Okay, so any."
15325.0,Patient,Have you.
226.0,Provider,had any suicide any suicidal thoughts.
15325.0,Patient,"suicidal it yeah. Yes, I have unfortunately."
226.0,Provider,And because I was a little kid probably like.
15325.0,Patient,"10 years old and I went to school for public health, so I know that suicide is like the number two cause of death between the ages 10 to 35. Because of all, a lot of the same things I went through."
226.0,Provider,This so when was the last time that you had suicidal ideation.
15325.0,Patient,"After my breakup with my boyfriend this year. And I. Have it a lot just because I. Because of everything that I dealt with, I just feel like. i'm always alone, and then to be alone and it kind of makes me depressed was."
226.0,Provider,"So when you have suicidal ideation do you have a plan, do you have an intention."
15325.0,Patient,"Now it's more of just like a thought that goes through my head and like a flash of something. something happening, but then i'm not planning is just like a thought and being like oh like what if I jumped off this cliff. or something like if I was walking around at the beach like it sounds like cliffs there's i'm just like thinking like oh my God, if I like just fell down this clip right now are like. jumped off, but then I wouldn't i'm not going to do it because I feel like it would be so painful. And if I don't die it's going to be worse, so in my diary have proved that with my dad."
226.0,Provider,"So, have you ever tried any suicide attempts to the bonds."
15325.0,Patient,"And when I was in. High School I did I miss my first after my first boyfriend broke up with me. I just was really not in a good place and then. felt like. No one's there for me and like that was my I felt like that was somebody I trusted I lost my virginity to him, he just decided to go. visit his family for Christmas and then. kiss some some girl that he dated there before and then come back and bring up with me and that really hurt my feelings a lot spell abandoned by him basically."
226.0,Provider,"When when you start when you attempted, it was hot What did you."
15325.0,Patient,I my dad had a bunch of ass so like I did plan that I had it in my. bag in my backpack and it was just some aspirin pills that my dad I just put like 50 of them in a bag and then I took them all.
226.0,Provider,yeah okay so right now low risk for suicide right no suicidal ideation.
15325.0,Patient,"Ever since then, and that. Like I took those pills at school, and then I walked home a couple miles, and I was at home and I tried to like throw up, but it was like an hour a couple hours later, and then definitely throw up some blood. And, and then tell my mom I just like kind of a sick for three days and had ringing in my ears and had to lay down and luckily didn't die. For us to do, and I want to tell her I tried to kill myself."
226.0,Provider,"So, are you working right now."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah I work at a Ariel gym right now, like actually it's been really been my saving grace because I. Just work out I my my. way of dealing with anxiety is working out a lot like a couple hours a day, or so I like to go on bike rides and i'll just wake up and go for like a 30 mile bike ride sometimes."
226.0,Provider,"that's that's really good like so the anxiety is like the energy you're getting that energy out of your body exercise is really good for managing anxiety managing depression and you know you're right, you said earlier. You know anxiety is about you're living in the future."
15325.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"And so you're always thinking about something that might happen that could happen oh my God, what if it does happen. And when you're in that state of mind your body's like on overload everything's like an overdrive right. yeah and and so. So the goal, you know, the goal is to be able to stay more in the present moment, and you know we'll talk about coping strategies for anxiety and what to do and how to ground yourself but. You know you're already working out you're going on, by grades like absolutely continue doing that kind of stuff um. yeah there's other grounding exercises there's meditation. exercises, you know."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah i've used to do when I was so that's The funny thing is like when I was a kid so I, the reason why I went to school for public health was actually because I could get a minor in holistic health and I wanted to. I took a lot of classes on my through my G classes, I took like a bunch of psychology classes, I took it abnormal psych class like a try to understand all my dad's. And like. Just try to heal myself and, but when I was a kid I would write in a journal I didn't meditate a lot like stop down my own. Ways of like healing and and trying to eat healthy and do all that."

And I wanted to help people because I didn't want you know I wanted to help people that were like me that went through a lot of dramatic stuff but. You probably know that it's really hard."
226.0,Provider,"To do that yeah it's. it's hard, I mean it's it you just have to be able to work your own stuff out first. You know, like it takes it takes some you know, like I said you got to have your own house in order. Before you can really be useful to other people and so. it's you know it's working through a lot of that the trauma discomfort and that resentment and confusion and."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah I agree, I went to Asia, luckily I went to Asia before coven happened I got laid off from my job I used to work in pharmacy from early age 18 till. 2018 like I had a few like when I was going to get my bachelor's degree, I took a few years off, but then I was trying to find a job in public and health, education and.

15325.0,Patient,"yeah I was working in a hospital and I was like, on the other side of pharmacy so instead of filling all the prescriptions and stuff in the pharmacy I was the one reviewing the medical charts for the doctors and like refilling the prescriptions. yeah you just staring at a computer all day and then having to read you know, end up all these charts and make sure like and then make sure they have all these labs done there's like specific protocol to follow, but. there's just a lot of like reading things and like kind of being like is it Okay, because it was hard, it was, like all the hartman's all the am side of you know all the really crazy things i'm like to make sure this is right. Again I didn't have I wasn't able to see my friends, because I had to wake up super early to get to work, and then I was really tired side and socialize that much when that happened, but then I got laid off, and I went to Asia, I decided to go backpacking in Asia, for six months."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, my God baby and like I did feel alone and kind of like helped me do a lot of things, because I was alone and."
15325.0,Patient,"The first time ever really being alone in another country all by myself and not knowing where I was going and just living day by day, trying to meet people, but sometimes I felt like a loner outsider because it's hard to make friends, sometimes and."
226.0,Provider,Wherever you go on Asia.
15325.0,Patient,I went to Thailand Cambodia. Malaysia Philippines and then I went to the Malaysia part of Borneo. And I went to Indonesia.

15325.0,Patient,"yeah it was really, really pretty and beautiful like I got I wanted to see a lot of the nature before it's gone and I went scuba diving a lot I got. 36 dives completed I got my advanced open water, because I already had my open water and. I was really focusing on like the ocean stuff and I might go like when I went there, my intention was to not use as much plastics I brought a lot of reusable things I have to contribute to that and, like just trying to. see all the cool stuff before it's gone basically or like hopefully I won't be gone like I want to go back and that that trip actually helped me. heal a lot of things, but then I think this relationship just opened a lot of the wounds again. But. I did kind of have like thoughts of suicide over there, my my thought was like i'll just travel until I spend all my money because I had a lot of money saved up and I was. kind of feeling alone because I felt like only two or three people in my life reached out to me when I was gone and it felt like."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15325.0,Patient,"Does anyone really care that i'm not there, or like does even think about me. That, I had a really great adventure and I I realized like I do need to follow my heart and take care of the ocean and go back to school for that. Because I thought about doing nursing, because my mom did nursing and I. You know my biggest worry is like being able to take care of myself and not have to rely on her anyone else. Yes, and I was thinking of doing nursing, but now like, I can make good money doing marine conservation and live in another country and just live abroad, which is my goal. Right want to live in and travel and."
226.0,Provider,"So, are you okay financially or you're having financial issues right now."
15325.0,Patient,"i'm okay financially like right now i'm i'm working part time, so my income is low, but I have a lot of money still saved up because I came back from Asia with like half of my money in my savings gone and luckily I had unemployment to was able to get that but. yeah it was like a blessing in disguise, because it happened for coven."
226.0,Provider,And I kidding I mean like. Do you need a lot of money to go do something like that or.
15325.0,Patient,"I know because I back I did the really cheap like I stayed in hostels I paid three to $10 a night for a dorm and then I really like all the cheaper food. Industry food I just ate vegetarian, I tried not to eat any meat. So thick that. The most expensive part was the diving. But even that was cheaper than diving here, and it was way more beautiful."
226.0,Provider,"There are straight fits together, though. Especially in Thailand right."
15325.0,Patient,"Oh yeah the street food was so good, I, like the best I felt so healthy eating and Indonesia and Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines and and Emily in Malaysia or kind of the food was like and they eat a lot of fried food and Philippines. And a lot of bread and then in Malaysia they eat a lot of noodles and meat but I. Just found like vegetarian places. or just would make by go the grocery store and get stuff."
226.0,Provider,yeah that's amazing trip and then I learned a lot about Buddhism.
15325.0,Patient,"And that, like, I really liked Buddhism, because it's not really believing in God and stuff it's more about believing in being a good person."
226.0,Provider,Right. So. good for you.
15325.0,Patient,Like the human suffering stuff and all that and the attachment.
226.0,Provider,"Step mm hmm. So I think you got a ton out of that trip, and I think you're better than you think you are."
15325.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah so you know, keep that in mind."
15325.0,Patient,That they gave me a lot of empowerment was like I can't believe I did that. And I drove scooters motorbikes and all that stuff. Now motorcycle scooter.
226.0,Provider,navigating all that traffic that's.
15325.0,Patient,"crazy yeah I guess i'm I would be really good at being a travel agent. Hours like trying to figure out how many to get to this place or make a mistake, what are we going to do."
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely. So, like right now, do you have friends that you do things with."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah I do have a lot of friends, they do things with um I just felt kind of isolated with my my ex because. He would say that he would want to go do something out and make plans with my friends and then that day would come and he would be hung over and then via all like. Not wanting to do it, and then I would just feel like I didn't want to go do it anymore, because you know, I was all excited about going with them and inviting having him make friends, because he just moved down here from the bay. So I but that now, I do things with my friends."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what part of California, are you in."
15325.0,Patient,"San Diego. So i'm outside a lot. i've been trying to just make new groups like I do do a lot of things my own and then. I just found some groups on instagram there's like a light up bike group that meets up every Saturday night and bikes around at night it's like a bike parade. silly for fun. Doing an aerial gym. And then that's where I work, so I get free training, which is nice."
226.0,Provider,"Alright, so you're doing what you need to do like honestly you really are, I think I think I think a lot of this like what our work can be around here is just you know working through some of these traumas that you had and sometimes it's just like talking about it that. Really says it. You know. The thing with trauma, is that you have to be ready to talk about it. You got a tram pace, and you know you talk about what you feel would be really helpful to discuss things that you just want to no longer hold on to. resentments that you don't no longer want to hold on to. You know you have a full life, you know you know how to. You know how to keep yourself engaged. Are you are you on any medications didn't ask him."
15325.0,Patient,anything.
226.0,Provider,"And are you going, are you wanting any medications."
15325.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm not sure, because I worked in pharmacy for so long, sound like cave and make myself. Take a little. Even when I had to take when I was taking birth controls like hard to make myself do it, so now, I have an ID. But. If there is like a natural inside each thing I can take."
226.0,Provider,"So here's the deal is like I think what we should work on is just some things that you can do like I said some coping strategies to address the anxiety. that's always the best place to start you know. yeah and then, if people feel like they need to have something like a you know prn or you know they can do it that way um but yeah I think the best way to always start is not. yeah. You know, trying to learn how to manage it without any."
15325.0,Patient,I just noticed like when I. I get like anxious thoughts are like. I start going down these rabbit hole thoughts is like when i'm.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15325.0,Patient,So it's ideal to get snap out of that faster.
226.0,Provider,than like.
15325.0,Patient,"I just started dating someone again like a new person that I just met recently through friends and. i'm really happy with like he's the best person i've ever dated and he's like. pretty much the universe everything i've asked the universe, for an a partner and he's like given to me, but now i'm having all these. Like I have a really good time with them and i'll be really happy and then, like the other day it's been like a few days since we've seen each other really see each other in the weekend, but. I just like started having these anxious thoughts of like Does he really want to be with me like I mean I don't know just. I always do that and I just feel like Am I evil should I even be in a relationship."
226.0,Provider,"So when you get those kind of thoughts it's like. yeah ask yourself is this based in reality. Is this real. Or is this something that i'm thinking up in my mind. Is this reality based, and you know it's not reality based so you say okay i'm stopping with that thought and i'm replacing that plot with something that's much more positive and productive. So it's like this thought stopping technique so it's like every time you get a negative thought you replace it with something positive."
15325.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm trying to do like sometimes i'm like Okay, how can you say a positive thing, instead of like all these negative things because. Even when i'm. Looking at myself in the mirror i'm always like it's more negative when I was a chubby kid too, so it doesn't help, so I feel like my self image body image has always been skewed. But yeah it's always like that criticism."
226.0,Provider,Right that's how.
15325.0,Patient,You start being more positive like oh you look good today like you.
226.0,Provider,"Right exactly so here's the thing it's like for every negative for every negative comment that you say to yourself. It takes 10 positive comments X out that one negative. So if you're going about your day and you're saying five negative things about yourself, you got to come up with 50. You see, the numbers here like. up right so. For being really mindful of like what you're thinking and how you're thinking about yourself."
15325.0,Patient,yeah definitely yeah you still like try to write when I had mirrors on my closets I had a dry erase marker know just be like right positive things to myself so see it.
226.0,Provider,"Such a great idea, so you know now just focus on doing it like in in your mind. When you get that negative thought then you immediately. And then you replace it with something positive."
15325.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, also. Positive affirmations are really good."
15325.0,Patient,Like meditation when you're meditating like. Staying on things in your head and kind of yet.
226.0,Provider,"or just saying them throughout the day. Like you know. i'm more than enough time beautiful I love myself. i'm competent. You know i'm worthy i'm lovable you know those things Okay, and just keeps and that's actually how you can when you get that negative thought you just replace it with something like i'm lovable beautiful i'm are they. yeah, then you know, because you want to start actually believing it. You know it's not that you want to believe it because it's a lie."
15325.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,it's like you believe it because it's it's absolutely true. And you absolutely deserve to have. A life that you want to have. So it's just you know and that's some stuff that we can continue to talk about and.
15325.0,Patient,"stuff that we can work on. yeah I found this girl that that does my friend actually my my best friend, said to me, because she bought she's also getting therapy, because she had a lot of dramatic stuff with her step mom kind of similar to my my mom stuff so. She like. gave me access to this person's program but it's like this girl that does tapping."
226.0,Provider,On yeah right.
15325.0,Patient,Like saying those things yourself and like tapping all the pressure points.
226.0,Provider,For those are really powerful too.
15325.0,Patient,mm hmm that's how my he realized that.
