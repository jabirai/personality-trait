So you would know what to expect so one of the cover is questions, based on biological history so like medical concerns medical history yours and immediate family. On some psychological questions so mental health concerns if you have any kind of diagnosis is anything that might run in your family and then. Social settings so educational history economical history support systems friends peers co workers stuff of that nature and the idea is that once the assessments done. A a qualified practitioner could read it, not having met you or even conducted the assessment could develop a treatment plan and some goals for you, based on what you reported, so it paints like an overall picture what's going on with you."

15251.0,Patient,"Currently. have been an issue with drinking, probably in the past year. More well, a lot more so than than. Probably in the past 10 years I used to drink pretty heavily when I was younger. And I sobered up on my own. And that was kind of when when I started going to church and my it kind of took me that way. And just recently it's been. Pretty pretty stressful since I opened up our brand new shop and it's just not something basically it's a family run business and it isn't really something that. I really wanted to ever do I didn't really want to have multiple stores open I came from a corporate background. I ran away from that for a reason because I didn't like the way corporation drams so I joined this family thing and then it starting to turn into a corporate thing and. that's kind of that on top of, of course, everything that's going on right now socially very social person and i've been able to meet family and friends and stuff like that kind of stress me out so. So I recently got. started drinking, even at work day drinking and then. The last time this happened, which was the seventh of the month. me my wife kind of had it out, and I even had it out with some people at work, about it because I was kind of just tired of it all and just kind of let it all out kind of thing and. After that my wife and I sat down and talked about it and. She wasn't she was like done with it, she said, look we can't keep doing this because you know we go through this process with this work and either leave the job or. We split up or we're not doing this, our kind of thing, so I we sat down and talked about it and we said we would do something new, and this is something new. something different, you know something that will be helpful outside of being our own inside influence, and so we figure we're going to do this or. that the difference is we're probably going to split up so and that's the reality for us in a calm. conversation is this, we need to do something to. I guess to face whatever whatever's going on right now working so, fortunately, for me, my works paying for all this i've been off since the seventh. Okay, to sign up for this and to take some time off with my wife and stuff like that stuff currently just working on my marriage really to be honest with you and that's the reason why i'm not at back at work and everyone's okay with that I work so."

15251.0,Patient,I think I did the first yeah the probably the first day when I was detox and I had a little bit for sure okay.
724.0,Provider,"Just just for like a. Like a superficial education. detoxing or cold Turkey alcohol very, very dangerous like very dangerous. One should never do that without medical interventions, especially if your body has a chemical dependency on it and i'm not sure if you did or not typically would would would would would with withdrawal symptoms of. That means that your body does have a chemical dependency on it, meaning that it relies on it to function, to a certain degree, whether or not it's an extreme. adverse side effects from the withdrawal or it's minimal there's still something there if you had like. Really really bad withdrawals I would always like encourage you in the future if you ever did fall back into it. That cold, Turkey is not the safe bet for alcohol detox you really need to have medical intervention because there's a risk for seizures. And with seizures comes falling with fallen comes hitting your head on objects and then blackouts all that kind of stuff I work in the er and I lost a lot of patients. That were chemically dependent and they would start systematically coming in with more bruising on their faces. And you're just like hey man like things aren't like whatever you're trying to do you're not staying on top of it, or you need to go to a detox they would refuse detox go home drink again. blackout fall I had people fall hit their head and then they'd find them days later, you know what I mean so. it's very, very risky to cold Turkey alcohol detox that's for sure so just keep that in the back of your head. Okay, medical interventions, the best way. Because they can manage your symptoms in a safe setting and medicaid shoe and keep the heart rate down keep the tremors down all the restlessness and keep everything like at bay and then be able to monitor you for like a 48 hour period. um. Any any history of blackouts."
15251.0,Patient,"from drinking. If there was any heavy drinking yeah yeah. it's probably less than 10 times over my lifetime, but yes i've done extreme drinking, yes, and what that means for me was drinking a handle 1.75 handled in the past haven't done that for probably I don't know 20 years."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, have any history of false while you're drunk."
15251.0,Patient,"Oh, I follow him a couple times oh for sure around family oh yeah okay."
724.0,Provider,Any of those balls are like resulting in like a head injury that required medical intervention.
15251.0,Patient,"No, no."
724.0,Provider,um. Any history of overdose. And what is the longest period of sobriety that you had.
15251.0,Patient,It was. Some we're looking at about close to nine years.
724.0,Provider,A long time man.
15251.0,Patient,"No, no."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you definitely have it in here like you got the ability okay. So the next section is going to be about medical stuff. So what we're looking for is. history of seizures history of heart attacks high blood pressure, diabetes, any kind of medical condition that you've been diagnosed with. In the past, or you are still dealing with today."
15251.0,Patient,"In the past, a lot of my weight, I guess, I was pretty overweight, probably borderline obese caused a lot of issues, my doctor said I had I did have high blood pressure didn't have diabetes, but I was borderline there was a probably like a warrior period, what else like 240 pounds. Good and so I lost all that weight and just I think just under 200 pounds, but since then I haven't had any actual health issues since then."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, good do you take any medications currently."
15251.0,Patient,No nothing.
724.0,Provider,What about like over the counter stuff tylenol advil multivitamins melatonin stuff of that nature.
15251.0,Patient,"I take a multivitamin for men sunday's jellies that we take in the morning but i've taken some might be prepping once in a while the line of work, I do is all physical. Right, so you know every once in a while my back's really hurt and then I might take some ibuprofen before making a long trip and in our truck So if I have anything over eight hours sitting in a vehicle will probably take some ibuprofen for my back."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, that seems reasonable okay um any medication allergies."
15251.0,Patient,"No, no."
724.0,Provider,What about like environmental allergies bee stings. Holland anything like that.
15251.0,Patient,"I have, I get hay fever everyone's like every couple of years, for some reason i'll have allergies one year and then a couple of years, I will have zero allergies to grass or anything you know just it just kind of. it's once in a while I just attach it to the to the way I eat my diet, if I eat a lot of local stuff fruit, vegetables and stuff like that don't seem to have any allergies, but. Also i'm good periods not eating local stuff i'll eat local honey. And the local Poland and stuff like that hope."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah they say, like a. Like a that does help it like seasonal stuff especially like if you if you eat local and. All that kind of stuff makes sense, you know what I mean like if you live in an environment and you're not eating from that environment, you know you'll be sensitive to things, but if you are eating with within the environment, you would definitely benefit. See the honey thing is like like a big thing that i've heard like fairly recently in the past, like several years, people like yeah if you eat local honey you like your seasonal allergies kind of like diminish a lot i'm like seems interesting. But if you get they sell bottles of local."
15251.0,Patient,"pollen like they come in little balls actual pollen itself it's literally all condensed and if your throat is even itching. on the spot, as soon as you eat it it goes away immediately like immediately i'm not kidding so it's just so expensive, so you can you know I don't have that kind of money to throw around all the time, but. My allergies are really bad i'll go buy local Paul and at the local market and its immediate I know i'm talking about within a minute or two."
724.0,Provider,"Like how expensive, what are we talking about like."
15251.0,Patient,"You know, it could be 6080 bucks it depends on the person who's selling it, you know. It really does, but I mean it's worth it, if it's hurt me it's my glands will swell up and i'll start getting he throat. He is in. it'll go away like almost instantly it's kind of it's kind of crazy."
724.0,Provider,yeah I wonder if you could just curate it yourself like if they're like already absolutely need bees and stuff you know.
15251.0,Patient,"yeah you need bombs actually yeah my wife's cousin actually grows, he has bees and they do that, but they only make enough for their families, so. So I just word of mouth, I tried it and i'm like Okay, it does work it's just hard to get it, you know."
724.0,Provider,yeah okay interesting because then they'll have any any hospitalizations overnight stays in er or surgeries in the past.
15251.0,Patient,"yeah I broke my leg. When I was probably 25 or 26 playing in a semi pro basketball League and my leg up broke it my family and my turbulence, so I had to have surgery on my legs So yes, I had to spend a night for that."
724.0,Provider,Okay um but no hospitals hospitalizations related to alcohol use or anything like that.
15251.0,Patient,Oh no no okay all right.
724.0,Provider,um any issues with activities of daily living like you can care for yourself hygiene grooming eating.
15251.0,Patient,"eating. Up no issues, oh no i'm fine yeah."
724.0,Provider,"All right, and do you have any use of like assistive devices. crutches canes I see you got glasses on those for reading or for this since."
15251.0,Patient,it's for distance so.
724.0,Provider,The next section is going to be about mental health so have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health concerns such as Depression and anxiety ADHD ptsd.
15251.0,Patient,"No, no."
724.0,Provider,Any history of medical concerns within your family.
15251.0,Patient,No. No none of my family.
724.0,Provider,"And i'll double back to the previous section any any any medical history in your family that runs significant heart disease, cancer, diabetes."
15251.0,Patient,"I think cancer is prevalent in the women are our family for sure, almost every one of them has had cervical cancer."
724.0,Provider,Oh wow okay. yeah that's unfortunate.
15251.0,Patient,"yeah yeah actually one of my sisters, is going through some of it right now but definitely all my aunts have had have had it and my mother and we just went through it last year, and my grandmother for sure. and her mother died. and great grandmother died of breast cancer wow."
724.0,Provider,"I guess on the. flip side of the coin early intervention, now that they're you know they're aware of how strong, it is in your family early inventions key so at least there it's sitting somewhere in the back of their their real estate for their brain. And it might prompt people to act sooner than later, so it's good. it's a crappy situation to have but. I guess know beforehand kind of preps you a little bit. i'm. covered there. Any history of self harm suicidal thoughts ideations attempts."
15251.0,Patient,know.
724.0,Provider,What about your family any history of that.
15251.0,Patient,"No, no, not at all okay."
724.0,Provider,"And in the last 30 days, no thoughts of cell phone. Any any history of trauma. Physical abuse emotional abuse, sexual abuse, anything like that."
15251.0,Patient,"Oh yeah when I was growing up, I was physically abused for my stepfather."
724.0,Provider,And how long did that go on for.
15251.0,Patient,"So. I think probably when I turned a team 13 or 14 I actually remember standing up to him about it and then. That kind of ended after that so probably. Were with him since as far as I can remember, since I was little I mean I can maybe four or five years old, all the way tells probably 13. And I think finally. Mother finally had the. Police intervene with that so yeah I think it's all about, I was in my early teens either that kind of ended yeah."
724.0,Provider,"it's a it's an unfortunate thing to experience, but the moment when it stops like the empowerment that you get, especially when you stand up to the to the person. it's life changing."
15251.0,Patient,yeah yeah it was that point yeah it was a normal thing you know. People don't understand that they think went into. that's that was life so. there's no way of knowing what else was different so.
724.0,Provider,"I knew was a was a victim of physical abuse like as a kid and I remember, like the the one day that it stopped you know my a. You know full self disclosure like like my mom was young, when she had my brother and I so like I gave her a pass now in front of me because it's like. Like I don't know what I would do if I was a teenager trying to raise two kids probably a lot different in hindsight, you know what I mean but. When I got taller than her, I really liked the last night that she punched me in my face and I just looked at ours, like we're not going to do that anymore and it's not I mean like it was that was it's it's a pretty surreal moment to have so. sorry that you had to experience it but i'm glad that you uh you overcame it it's important for development. Right um. How do you feel currently with your ability to not relapse like what do you think are some barriers that might stop you from. Remaining sober that needed to be like that needs to be addressed so already we know, like the worst thing is a major trigger for you. Is there anything else that might just be like give you the effort and then want to start drinking again."
15251.0,Patient,"Not not really right now I mean that's, the main thing that's kind of. has been adding to this and it's a reason why i'm been sitting down and i've been meeting with with them on a weekly basis, talking about. What we're thinking i've been spending a lot of time myself in praying about it and looking at it in my word about whether or not I should even stay there anymore. And i've even talked to him about the philosophy we have a difference of philosophy about you know building this. empire, or whatever the way I explained it to them versus just I was just i'm just here to be with the guys and to have a relationship with these guys and just live like that i'm not looking to. You know, build something you know, to the point where it's like more money more money more money you know kind of thing it's. Just not my thing."
724.0,Provider,you're not motivated by the by the financial gains but.
15251.0,Patient,"i'm, not because I left I left financial gains for that place you know I left because I saw that they needed help, I made a lot of money when I was young, and I worked for the second. second biggest construction management company in the world, there was no reason for me to leave. Something that I was managing almost a billion dollars a year, you know what i'm saying there was no reason for me to leave I left because I saw someone needed help. And it was family, and I was like i'm going to go help these guys, so I mean I went back then, when I was when I left, I was making like $29 an hour. That was a long time ago, and then I went down to go work for them and we're looking to get paid sometimes because the work was so hard, but I found I found something in that you know for myself. And it was. yeah yeah I loved it, I mean I love to be able to help and didn't matter to me whether we suffered money was it to me, it was the satisfaction of being able to help you know people was what I was kind of into it for so we're kind of get to a point where. We we've lost we had for owners, we lost two in the past two years to crazy circumstances. And the the fire in Paradise devastated our family to all that stuff kind of all happened within a three week period. And then from there, the philosophy has changed and that's that's what i'm trying to address right now. And I know they don't see it, but for me it's like no, you know I can't do this if we're trying to. What try to save a bunch of money, trying to make a 401k I don't care about any stuff I did would have never left the company, I was with I was plenty happy with it, you know where I was working was it was fine you know but. This was more satisfying and it still is there's what you guys are begging me text me all the time to come back, but I have to find what I need to do in my life. To better my family here at home because I can't i'm not going back to what just happened i'm not I mean I already know that it's like we can't I can't go back it's like we go back to that and my family's kind of done for and i'm not going to have that."
724.0,Provider,"Now, though, so you're already you're already out the door on this job."
15251.0,Patient,"i'm kind of the door, unless you know, unless there's some serious changes going to happen, I don't know if they're going to do that or not they might just tell me what i'm going to make changes for you. And I understand that, but I won't i'm not going to leave begrudgingly i'm going to make sure i'm not making a case it's like this is where i'm at this is the things that need to happen for my family. And, and for the rest of the guys but that's just my viewpoint, so that doesn't work, you know i'm no longer focusing on making money because that's the focus for my job, obviously. My job is to make these stores that make a bunch of money and put put guys in position to do that. I don't that takes away from everything else in my life so that's one of the problems I told him I said this takes up almost all my time I have no time for anybody else. And just being off these couple of weeks i've had time for people in my family I haven't had time for new years like I mean i've been. helping people with stuff working on cars are helping go i'm a big automobile car guy I like to work on cars, like to help people the cars so. i've done that, for two weeks and realizing going hey man, this is part of why I came over here this life was simple and I can still help people and my family, and in my church and i've been doing that for like two weeks going, this is what I remember why I came here. To be able to help people and I haven't been able to do that because i'm always. i'm always either traveling looking for new accounts for traveling to get tires or this or that but i'm basically in charge of this this big old company that I just. I don't care about like that you know so that's what i've been trying to tell them it's going to do if you bring me back you're not going to have that focus for me anymore, because I need to focus on my my actual family right."
724.0,Provider,"That seems reasonable yep seems reasonable and you probably have the the resume that would afford you the luxury of shopping around to for employment, if need be."
15251.0,Patient,"yeah and that's one of the things that you know I talked about I don't want to just go get another job I just don't i'm not getting into this anymore, this kind of work. i'm going to go do something that's going to be something that I can get my I can work not sit at a desk move around work. and have time to think about the things that are important to me and not worry about what the job is so for me a simple thing is go be a mail carrier, you know, the post office that kind of work like go work but not going to stress over the work."
724.0,Provider,"yeah but you're totally employable like at whatever position you're looking for you know what I mean so and you've got like a good outlook on it, so you know you're hiring so having like she's been having like the weight. of being like I bought some people who would be stressed out by the idea, but like I don't know if I can go back to work, but I need the job you know what I mean. So much of our life is is centered around like the employment aspect to keep everything else somewhat stable, whereas with you. Your family of what your stability is so you could find some some blow off job like you said, probably pretty easy it's still be happy and then that would afford you to keep disability, with the family. So yeah I mean you're already you're already halfway out, you know what I mean like you're going to. ready to admit it now you got loyalty to your co workers and your peers and all that kind of stuff, but I doubt very much that. When it comes to corporations and corporate greed like once they're on that path, like that buddy path it's hard to it's hard to steer away. People from that that agenda and it's sad, you know what I mean like, especially when when mom and pop stores are like what's unique about mom and pop stores is like the experience that you get from people you know. it's like going to restaurants, like like I lived in Florida for like 15 years and i'm from the Northeast so in the northeast like. Food is like synonymous up here mom and pop pizza joints Italian restaurants, you like get quality food when i'm with the Florida was like if I want to quality Italian you know it was like olive garden. And i'm thinking nothing unique about going to all of God, and I could go to olive garden in this state or go to the olive garden is the next state over and the experience is going to be the same, I was like it's. it's it's very bland like everything about that, like that that corporate world culture were and then there's so many of them that, like mom and POPs can't survive, so you can open up like a good Italian restaurant. You know and run like a tight operation, when you got five armed guards that are just crushing you, you know with volume so it's like that's why it's important to have like the mom and pop shops and people get greedy. it's unfortunate."
15251.0,Patient,"yeah and that's the very the very thing that they can't see so when you're in the middle of that greed or thing that you think you're right about. Well, you don't even see it you open up another store i've been trying to tell them you're splitting up the guys that are related right here and put some over here and you're just diluting."
724.0,Provider,The.
15251.0,Patient,"ball actually the quality of the when people come in here and you're going to keep doing that, until until what your mind is you know. Exactly so but there's no seem that, because the only the bottom dollars all the. Matters well, they would be happy with becoming by this yep."
724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah go like yeah. yeah it's. yeah I will say that it's always bound to happen when people to come into like like positions of power and then there's money attached to it it's. that's the that's the evil thing about capitalism, you know the cool thing about capitalism is that, like you're. You can work and earn as much as you want or desire or capable of doing, which is cool so like the the challenge exists and you're afforded that the downside of capitalism is that it it'll eat you up like that that motivation will just destroy your moral compass."
15251.0,Patient,So.
724.0,Provider,"it's a catch 22 it always is um so you got a good support network at home and you go to church, so your peer group is made up of friends family churchgoers good um any legal issues outside of the one time, when you were 20."
15251.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"All right, well that's pretty much the assessment of as it stands. We covered all that stuff. The next thing will happen is. i'll schedule up a follow up appointment with me, you have you been assigned, like any groups, yet, so what they do here bright heart is like you'll attend like weekly group so plug you in like a. group model and then you'll see individual therapy or individual therapists likely me a couple of times a month for. Like real, specific issues that need to be addressed the group therapy ball was so you can interact with people get different perspective share your experiences have you ever been to a or anything like that in the past."
15251.0,Patient,"I haven't I haven't um but Yesterday I was in a group group one with Cassandra Cassandra from Rhode island. it's said i'm assigned to you for the group, but for some reason I got put in."
724.0,Provider,"yep yeah and they do that it gives you like, like some different looks she's really good I know her so. yeah we're from the from the same state, so we work together."
15251.0,Patient,"Okay cool. yeah we did that yesterday, so it says it is weekly yeah. So that's as far as I know, is I just wait for Rana send me the links to which is my coordinator yeah send me the links to what I need to do next, so as far as I know, is just every Wednesday at 4:30pm."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so that that's the group and then i'll schedule a i'll schedule a individual session with me. Probably about two weeks out that's typically how we do it. So i'll do that, right now, so then you'll know that and then the other thing is like surveys you going to do weekly surveys, they tell you to do them before the group."
15251.0,Patient,So before you.
724.0,Provider,"Say group, but I, I encourage people to get them done like you know Sunday night before the upcoming week so treat it like homework, so you don't have to worry about you know whether or not you got it done right before group or. gives a doctor's time to read this stuff because what happens sometimes is like a you know clients will go into a group and say everything is hunky dory. And then we'll be like okay cool you know it takes up at face value, because I don't you know, through the camera it's like hard to tell people's mannerisms or if they're withholding or lying or whatever. And then i'm from like the school of thought, where it's like I don't have time to know if you're trying to manipulate the treatment, one way or the other, so. When it comes to like bullshitting it's like like I don't have time for that, because at the end of the day, treatment is like you. it's the individuals treatment so it's like like don't bullshit me because you're just bullshitting yourself it's like like come here speak your mind. You know, get the things that are like on your chest off your chest, so you can you can be free of the like the pressure or whatever it is like like that's how we can get to like the root of the problem. So people will come in the group and be like not everything's perfect and then they'll read the surveys and the surveys, are all self reported. And we find out that they're super depressed or they're really anxious and you're like Oh well, that's not what they're saying and groups and i'm confused. So that they're important, so I just tell people that they get a dog like earlier so everybody can read up before the group right. So that's that so today is Thursday. So we'll shoot for. October 7. Is a Thursday."
15251.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,What time is good for you.
15251.0,Patient,"So early early is fine, the earlier, the better is finding me."
724.0,Provider,"Earlier, is the better Okay, so what time is it there right now."
15251.0,Patient,We started at eight here you're in three hours. 11 right.
724.0,Provider,So let's let's shoot for like 815.
15251.0,Patient,yeah that works for me.
724.0,Provider,"Thursday October seven. alright. If you have any questions or concerns with. The program or just about anything you're carrying have or the the virtual clinic those going to be like your point of contact so. reach out to them and be like hey I got a question about xyz and they'll form you out to or they'll answer the question for you, but if they can't deal for me to the to the people that can so that that's like your home base the virtual clinic is. OK, and then with the survey email, which you probably have gotten already like bookmark that email because that'll be the same link that you always go to from what i'm told. To do the surveys before your groups so keep that stash someplace start liking your email and then just go there and that'll be where you'll input, the data and and submit their OK."
15251.0,Patient,"OK, well, the only email I got about surveys were like they were broken down by serving. I didn't get like a home base link I got this is survey, you know one, two and three click on these links to go to those surveys."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's the one so you're going to save that you're going to start at. Okay yeah keep that email, because those are the surveys that have probably been assigned to you, and what you're looking for something called the band seven and the seven is. For sure do weekly because the seven day thing is seven days right so it's like."
15251.0,Patient,Oh gotcha gotcha. I was wondering what those acronyms or.
724.0,Provider,"yeah the php nine is a depressed mood survey and there's nine questions the gad seven survey is general anxiety disorder survey and there's seven questions attached to that one. Those are the three most common ones that you'll see. And then quarterly you'll see a patient satisfaction survey which they will likely email to you, and just as a reminder, because it is every 90 days. they'd be like hey make sure you fill this out and you probably had a couple other ones that you had to fill out initially, but you only have to do those on your initial intake but the three big ones I see them most is the band seven which is like the basic addiction. something and then yeah basic brief brief addiction, monitor and then the general anxiety one is the depressed mood one. Those are the those are the big three. So just complete those. It also. They also use the surveys, because state and federal regulations require us to prove. measurable outcomes for patients and surveys are one way that we could actually measure, especially if you're doing every week and it's like if your numbers going up or if they're going down or if they're maintaining that's one way if we ever got audited by. The State or the feds came in and they were like show us how you know shows how Mrs Morales, is doing and we're like well and his. Group and his individual sessions, you know he self reporting progresses toxicology screens look good you know he's not positive for. You know he's not lighting up like a Christmas tree for everything you know, things are looking good they're like all right cool how's he doing though it's like I just told him that. You know so, then we would provide the surveys and because that they're all self reporting it's all what you're saying how you feel like Okay, it looks like his depression is going down over the past six months it's. measurable decline and the pressure, like the press moves but alright cool Thank you so whatever you guys are talking about any group therapy sessions or individual sessions appear to be working so that's what they're looking for so. Just do surveys that make. For busy work to keep people annoyed or anything like that it's like a real place. Sometimes it is hard for people to understand that it's like this is like a nationwide organization so it's like what they do in California. is probably similar to what they do in Rhode island, but then sub so like when it came to like a one example, like methadone treatment programs the feds have a bad date. State can add to that mandate, but they can never take away from that mandate so some states are like always we're going to do it better than New York we're going to add extra steps like into this stuff but they could never. They can never go underneath the federal mandate so then it's like we would give people take home, so they were clean and sober for like 90 days you get one taiko so you don't have to come here every day, but if they are positive for weed. At the state level it's legal at the federal level it's illegal thought, while you fail the drug screen, you know what I mean so it's like. All this creams of these loopholes that that we have to manage and work with. So again, the surveys, or what a way that we can we can prove progress or lack thereof so they're up there, important. Right now. So any other questions or concerns."
15251.0,Patient,"No, no that's it, I appreciate your time."
724.0,Provider,"yeah man was nice to meet you and it sounds like you've got like the right motivating factors and your heart is in the right place and it's just a matter of have. Some internal struggle that you still have you committed to your family, obviously, but you're also committed to your other family too, and you have some internal struggles there that will have to. start developing is appropriate coping strategies at that using alcohol boycotted just check out of the issue, because that's you know. By and large humans when it comes to like stress management, sometimes when it becomes too much we just don't want to deal with it, and he uses check out his drugs and alcohol so. We just have to develop some other strategies start letting things go and then accepting the you know the fallout and then have the manage those feelings over a period of time alright."
15251.0,Patient,Okay alright thanks man.
724.0,Provider,"sounds good, I hopefully I won't be so congested next time we talk."
15251.0,Patient,alright.
