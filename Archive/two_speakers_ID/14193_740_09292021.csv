740.0,Provider,"You can you just haven't had you know, have the confidence to get it. So. mom mom passed. Which realize it your last support system that you hated because the same disease, when I read that you don't have any framing."
14193.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"Now, who was a man in your call."
14193.0,Patient,"Oh, he wants to be my boyfriend. it's not gonna happen i'm not attractive. But."
740.0,Provider,We. might even be good enough to be afraid.
14193.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah I mean he's a. You know he has issues that he's not dealing with and it irritates me but. Maybe, because I have issues that i'm not dealing with."
740.0,Provider,"Or maybe I have family issues and. Sometimes you can see yourself in another person, based on their issue. And then it. saves you because you see yourself. See yourself to somebody else issues. If possible. So we have there, we have the job. Even though you making really good money you have awesome benefits and after the thing i'm sure you retired from it that they gave you, but we have there, we have the job, and then we have grief mom lift."
14193.0,Patient,mantises.
740.0,Provider,About so that means now i'll have. you're missing the person that you connected to for the past basically your whole life vision mumble. So this very his dad said alive or.
14193.0,Patient,No he died 20 years ago.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so most parents are gone. Do you have any contact with us easily."
14193.0,Patient,yeah I talked to my sister today I don't fully trust her though she's she can be emotionally abusive. And I. You know I don't stand up for myself and that's another. thing that I hate about myself.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so she me emotionally abusive you don't have any boundaries with her."
14193.0,Patient,have good boundaries now.
740.0,Provider,"it's Okay, we could be what it is, oh shoot don't shoot for it don't do free. St. So. I want to do this would you first not talk about it because I read somewhere no not somewhere, I read your thing that you did you. win as well coping skills you're using you as I don't know so I need you to know which means there's a list, something that we're going to discuss because I need you know what coping skills are available. And what our options to you outside of taking the guy that you don't like to work. And then going to a job that you don't like and bessie."
14193.0,Patient,Very well just try to keep my head up I try to maintain a positive attitude.
740.0,Provider,"When that's not working, because you're not on."
14193.0,Patient,My i'm just. Eating i'm just I don't know what i'm doing.
740.0,Provider,"Let me take some measures and i'm beyond which and now i'm not gonna be your therapy that you had from from from the other time I can't compare i'm sure she follows with the best of the best I can pay them to do the best that I can. One thing I one thing I will say, is it is very, very difficult to keep up to space to try to maintain positivity when your thought process and your perspective is so negative. So. You can't you can't keep a positive outlook on something well you don't possess a positive perception of yourself does that make sense."
14193.0,Patient,I didn't get that.
740.0,Provider,You said you said in regards to you try to keep a positive outlook or try to stay positive. But when I think that you struggle with the most. Is your negative thinking.
14193.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,So it's hard to be positive. When he basically your your your dominant thought process is negative.
14193.0,Patient,yeah sometimes I really feel like i'm de compensating. You know.
740.0,Provider,"How So how could, how do you feel like what was going on with how you feel you do today."
14193.0,Patient,And just kind of losing it.
740.0,Provider,Okay.
14193.0,Patient,"That um. You know I want to call in sick and I don't have any sick time. hmm and. I need. I feel like I need a job that I can use my brain with instead of just be mindless, which is the work that i'm doing is totally mindless."
740.0,Provider,So if you had an ideal job. What would their job be.
14193.0,Patient,"Well, I could be an assistant pretty well but i'm kind of growing out of that now finally now that i'm almost 60. um. I don't mind working hard of mine staying busy. You know i'd worked for the dmv I don't care, I mean my whole idea, the whole plan for me was I was because I got a house in Tennessee. Because it's. So cheap, you know I grew up out here, where it's very expensive, so my whole plan was to. come out here, take care of mom and when she passed and go back to Tennessee transfer back to the costco and Tennessee. But why would I want to do that when I hate my job. and You know is that I mean it's not really realistic."
740.0,Provider,You have more frame and more support in Tennessee.
14193.0,Patient,"I have a little bit not really I mean some of those friends are not really good friends are kind of crazy. stuff so I need to tap into them more at least by phone. So, instead of just like living in my head, I actually live outside. You know. that's the problem with isolation."
740.0,Provider,"So you're in California now right. So who outside of the frame that you currently have right now, who else do you have as a supporting California, do you talk to any of your co workers at. Work do you have a relationship with them."
14193.0,Patient,"They don't. there's one that I might move into her apartment she's vacating so I might move in with her roommate whom I met a couple of times. and well, the plan is i'm going to do that, I just have to because I wasn't happy, where I am now, although it seems to have gotten better recently the matriarch the woman who rents, the rooms, and I mean there's nine people in a four bedroom apartment. I mean wow. Which is okay because it's a nice distraction for me and three of the people are children ages eight six and four so that's nice to have kids around. Have that kid energy. That doesn't bother me, but I feel like I feel. Well, you know the the owner of the House she's she was. She she wouldn't turn on the AC because it was costing too much, and she was in a bad mood and when I asked her. She was just she kind of yelled at me, so I just threw up my hands and walked out and then. Another time I was going to do laundry and she said, I can do laundry day because their bills were too high and the water was too expensive, I have to go to a laundromat if I don't like it, I couldn't move. So I started looking for a new place. And I think I found one, but now she's been really nice to me so i'm concerned about approaching her and telling her, I found another place, and that was going to do it when I paid rent on the first. To give her 30 days. hmm she she's been really nice to me lately. I think she thinks I wasn't giving her enough respect like I was treating her as an equal, but so I started doing the sickly sweet thing, like her grandkids do to her, and you know say good morning how are you so good to see you on that shit that I hate. And she seemed like that respond well to it. So it's kind of manipulative but."
740.0,Provider,So pay your first month's rent let her know that you're leaving.
14193.0,Patient,yeah it's like how do I tell her.
740.0,Provider,"I know you just say I thank you so much for the opportunity, I appreciate you for allowing me to stay here for the length of time that you have however i've been able to retain. i've been able to repay my own, and so this is my 30 day notice. That i'll be leaving at the end of the month."
14193.0,Patient,"And then the other part, is. The person. That whose place i'm taking. In this apartment my coworker her daughter lost custody of her children, she has custody. court hearing. On the seventh, so the children are there, the daughters there sometimes and. they'll all be moving out hopefully by November 1 but I don't know sure so it's a little bit tentative. You know I don't know if i'll be able to actually move in November 1."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so what you want to do is that means don't say nothing at all. Until you know for sure, once you know for sure for sure, then you give i'm fine I live in Texas I got a little taste the twain go me. But. Once you know for sure, then, then you can give you the notice. But you never want to give a notice if you're not if you haven't signed on the dotted line if you haven't. If you don't have a cab with a key in hand, no. yeah because the last thing you want to be doing the sleeping to your call."
14193.0,Patient,Right right or spending way too much money at a motel.
740.0,Provider,"So. With. i'm trying to see. You know what I still want to go over this. Though we're fair, let me at least want to give you an ideas ideas of coping skills that maybe you can actually use. yeah Okay, because, being able to cope, is very important, with how you manage your depression, if you don't know how to cope, then you will never know how to manage if you don't know how to manage it, then it will always overpower you."
14193.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,and basically affect your whole life.
14193.0,Patient,Right. going on.
740.0,Provider,"Right, and this is because you it just because of poor coping that's all. Because you have a you have a great job I mean, believe it or not, you still. do have."
14193.0,Patient,yeah. I do yeah. And I am grateful for that.
740.0,Provider,"Right and you have a place to say so, and then you believe it and are you still do have some kind of support you still have a support system support system doesn't have to be 1020 people if you got you got three good folks the name is you got a support system so. But I want, I want to explore more of how to cope. And how to properly cope according to what's a realistic for you. The idea is not to give you things that you know for a fact that you that you won't do that idea is to come up with a plane a really big coping skill that you know that you can actually implement into your day to day life does that make sense."
14193.0,Patient,"Yes. So, yes and it's it's being consistent about it to."
740.0,Provider,You know yeah. um so let's. Go ahead come on.
14193.0,Patient,"I was just going to say it feels good to exercise the first day because there's such a dramatic difference. And I feel good afterwards, but then keeping it up is the hard part being consistent is the hard part."
740.0,Provider,"I agree. However, there's a there's a reward there's always a reward in being consistent. And i'm I read this post one time basically saying that how much further, would you could you have been in life If only you maintain discipline."
14193.0,Patient,Right it's.
740.0,Provider,Only hmm so. Now. we're going to turn it if only it's a reality.
14193.0,Patient,So if they. claim as.
740.0,Provider,I said we're gonna turn it and only into a reality.
14193.0,Patient,Oh okay.
740.0,Provider,"Yes, ma'am it says, right here it's a depression SAP a person's energy to do just about anything even activities they enjoy as a result, people with depression tend to become less active. which cause of the depression to to worsen, however, even a little bit of activity can help stop this cycle. So getting out getting fresh air doing activities. actually helps to decrease."
14193.0,Patient,The depression yeah when I.
740.0,Provider,"When you're isolated and when you are alone when you have no one to talk to, and we just kind of, say, to yourself, you don't say being your own way it caused the depression, to get worse. yeah. Some of our lives in the genesis says this it says shoes activities that you are likely to complete so these of activities you're going to meet that you will do. First, we have exercise it says walk go for a bike ride waitlist follow and exercise video swim or practice yoga. Which one, are you willing to which one, are you willing to do."
14193.0,Patient,"Well, I don't have a bike and I have only one way in my room. I don't have any way to follow an exercise video. Oh that's right I forgot. I like to practice yoga stretch my room right now is very small room and it's full of boxes, I have no furniture."
740.0,Provider,So.
14193.0,Patient,file cabinet.
740.0,Provider,What about. What about going for a walk.
14193.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"that's, the first thing they say, is it just saying."
14193.0,Patient,"it's not attractive area, but maybe I could drive somewhere, that is."
740.0,Provider,You can you can drive to.
14193.0,Patient,"yeah. But then I get scared actually walking like that, by myself."
740.0,Provider,So girls. will go with the friend that you just dropped off.
14193.0,Patient,"that's part of my problem is that my I have a friend. That I kind of like but she she won't exercise she just wants to gain weight she doesn't want to, but she does."
740.0,Provider,"So, would you be willing to go for a walk with you there."
14193.0,Patient,"Yes, she'll i've tried i've tried that and i'll try it again."
740.0,Provider,yeah you can't blame.
14193.0,Patient,them I did she was like she took a few steps and she said I can't do this is too painful for me. I am having trouble with my back i'm having trouble with my side you know she gives me excuse.
740.0,Provider,So maybe she not a good friend to walk we.
14193.0,Patient,We need to find an agreement yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So, if even if you can't find a friend, the thing about it is this. If even if you can't find a friend to walk with you, but you can find a Francis talk to you on the phone while you walk there still a good alternative."
14193.0,Patient,That that's true that's a good point. i'm not a talker a lot of times I. I listened better than I taught so.
740.0,Provider,Define just say hey girl i'm not here walking child to having a panic attack on mythology people talk to me about some.

Depression support group in 94518 area. and So one of these should be a good fit for you, they will you because i'm telling you, you have to get out, you have to do something, everything that you do currently right now. You have a negative response to everything that you do so, that means what we have to do that, we have to try new things so that you can get a new response it's hard to get a new response based off, of all things where you've already have a negative. response toward it so we try to do new things to get new responses, the main thing and the main goal is to reduce the depression. In order to do that, we got to start doing gotta cope we gotta learn how to do so, let me let's go back let's go through this real fast, excuse me. I want to finish these coping skills with you. I don't want to. Leave you have had it, I want to make sure I finish it. So the next one is. All right, responsibilities playing a half work pay bills professional development homework. i'm sure you already have those because you got to pay for where you live hobbies sport gardening drawing playing music hiking playing would have picked and cookie what are some of your what are some hobbies that you like. Okay, which one of these which one of these are you wouldn't shock."
14193.0,Patient,"I don't know. I mean my problem is i'm alone too much, I need to be in a group. And you have a support system that's my problem."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I agree, which is why I showed you the support groups. so that you can start getting engaged with other people, because what happens is when you're engaged with other people, then, then, then you get engaged with new opportunities, because you never know what other people would would new opportunities other people bring into your life."
14193.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"So, like you have cooking classes, I mean I love to cook AG, I mean food network is a show that I love to watch a little tweaking a little fatter recipes on teachers to track things like that love cooking. i'm not. You got YouTube. Okay okay."
14193.0,Patient,i'm gonna need the reminder again.
740.0,Provider,"YouTube everything about everything you need literally is on YouTube even if you don't have a not a not a founder your phone yes okay just plug in the phone you aren't all YouTube a listen to it on it. Even in regards to it, they have grounding techniques to have mindfulness exercises everything you need is on YouTube."
14193.0,Patient,Get.
740.0,Provider,This is another thing. It says dress up no yeah I get a haircut prepare healthy meal.
14193.0,Patient,"I get my hair done. yeah, this is not my real health problem. Maybe I put on makeup. I mean i'm not doing i'm in a shitty situation right now I don't. saw my room. it's just it's this tiny little room. that's full of boxes. And i'm not impact anything so I don't have any any furniture, to put it in. And you know. So hopefully that'll change next month now. Remember, when I move."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So basically Now you can look at the boxes, not just as a main because I don't have any French, to put it in but nine you can look at the boxes is hey this, this is a preparation for transition we. And are we moving out and so that's what that's the new meaning for the boxes. So the next thing is, it says practice your chosen activity use the following tips to improve consistency, the first thing you say in the genesis will start small. Like I say even we're walking three times a week that's worthwhile if needed break activities into smaller pieces some activity is better than none, so if you do, even if you do three out of the five. Or, if you do two out of the five that's fine because some activity is better than nothing. Right The next thing is. It sounds like passing. Absolutely, and it says, make a plan set an alarm as a reminder or time and activities is something that you already do, for example, practice a hobby immediately after dinner every day. So you can either set an alarm as a reminder or high tie it into something that you are ready to do. The. breaker for me."
14193.0,Patient,"Personally, I can do that."
740.0,Provider,You know I like to go for walks and stuff.
14193.0,Patient,"But here. He he walks real slow he's kind of disabled. hmm and physically and intellectually a little bit. huh although he's smart in some ways, but I look at it like i'm kind of disabled to. But I do get real impatient with him because he is so slow the can't."
740.0,Provider,"But if you go to the gym. yeah they have trainers at the gym. yeah and then they have people next to you there's next year on the treadmill and let me say something I got a great imagination. And I could find myself competing with the people, next to me I look at the fee they go and i'm like well I need to go they see. cuz i'm not gonna let them walk me."
14193.0,Patient,Your competitive.
740.0,Provider,So it is what it is.
14193.0,Patient,I let my depression speak.
740.0,Provider,But see what what i'll say is it's not really the competitiveness basically What it does is that it keeps it keeps what i'm doing interesting. So is more saw me challenging myself to keep what i'm doing it because what happens is is that if I find it interesting but i'll keep doing it if I find it boring i'm not gonna keep doing it. Right and it's the same way. So look at at join a support group.
14193.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So another thing say yes to socialize and depression makes a tempting to stay home isolated from friends and family make a habit of saying yes to social opportunities, even while you're saying."
14193.0,Patient,I do.
740.0,Provider,"I do, I just don't get that opportunity that often. Because i'm. Not a failure Fatima janice. Because you gotta have a social support group for. Your a new territories you spent your pat your last she she is taking care of your mom and so now is your turn and all the way you can do is to get out there, one of the best. One of the best books i've ever heard of it in order to make a friend you got to first show yourself friendly and so that's how that's how they work, you know i'm saying so, basically, once you start going to support groups. working at your job, going to the gym eventually you can make with some people."
14193.0,Patient,So.
740.0,Provider,"This is what I wanted to do the homework. My homework on the third day. So.
