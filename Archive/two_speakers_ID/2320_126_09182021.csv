You know that had been out of work for so long, and the reason why they're out of work for so long is from you know different things like either they didn't want to work or something they had other problems from their previous employment. yeah so the program that they're hiring from is a program of individuals who like I said i've had either problems in the past. or your enemy, and so the kind of what do you call it, I call it a delinquent list.

Your first creation day i'm. Making up until now, but i'm so glad that they decided to do that because I think we're I think we're not the only ones, but we're kind of at the bottom I kind of feel like sometimes appreciation."

2320.0,Patient,"Do you think people just kind of see when they're used to it, so they don't you don't mean, but a lot of people at my job, you know they try they they do understand what we do every single day, so they do try to your enemy just kind of, say, a few kind words. You know what I mean not every day but yeah are you. Just kind of recognize that they appreciate what you're doing."
126.0,Provider,"Well, and like you said, now more than ever, I mean after every airplane flight everything has to be cleaned after every bus ride everything after every train wreck everything has to be clean. restaurants, like mcdonald's are blocking off their bathroom because they said they don't have enough time to clean it after every person has gone at each person. yep so it's like they can't keep up with the amount of cleaning that needs to be done nowadays."
2320.0,Patient,Right yeah.
126.0,Provider,"it's the central, but yet yes you're unappreciated you're you're definitely you know it's a. it's it's hard to get people to understand how how difficult your job is and and how seriously you take it. You know."
2320.0,Patient,"I mean like i'm gonna get i'm gonna go ahead and get vaccinated and all that stuff for my vaccination you're like a beginning a lot of thought, like."

You are fully vaccinated until after like the second one, or something like that. Yes, so I have to try to what I just have to get basically just call someone I guess and. make an appointment for my."
126.0,Provider,"job you don't even have to make an appointment, you can walk into a CVs most CBS is do it right there on the spot."
2320.0,Patient,"For a vaccination. Oh, I thought that was just covert testing okay."

2320.0,Patient,"yeah most definitely and then like so I decided on it, and then I was starting to think you know so now it's like. Especially like now, since, since I know that i'm not vaccinated all just yet, like, I really take my job seriously because you know world us work with the eight hour shift that we've got in the amount of work that we've got with just me and my crew like. we're barely."
126.0,Provider,keeping up with the you can like.
2320.0,Patient,"hours a day on all their how many buildings and right quite a bit you know and so. I don't know I just. Work on everybody to kind of you know what I mean like, especially with like my new person and stuff just want her to know the importance of what we're doing you're in the main."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2320.0,Patient,"So yeah so i'm going to sit down with her Monday and just have a little chat with her my boss said, he said, you know, he said, I know how you are because he knows i'm lightheaded and i'm hot tempered and I. I go like zero to 60 in a second when i'm going to mean, especially when I feel like i'm being like cooking like."
126.0,Provider,For granted or taking.
2320.0,Patient,"Like. it's like I don't know I guess like when I get that feeling I start to get antsy and stuff and. I don't know my body goes to weird like convulsions is that, like strange, or what."
126.0,Provider,"I don't think so because it is exactly reminding me of how I felt when like certain things my ex husband would say to me, and it would just. really hit me the wrong way like I used to go to jazzercise like four or five times a week."
2320.0,Patient,And i'll.
126.0,Provider,"Out with my jazzercise buddies I have friends from jazzercise to this day that I met in the 80s. wow and you know we were having this argument and he says to me well, I let you hang out with your friends at jazzercise after class. Wait a minute you let me. Are you kidding me right now. I mean. I don't think you have much choice in it it's because to him if he was kind of like left home to babysit the kids that wasn't fair. not fair, but if i'm left home to babysit the kids will that that's just fine."
2320.0,Patient,yeah that's.
126.0,Provider,nothing wrong with that.
2320.0,Patient,"Oh, not at all."
126.0,Provider,"In fact, for a while I used to watch other people's kids so I could stay home with my own kids. thing and i've watched to other people's kids and. Oh, and you know, and it was great because I got to stay home with my own kids for a little bit longer you know. Right only outside time I got was going to jazzercise otherwise I would never leave the House for the whole entire day. wow yeah and it would be like. Cabin fever I can't take it, I have to get out of here."
2320.0,Patient,"there's a group of the ladies that work at the Child Support Office and they go to the gym. They all have like a membership, but they all you know they all work together to say know each other. And they you know they go like three days a week or whatever it is, and they they don't want to use the equipment, but. The lady that is doing it, you know she like knows a lot of exercises or whatever to do they kind of make it a thing you know after work three days a week, and they're like come as you come here and win it because, not everybody can come through this week, all the time things happen. Right, but some of the girls were like sometimes we just come once a week, you know I mean the she's like there's one week I couldn't come any of those three days, you know that we would normally do it, but just just to be out because I don't really have too many friends."
126.0,Provider,"That sounds like a great idea, a great idea."
2320.0,Patient,Because it me.
126.0,Provider,"yeah when you're exercising with other ladies, first of all, you end up hanging out together you end up you know, helping each other and encouraging encouraging each other when you're exercising. it's motivation and you're not going there alone, you know. Right it's so much better when you get to work out with somebody else. Whether it's once or twice or it doesn't matter any any amount of time is going to be well spent, so you know it's not like you have to make a commitment i'm going to come, three times, no i'll join you and I can and. That sounds fantastic I mean I used to go straight to jazzercise what after I did finally get a job and stop babysitting other people's kids. I went straight to jazzercise after work because I knew if I went home first I wouldn't leave. hmm so I always put my clothes in the car my bag, and I would change because, if I came home first just to even get something I would go. hey. Now that i'm home, I just want to relax and that job when you make it part of your routine you almost feel like i'm missing something if you don't do it. I did jazzercise for about 16 years. wow and then. I started going to the gym and I joined a gym I hated that jazz bass was way better it was all women in our class we all bullshit it together and it's like when you're in a class or you're with a group of women there's peer pressure you can't just go. home i'm tired i'm going to sit down and i'll rest this one out you're you're there to keep up with everybody else. And to me, I cannot watch exercises at home because I will not push myself, I only push myself if i'm feeling that peer i'm around other people. Right yeah I love jazzercise i'm telling you, you can make some good friends exercising together and like you just said, you. Like that's one thing lacking in your life this sounds like a great opportunity for you, I would start doing it."
2320.0,Patient,"yeah I was thinking about was like man, and you know actually it actually really does sound fun."
126.0,Provider,Even.
2320.0,Patient,"A whole eight hour shift, I mean it made me feel better about myself to your no. No, no, I actually. address them."
126.0,Provider,"Especially if you have a. 10 stressed day or you feel like frustrated at the end of the day, or you're kind of like oh my God I don't like I can't wait to leave work and working out is the best thing for you to do just total stress release. yeah that is that's the answer distresses is exercise sweat it out, you feel so much more like oh OK, I can handle life now because the stress is boiling and there's no release or relief for it. and exercising is what I mean for me that was like my total stress release. You know I would do the whole Cardio thing and the aerobic thing and afterwards I would feel like a million bucks you know and and then I would hang out with my friends in the parking lot when you talk about stuff. Right, you know and then eventually we started doing things on the weekend, we started celebrate each other's birthdays and you know it's. I think that's you know you've you've already recognized that something kind of missing from your life at some you know."
2320.0,Patient,"yeah I. yeah i've been i've been thinking about that the last like few months because they've been they tell me about it all the time and they were going to come and join us at the gym gear, and I mean. So it's just kind of like like they keep motivated me just asking me when are you going to me because sometimes I get busy, and I forget that I was going to even do that you know when I have to do. yeah, then I start feeling like. I don't really have a lot of time for me, but I don't make the time for me, and I can make that time I."
126.0,Provider,Know right.
2320.0,Patient,"yeah so that's where i'm i'm trying to start with, that is just. Yes, because that I know that if I can do the sleeping thing I can do that too, I think. And it'll help with my stress since i'm all dressed it seems like."
126.0,Provider,"huh yeah yeah that's the magic potion to the stress releases is working out getting that physical kind of your heart rate going, and also the serotonin kicks in, and you know the film good endorphins kick in. And that's what makes you feel good to. Have you heard of that before."
2320.0,Patient,"I have, but i'm not really sure i've asked you, I know it sounds dumb i'm 41 years old, but. No."
126.0,Provider,"No way, have you have you ever been a big exercises like have you. Exercise every day. Okay now. But you don't know about it. exercisers know that when you put in that physical energy for about an hour you start kind of getting not a high, but you get a physical good feeling in your brain and that's when they call it the serotonin is is kicking in so when you exercise like some people are addicted to exercise. Because of that feel good hormone that kicks in when you reach a certain level of your exercise activity."
2320.0,Patient,Okay well.
126.0,Provider,"So some people they'll just to exercise for hours, which again becomes an addiction and becomes a problem, but it that whole thing about. You know exerting your body to a certain point where the feel good hormones kick in and you kind of what they do, is it kind of refreshes your brain and you feel sometimes like a wash of just a feel good feeling. call it the runner's high."
2320.0,Patient,It does it come with any kind of exercise like. walking or.
126.0,Provider,Only only the Cardio you have to get your heart going to have to get your heart rate going.
2320.0,Patient,Oh so like like running just. running. And yeah other.
126.0,Provider,"or doing strenuous exercise, so if you're just walking like a slow pit paste Probably not. Okay you're walking fast in your heart starts beating or you're walking in you're carrying weights then you're going to get you're going. In for a certain amount of time like your heart rate has to go. There fairly quickly for 20 to 30 minutes. In order to start filling that serotonin."
2320.0,Patient,"So, like they have like treadmills the gym if you're like run on the treadmill."
126.0,Provider,yeah you can that'll do it that'll do it yeah. So now how much does it cost to join this gym that they work out.
2320.0,Patient,I think it's like 30 or 40 bucks a month. No that's.
126.0,Provider,"that's nothing. yeah nothing yeah we had. um gold's gym when it first opened up in town, they were charging like 50 $60 a month."
2320.0,Patient,Oh wow.
126.0,Provider,"calculus so, then I thought I got a good deal by paying 45."
2320.0,Patient,mm hmm.
126.0,Provider,"And then, when I moved from one city to the next, I went to go quit my membership and they said oh Oh well, you know why are you quitting I said well because i'm moving i'm not. This is not in not going to be my neighborhood anymore, and they said well you know, can we entice you to stay, you know what about $25 a month."

126.0,Provider,Okay where's he where is he calling you from.
2320.0,Patient,"i'm not sure i'm trying to figure out like because he's a team now so he has his own job he does his own thing, and when I get home from work usually he's gone, but. They don't always know when I have like they're used to every other Wednesday night mom has group, you know."

126.0,Provider,Something yeah.
2320.0,Patient,"When it cooks that chicken like it cooked all the fat and grease out of it that it tastes so much better than. really looking to add up and I couldn't believe it. wow because I always. wanted one, but every time I go to get one their prices so i'll hold off, you know. You know I am so. But then I was like I seen it and I was like you know what every single time that I go to get one I tell myself, no. So I was like I have the money yeah just buckle down and get this. Exactly I my son was even proud of me, he was like oh my gosh mom because he knew what I was thinking he.

126.0,Provider,Right right yeah you're gonna have to.
2320.0,Patient,get a loan it.
126.0,Provider,"And experiment and cook different things and you're going to love it it's gonna. be so much easier, plus during the summer, when you don't want to turn on the stove. And that that thing kind of keeps the heat contained it doesn't spread out."
2320.0,Patient,You know right.
126.0,Provider,A House like if you're baking in the summertime the House gets so hot.
2320.0,Patient,"yeah it does. Yes, yes. yeah it's crazy and then the timeframe like I put you know the same type of chicken on for the same time that I put in my regular of it. And then half that time. Like it wasn't even the whole time that it would have spent in my oven to cook."
126.0,Provider,Right it even condenses the time that it.
2320.0,Patient,yeah I was like holy moly. That was a pastor minutes yeah.
126.0,Provider,Alright guys.

126.0,Provider,"looks good. i'm a proud of you for buying. it's a step in the right direction, making life easier for you. Right yeah."
2320.0,Patient,"yeah dinner time is the worst for me live on it every night five days a week, and maybe it's just the fact that I bust my butt for eight hours and then gotta come home to still do more work."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2320.0,Patient,"So yeah i'm like well i'm trying to find like different crock pot meals or anything that will you know, save my life so. dinner is done. Before I get home with something. So I think i'm going to try to find some meals to switch off like maybe like use my crock pot half the time use my room my other one, like the other half the time and maybe."
126.0,Provider,yeah it's great idea.
2320.0,Patient,She has like a hold everybody's like let's get her mom so i'm like i'm. Like you just did like I was thinking about dinner i'm Gary.
126.0,Provider,Or you haven't decided I can't decide.
2320.0,Patient,"More cuz I I probably like the only one, the House they ever comes up with what we're going to have for dinner every single night and I get tired of it i'm like throw me somebody at."
126.0,Provider,"It right right. Processes right. leave a suggestion list on the table, have. For dinner just write it down."
2320.0,Patient,You know yep.
126.0,Provider,cuz yeah it's hard to think of making something new every day.
2320.0,Patient,"it's hard you know. I haven't gone through this thing with my with my 10 year old son and my 12 year old, not so much for 12 year old, but my 10 year olds very bad maybe it's. I don't know he's changed a little bit and he's starting to get very disrespectful not the same son i've had so I was like what's going on, someone said, maybe it's just the age, because they've got some 10 year old kids to I guess they've been doing that too. Like I have all boys, except one girl, you know so when boys go through puberty I don't know I guess I don't I guess I forgot what age that was or whatever, but. Because I know my 12 year olds already going through it, so I guess, I thought for sure I was too small or too young to do it, but. Someone said they started getting their hormones around that time, so I thought, maybe it's bad or something, but every night, it seems like if. If i'm the one you know figuring out what to fix for dinner, and I fix it then it's like so if i'm not fixing dinner everybody's like oh ma what's for dinner, and no bug me to no end to I fix something. Then, if I come home and I already have everything planned out. For dinner already made. they'll be like my 10 year old be like I don't want that I don't like that. I have to fight with him almost every night."
126.0,Provider,"No, no, fight this is what we're having for dinner tonight if you're hungry only did that needs to be said, no fighting. State and hopefully collected."
2320.0,Patient,"I got to that point the other night, you know as soon as I get to that point. Something back my brain tells me oh now you're a bad mom because you let your son go without dinner for the night right. But I remember what you said about your daughter. And then I was thinking about it, and I said okay well let's try this thing, so the other night he didn't want to have something that we were having for dinner. yeah and I was already pissed off because it happens every night live on a year, and I mean if it was every once in a while i'd be so different."
126.0,Provider,it's attention it's it's trying to get attention.
2320.0,Patient,"Okay that's what I thought I was like what the hell's going on here, you know I mean and I already had a bad day at work, so I was like Okay, if you don't want this. This is not a restaurant. A restaurant i'm not the maid so if you're not gonna eat but I fix, then you can go to bed. No problem for me. I started to realize. After a couple days doing that my brain stopped telling me how bad of a mom I am. So I left him the last couple nights go without dinner. And then, today I thought to myself how come it's not facing you know more shana why don't you feel bad at the fact that because normally I would feel bad. Like wait no because i'm so tired of because it's been happening for so long that my advisors got to a point to where it's just like you know what i'm over this i'm done."
126.0,Provider,"And you are doing the right thing by disciplining him in a loving manner. die by missing one meal. And you're showing him a This is my you've just reached my limit. Right and without yelling and screaming if you're not going to eat, what we have to serve tonight you know this isn't a Buffet it's a 24 hour restaurant. A serve dinner, this is what we're eating if. If you're not hungry you don't need to sit at the table, well, I am hungry, then you D. and agree you do and that's it no yelling and screaming no defending yourself I love it I love it and what you're doing is. you're not letting him push the boundaries and need to know there are boundaries if or to just run wild and do whatever they want they think life of them a living and they don't have to work hard to get what they need."
2320.0,Patient,Right.
126.0,Provider,So you're doing him a favor you're not being a mean mom. Keep giving him boundaries. And that's very helpful very good.
2320.0,Patient,Usually I like usually i'm fighting and screaming and cussing and it's just it is bad and it's like all this after work and fighting over dinner.
126.0,Provider,Right.
2320.0,Patient,"Right even my daughter was like every night, this is going on, like and you didn't used to do that, but like I said, with the change in him, I don't know if he made because he's getting older and he just thought well, maybe now it's time to test mom or something."
126.0,Provider,I don't mind yeah Brian was.
2320.0,Patient,"Like what is going on, you know I mean trying to figure out what was happening, was it."
126.0,Provider,"good for you, I love it."
2320.0,Patient,"But I actually didn't have to cuss or yell at him or nothing you know I mean he started to argue after I said Okay, you can just go to bed, you know, then he wanted to argue, but then a part of me was just like it felt so calm for me just to say. i'm not doing this anymore. you're going to go to bed that's. Full goodbye. Like my body felt this sense of like great yeah did I didn't have."
126.0,Provider,Her.
2320.0,Patient,"Yes, him or something I mean, because that is what happens on a daily basis, that seems like what can lady. Then so rude disrespectful and mouthy."
126.0,Provider,i'm glad you did that i'm so proud of you.
