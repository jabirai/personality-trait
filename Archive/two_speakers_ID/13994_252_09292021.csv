252.0,Provider,"I, are you out of your meds."
13994.0,Patient,yeah yeah now.
252.0,Provider,"All right, i'm going to put a inquiry into Mary. And what that is is I tell her where what's going on what's been going on and that you're out of your medication. And that you'll be in group on Tuesday evening for makeup group for Monday, because you can't go Monday and asked if she will give you. A bridge, you know and from now until then, in other words, give you enough medication to get it to that that Tuesday meeting when you can see her and she can see you."
13994.0,Patient,"Okay, I see."
252.0,Provider,"What i'm saying. yeah um and that will definitely help you, and it will help you, through your process to write with your teeth."
13994.0,Patient,"yeah I hope so, I mean on the last medic medication. was a kiloton and. it's. OK OK i'm used to taking xanax for thousand ting and xanax for 10 years and then yeah and then all of a sudden, he dropped me boom. And I came here and then. It was. It didn't work. I would say. And it was still hard this sleep and stuff but I mean. She told me that you know that that's probably what's going to happen, you know, and we want to try to stay away from the xanax because it's just. You know, still getting to know me too, you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah and you know definitely what we are doing in group is alternative.
13994.0,Patient,"Like I know, eventually, you want to get on something and then get off of it at the end you know that's the hall and that's what I was at like. I was getting the two milligram. xanax as I was again. all the way up to three a day 90 of them and then I went all the way down to 3031 milligrams. And took 10 years but you know it went. I was a. I was proud that I went all the way down for that you know what I mean. Good, then I just feel like. i'm starting all over from the beginning now."
252.0,Provider,and use it for help them.
13994.0,Patient,see that again.
252.0,Provider,I said you've been off of it for how long.
13994.0,Patient,The work.
252.0,Provider,benzodiazepines.
13994.0,Patient,Just a couple. Like five days.
252.0,Provider,Sorry i'm typing the inquiries Mary.
13994.0,Patient,Of course I didn't have that neither when I was incarcerated for. Six days. This all months been messed up I just i'm so glad that I got. so happy and really am i'm so happy I got all that done with. yeah aquarius is such a big relief off my shoulders. actually made me get up and shave and. A haircut. This for a second there at a big old beard.
252.0,Provider,You did.
13994.0,Patient,It was just because I wasn't taking care of myself just.
252.0,Provider,well.
13994.0,Patient,Being depressed and laying down. My car.
252.0,Provider,going to preach you know.
13994.0,Patient,hey I got a question does gather pin have a withdrawal effect. No. No okay.
252.0,Provider,"gabba this way it's naturally what our body makes already. So there's no withdrawal with with that it's you know things suboxone. benzodiazepines if you if you're on them long enough, which you were so i'm surprised that you know you haven't been experiencing any withdrawals."
13994.0,Patient,"Oh, I I I did have some before I came to the right heart."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13994.0,Patient,It took a little while to find. Someone to get my. My take my insurance. yeah and yeah so that was. I went I definitely went through it. But uh.
252.0,Provider,yeah very um. What we're doing how many times have you been in group.
13994.0,Patient,I haven't been in group. None yet.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, I didn't think so because i'm like damn I seen it bigger. What we're doing in group is we're working on coping skills for anxiety right because the idea is for you not to be on any kind of long term bezos."
13994.0,Patient,"You know, not an alternative."
252.0,Provider,"You know, to use alternative things that will are natural that will help you that won't cause you to detox you know one thing about themselves is that it can cause you to have an early onset of dementia. And so you know being on it long enough. I mean you go right down that direction, for many, many years that was to go to for doctors was here you go here's bill his bills bills."
13994.0,Patient,bills yeah 10 years ago 10 years ago it was a little bit different.
252.0,Provider,yeah big time.
13994.0,Patient,"regression all through you know the three out of 10 years, especially yeah I saw it."
252.0,Provider,"And then now they're going oops. Oh, you know yeah Mary is it you know she's an advocate for. Definitely to get people up and so it's because of the long term effects it has. And you know we're in we're working on this book anxiety and phobia workbook and what it's talking and what it's teaching about is you know breathing K things that are important for anxiety, no matter what or panic attacks or phobias, yes, the diet water good sleep exercise for sure. Those."
13994.0,Patient,"Right healthy is one of the main things you know I I definitely understand that eating good and Stephen. Stephen sleeping right, those are very big things."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, and i'm also learning how to breathe from your abdominal from your abdomen instead of your chest. Taking really deep breaths being able to walk through the physical discomfort of the anxiety when it first starts coming on the messages that you tell yourself when you're going through it. Right changing those those messages. With that. That can help you walk through. The physical symptoms of anxiety and they become less and less and less until you have them no more."
13994.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,anxiety is something that can be cured it's something that that you can control and cure with enough practice of these things that we are trying to teach right.
13994.0,Patient,"So, knowing that."
252.0,Provider,"Right, knowing that it's important that we practice, these things that we first get the basics under control what we're eating. What we're doing as far as exercise for ourself what we're telling ourselves, we have to change that negative message in our head. You know from oh my God i'm gonna die here it comes again oh my God is going to be worse than other all of those are fear driven thoughts that push that anxiety higher. And so. You know. A benzo is not a. it's a short term fix for a long term problem."
13994.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"it's way more problems long what long term. yeah right so just know that if you come to group you listen, you know you apply the skills that we're teaching in group, you see a significant difference in your anxiety. Okay. it's work it takes work."
13994.0,Patient,Though yeah I know. I know.
252.0,Provider,"We just into yeah, this is what we do as humans is we want that quick fix because we know that that pill is going to take it away right away right."
13994.0,Patient,"And there's yeah. And that's what I kind of that's what. that's what I guess xanax did for me. yeah cuz when I took the kolata pin it was like. Okay i'm getting a car and i'm still tripping out and I don't know what's going on, but the have you know I don't want to go anymore it's like it wasn't it's not like that does that Zack was like fast those like I you know, I was like oh okay well. Okay let's go and let's go get this done now, you know."
252.0,Provider,"Right right but see did you just hear what you were saying the messages that you're telling yourself. yeah it's medications not working, I need you know this back, I know that it works, we know that xanax in you know works it's not just the fact that. we've taken it just that alone changes the messages in our head, which then slows that anxiety down you see the correlation is like, if you take that that other medication it's longer acting stays in your system two days longer acting. The only difference is is the messages that you telling yourself have to change to all right i've took my medic medication, I can handle this i'm going to feel better and a few I gotta breathe and let it do its job. And i'm telling you you'll feel a lot better. Right sandy not I mean it's causing havoc it might take care of it short term but underneath it is causing havoc in your body and your mind."
13994.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no definitely I know it's. Something vendors, or something to use, you know. short term short term and then obviously the whole. thing is to taper off and be off of it and learn to live without. You know anything."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and the funniest part about it is that when we first started this workbook I used to get. heart palpitations right anxiety all the time, like I would be thinking and stressing about bills, or I over you know kid or whatever, and I would feel my heart start just going. And for me that was always the first signs of you know, an attack coming I know it's coming. And so what i'm what I started doing is I would whatever I was doing I would stop. I would take a few minutes and I would start talking internally talking to my heart. Literally I would visualize it as it pumping you know, out of control it's pumping pumping pumping. And I would start talking to it, saying what are you freaking out about everything's okay. slow down you're fine we're fine. And I is I swear my heart was sort of slowing down. which proved to me that we have exactly what this book is trying to teach us that we have the ability. To control what happens with our body by what our mind is telling it."
13994.0,Patient,yeah. that's when the mind very strong.
252.0,Provider,yeah there is Joe.
13994.0,Patient,"me, and I can predict door imagine. how strong the brain is when we can do to your body and stuff like that."
252.0,Provider,"So that's what we're trying to teach. is exactly how strong your mind is and how you can win that anxiety first comes on you know, the first onset of it, some people will start getting sweaty palms other people will get heart palpitations other people will start. To start getting agitated you know they know it's coming right. And that doesn't always have to be a trigger but being able to identify the things that cause, you know, for the most part the anxiety attacks allows us to control it better to."
13994.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,Okay it's pretty amazing I didn't realize this like I always knew our mind was powerful but I never realized how powerful our mind really is it's pretty amazing.
13994.0,Patient,yeah and. I always I. Always wish I was more mentally struck like strong stronger.
252.0,Provider,You. know.
13994.0,Patient,Take no definitely I feel what you're saying I just always felt like I was weak minded I. Just.
252.0,Provider,You know who told you that.
13994.0,Patient,No one told me that it was it's just my own. Thinking of like. Just like anxiety attacks or being like just. Getting up the House and going and doing stuff being around people just what am I scared about I don't know why i'm scared it's just. there's a tell me it's a phobia or something I don't I don't know I just I can't.
252.0,Provider,What we are working very.
13994.0,Patient,Week. and mentally weak over.
252.0,Provider,"Phobias can be resolved as well. And we were just going through a part in the book, where it was talking about exposure to phobia so you know you either get out there and there's two ways that you can. resolve phobias it's just getting out there and facing it and walking through the bodily symptoms, putting yourself in a crowd of people and telling yourself, everything is okay right. These people aren't gonna hurt me there's nothing to be afraid of your Okay, and you sit there, and you just walk through those uncomfortable bodily symptoms that's one way. Another way, is where we do it in little little bite sized chunks right where we go one day, and we look at a crowd of people. Right that's all."
13994.0,Patient,hmm.
252.0,Provider,"The next day. We might get in the mix of two people. And we go away the next day, we might get in the midst of five people. And you'll feel the anxiety come, but the messages that you're telling yourself about that anxiety will help alleviate the symptoms. it's normal to have a setback, where you just say I can't do this today and that's Okay, as long as the next day you get out and you continue doing what you're doing."
13994.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,"Or you know it before you know it you'll be able to walk in a crowd of people controlling your anxiety by your thoughts telling yourself. This is uncomfortable I like it, but i'm going to do it anyway i'm not being hurt nobody is touching me there's nothing to be afraid of, and these are the things that we keep telling ourselves, the more that we keep telling ourselves, the more body search responding and listening. yeah right. yeah it's just a process that's it we don't beat herself up if one day we can't do it the next day we get up and you do it again it's okay it's a process it's not something that can be changed overnight it didn't develop overnight."
13994.0,Patient,"Now, actually, I never had these kind of problems until I was 21 and got really bad when I was 22. yeah it just came out of nowhere, I feel like. My mom thinks it's because I did. juvenile hall time and jail and prison time and stuff like that, but. I don't I don't feel like it's I mean I could be part of it, but I mean I don't. know. It was really weird I didn't understand what a what a. Panic attack was you know and then. yeah it was very. very weird."
252.0,Provider,"And it can be, do you know how many people that i've seen that it's got came out of you know jail and prison and they can't be around a bunch of people, it takes a while before they can even adjust to any kind of societal anything."
13994.0,Patient,Is that normal okay so that's not yeah oh okay.
252.0,Provider,"It is something that caught can cause sure you know. Think about it, if you're in jail or if you're in juvenile even juvenile hall you're in a guarded secluded area right you. know there are things inside those walls that are danger to you. it's still you still have this concept that you can control. right here. You have control over your area so there's a sense of protection, even though is probably way more dangerous right. And so you have to remember that they can cause an onset of. anxiety to start. Imagine people that have been in prison for. Years 510 years. And then they go. yeah and then they get out and they're like I can't leave my house."
13994.0,Patient,Where they call it.
252.0,Provider,seems like they're flailing you know.
13994.0,Patient,yeah. I forgot what they call that it's like institutionalized yeah.
252.0,Provider,"It takes a while, for them to be able to walk through it and get in get comfortable back in society. it's just not something that they can do you know i've heard and worked with people that have been in prison for 20 some odd years and get out and say I think i'd rather go back to prison and live the rest of my life, a lot easier. You know."
13994.0,Patient,yeah yeah I understand that part no I mean. it's a lot easier because it's. yeah.
252.0,Provider,"They know they'll know the dangers, you know."
13994.0,Patient,yeah exactly exactly and over here it's when you're outside.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
13994.0,Patient,"They rather be in there, because they have to be or. And when you're when you're out here and you're not where you want to be in life to that it's just a whole nother like."
252.0,Provider,Stress does it take a lot of work.
13994.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So. Okay, so I put in a. An inquiry, in other words inquiry says that you need a bridge to get to group on Tuesday. So you need some medication ASAP is what it says, I explained in there about the things that you've been going through and why you missed her appointment with Mary and why you can't come on Monday. That, but you stated that you would commit to coming on Tuesday evening at seven."
