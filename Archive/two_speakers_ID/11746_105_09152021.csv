11746.0,Patient,i'm gonna close the door real quick okay.
105.0,Provider,"want to bring me up to speed, a little bit about how you've been doing since we last met or anything that's kind of on your mind."
11746.0,Patient,"So i've been thinking a lot these last few days and I have something that i've been really waiting. So, tomorrow, well, let me just tell you what I have going on, so tomorrow's I have the annual not annual that's obviously every year, but I have my. I guess quarterly check in with the nursing board every three months. mm hmm so I have that going on tomorrow which i've been nervous about i'm always nervous about it because it it's like a you know it's it's a panel, so you feel a little bit ganged up on."
105.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11746.0,Patient,"So it's just it's always a little bit nerve wracking. So I have that going on tomorrow i'm trying not to think about it too much and then another thing that i've been kind of. Avoiding is well you know Darren i've told told you about him GG dad who's passed well his mom her name is Kay. We were supposed to go to Florida. September 5 through the. 25th I believe it was, we had a week plan in Florida, we were going to take GG to see her, she lives out in Bristol so we were going to stay in Panama, and then let GG visit her and Bristol for a few days. But because gigi got sick, the first week of school she was pretty much out the first the whole entire week of school, so you know being that I don't want her to miss any more school and then they also doing like you know the assessments like kind of the beginning of the year testing. We were that we were supposed to go. I canceled the trip and. A kaizen you know calling me texting me calling my mom and. And you know, asking you know where where where are we are we going and. I haven't responded back to her."
105.0,Provider,what's going on and let her know you cancel.
11746.0,Patient,"Well, I did I did let her know. Via text, but I haven't we always communicate via text we never talk like on the phone. it's just kind of it's always been our pattern I guess of communication or or via messenger on Facebook she'll message you know because that's how we usually call is through the Facebook APP so that they can talk on camera. So when she messages me it's usually through that APP. So she knows that we canceled but I haven't talked to her again about. about going going because I don't I don't really I don't know what to say when I don't really know what to tell her I don't know when we can go there again, you know I don't know how that's going to. Work with school and you know, for instance, I thought about taking her for. Like Christmas break I but I looked into that and even now, like the tickets are just so expensive, you know, and so I just. and also more more than even that more than the tickets is she she does not want to go at all, you know, during that time, because she knows it's like her birthday time and she's like mom I please I don't want to go see you know I don't want to go to Florida for my birthday. And so, with that and the cost of it all I just I don't know that when we can go again, so I don't know what to tell her."
105.0,Provider,Is there a sense of not wanting to go.
11746.0,Patient,"Well, for me it doesn't really matter because I mean I don't have to see her you know I mean all I have to do is basically take GG there but. You know the same time she's fine she she's never really spent the night anyways so she's very apprehensive about you know I have this expectation that I feel like kay's expecting her to you know go and beyond this, you know one. You know feels like she was like an extended stay almost you know, like a week or something like that and she's just not she's not prepared for that you know she's she's five years old she's not she hasn't really been away from home, and you know K wanted her initially to fly by herself. On nothing fly by herself, you know that's it that's a change of airplanes there i'm not comfortable with that in any way, shape or form, so I was like that that can't happen unfortunately she cannot fly. By herself, you know so, then I had made the arrangements will that that we would all go, you know, or at least I would go with her and then that just didn't pan out, I mean I had I even now, I have, like all of the refund money sitting in the southwest account because. I had to cancel the flight, so I mean I fully intended to go it's just you know she got sick and then she can't miss any more school. So I really don't. I really don't know how to plan it now what to tell her. How to address the fact that God is not comfortable there are more than a few nights. And I just I feel like this huge weight. About. You know I feel this obligation for her to. To go out there and. I just I don't want to feel like that I just I really don't I mean. I understand that you know that her son has passed and that's extremely sorry, you know extreme extreme travel tragedy, obviously, but. I don't feel like it's my obligation to bring GG they're like under this certain time frame, you know I want them to see each other, obviously I would love for her to spend time with her grandma and your stories and you know do all of that I just I don't I feel pressured by her."
105.0,Provider,"yeah and what i'm noticing is. This. I feel obligated i'm not obligated I feel obligated i'm not obligated so you're. Remember, we were talking before about i'd saw a little note that I written about the distinction right between shame and guilt."
11746.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"Can you see and it might be artificial but just see see where that fits in this I don't know if I had gotten, to the point that I had talked about sometimes the inverse of guilt can be that we're we kind of resent someone. So Jay wants to take one side of it just look at one side."
11746.0,Patient,I do feel guilt.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, for what What did you not do, or what did you do too much of."
11746.0,Patient,I feel guilty for not getting her there.
105.0,Provider,"What did you do not do the specific What did you not do, or what did you do too much of."
11746.0,Patient,"I feel guilty well what I did not do is, I did not follow through with the plan, I did not, you know. Make the trip happen, I guess, I cancel the trip."
105.0,Provider,"Okay now so be a little slower than normal thinking, what did you do instead."
11746.0,Patient,I canceled.
105.0,Provider,"I don't know I already got that one. So you didn't go that's the you know i'm someone who makes a commitment I keep my condemning that didn't happen. Right, what did you do. What are you doing. Here, my daughter."
11746.0,Patient,Maybe yeah I mean yes.
105.0,Provider,Is that true.
11746.0,Patient,That is true.
105.0,Provider,What were you going to say before I feel that in.
11746.0,Patient,um. I don't remember actually.
105.0,Provider,"All right, well let's just check and see if there's anything else because we were just going to use this this little thing here. we're gonna be looking at values right."
11746.0,Patient,I avoided her which was.
105.0,Provider,"Okay that's after that's after. Okay, so we're just going to take this this thing of. Values we're working with with guilt. You feel guilty, because you didn't keep a commitment you didn't follow through is that right. And do you feel guilty that you took care of your daughter."
11746.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,Would you do it differently.
11746.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"So why do you feel guilty you acted inside of your value, you had a judgment call I either, like myself, as someone who keeps a commitment or I put my daughter what."
11746.0,Patient,"Well, her needs first."
105.0,Provider,"Well, if I kept my commitment I wouldn't be putting it first i'd be putting it second. So you put the needs of your daughter ahead of being someone that is seen as keeps her commitment. And you would do it again. Is there really anything to feel guilty about, do you not like that person, you are that put the needs of her daughter above. What people might think of her as. Well, what would they think of you, if you kept that commitment, and you didn't take care of your daughter."
11746.0,Patient,"Why, I mean I think there's more to it because I feel like a hypocrite."
105.0,Provider,"will play this one, all the way out, I know you. want to go off, but just really get this one solid. So you really get what i'm doing here. You get that, because this is about you've said guilt and and if you use the framework that i'm using it acted outside of your core values. You didn't do enough of something we did too much of another were you hypochondriac with your daughter."
11746.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,Would you do it again same thing.
11746.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"So i'm gonna ask you again, what do you feel guilty about what did you not do."
11746.0,Patient,"If you would I would exactly. yeah I mean all of that's right, I know exactly what what you're saying. And I guess I wish I would I could have done better, as I could have informed her more I could have been more Community you know communicate better."
105.0,Provider,"And we're going to get to that. I was definitely going to get to that because I hear I heard hypocrite communication I know where you are now with it, but I really want to see if it's really necessary, because there are times when we can do better. And so, but when it just comes down to going ahead and flying out versus taking care of her if you would do that differently and you've already said no twice, you said no, I would do that same thing I would prioritize things competing values. This one's still gonna rise to the top so then put my daughter's well being ahead of that I look like someone who follows through. Right yeah."
11746.0,Patient,"Okay, I did I did everything right on that note, I would say."
105.0,Provider,Now we're going to. i'm a honest candid direct communicator. yeah we on Kelly on that one.
11746.0,Patient,not good at all.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so probably some yucky feelings about that, and so you keep going back and forth, maybe trying to justify it in your head like over and over like was it justified that I don't communicate hey we checks and just how we tax, so there was some justification, maybe going on in there. So here's where I wonder. If it's just guilt, then you just repair it just to fix it. fix it that's it if it's shame. You probably not going to want to do anything probably going to want to hide. So, what are you doing."
11746.0,Patient,I think I i'm definitely hiding i'm avoiding it.
105.0,Provider,"So see if there's anything that even smells like. i'm. What i'm I can't I don't even know what it is, I mean if it's shame if it has to do with that something having to do with there and that you're depriving her of. Something. That you own or something."
11746.0,Patient,"I feel all of that, I mean I feel like i'm depriving her of. I don't know what the word would be but have you know that connection that she needs or that you know to be able to look into her eyes and you know, be able to see. Darren there they I mean they look so much alike same color eyes, I can imagine there's probably very strong feelings when she sees her i'm denying her that. i'm. I mean that's that's the biggest thing is just I know how much she wants to see her. You know I feel. I feel guilty, but I also I also feel ashamed, because I haven't. I haven't communicated properly, and I know that and I, and I justify it by. I don't know if it's so much justification, but i'm not I let people tend to. i'm a bit of a pushover I suppose so because I know that. You know she's very strong personality and I kind of. i'm avoiding it because I don't want to be I don't want to feel uncomfortable."
105.0,Provider,"They go I don't want to. concede to her pressure. very reasonable. So maybe some skills of remembering that. you're not the cause of the fact that she doesn't doesn't become the second person in line to then be this this surrogate child for K it's not you didn't take that on just because Darren passed away. Now. there's. letting her have those feelings number one letting her have them, it could very well be that you're correct she wants to see GG because of what you just said. what's your responsibilities to take care of you and your daughter. katie to take care of herself. same thing you did for me to take care of my daughter i'm not going to worry about letting someone an adult get let down man take care of the child. So the first is that emotional boundary letting her have her own feelings and now we can get to communication we can get to how do I communicate. Two things at the same time. Okay, I have, I imagine, and that's the key piece with talking with actually speaking and verbalizing is i'm imagining or the story i'm telling myself is that. You. What. You said the word. want that connection with GG because. She looks like Aaron and you want that you want to see see her eyes that's what I think and and I I feel sad that. She wasn't feeling well and I had to cancel. Are those true. Those yes. So my saying that does it seem like. she's going to be offended or. something you could say something like that."
11746.0,Patient,"I think that's a very good. opening a you know, an initial opening the door. Okay communication."
105.0,Provider,"So that's would be the beginning, which is to say, I have compassion for what you're going through and it's too bad I had to make this difficult decision. And then comes what you're predicting is really hard, well, I want to commitment from you have when you're coming out and that's where we're at now right it's oh my gosh I don't want to deal with that So how do you think she would deliver it the push."
11746.0,Patient,"And I think she's. I think she's going to start off by. My complaining that I didn't communicate with her that I didn't let her know that you know what was going on. So i'd like to address you know the the apology all of that, for."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, how long how much time has elapsed since the cancellation."
11746.0,Patient,About a week.
105.0,Provider,"So apologize, what do you sorry for this is where guilt is this is how you fix it right here."
11746.0,Patient,i'm just sorry I didn't let her know sooner.
105.0,Provider,And if she says why What do you say.
11746.0,Patient,"It was a last minute cancellation, I mean it really was the last minute cancellation, but I mean it's been a week since then and I haven't talked to her so. i've been avoiding her that's the honest truth, I mean."
105.0,Provider,"But they're not going to you can you can include that piece in there, but there's a little bit more information that i'm privy to that is not bad that I wonder if it's still you're thinking that it's somehow bad. it's not. daughter has said she wants to hang out here. The tickets are expensive. And there was something else I don't know what it was."
11746.0,Patient,"it's missing school is the number one thing I mean she cannot miss school or school so that with I don't know when i'll be able to plan it again, it was really optimal timing, the way I did it and I don't know when that's going to happen again."
105.0,Provider,"Just so we're clear knowing it really won't get sideswiped if you really know at the core what the reason is because, then you won't get hooked. Because Christmas there's no school So you see perversity we you know so that miss school thing might come later, but really. What is it the core of this, I wrote missing school, I wrote it down I also put money because she said costs of tickets, so we got to figure out what is really at the core."
11746.0,Patient,doesn't want to go.
105.0,Provider,And who's feelings are you trying to say to protect.
11746.0,Patient,case I don't want to hurt her feelings.
105.0,Provider,"you're not responsible for her films. She, this is a five year old child if K can't see that a five year old that massive change. That that is age appropriate developmentally appropriate. You are not responsible for her feelings. you're doing a lot probably of taking she's lost her son, I would hope to have anybody say anything that is not. toward her and supportive of her and. That is not for you to solve. But it doesn't seem to be all right. That your that your daughter she she and we, the way you can phrase, it is she's said, and you know kids can change their mind, but at this point what she's sharing is she wants to be here you don't say what not so that's a little word game Oh, she says she really wants to be here. So that can be a way of phrasing it that doesn't sting as much to someone else but ultimately. You can ask and say that hurts your feelings. You can ask and care. And I may have been kind of. stewing and struggling with contacting you because I was kind of part of me thinking I didn't want to hurt your feelings Okay, and with with with my daughter's preference and you know it could change again. And i've got it i've got to kind of watch her and see see where it goes. And how are you doing around it okay. care. These are the truths, we cannot manipulate each other, I know, it seems weird that you might be up to that you're trying to spare her pain it's still manipulative. Trying to control someone else's reaction and you're going to maybe get an even uglier one. it's so bizarre what we humans do. There is nothing wrong with the truth. And the truth might have been even something else could have been like you don't want to go. And that would have been Okay, too."
11746.0,Patient,"yeah. I feel Another thing I just want to. share with you about my overall battle or struggle with this is that I know she's not in the best health and. I don't want something to happen to her, you know, God forbid, something happened to her and I didn't. You know, push more to get the GG there, then I would feel guilt and shame about that and so it's. it's just really hard it's really hard yeah."
105.0,Provider,"Then you share it, it will transform when you share that you're trying to do all of the thinking for all three of you. It will change there's nothing wrong with what you're saying we say it, we say i'm so conflicted K. It if something was to happen to this relationship, and all of a sudden, the fights knowing could travel. For years, you know some catastrophic you know make something if you want to you're not going to die you don't want to say that okay fine too good maybe I don't know but anyway and. I would just beat myself up terribly I want you to have a relationship with gigi I look at you, and I see how you look at her, and I imagine, in my mind how you look at her and how you see those eyes, I look at her, and I see Darren in there too. I am in a struggle. She wants to be here, trying to way that her preference. And I want this relationship. There are some other factors, the timing was ideal before you know there's the timing and there's some financial constraints, but really K it comes down to this conflict of trying to way. You know. I listened to her. As hard. and say hey how you doing around that yeah Oscar. Now that's just let that be there they're just like that I don't mind going into role playing really if you tell me. The kind of person she is she's going to be. Completely dismissive of the needs of gigi and say just get her out around which problem is I don't know what kind of personality we're talking about here. So i'm happy to go to to an extreme, but I just wanted you to first get a sense of permission that there's just nothing wrong with being in this human struggle, a come, all the way out of it come, all the way out and say, well, for goodness sake i'm so glad that K wants. to know chichi that there's love there that's come, all the way out, you say this conflict even exists, we can say that kind of thing. That this challenge for me exists because I love my daughter so much and you love her so much we all want to you know have these relationships and do the right thing and i'm having to weigh out, you know some of the challenges with me, making both of you have to be. stuck in the middle, and this is hard."
11746.0,Patient,"it's really hard i've been really like in shutdown mode because of it, because I feel like I feel like darren's watching me and he's disappointed and what i'm doing and I feel. I feel so guilty about it, and I feel like I can't not meet you, no matter what I can't make a good decision. Oh, and I can keep everybody happy, you know and and when I talked to Ryan about it he's. he's like well she should understand that you know she's a little girl and she's not gonna you know go there more than she's you know lucky if you even let her stay one night, and you know I mean he's he's, on the other end of it he's. he's looking at it from strictly how GG GG point of view, he does not care about K or case feelings."
105.0,Provider,"guys see that but you're you but you do and that's what you're you're in this. And what i'm trying to give to you that I don't think you were giving yourself permission for is there's nothing you can't tell okay. there's nothing there's nothing wrong with what you're talking about you're not a bad person, but you did share some interesting things about truly may not be disappointing. Okay, might be disappointing Darren. Really. So share that to notice you didn't get any weird reaction from me like that makes sense. You wanna you want to be this this good mother, that if he is watching over or something you know it's like want to do right by this child and his family."
11746.0,Patient,"Thank you, I mean you said that, I mean 100% I that's what I want to do is, I want to do right plane, I feel I owe them that."
105.0,Provider,"You always. Interesting phrase. i'm not sure what to do with that. sweetie, what do you, what do you mean you call him back."
11746.0,Patient,"Because it's because I still feel you know. I feel bad about how he died, I still feel like I could have done something had, I called that day and because I haven't truly gotten over that. I carried a lot of that with me, and so I feel like I have to make. right that wrong somehow."
105.0,Provider,"I don't know that you're going to be a satisfied with the ledger when you you think you tally those things up at the end, a year from now, whenever I don't know that you're going to be so satisfied. You go and you sacrifice you do your obligation behaviors you go ahead, you do them and now time has passed and there's more they want more. When does it end how much is enough, how do you measure one thing against another I don't know that you're going to be satisfied with this this scale."
11746.0,Patient,"You know, when you said that it reminded me of many instances in my life, where I have done that, and I have not. I have given so much of something too much of myself in some way, even where there was emotional or time and I have not been satisfied in the end, on how that really played out. And I have a bad habit of doing that."
105.0,Provider,"Maybe there really is no ledger for this. Maybe the way to read it is just to the next loving thing he does the filter that you've been using maybe that was the thing that was slide. Just do the next loving thing. And it will be hard, sometimes, because these are both loving things. But speaking is loving to being able to say I had K I don't want to do this, one on my own i'm really conflicted i'm conflicted. It would be so sweet, and I would feel so good to see you two together. And I look at my daughter and she's saying, she wants something and i'm trying to reinforce that her preferences matter that I hear her. Pardon me hope she changes her mind so i'm at this point it's not there just how you doing around this case, how you doing with this, you know included or now you're communicating you know, there is connection in doing that. And you're not in this battle, all inside imagining imagining imagining. and I use this a lot and I say give what you have to give nothing more, nothing less just get that you want present. And that's a boundary issue. Now, how you speak to K is this other piece. Will I be sure. How you speak to her yeah matters you'll maybe some take some notes, you might write some things down but it's really. How do you stay true to yourself on that psychological level, you can rehearse a few phrases that can be helpful for you, but I think mostly it's going to be in it Okay, that my answer is no snow. i'm going to give I have to give I don't I can't I can't quite do it i'm gonna keep watching her to keep listening to her keep weighing this out, and I want to keep hearing from you too Okay, I am having a hard time with this one. Just all teed up beautifully Now let me ask you something was GG saying i'm kind of excited about going before was there, she wasn't negative about it, are we ignoring it then what was she saying in before."
11746.0,Patient,"While we had we want, we were going to stay a couple extra days and we wanted to do something fun with her, you know whether it was before after she came back from seeing K so she's excited about those things. But she's really not. You know she really was like I don't I don't think I can stay more than two nights mommy I think that's, all I can state. So that's why I had kind of said well that that's where I had said two days, because I felt I thought, maybe three I thought at least three days, I would like her to stay three days, but she just said, I don't think I can."
105.0,Provider,And does she say why your daughter say why.
11746.0,Patient,She said because i'm going to miss you too much.
105.0,Provider,And you don't want to stay there with K.
11746.0,Patient,"No, I do not. i'm going to be yeah very honest about that I don't. I don't want to. stay there, and there's a bunch of reasons, but I just don't want."
105.0,Provider,Any guilt around that.
11746.0,Patient,"No. I. know I really don't feel guilty about that because I just you know I just. she's not my cup of tea, to be honest, I mean just i'm not into. A lot of the things that. that she is and there's just a lot of things I know about her she's just not my favorite person in the whole world, I do care about her so much because she's darren's mom and I want her to be happy and have a relationship with gigi I just don't feel that I have to."
105.0,Provider,"So maybe she doesn't like her, that much either."
11746.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know I mean she when she talks to gigi on the like the tablet. I have you know they'll spend quite a bit of GG will show her all of her toys in her room she doesn't really know her. And I don't say anything bad about her, and I think where my distaste from K comes from is there's a lot of things I know about her. As a mom how she was with Darren that I don't like. So God doesn't know any of that stuff you know if I look decade now, like just the person she is if I didn't know any of the other things you know she looks like a very great person, you know. she's a little too religious for my taste and I don't like that part of it so that's where I don't like it, but I don't mind if GG you know she to GG to church and. She spends a lot of hours at church. I don't know how gigi is gonna you know do with that, but I didn't even bring that up to gigi I mean God doesn't know anything about that stuff."
105.0,Provider,"All right, well let's um let's refresh about where you started thinking about we talked about kind of walk through your mind. Moving forward these relationships will continue. Your dilemma hasn't shifted what you're going to do, how you're going to do it and what's left for us to work on."
11746.0,Patient,"I definitely. I appreciate everything that you've said that, I mean that's how I feel I understand about the. shame and about the guilt and what I need to. distinguish here that my my own thoughts. are correct the way I went about it, perhaps is not. The best way, as far as communication goes, but my. You know reasoning behind it was was right, it was the truth and."
105.0,Provider,"Accurate, not only was it the truth, but your intentions were to spare people's feelings, you were trying to not have K feel sad. And remember that you can say that. can say it to her. I didn't I didn't want you to say. Trying to manage don't want my daughter, to be sad don't want you to be sad and really conflicted. I want to keep an eye on this and watch and see if. She changes kids change every day, certainly over a month or two time they change i'll take a look at whether I can afford the flight i'll see if she can. Or if there if it would happen on a break there's a lot of moving parts to this and whether it would line up with your schedule okay."
11746.0,Patient,"yeah, I just wanted to write down those few notes, because that's it's so funny that's what I keep forgetting, as I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but that is. The reason behind all of this, otherwise I would I mean if I had just some Florida trip plan that I couldn't make it. I mean I wouldn't feel anything I only feel this way because I don't want to hurt her at all I know she's been she's struggling herself and she's going through a hard time."
105.0,Provider,"But to child is not upon just not upon. she's we did this right, we know she's gonna come up here is top priority as many parents do it's going to rise to the top it's going to be child child child child child more times than not."
11746.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah so I just I need to communicate. I have to, and especially because I don't like this feeling of avoidance either it's not a good feeling."
105.0,Provider,it's awful isn't it.
11746.0,Patient,it's awful So if I can just. get over that I need to. i'm going to communicate with her after this because I eat it's been that wing for me.
105.0,Provider,"If you change it to do you see that it's a kindness to share what you're about to share with her, I don't know what she's making up in her head. But what you're about to share with her is kind it's I want you to have this connection with gigi and this thing just fell apart, when she got sick, how are you doing around it okay that's kind that's not mean. it's checking in with someone it's showing that you care about them, so your motivation for getting on the phone or texting how we go about it. it's compassionate. don't mean it's a loving thing to do, let's consider it hey avoiding. You know I logically I know why you're doing it. Do you know what to say because, again, you haven't role played her I don't know how she sounds and what she does. You concerned about her pushing back or you think you might not be able to hold on to your no."
11746.0,Patient,"I think I will be able to I don't know what to say. Like she's been sharing a while she's been sending me some links about bringing Jesus into my life, which I think is maybe a."
105.0,Provider,that's a problem.
11746.0,Patient,yeah I think it's like he's telling me that i'm not.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so before we do that, and am I going there, but just around this topic is there a fear that we have not addressed she going to say something do something, will you will not be able to hold on to your boundary."
11746.0,Patient,I know she's going to say when When will you come there. And I don't know what to say that.
105.0,Provider,"Perfect we're going to do it now well fine So when I really I need to plan my life, I really want to see her and I miss her when when can you guys fly out. So don't say anything just sit there for a moment, and this is. want you to think through. running through why you were saying the know and setting the boundaries, to begin with, just think about it. get real clear about it."
11746.0,Patient,I really can can't answer that right now.
105.0,Provider,"And you know why, just so I know what's the reason."
11746.0,Patient,Because ggs preference right now is to be home.
105.0,Provider,uh huh yeah.
11746.0,Patient,"And I you know I will watch her, for you know and then of course she's a child and that changes all the time, so I will you know be looking looking for those signs for those cues that she's ready."
105.0,Provider,"And now you can do the emotional thing if you've got you can remember it and you've got the wherewithal you can say Okay, how do you feel about that try that on see how it feels to say that asked me how i'm doing."
11746.0,Patient,"So K, how do you feel about all that."
105.0,Provider,"All yeah I like that that sounded very genuine. Well i'm disappointed, I want to steer. wish you guys could do it soon. And you just repeat yourself just repeat it didn't it doesn't this stuff isn't fancy it's just honest. yeah i'm conflicted you might say, I really want her to see you too and i'm a little bummed that she's not like dieted fly out there would be so much more convenient I would be so less conflicted what's wrong with troth."
11746.0,Patient,what's wrong with the truth right.
105.0,Provider,"yeah not a darn thing. you're not used to that you didn't grow up with that. You you use the avoidant thing and repression and boxing things up there's really nothing wrong with it. The stuff you think your daughter's bad because she doesn't want to go over there, you would never tell her that and really you should want to. help you wouldn't say to her Oh, of course, not so that's that's why i'm saying when you're talking with her keeping this little thing that I had this little you know what is my core value. raising a daughter that feel seen and respected and that her feelings even she's a person to stardom she cares. that's important to you teaching her something, and you don't have you know, then there comes this stuff of the way we deliver it I have access to a very. sort of playful in my voice, I can kind of go oh I wanna I want to teach her how to do this, see how I do that. Oh, I want to teach her that i'm really listening to her, and I can I can honor her preferences for things and weighing it with really wanting her to. do things that are a little more adventurous, and the little unknown and and so i'm kind of in the middle of that so i'm going to keep an eye on things for a while you go bag and how you doing around that K. But you're the mom you are the boss, then, no matter how you cut it so yeah yeah."
11746.0,Patient,"Okay i'll give it a whirl. see what happens i'm going to you know try my best and that's, all I can do, and you know I really at the end of the day, you're right I don't have any control of how she's going to feel. How she's going to take it, I can just see the my truth is gentle as I can, and. And there's really nothing wrong with it, I mean it's not coming from a bad place at all."
105.0,Provider,"And those those are safe phrases, I feel conflicted and things that I say this to everybody, as much as I can memorize the phrase. What you're sharing is important, what you're saying is important now think about that. and important. And i'll think about that. The God thing, by the way the Jesus that you just memorize that you can use it everywhere. face is important, how you feel strongly okay about your your spiritual connection to God. I don't think about them period, you make no commitment. it's a deeply personal thing. And she just because you know you guys are in a program you're going to be hearing that word boundary until you just don't want to hear the word anymore. Okay, but it is still so relevant that because you're getting better at knowing where yours are and protecting them versus what you, you would just avoid. An escape instead you just keep you do this, you have to keep doing this people don't see them there's no actual hand there so they're going to push God and they're going to push their agenda they're going to keep pushing you have to still keep saying. I can't do that and the quicker you get to the know the better oh I can't do that I wish I could different different timing, let me see if anything changes about situation and how you feel. And when you say how do you feel it also kind of gets it off your shoulders, by the way, now you've got someone answering a question."
11746.0,Patient,yeah I mean us thing that just reminds me so much of how my boundaries that has been the biggest problem in my life.
105.0,Provider,"yeah these are huge issues you are not alone you everyone in growth is going through the same darn thing. And even the most mature the most adults and adults out there they're still having to set reset said it again. it's up to the person to set the boundary, it is not going to be other people, seeing them they're going to be pushing their agenda we tell ourselves a lie, we use the word should and say they should know by now."
11746.0,Patient,"A lot to work on, but i'm. i'm happy to be learning this because I didn't learn it before."
105.0,Provider,And nobody does we have parents would just say shut up be quiet and behave look good get good grades be quiet be polite that's it that's that's the training.
11746.0,Patient,"yeah well I want I want God to grow up with you know i'm you're going to have you share some points with me, next time, maybe or another time about how I can instill those in her door I don't not pushing mine beliefs upon her."
105.0,Provider,"If you're doing look what look you just did it by saying I see you daughter she's trying to set her boundaries I don't want to go you're teaching her by saying I see you I hear you have a preference you matter. You matter you're doing it oh you're doing it okay. it's so much more powerful than because then that cutting that word boundaries in mean absolutely nothing but that you can be in the moment saying. You really want to go on this swing and you don't want to go get your hair cut Okay, I get that you want to play first wanna play first right hmm, how do we do it what's your idea, how do we get this haircut, how do we get that swing in. You know. Yes, happy to talk about because you're the executive functioning of this little one she doesn't have that. That part of her brain developed yet so. But just know that when you do this work that is hard. it's going to be easier and easier for you to teach it to her. Okay yeah i'll come more naturally to you know take pride in it."
11746.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to keep working at it, because it's really important to me. We don't have anything set up for next well I don't know what you have next week or or whenever next. Week."
