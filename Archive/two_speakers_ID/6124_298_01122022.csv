298.0,Provider,"Magdalena, how can I help you today."
6124.0,Patient,"um I was talking to. Valerie Valerie and I spoke to her at length about my feelings about my medication meeting adjustments. And I think it. hasn't happened. As of yet, because I haven't been consistent enough in my care and my own care to make it consistent enough for my providers to make those decisions. You know so. So I I understand why it has happened. With my whole life. pretty much since my 30s is pretty much known that I i've kind of self never been diagnosed that kind of self diagnose, because I have all the criteria for diagnosis for bipolar two. And the way that they're the mood patterns of their. it's bipolar too, because I go into depression on a monthly basis. It impacts it impacted every relationship in my life I have. Besides, my boyfriend and my kids. And those. People have forgiven me many, many, many times. of my words and how hurtful I can be an uncontrolled with my emotions that can be and but other than that I haven't been able to maintain any relationship in my life and it's because of my I have. These ups and downs that are so dramatic and I become a different person. and Right now i'm in a depressive mood I can feel it I just feel myself, I can I can just feel myself not feel right. And what I was talking to Valerie about is that i've done all my research i've done all the you know read all the data and. Looked at the DSM, for you know five and. And I really want to be put on lithium I really want to start my cell phone lithium because. I think it's the most. proven medication to combat combat the ups and downs of 5. million you and and I just want to, I want to take that I want to start bipolar treatment. And I say."

298.0,Provider,And are you you're not taking the hydro accessing for anxiety.
6124.0,Patient,"I am. That, if I turn on my like clockwork."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and I have a cute little story about lithium do you want me to share it with you."
6124.0,Patient,"Of course, I want to hear your thoughts about lithium."
298.0,Provider,"So i'm i'm up here right on the border of California and Oregon where lithium is in the rocks because it's a salt and everything in ashland Oregon is like lithium motors or lithium restaurant, I mean it's just everybody is livia. Well, it came to be that you. could bring jugs empty Jones and go to the town Center and get water and people would come from everywhere, with their jugs to get the water that has all the lithium in it, because it's a natural salt. And so they finally had to shut down the town square fountain because causing so much you know problems and lithium is good, the reason why people like lithium is because it's a mood stabilizer there's a feeling of well being, it is the gold standard when treating somebody who has. suicidal thoughts like lithium has been known to help with those intrusive thoughts, more than any other medication, but lithium. You know, naturally, it just lifts your mood and works on depression. But here's the thing about lithium, that is why they shut it down the main reason is there's a very narrow window of what is safe, you can go toxic on it. Or, which is too much or you can undertreated and not get the effect of that you want so that's my blood us are needed. To make sure that you're a good candidate and that it's working well for you, and if you are up to doing the blood test, and I say why not give it a try heck i'd like to go on lithium."
6124.0,Patient,"i'm so glad to hear that because. Yes, I know of the very, very narrow therapeutic range and I was going to actually request that we do follow my lithium levels is specifically for me, because I do hot yoga so it's. it's really dehydration is a is impacting the therapeutic level a lot and kidney function, so I would want to make sure that i'm staying optimally hydrated because of that reason alone, just because i'm always trying to keep up with my hydration because I do hot yoga almost every day."
298.0,Provider,"wonder if this makes me happy. i'm just looking over your labs from when you did that for us. And can you give me a minute, while I just read over them."
6124.0,Patient,yeah yeah go ahead i'm going to start walking inside my clinic because of. My break his interview.
298.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean. I need to get going, but. Okay, only i'll need to see you in groups, so we can continue to increase the amount till we get. To the point that you feel stabilized now. My thought is that continued been lamictal, which is a mood stabilizer but, once we get the lithium up there, then come off of some limits to what are your thoughts."
6124.0,Patient,"Whatever you think whatever you have seen work I you know, like like I said I I feel like nothing has really made the difference, so if this, this is the difference by itself and i'm willing to take off anything that we can take off, you know. yeah that would be."
298.0,Provider,Okay well i'm awesome so glad that you have read up on this and I will start with the starting dose i'll See you in group we're MED follow up whatever you decide and make sure you chat me okay. And do you have my email address.
