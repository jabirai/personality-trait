298.0,Provider,Do it.
6867.0,Patient,"Yes, and no I mean I i'm still dealing with the death of my dog really hit me really hard and. And the thing is it triggers it with me because i've seen too much. Too much death in my life i've seen too much of it i've experienced too much of it. And it just every time it just takes it just harder and harder for me to like snap out of it."
298.0,Provider,"And and. The death of a dog can be as big as the death of a close family member, if not worse, and the reason is, we allow dogs into a portion of our psyche into our heart, you know we allow dogs to get very close to us and um and there's just it's a deep hole when they pass."
6867.0,Patient,yeah we had her for for 12 years.
298.0,Provider,hmm.
6867.0,Patient,"And I was just one that she picked up on, I was just the one that she hooked on to so. That was kind of hard."
298.0,Provider,"yeah, that is, are you wanting to have you lost your sobriety are you wanting."
6867.0,Patient,"or no, no. As a matter of fact, I. Not too long ago I celebrated one year of sobriety. So I. i'm not, I have no inclination to step backwards after working hard to achieve that. So now I I just try I deal with it in other ways, I mean i've been i've been smoking a lot more. and You know I don't I don't drink I don't or anything like that so. they're just times larger shut down. Where I do don't. Talk I don't you know do much of anything."
298.0,Provider,"Now you have somebody prescribing medications to you, do you know that was somebody else sorry go ahead."
6867.0,Patient,yeah that now that I don't. The only thing i'm on right now it's a box and that's it.
298.0,Provider,"Because this is situational like. i'm hoping that this does not develop into a depression, that means that your serotonin levels really get out of whack i'm hoping that this is situational and you'll be able to talk it through, and you know work through it, are you in counseling."
6867.0,Patient,"Besides talking with amanda not really. i've I mean, and you know we're still dealing with grandma to and everything and she's you know, so I know her is is not that far off either so. You know, so that so that one's going to get me too so it's her like oh my God."
298.0,Provider,yeah. But you know what you're having participatory anxiety over what's coming and that's hard on your brain stop it.
6867.0,Patient,yeah i'm just exhausted me sometimes.
298.0,Provider,It says it's very exhausting how's your sleep.
6867.0,Patient,"sleep is all right i'm or your early to bed early to rise and everything but. i'm so. Like busy during the day and everything that every time I sit down, I start to pass out and go to sleep because i'm. always going back checking on grandma and also you know doing housework and keeping up keep here so. So I don't I don't sit still very often."
298.0,Provider,that's good and bad. You know I mean. Is there anything that you wanted to go over today.
6867.0,Patient,"i'm. not really I mean the main thing I mean the main thing cuz I know we keep talking about triggers and everything like that and. And so, and like bit me, I mean. Once I kind of like get def stuck in my head and everything like that so it's really hard to like push it out or push it out everything like that and. There are some there are just some days in which it just. Those are the days I just like shut down."
298.0,Provider,"So can I suggest something. There have been some studies out there that show that people with ptsd have low serotonin levels, I was just thinking about this. One if we were to do like Prozac which has been known to increase people's moods for better and see if you responded to like a low dose and it pulled you out of those funds that you're getting in. And you know good."
6867.0,Patient,yeah i'm willing to try anything at this point.
298.0,Provider,"I think that that would be a good choice for you. I want you to give it time to work but. All I want to do to right now is just to make sure that you don't have really negative side effects that you can't live with, because the side effects could be an upset stomach. You could. Have GI problems, because in your stomach is 90% of your serotonin in your body. And when I give a serotonin medicine there's always that possibility but i'm going to give you a low dose and if you do well with it and you don't have then we'll go to the next dose that will be more therapeutic. Take one CAP P O, and let me know on Thursday how well, you did taking this okay."
6867.0,Patient,All right.
298.0,Provider,"All right, and I think you might see surprisingly pretty fast. within a week or two that it's starting to lift your mood."
6867.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I just remember cuz i've just been noticing it's like you know when I first started with you guys and everything I mean my my mood and everything was so upbeat so happy and everything like that, then all of a sudden now so it's like it's just going down and down and down."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm well let's try to pick it back up again.
6867.0,Patient,yeah I want to see the Michael that I like.
298.0,Provider,Happy Michael.
6867.0,Patient,yeah me too I haven't seen that Michael for a while.
298.0,Provider,I hear you I hear you. All right. Are you feeling suicidal.
6867.0,Patient,"No, I just get to a point where you know, or sometimes. Because I don't have that many people left in my family my immediate family everyone's pretty much gone and. And sometimes you get to feeling, even though you were in a House full of people you still feel so very alone. And sometimes I get that way you know just like you know."
298.0,Provider,well. write me and group or stay after in group to tell me how you're feeling okay.
