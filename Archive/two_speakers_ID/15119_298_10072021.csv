298.0,Provider,"And for depression. What medicine, have you tried in the past for anxiety and depression."
15119.0,Patient,"So many long lists. That are on. on and on and love you Trent. I don't know. It really helped to fold that it. I guess it helped a little bit, because when I stopped taking it, I felt like much worse I just saw I guess that probably helped like maybe 20 30%. not really."
298.0,Provider,"So well future and helps with motivation in life, it really doesn't help with anxiety. So if you need more get up and go that's what wellbutrin would do it works on dopa me. Transit down. is usually it helps with sleep."
15119.0,Patient,"Right so that's what that was. The point I guess, I was taking supposed to take the word eternal in the morning, which day and then pass it on a night Tommy sleep sometimes they would help, sometimes it would. I guess is the situation, oh yeah."
298.0,Provider,"And sometimes. People need a. dope I mean. which is what the wealth uterine, but they need serotonin to help with the anxiety and depression and that's a. Different medication all together. Tell me about tell me about your anxiety."
15119.0,Patient,"Oh. noes getting much worse. I didn't realize I realize how bad it was but i'm. Like really nervous about. Doing almost everything when it comes to go on our side. well. sergeant my nerves are really bad and it's hard for me to concentrate and i'm like really sometimes just even scared to get on the freeway. Driving oh no when I was working at like computers like an hour drive but it made me nervous, especially at night, and then, especially when I was working at horny shift to be that five and. 530, and this is somebody have a commuter town and I live in so like crazy traffic on the freeway in the morning, but not like really heavy some people would drive really fast and. I was nervous but man i'm just really, really nervous about like everything I don't even like walking at night anymore Oh, the job I just felt comfortable I couldn't do anything right. wasn't really concentrating very well because my manager so bad because I was always second guessing myself, you know, make it make a mistake and so. I felt bad because a lot of the people that will call up there were. Senior citizens or or maybe not, but it was a lot of fraudulent activity. will call saying all of them and i'm like oh great. Maybe even not even yeah within the first week I kind of been on the floor and taking the calls, I really started to figure out that they're kind of scamming people are you know. doing things better to me with seem unethical like an ethical business practices. But I don't feel comfortable with that either so anyway just nervous about everything I have this friend i'm scared of him I don't even know why well I know why but. I usually not that scary and i'm like so scared to the point where i'm like lying to him because i'm. Thinking something happens somebody pulled a gun out of me a few months ago to so you really. Like shaky and to. get to go people in life and. I don't trust the share everything just makes me nervous i'm like some happen."
298.0,Provider,"And, have you started counseling to."
15119.0,Patient,"Know i've been missing those appointments i'm trying there's some technical difficulties, a couple times and then I overslept. The last appointment completely up. I. don't know if I forgot it well, I did very good and then I did oversleep too, because my schedule at that time I was working 1:30pm 8pm to 10pm and that. I wasn't sleeping well at night so. yeah just overslept."
298.0,Provider,"Have you ever tried circling for depression, anxiety."
15119.0,Patient,know is that the the name brand.
298.0,Provider,know the name brand is zoloft.
15119.0,Patient,Okay yeah I think I have tried so long.
298.0,Provider,Before work for.
15119.0,Patient,I can't say did I can't say I can't really recall actual effect now okay so yeah might be mixed up with Sarah coil but if this.
298.0,Provider,"is almost no no very different. Very different zoloft is used it treats anxiety, especially social anxiety, but it also treats depression any one of the serotonin medications they just are tweaked a little. And so what i'm listening for is your symptoms and which medication to choose, but I really don't know until we try the side effect of zoloft. The outcome is people usually start to get their anxiety under control, they don't feel that feeling of doom and gloom something bad's going to happen. But it takes time to get to a therapeutic dose it takes four to six weeks for us to really start seeing results. It just as a good medicine for anxiety and depression. Oh that's Oh, I know what I was going to tell you the side effect is. It can upset your stomach when you're starting it, but it doesn't necessarily do that to everyone, and the reason it can is 90% of our serotonin is in our stomach. And so, when we give a medication for serotonin your stomach can feel it until it gets to your brain and so that's my recommendation that we start that and we get you. On your appointments for. This you know."
15119.0,Patient,"We are now that i'm not working, oh God, I feel so bad about quitting that job because. Anyway, this just doesn't be easier, now that i'm not working."
298.0,Provider,yeah it will be easier for you. Take two tabs so how you're going to start it is one tablet once a day for the first week and then the next week take two tablets.
15119.0,Patient,Once a day.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15119.0,Patient,So. What what is it best to take that in the morning.
298.0,Provider,"you're gonna have to figure out if you take it and you feel sleepy than I would do it at night, if you take it and you get energy, then you need to take it in the morning and and every every I can't even predict which response people go."
15119.0,Patient,So it could cause drowsiness and excitability.
298.0,Provider,Exactly depending on the person you give a person serotonin and they might be so deficient in it that it pumps them up into energy and other people any time you give them a new medication. They feel like they want to take a nap So the first time you take it you'll probably know which way you're going to go.
15119.0,Patient,"Are you going to be able to prescribe me something for this, I mean."
298.0,Provider,"i'm already on two medications right and prescribing two medicines right now i'm afraid of a third one being added until I know that you've got on these two and then I will treat your insomnia. And I will be happy to it's just three medications we won't even know what the problem is, if we do that."
15119.0,Patient,"So, how does this. He said it's something to take away alcohol cravings How does that work that type of side."
298.0,Provider,"And also now tracks own um How does it work. i'm gonna have to get some help on, let me go to my book, have to explain the mechanism of action to you."
15119.0,Patient,I guess i'm. i'm wondering if to with side effects that's exhales oh.
298.0,Provider,"And that's another one that it can upset your stomach, not to say would, but it could."
15119.0,Patient,"Have stomach problems, I mean it's. I have ibs and then I just I guess bad nerves that probably causes some stomach pain to."
298.0,Provider,Oh wow um.
15119.0,Patient,"I mean. it's temporary, I guess, I could try."
298.0,Provider,"So this doesn't mean much but it's an opioid antagonist. And that's how it works it you, you can drink and still take this medicine, but you just your desire goes down for it."
15119.0,Patient,Now about already taken narcos how's that gonna enter.
298.0,Provider,"it's going to be terrible. To take no you. cannot do this medication, if you are taking narcos so are you prescribed narcos. Then i'm canceling this prescription. I did not have that written down that you were on norco sorry, you cannot take this medicine, it would make it so that the narcos would not be effective."
15119.0,Patient,Because yeah i'm like antagonist that sounds like a bad.
298.0,Provider,It would. yeah. Good thought so um I let's talk about sleep um. If you have ID ass.
15119.0,Patient,"For what I actually do because the normals my pain management, they prescribe. Colleagues, and what's the de niro lots but I don't take nearly as much but i'm going to start, because just being constipated is this oh painful for me."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I recommend murtaza teen. You can take a whole tablet if you want to. it's not the. it's stronger than transit don't. Waste way way stronger than transit down. But it's not addictive, and it is not um it's not addictive let's see what else about it um."
15119.0,Patient,So.
298.0,Provider,"The name of it is murtaza teen it is used for at 7.5 milligrams it is used for sleep at 30 milligrams 15 or 30 milligrams it's used for depression. and not necessarily anxiety, though. And so. 7.5 milligrams I have people who have to cut the tablet and half a lot of people because it's 7.5 milligrams is too strong for them. It just it's too strong, so if you wake up and you can't wake up and you're really groggy, then you need to cut it in half to."
15119.0,Patient,"Okay, so I was thinking that's how the Sarah quote made me feel like really."
298.0,Provider,"And this is not like seroquel like this is not a anti psychotic medication, this is one of the antidepressants that we use only for the while we didn't use it. If it turns out that you don't respond well to circling the zoloft, then we would probably end you do respond well to the murtaza team at nighttime we may just go up on the murtaza pain. The problem with murtaza pain is at higher doses you run the risk of gaining weight and I don't want to do that to you."
15119.0,Patient,"Our really. I just lost her way i'm really depressed another one. Oh mama or eating as much anymore i'm not using food as a drug like I used to sometimes they do, but i'm conscious of like gaining weight and eating too much sugar I don't. See myself me too much weight. it's definitely possible if I get into too much of a phone. All right, well. When you mentioned is non addictive it kind of. discouraged me from bringing it up, but i'm not one point in the past that Kaiser behavioral health they prescribed me out event to assist with me not drinking anymore."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, it added van is used for. withdrawals for when your drink when a person is a heavy drinker and they go to stop they can have seizures and add a van is to help with. Making sure you don't have seizures having said that it's very addicting and it and you build tolerance really easily with that."
15119.0,Patient,So.
298.0,Provider,"I think two medications is enough let's get working on your anxiety and your insomnia, and we'll work with your alcohol use and another visit okay. All right, take care of. Any suicidal."
15119.0,Patient,we're going to send out to write it is that already in my chart.
298.0,Provider,it's already sent to write it yeah. And do you have any suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
15119.0,Patient,"No it's not funny but I don't know I wanted to laugh, but no I don't. know no, no, no."
298.0,Provider,"All right, take care. bye Thank you."
