And yeah it just. It. Just spiraled downhill from there, I started taking. Some tools with intend to you know commit suicide and. She runs in and she gets home I don't remember where she is as all. it's all very foggy but she comes in, and I remember her taking my bottles of pills, because I had xanax lyric on some other stuff and.

16781.0,Patient,"Yes, I see a therapist right now, once a week, I have a psychiatrist that i've been seeing for a while, see him, maybe every three months right now. But I wanted to check this out because he had me on the events. Which is great for my anxiety and me to focus and everything. And, but then he had me taking xanax at night to help hold me down and stabilize myself. Which is old school but guys I know is really affecting my moods. But yes i've taken therapy and. And psychiatry and the medications was there something else in there, yes."

462.0,Provider,"Sorry, so there's seems like there is a connection there. And in the past, would you say that you ever drink excessively or was it more socially."
16781.0,Patient,"In the past, is socially and the last two years it's became a little too excessive um. yeah I didn't think I had a problem for a while, I never got to where I was drinking all day long or anything is just you know a little bit of self medication to bring my anxiety down in the afternoon."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. Our. substance use the legal drugs, maybe addiction to prescription drugs anything like that."
16781.0,Patient,"i'm not diction to legal drugs, I have used like ecstasy and. I had mushrooms back in the past."
462.0,Provider,"And how many times, would you say you used those two things."
16781.0,Patient,"mushrooms only like. Two or three times. Ecstasy, I was going to raves quite a quite a bit in my mid to late 20s and. yeah i'd say for about a year year and a half is. 12123 times a month we're going to arrive and that's when I was taking ecstasy, but. I stopped that and it's been over seven years."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and how about any history of addiction and your family or mental health."
16781.0,Patient,And addiction for sure my grandfather has an alcoholic. Nobody in my immediate family right now. And then mental health nobody's been diagnosed really but. It seems to be like my sister might have bipolar from what for therapists had said before she stopped seeing her and then ADHD it seems like with a few of my family but they're never really diagnose.
462.0,Provider,"All right, and can you just tell me where you were born, who raised, you and I guess who's in your family."
16781.0,Patient,"I was born in rain rain a valley California i'm wondering, is there and then. It was my mom dad brother and sister and tell us by eight years old and then. My parents got divorced and i'd say around 12. My mom found my stepfather they didn't get married until I moved out in 18 but he moved in with us and he's pretty much my stepfather. And then my brother was 11 years older so when he turned 18 he moved out. And then it's just my sister, and I, my mom and stepfather for a while, but 18 I moved out. yeah that was that all the questions you asked her."
462.0,Provider,"If that was perfect and, what is your relationship like, with your family members currently."
16781.0,Patient,"i'm my sister and I don't talk she's always been very manipulative and coming to find out and reading more about mental health and stuff it seems like she's very narcissistic and she's always trying to pull you back into drama so i'm staying away from that. My mother and. mom dad and brother, we all get along very well i'm real close to them, but my dad's in Oklahoma my moms are being all over the country and brother is a. Cross country truck driver, so I rarely. I rarely see my brother most because he comes and drops off in La quite a bit. But they're all out out in the country, you know my sisters out night. we're all spread out yeah."
462.0,Provider,"All right, and I know you sort of mentioned a little bit in group but i'll just have you will go through it now so who are you currently living with it seems like there was a change in your living situation. Somewhat recently, can you describe that to me."
16781.0,Patient,"i'm sorry now, who I live what's this just this guy here. Hello sky."
462.0,Provider,Oh hi buddy. Good roommate right.
16781.0,Patient,yeah he is. He helped me through my break up with my ex fiance so.
462.0,Provider,Basically.
16781.0,Patient,"But yeah after the the attempt. My wife and I talked when I came back from aurora and. The gist of it is yes, she still loves me she wants to be with me, this is not a divorce, she didn't think of it that way. But she would like me to move out for a different few different reasons, one is because she needs a little bit of space because yeah me attempting. It put a lot on her, you know as like what is she she feels like she did something wrong, this is not, you know um and then. You know my mood swings she would like me to you know be my myself be more stable and stuff and not be around the kids because they have a son or daughter, who is seven and three years old i'm the son my son is my step son. i've known him since two and his father is living in Vegas so i'm pretty much his father. But she would rather them not be around us arguing when my moods go up and down. And so that's one reason and another one is. Because it's a, what do you call it the cultural difference between. her parents and I or her family and myself it's really hard because, for I live, we were living with them and, for me, going from my ex fiance and my dog to. All those people in the House it's very. Good yeah the anxiety just shut up and. that's partially why I started drinking to. Why my exciting never went down all the stress and everything and they're not bad people it's just being around so many people and not having control of or knowledge of what's going on in your own place. So that's another one just get away from that. And then there are a couple other reasons, I can think of, right now, but those are the two main ones and we've been wanting to get out, you know so in six months if everything's fine with me if i'm more stable and everything she'll move in with me, you know with the kid. You know I work at the office with her. Every day, and I still see the kids every day, except for two days a week, they with the parents. Yes, she comes over with the kids and we all eat dinner and. They stay till nine o'clock and then they come home. So it's it's good you know it's just hard, not being there in the mornings and stuff."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so it's definitely a change and change is always hard but it sounds like there is, you know. pretty strong communication between you and your wife, as far as you have a set time limit on this, you know what you want to accomplish in that time limit, you want to stabilize your moods she needs for a little bit of space after the big activating event and hopefully. It all comes together like you said in about six months. Okay, and so you it's her son your steps on and then your three year old daughter, and that is between you and her that's your mutual child. All right. And then Okay, so you said that you work in the office with her, can you describe your work to me."
16781.0,Patient,"yeah she's a licensed clinical social worker and. We have four other employees with us, but everybody's at home right now i'm doing it from home, but what I do is i'm pretty much take. Do the intake. Call or screening. just see why they're so you can therapy and all that stuff and I get all the insurance information check eligibility I do I process all the Co pays I. do some marketing with our website, I do outreach to schools, churches and like that. it's pretty much what I do. And yeah I see her every day, you know her 10 minutes in between clients she comes out and we talked a little bit you know. it's it's a nice little thing I I actually before the attempt, I was working there, and at a place called off coddle houses, a cook and I decided to quit there, because once I started there, I noticed that. My work. In our business kind of went down from like a effort to maybe a C or D. Okay, so that's one big reason because I want to put more effort into this to where we can both sustain a very well off this and eventually buy a house and then that place was toxic had some drinkers who drink at work and stuff and it kind. Of pushed me to want to drink more some. had to get away from that again so."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you do you enjoy what you're doing it sounds like you, you do, but."
16781.0,Patient,"yeah I really do I love what i'm doing um i've always loved helping people used to be a Union organizer before. Right, when I met her as one at the end of that. But that was pretty toxic to because making phone calls is constantly being. Having constructive criticism, even if you did everything right Okay, but you should do this next time, or you should do, that is just. really bad in. Helping many people in the very end so. But this just took on something totally different because I could connect with people with my. My mental health past and with my anxiety and stuff and be able to talk to them or make them comfortable and. connect them with which therapist you know would be best for them, so I love that."
462.0,Provider,Great. And how long have you been married.
16781.0,Patient,we've been married for four years now.
462.0,Provider,"Three years Okay, and do you feel safe in the marriage."
16781.0,Patient,"yeah I do, I mean it was pretty shaky right when I got out, you know cuz. I could see where she was you know afraid of them in the fight was also about. watching porn you know she's not very sexual person so once or twice a week watch that and. yeah she had finally found it, you know I didn't watch any for maybe two or three years and then just recently picked up because. Just being intimate with her maybe twice a month just it was very hard so."
462.0,Provider,So that's what that's what activated this light.
16781.0,Patient,"yeah but, and it was a little shaky after that just trying to see trying to work things out, but now i'm I there's a lot of hope there you know with. The effort she's putting into coming over here, and when I go over there, to pick up the kids she asked me to stay the other night and watch a movie with her, you know. When I dropped off. it's you know it's I said there's a lot of hope there and. Okay i'm for the ones Karen."
462.0,Provider,"that's great all right. And then, how about a friend group do you have social support a group a club and activity anything like that, where you're connected with others."
16781.0,Patient,"um. I mean, I have quite a few friends. Well, not quite a few i'd say maybe about five friends five really good friends, I don't like a bunch of friends is can't keep up with all of them. yeah five really good friends, but I don't really. Talk about my issues too much them, I have one friend I do every once in a while. But the others I don't because I don't want them to see my wife in any way or judge or anything like. I do talk to my parents my mom lived with us for five months, while she was she got a divorce from my except father and. She was transferring into the rv life, he stayed with us or five so she knows my wife and. How she is now as how I am and it's Okay, I could talk to her freely. And then I went to recently. con a 10 day silent meditation retreat. and made a. Few friends there once we were able to break the silence. And yeah keep in contact with them and. Hopefully i'll be going. To some more like little meditation things with them, you know. Great I could talk to them about quite a bit of stuff because they don't know her they don't."
462.0,Provider,Call sorry it's not so personal.
16781.0,Patient,yeah it's not so personal.
462.0,Provider,"All right, well that's good too, and then how about education, did you finish high school. Yes, Okay, and what was school like for you as a kid and team."
16781.0,Patient,"um you know, up until let's say how does it go again freshman sophomore after sophomore year I started. I mean before sophomore year I was like A and B student and then. Is a little hard before then to some once my parents divorce, just because I did dyslexia, and I stayed back one grade. Just because I think as the job force mixed with the dyslexia problems kicking in I was in third grade. And then I did pretty well, but then once my stepfather moved in. Family dynamic started changing. that's when like I I think I started going to depression, then, because he is, it is a. A correctional officer and he treated us like we were inmates pretty much. Always young I. had to have that control, you know is as hort one that but he'd be really good at faking things in pretending like everything was okay later. yeah. And so, as is pretty hard seeing my mom and him fight he got a little physical with her, but not too bad tours anything I needed to call the COPs with or anything but little pushing here and super very. abusive mentally and everything to her and to us. But it started really showing my last two years of high school and I barely graduated. Because of just everything that was going on."
462.0,Provider,Any any other schooling after high school.
16781.0,Patient,"um I tried a few times with college like I went to rcc for about a year and a half. And then I just stopped just wasn't for me and then I went back for coronary arts school. I only reason I didn't finish, that is, because when I started working at patongo. Some guy going to the same school as me he had just graduated and he was making $2 less than I was like wait wait a second, so I did more research and find out it's not your education it's. You know who you know pen your skills."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
16781.0,Patient,I was like i'm not gonna finish.
462.0,Provider,yeah. OK.
16781.0,Patient,"And now just doing courses, just to learn more like we have an ADHD course coming up, we have LGBT Q courses, you know we pay like $300 and you take the course just either get a certification, or just have some knowledge."
462.0,Provider,"And then, what age like Maybe you can pinpoint an age or in your in school or maybe it was after school, did you start experiencing mental health systems, whether it be the anxiety depression or ADHD."
16781.0,Patient,"See, I never knew about any of this until five years ago, when I started going to be programs um but once I. went there. And started realizing like what anxiety was. I could go back now and, like oh that's why."
462.0,Provider,I was.
16781.0,Patient,"You know, I was in a social situation is hard for me to do things you know that's why. You know I thought people drink when they went out because things I hate that feeling was so high, like Oh, this is going to loosen you up you know. that's why I can only stay till 12 o'clock at a club with my my ex when she wanted to stay till like three. And i'm like no, I have to go need to go now we need to go there's my anxiety I just it peaked down and, like, I have to go and before I have this panic attack which I didn't know I had before I just thought this was just me, you know. And then, about two years ago year and a half, when I found out I had ADHD like nobody told me, but I was just doing research on why a certain weight loss pill took all my anxiety away and why I wanted to be so social on that and everything and. A lot of people said yeah I wanna you took venture mean it's kind of like having adderall or you know via events and it just It makes you more focused, you know a lot of people that had that certain type of anxiety. It just kind of wiped it out so it's Okay, I read a book on ADHD, and that makes so much more sense to me, I was like wow. My whole life now I get you know put things in order, I was crazy, so I talked to a new psychiatry it's not that Kaiser ones that I was seeing at the time and he's like well Okay, let me, you know do some research on this for you on you and then he put me on. adderall at first and. Everything was great for a while, you know some, then I went to buy dance, because the mood swings are just I mean the. You know I get really excited right everyone i'd take in then had go down, so I. Did five answers longer lasting but. At night is when it when it wore off is it's really hard. So okay yeah. Okay."
462.0,Provider,"Right, how many legal history been arrested. court cases yep so anything like that, no, no. And how about any physical health or medical conditions surgeries pain health conditions autoimmune disorders anything."
16781.0,Patient,"Only thing is my knees, I really bad knee problems when I was and sixth grade I tore some ligaments. And then my weight doesn't help from about 300 pounds, five, eight, so that doesn't help my knees, other than that I don't I guess really. One other reason I quit cooking recently is because my carpal tunnel I forgot I had that when I click cooking for the Union, and then I started working at the end, and I mean. When I went back to work, recently, is just started killing me so. Other than that, no, nothing."
462.0,Provider,"And then you mentioned, you know some trauma as far as witnessing some abuse and even domestic violence in your household any other trauma throughout your life that could be physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse or anything else that you consider traumatic for you."
16781.0,Patient,"um. Two things that I can remember. One that I don't even know if it's dramatic or yet if it affecting me or not, but I remember this and I felt I guess I feel guilty on this, but when I don't even know how old I was, I was very young and. My my mom would drop me off at babysitter's house and there's probably like eight other kids being babysat there, including and then her kids as well. But her son, who was quite a few years older than me. We were in the garage him and I, and I know he asked us to touch penises and I was confused at first, then yeah. Right when we did his mom open the door and we hid um but. yeah I just so just sticks out I don't know if there isn't in there, what I know there's a little guilt for that. yeah. Little coerced. And then. One thing I think really hits on my my social anxiety is again when I was really young in grade school. I don't remember the gradient I want to say is second grade. I don't can't quite remember, but one of my teachers, she said on okay class let's go around to everybody in class and everybody needs to tell us. Tell us one embarrassing story about each other or tell one embarrassing story about each other, and I was okay. And I was thinking thinking thinking, while each person was standing up and telling their story, and I was like I don't have anything embarrassing I don't I don't get embarrassed and. And I remember okay well one time my mom's. friend walked in when I was using the restroom you know, so I told that story, and my teacher stood up she started yelling at me saying no potty humor I can't believe you said. Any parents yelling yelling yelling and then she made me go stand in the corner the rest of the day, and the kids laughing. yeah I think that. really hit me like oh that's why i'm afraid to you know talk in front of other people. That have been."
462.0,Provider,developed social anxiety right there yeah that's just horrible.
16781.0,Patient,"Sorry, I remember that same thing when I went into. Eighth grade ninth grade on what does that. hey yeah eighth grade. teacher had a score around and we had to."
462.0,Provider,Say service.
16781.0,Patient,"And up and say something about ourselves, but not about ourselves, but like my name is Michael we had to match to other words with him that kind of makes sense. And it came to my turn I was just no i'm not standing up I don't know no I don't know I don't know I can't do this nope. there's no way that somebody helping I remember her name to girl named Andrea she said okay Michael metal mouth mouth goes okay thanks, but I didn't stand up, I didn't want to add in what you're married anything."
462.0,Provider,"yeah understandable after that experience, so we do tend to go around in group and share in that manner, was that triggering for you or was it okay."
16781.0,Patient,"Nice okay cuz since i've been at when I worked at the Union we do that all the time, so it kind of opened up, but. I know how to prepare myself better, I guess, but at the same time, like if i'm in a social environment, people are talking to me and prepare for a regular conversation what they're going to ask you know."
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah true true so with group it'll be very much like what we did this last week. But if you ever feel triggered or like you don't want to share, you can always chat me privately and say that it's just like not your day to share or you can just say pass I give everyone a chance to pass on a day here there if they just can't can't do it so."
16781.0,Patient,Thanks for telling me.
462.0,Provider,"alright. So i'm going to run through a suicide assessment, what was the general date of when you attempted to commit suicide and then ended up in aurora."
16781.0,Patient,to guess October 27 okay.
462.0,Provider,And was that the first time that you've attempted to commit suicide in your life.
16781.0,Patient,"um yeah as a first time it had crossed my mind, a few times is more just passing thoughts like I can't take this anymore work wise wish somebody would hit me while i'm driving to work, you know. I thought about turning my car into the Center divider, not even to kill myself just to get out of work, sometimes, and if I died okay. You know that type of thing, but this time is such a big trigger that. Yes, I just couldn't handle it, you know."
462.0,Provider,"So so so you've had ideation throughout your life, this is your first attempt, and since you have left aurora have you been having ideation such as wishing to be dead wishing you were dead or you could go to sleep and not wake up."
16781.0,Patient,"i'm gonna say very slight runs every once in a while, but I just while I was in er I met a kid who is 18. But he grew up without a father and is really hard for him, and you know I listened to a store in it kind of opened my eyes to my kids you know and so anytime that. I start to go there and if something's hard if i'm you know, have an argument with my wife, one thing I i've been doing and i'm trying to get my mind out of that but is. You know, while I deserve this you know I deserve to be here, I did that, to my wife I you know and it'll start to go there, but I don't know you know, so I guess it starts to go there and then I pull that away and say no, I deserve this I need to suck this up, I need to take it. yeah i'm still punishing myself and away but it's not going there it's not like oh I deserve this my kids need me, so I just got to take whatever my wife gets me and then, then I calm down after I meditate and I can think rationally again."
462.0,Provider,you're able to control it and bring it around basically. yeah okay. So some ideation how about have you been having thoughts of actually killing yourself.
16781.0,Patient,I haven't had any thoughts have actually done it since i've got up.
462.0,Provider,Since you got out have you been thinking about how you might do it again.
16781.0,Patient,No.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you had any intention of acting on any of your thoughts I know we kind of already described that but I just kind of got to run through this. And, have you started to work out or worked out details of how to kill yourself, and do you intend to carry out that plan."
16781.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,"All right, and what would you say, are some of your protective factors from committing suicide so reasons for living even just fear of pain, like some of your personal protective factors."
16781.0,Patient,"i'm not the pain paste that I didn't say this, I used to cut myself when I was in high school just for the pain to distract me from others have moved on to tattoos instead but i'm. Sorry, so no not the pain, but yeah my kids really big factor. One reason I pushed really hard to find a place with that I can keep my dog here because there's a lot of places that say no dogs. Is you know I don't want I wouldn't want to. do anything in my dogs left here for who knows how long like. A character yeah. So um and then he's here, social, I mean. What is that called he's here to help me through this I forget the term for that went out but. emotional support dog that's what singing pretty much emotional support and."
462.0,Provider,that's great.
16781.0,Patient,But those are really the biggest things that. Really. helped me keep my mind away from that and just. be secure. My kids number one.
462.0,Provider,"Okay kids are number, one that makes sense. All right, so that's all the questions I have for you, but I also like to just leave it open in case you feel I missed something really big that's important to know about you."
16781.0,Patient,know I think I pretty much stopped all had in there and between two. yeah I. Think that's about it.
462.0,Provider,Okay.
16781.0,Patient,"i'm only curious about a. Actual therapy like seeing a therapist am I going to be seen you as a therapist or just a group or okay so. it's been all breaking down Monday like we we did the group, and then I had my couples session with my wife and then Tuesday I had my therapist and then. Like. yeah do this."
462.0,Provider,"One thing you can do if you don't want to receive therapy through us is, you can fill out in Roi and you can prove that you have another outside therapist that you are seeing regularly. yeah because if you are doing couples counseling and individual therapy and our group. That can be considered sufficient, but if you do want to do, individual therapy here that's fine too, what are you thinking."
16781.0,Patient,"I don't know because i've been I was talking to my therapist and he was saying, I it took me a therapist to find the right one, too. But he doesn't do regression and I think there is some needed there um. So i'm not sure, do you do regression at all or what's your style."
462.0,Provider,"I don't. You know, it just varies person by person, what kind of methods, I use I do a lot of cvt in db T stuff I do do some like inner child work right trying to re re parenting that sort of thing, but as far as regression goes, not so much so. yeah so it can really be up to you, since you did work hard already to find an outside therapist and you're doing it regularly. What we can do, maybe is book one appointment together, and it can be. Maybe, just like a little check in to see how you're doing and braveheart how the group's going right if there's anything else, I can support you with. start there and then, if you want to just continue with your outside therapist you can you know, do the paperwork for that. What do you think."
16781.0,Patient,"yeah sounds good, we can start off there and. If anything you're saying the Roi for the release and all that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and just so you know, there are our allies what you might as well do is just sign an Roi, no matter what and start getting them the process, so if you go to bright heart health COM and then go to contact us. And scroll down quite a while so scroll scroll scroll you'll see. New patient forums and you'll see Roi for provider. So you can fill one of those out for your provider and then they'll uploaded all see it, and at least then that's. On hand."
16781.0,Patient,yeah and if yeah if you need anything any way from them. Right nice to. be able to contact yeah.

Alright, so i've got you in for that you're all logged into which is a good start and, mind you, that we also have the survey requirement. Which is actually a really good way to track progress overall in a kind of quantitative way, so if you could just try to remember to do those once a week it helps to just maybe do it on the same day as group just. To keep it consistent."
