357.0,Patient,"hi. hello, how are you."
105.0,Provider,got audio now and.
357.0,Patient,"yeah well then margin. I really. been on my mind all week so like a text to the other day because, like i'm going to gwen before I self medicate. His temple really tend to this week, like with the pain and chronic pain and my Strauss and everything I just I feel like i'm really struggling. I am really struggling and i've been struggling for a long time Glenn has been struggling ever since I really got under two milligrams. I don't think I really express that I think it shows and myself meditation but. it's been it's been hard I you know, I was really thought a lot about it over the past couple of weeks and. What I don't like is this past week, I thought, a lot about about using their thought a lot about like gosh I wonder, so, and so, how many you know, especially when I was in what's job like like know anybody who crack whole goal, which is a good thing. But I haven't thought about that in a long time. And i'm."
105.0,Provider,We mean by haven't thought about that a long time to time.
357.0,Patient,"hadn't thought about scoring down haven't thought about reaching out to somebody other than the doctor, you know for support medicine i'm mad about about you know. thought about that right like I had struggled with my medication. You know and and I struggled one and I told you a Doc to kind of hit a lot of it. Has gotten better about telling y'all. In the recent past, but it's like I don't know and. You know I think I brought this up to you and the Doc and the past couple of weeks about like Do I need to go back up. and it's hard for me, that is, you know I think about that i'm like do I just get off to go up and then I will get. To do with him right now and i'm like okay I don't know like this is hard I don't want it to be hard I don't want to give up I don't want it to sound like i'm like throwing in the towel."
105.0,Provider,"Okay let's just talk about the pain. How much of what you're saying. Is the part of you that wants to just beyond this, so that you don't have to manage it in any other way. might be hard thing answer I don't know. Let me tell you why i'm asking, because you vacillate between what looks like some extremes i'm not judging you, you know that."
357.0,Patient,"Right, no, no."
105.0,Provider,"Okay okay so. This movement between I have pain I don't want to be on this medication. See how. How do just look at that one. How much of that is your inaction, to get the right treatment for that pain I don't know."
357.0,Patient,Really yeah yeah. um. it's it's hard to me because my pain is never been validated yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
357.0,Patient,"ever known and so when I got in clinic. You know, years ago. They basically were like yeah people who have your upper name. yeah they they have a lot of issues, you know they they hold a lot and. We don't really see anything like it's not really their. info this treatment, I had yesterday it's like a core synchronization. And the massages I think getting regularly they're like something is wrong with you like Do you realize this like this is mine and i'm like yeah it hurt all the time. I don't know why this is making me check sorry it's okay just go with it. and It makes me really grumpy It makes me really to hired which is dark comfortably. And I can't get any relief from it. I remember when I was at the pain clinic so what happened is I started in like two in. Let me back up I started buying percocet off the street for my pain it started when I was pregnant with josie and I have a little bit before that it became chronic when I was pregnant with Sophie 15 years ago and. I started self medicating because it would get really bad and it would hurt and it was just a miracle and. Then I start, I went to a physician or I was in Grad school at the time, and so I went to the school clinic that's what my insurance was. And I saw this nurse practice nurse practitioner, and she was like yeah that sounds awful and she's like I can tell that I can see your muscles fast background. And that's when I started getting prescribe opiates and then it became more and more and more and more, and no my mom died, and I, I really went into it, I really, really wanted to actually that must have been 2009. And then, it was. You know, probably actually 2012 2013 when I got to the pain clinic and they were just like. yeah we gotta get you off of these things you're going to die or have a horrible life, and I was like you're right and I was like i'm not very good all of this stuff happen, and then they just cut me off. And I was going from getting prescribed like 210 milligram hydrocodone to zero like overnight and that really. was when I started buying a lot of stuff off the street and luckily no great an issue and then we'll financial component and rumor is the effective marriage and all these other things, and then. And finally found someone I could get about so now so busy street and then it wasn't reliable so that's when I finally drink programs so that's like the whole history. And I have used to avoid tough things in my life, and I have used to get up and keep going. But a big part of that is the pain."
105.0,Provider,it's really it's.
357.0,Patient,"it's constant, so I am conflicted because, on one hand, a lot of people are telling me. You don't have an issue. You can you can live your life oh be free."
105.0,Provider,"Think about why you want to open. A facility, why do you think you want to open a place for healing or you think it is."
357.0,Patient,"We want to help people yeah have a positive experience, no. it's like why to turn the kids. I want to help people I don't want them to. I hate when people suffering suffering. You know, and how cool is that. You can add these experiences, you know, like. Some of this magical we've done, and you know this new treatment that i'm getting this core synchronization which is kind of like cranial sacred."
105.0,Provider,mm hmm.
357.0,Patient,I can feel the relief and it's so nice that that it's so nice to have that experience. Not just validation but like okay there's like this relief. And what percent is.
105.0,Provider,"still there today. that you are not confident. That this pain is real. How confident, are you this pain i'm having I feel this is real how confident, are you that that's."
357.0,Patient,him out again. Okay.
105.0,Provider,What inspired you to get the the synchronization. where'd you.
357.0,Patient,"find it and how to get there. yeah. So I mean all i'll try just about anything you know me give me come in the trial try it and. When I was having a lot of the health issues, after I got sick when I had code and 2020. I called my old primary care physician. And because I had I was trying to find a primary care and he had retired, but he recommended me to somebody and the person who does the core synchronization she works out of that office, so it was just like happenstance and I mentioned to the physician that. You know, in June, I was like hey like i'm really struggling with these health issues, you know I have this chronic pain and she kind of was like yeah you know. amy does core synchronization and I was like what's that and I tried it my gotten a few treatments and I really like it it's really helpful I get really but it goes back know it always goes back and so over the years corner tried everything i've done acupuncture done golfing and done. Physical therapy and medication i've done. I feel like i've tried, a lot of different things, and the problem is always been the upkeep of. You know, for me, prioritizing. Now I have, I have the financial ability to do so i'm really trying to prioritize them, you know it's been working with a massage therapist for. A while and making sure that is often during. That how often are you getting the soft tissue. i've been going about every other week or one command and. late March. March, April. Like one thing started opening up again and I could get in."
105.0,Provider,And what's really funny is.
357.0,Patient,"I used to go to the SPA here albuquerque bath and they closed them a pandemic right and I was like waiting for them to open up, so I found another person in the meanwhile. And she ended up buying albuquerque back so anyway that's just kind of a side note has nothing to do with me, but it was like a little synchronicity and she's really helped a lot, she has this really amazing technique that has been really helpful. When it comes back. So it comes back."
105.0,Provider,"So. What have you learned about why a muscle might spasm when you listen to these professionals talk with you, or maybe you've done some reading on your own Why would a muscle spasm. What did we learn."
357.0,Patient,"yeah well I find it's like an imbalance right a structural imbalance, it can be stress induced it can be from diet, you know, lack of exercise right all of those things. there's the massage therapist I work with is really surprised she's like I keeps coming back and i'm like yeah like I don't see that fight off and we'll we'll keep working on it. You know she's like yeah I mean, I can tell you have a lot of stress in your life, and you know this like second or third time she worked with me she's like What do you do. What do you do for work, and I was like oh i'm an HR manager and she's like I choose to be an HR manager before she was a massage therapist she was like. And I kind of told her about my situation she's like okay that kind of makes sense sciatica you have a lot of stress i'm like yes. So they're pretty honest about like stress right so then we kind of come back to I feel like what is my other conundrum at this point is like. I can't quit my job I don't want to quit my job at go, you know it probably could like would we derive yeah, but I would have to ask less money, I don't. I don't want to quit my job. it's the same I have mine. can't get rid of my kids I don't want to get rid of my kids. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"would be convenient if we know. A little more. A little more, you know."
357.0,Patient,It.
105.0,Provider,"would be nice if there was some timeline if somehow you could look at it and say Oh, I can see. You know this time of the month. When these things have been going on. My muscle spasms are worse. it'd be convenient if you knew. Do you see any pattern."
357.0,Patient,"yeah definitely gets worse. around my menstrual cycle that only gets worse than. I thought we did that exacerbated the spasms right. So that's a little predictable. You know, thankfully, I felt there well i've never had a lot of cramps and now i've gotten an iud so i'm just like. not really menstruating, but I can still the timing like i've always kind of regular cycles, so I can kind of estimate the timing. nicer to myself a minute that's definitely been something i've always struggled with is letting myself press. Although it really wasn't before I got the kids because every weekend don't go to her dad's and on Friday, but I would go out to dinner, we would have our date night I will go home. I would sleep I would sleep like through half of the day, on Saturday, or I would do whatever we wanted got up and went to the store to go and teach shopping or play with my dogs or watch the TV like I had a lot of downtime. and"
105.0,Provider,What was the what was the pain.
357.0,Patient,"it's like it's gone through phases, but I don't remember it being difficult to get through my day."
105.0,Provider,Were you taking manageable. opiates at that time.
357.0,Patient,"I will die and yeah. Like from 2015 until now, so you know I remember being at like orange yellow green and be like really feeling. knows when I was in the Program. The suboxone definitely helps with my pain management for sure. That would solve it no. But. I feel like. it's it. it's just powder under to like from four to two I don't remember it goes really thinking about it. Because I got under two milligrams like right before the pandemic, I was on I was kind of wanted all. Even though I had the kids I quit drinking right like I was really well, I was working on quitting drinking and really looking at that and really. You know carnage through. feel like. or 2019. You know, cutting down on the drinking and. With stress with the kids but. I don't know it just seemed more manageable."
105.0,Provider,And how. How much do you believe that. What you're calling stress. Is the source of the muscle spasm how much do you believe that.
357.0,Patient,"I think that. There, there was a. I don't think it's the full source of my pain. I think it makes it worse, I think the fact that i'm like. You know, spread super thin and then I get up and then I start freaking out and then I get the automatic response of having to deal with the pain and pretend like everything's Okay, and then."
105.0,Provider,I think that makes it.
357.0,Patient,"Worse, but it's not the sole source of it or something structurally actually an old it's an old pattern. it's really hard to get rid of it. You started."
105.0,Provider,This let's say this structural change when you gave birth. To Sophie or you're pregnant with her.
357.0,Patient,"So I hit I would have clarity, but it wasn't a daily pain, it became a daily pain, when I was pregnant with Sophie and I was, I was really big I was like over 200 pounds. I cope with nine pounds like I would say Glenn and itself the hated it and I worked. With retail so understanding a lot and we tried like taping I had a career director at the time, I tried like taping me and I got adjustments like sometimes twice a week. And it just. I had a physical therapist two things that I tore ligaments in my ribcage because of the weight carrying it down and she really thought it was this weird ligament that attaches to the liver okay. So I get it like it's like decent here, and then it goes pending on the inside down through into the my right rib cage so right now, like my whole right side my great hamstring is tore. My glue right so when it when it gets really bad, but this is the main at the Center of it and so. I also like to my rotator rotator cuff, and I was like 20 and they were like oh like you know it was just. Like whatever you feel he'll just don't use your own for a while. You know i'd like a plane, or something. couple weeks I can't even remember, I mean it seems so insignificant at the time, but the physical therapist laptop might have something to do with it too."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So your answer is, you are doing, every intervention that you know, have to try and treat. muscles what might have been at least two. Events where you. Introduce yourself."
357.0,Patient,"yeah I think I am but. You know. yeah I think I am. i'm hard on myself about that too, because you know. For so long every I mean it feels like i'm not doing enough. I don't know what. I don't know what more I can do. So."
105.0,Provider,"There was more tracking of this. realization understanding of numbers of degree of pain, where it is I don't think it would take a lot, a lot of organizing to get this done. Because when you go. get these massages you're saying you get relief, so that. The next solution. If it means you learn it last five days. And what's new is that you then do whatever this thing is let's say it's um. let's say you take a day off from work and you do nothing, or maybe on this day you get another massage or you exercise. I don't know what it would be, but what i'm wondering is. If you've been not getting. The treatment that you actually need and I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's more of those massages. or it's that you are unwilling. To change your income. I don't know if it's that great I have no idea if there's something happening at work or there's something in your mind. That is still making it impossible. for you to let your guard down and for those muscles to relax I don't know. I can't tell now, but if you get interested in it. Right and there's this written thing. right here in front of you and watch. And you're like I didn't know it was that predictable, I can see this happening, look at that. You might learn something or you might come to terms with something that you haven't wanted to look at and I don't know what it is. But the pain is real. there's there's no doubt. They often this this doubt of the connection between. What our mind is up to and how it's. it's keeping that that that muscle tight. I mean good luck, we still don't have a way to measure that we still don't in, unfortunately. But the piece that you have been able to say is I get relief. For a little while from the massage I see it go up. When i'm menstruating. Right. Now, how much of that is you saying it because you think that's what I want to hear how much of that is because you've really looked at it. It won't do you any good to say to regurgitate what someone else has said, but this might be a time for you to take a real look at it. Because in the next group, you may come in and say I don't want to be on this medicine anymore, if I have it around i'll self medicate. And so we're stopped going. Which is it we don't we don't know we don't know what to do so. Turning your your aptitude to to measuring things to tracking things which I don't think is going to be that much of a challenge for you, I think you're good at that. But I don't know how much you have actually turned towards it, trying to understand what it is. I wonder if what you do is try to. escape it move away from it, not trying to understand it distract no panic. catastrophizing I don't know. Not in your moments. But in this program the relationship with pain for a lot of people is this final. frontier of confrontation befriending."
357.0,Patient,"yeah talking about it. I hate. I do feel judged and I feel. This it really triggers me because it. makes me feel like i'm not doing enough. that's why I, for a long time I just gave up, I was like okay just ignore it just gonna push it away. Because nobody believed everybody just thinks, I want to get high not say you say this is my food. Okay right there I guess i'm gravy. well."
105.0,Provider,crazy.
357.0,Patient,"we're not strong enough for you don't need it just made me feel really. abnormal and then I was like. Oh, we do these appointments all the time and. It never got better oh. I do. Again, I really do still doubt myself and that's where I get to the point where i'm like. I don't want to look at it, I don't want to talk about it, I just want to pretend like it's not there because. we're either though it's just I hate it I get like this, I don't want to talk about it a judge I get to live I get it. Okay."
105.0,Provider,And are you.
357.0,Patient,"I bought. yeah you're right, I need to look at it and I don't want to."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I think. I think you're ready. I think. I think you can I see. Some some resilience in you. That makes it possible now for you to track it. Just the cold hard facts of it. yeah and maybe you can wrap your head around that that I will produce this document after 30 days of clearly watching it, I will use. phone for alarms I will use some sort of tracking system, I will rank it the level of pain, I will mark you know you could set up a system, and I can help you as much or as little as you want. Little faces to indicate what the actual mood was can have a little section a little column for whether you were on your menstrual cycle, where you were in that. You can have a little marking of what your mindset was you know, and then a ranking you know of the stress level there's all these pieces that you, you can put in there exercise can be attrition. And that's it. Just an investigation of it. Because we don't know what you're going to find you don't know what you're going to find when you get there. I don't know. That the recipe might be once a week you get massage. And there's something that needs to be done. With your workplace or maybe with less or maybe with the kids I don't know. But it might be a couple of steps away. and And it might bring huge relief. could also be you've been taking it for so long, you have done something to that system of pain Luke. That now things that maybe I would be like oh what that sucks I have I forgot about it for six hours your sensitivity might be higher Oh, that would suck. But there it is and what do we do with that, like that's still if that's real Okay, so my motivation for coming off of it right that hyper analgesic effect that get more sensitivity and there might be a closed loop, no new injury, but the loop is still there, the pain. it's still real it's what do we do with it. So. I don't know how we can get some raw data if you're not willing to look if you're judging that you're doing something wrong somehow in this or that you won't be believe that at the end of those someone's going to say that's not real. Of that has to be addressed, because i'm not saying it, I think, I think, Dr real. wants to understand I i'm guessing. That this is an opportunity for you to to really take a look at it. And i'm fine if in the end, the end of it just the increased self turns out there's relief from the pain I don't care how we get there. let's get there. it's not going to in the end i'm not going to say you had some phantom pain i'm not going to say it. Now what you say, to yourself. I don't know what I can't control that. But I know this. is real for you it's real. What can you do to look at it directly on a regular basis, so that we know. yeah give it the right treatment."
357.0,Patient,yeah good call. I thought about that and then. i'm like oh no just keep going keep going.
105.0,Provider,"Now, so I would say homework, if you want to do it is you sit down either hand write it. and put some columns together. The one the ones I listed you've got you know mode. Menzies. work. Less. Child care. Self concept, you know that's going to be that well, am I talking to myself. it's going to be. That, I have a massage maybe it'll be. You had one last week and then there's something about it happening, and then we start to see a pattern over time. I don't know, maybe it gets worse with that I don't know. there's exercise. And what if there's something I don't even know about what if there's something you're not even saying in here, I have no idea if there's something else going on. that's making it really hard to look at this one. I don't know."
357.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"But the i'm not doing enough. Is is an interesting because I don't know. which comes. Before the other I don't know, maybe just injury with your shoulder in and of itself was was nothing, maybe that's irrelevant. Maybe this thing when you were pregnant with Sophie is what it's all."
357.0,Patient,"yeah. A lot of it is connect I mean you know. I do feel like I have explored the connection between how miserable I was when I was with Sophie dad when I was pregnant, it was a really hard time yeah. You know, I think, women have been kind of telling myself like. You know this is this is emotional an analogy that that can happen that emotion could get caught up in an area of the body so that's real."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
357.0,Patient,"And now, where I do get very conflicted with the medicine, because I want the ability to say i'm no longer dependent I don't want to. There is a. There is a purpose but they're very alone for me."
105.0,Provider,"yeah yeah okay. But it's a destination and will we still have to look at just these small objectives of today can have that. Out there that's fine. But the ones you do today, and if the difference, and when I can't quite see is how significantly. What you're doing while you're sleeping I don't know what your mind is up to I don't always do, and while you're sleeping. I don't know what it's doing what you do to yourself in those moments without video I don't know what you're doing to yourself, when you see these children acting in a particular way I don't know what's happening in your physiology. I have no idea if it's getting tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter. And this i'm not enough it's not just a phrase there might be a very much a manifestation happening. And you just are continuing to worsen it I don't know. Maybe paying attention to it and tracking it will force. The creative solution, maybe some insight will come from it. Because you haven't done it just like that, before. But hurrying up getting off of it to find out if it's all psychosomatic. It isn't that it doesn't work it doesn't work."
357.0,Patient,Because there's.
105.0,Provider,"there's this there's something missing and I don't know what it is, and I don't I don't want to go wrong."
357.0,Patient,"No i'm not ready to be on I realized that by. I would, I would relapse or a. girl, more so than I have I would definitely."
105.0,Provider,"So MIA if it turns out you're you're in a moment and you're in pain. How much are you able to in the moment I don't know, do you lay on the floor to do a stretch, I mean do you address it, or is it just. You do okay. And, and what happens when have."
357.0,Patient,"Like a little knob or Bob or that I can like yeah. Pretty wall. Like yesterday, so I was like I gotta get I gotta get in because this week, I was like just is so much pain and the AV set me ABS today, and so I was like yeah I can do it, I can do it and. I felt like disrespectful the group, but then I was like rushing to get my presentation of the bad kids home second. it's just like every day so by four or five hours just wiped out and the treatment was really good like kind of sore today what my team level is it is bad, like, I still have my core pain, but i've got. it's not as bad, but I went to bed five yesterday I was like I just have to go to sleep like I just have to, and it just cold out like it. You know, five or six I can't remember and I slept until about eight and I was like Okay, who needs to eat before we go to bed and. So i've gotten better about that about what I be asleep asleep, and sometimes I feel guilty about that. Is there's just so much to be and. It is really hard to keep up with the number of people responsible for. We talked about that, but is it is what it is you do that as."
105.0,Provider,"Well, I don't I think that this is part of the recipe it's I need the massage I need to take this thousand dollars i'm getting a month and yeah I do need someone in the evening. Now I do I need three hours. and on top of that it's going to. be the. The mental acrobat. Nothing catastrophic happened because you left early from group nothing happened, I mean I don't know if the doctor gave you a guilt trip, but I certainly didn't."
357.0,Patient,"Know like if I was worried that I had been rude or inappropriate or I don't know, I was, I was really worried about that was worried about. was like oh shit, I think, for God useless dory and I felt like I should have been more prepared for that, like I should have just don't home, I was really worried about letting you down or like breaking the rules, I don't know okay."
105.0,Provider,That we can handle in here. That we can handle that. is a perfect opportunity for you to use this therapeutic relationship. To have said that publicly to have said i'm embarrassed i'm afraid you're judging me I love it that i'm I still want to be your favorite client.
357.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"gotta be. Well it's Okay, I made that up whatever yours is I don't want to make a mistake. But your work is the whole point is to overcome. That lie. it's not real and even if I did. The lie is that what I think matters more, the truth is. You needed that massage. And whether I was in a shitty mood. Self centered insensitive. or or or maybe purposely as an intervention was bitchy to you to see if you'd still hold on to yourself, this is not a philosophical thing you'd have to do it. You have to say. I fucking know what's better for me. Lady basically."
357.0,Patient,yeah. Well i'm inconvenience.
105.0,Provider,"So what you're rude. It it just all pales in comparison to your assessment you knew you needed that appointment, thank goodness, you got it. And you guys done you manage to crush that day and can't see it you managed to still get into group. You took care of you were there for the kids you didn't pull over on the side of the road and fall asleep. You got there they were cared for and you even got up later, you didn't sleep through the day I thought that might have been what you're going to say and you were you were still on top of everything, but you don't see that."
357.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"You consistently see what's not there what's not there what's not there. I just have this week is has been a lot of nice thing to people. I don't y'all go check out some Buddhism, because. it's now Friday I think every single. I don't want to say. Like i'm not kidding."
357.0,Patient,You were like sounds like everybody's having a case of being human. yeah. You know I can't push.
105.0,Provider,A particular dogma of some kind of. It.
357.0,Patient,"I like Buddha done through your is, this is an audience if there's a religious their religion that I, you know practice okay aspire to practice would be Buddhism right."
105.0,Provider,yeah well but are you living it.
357.0,Patient,No. Fire right.
