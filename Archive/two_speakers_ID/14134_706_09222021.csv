14134.0,Patient,Hello.
706.0,Provider,hi justin.
14134.0,Patient,i'm so sorry. i'm glad you're still available. i'll turn my video on one second.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so just. Just for future reference, we give a 15 minute leeway, so you were a little past that but I went ahead, and I saw you anyway, because I don't have an appointment immediately after this. But if I did we might have had to reschedule just so that we didn't you know get time for the day. Okay, so, but you do have that 15 minutes, so we do try and give a little bit of grace period."
14134.0,Patient,I appreciate it i'm sure most people appreciate it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah well you know life happens. All right, so it looks like today we're going to complete your bps which is your bio psychosocial."
14134.0,Patient,How long does it take.
706.0,Provider,um well typically we book an hour for it but we're going to try and get through it as quickly as we can.
14134.0,Patient,Because I said this sucks I start work at 11. And I know. i'm sorry hi adjusting.
706.0,Provider,hi i'm Stacy.
14134.0,Patient,You know I didn't when I made this because I was there on Monday right.
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
14134.0,Patient,"I don't know what happened Monday, because we were set up for Monday."
706.0,Provider,"i'm also on Monday, what had happened was they didn't book enough time so on Monday, they booked you for a half hour time slot to do a bps instead of an hour. So I did I told them I said hey we're gonna have to reschedule it because. there's not enough time. yeah and then I don't know if somebody didn't get Ahold of you right away, but then I got a notification that you showed up and you were in my room and I said hey. I let you know yesterday that this wasn't going to work because there wasn't enough time books and they said okay we'll reschedule so I don't know if there was some miscommunication between. The care navigators or what had happened but. Not the initial appointment, the very first one to be. Here that takes an hour just because we're getting a bunch of history. I always like to allow for an hour, sometimes we use it sometimes we don't but then after that therapy sessions are typically 30 minutes."
14134.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's when I made this employment I didn't I wasn't thinking like I forgot that we had to do that, you know, and I just i'm just a little concerned um. That we might not have enough time do you want to get started, or something."
706.0,Provider,"I can't start it and then stop it, because everything's recorded so. I started, and then I stopped recording because we run out of time, and then I restart it then transcriptions not going to know to connect the two if that makes sense."
14134.0,Patient,"yeah is there anything we can like do today, I know that's the first initial thing it's just I don't have enough time right now I thought it was half an hour and I was late and that's my fault."
706.0,Provider,yeah So do you want to just reschedule it.
14134.0,Patient,I guess I guess we'll have to.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. When would you have an hour, that you would be able to do it."
14134.0,Patient,"I can pull up my schedule, I think I can't while you're on the phone is that all right."
706.0,Provider,yeah that's fine.
14134.0,Patient,You still there.
706.0,Provider,yep i'm still here.
14134.0,Patient,"Fine, my schedule. Wednesday tomorrow. For i'm. like this week."
706.0,Provider,"um it doesn't necessarily have to be this week you just want to make sure that you get it done as soon as possible because, after so long i'm not having a bps and being in the program It makes you fall into noncompliance."
14134.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I want to fall into that is."
706.0,Provider,We don't want anything like that to happen so.
14134.0,Patient,I don't know how early start but i'm. On Friday anytime before 10 or yeah because I started 11 is do you. Have maybe. Have like a nine o'clock or something.
706.0,Provider,Are you on eastern time zone.
14134.0,Patient,Central.
706.0,Provider,"you're on Central okay so you're in my time zone typically everybody's either in Pacific or eastern so, then I have to kind of do deductive reasoning and try and figure out what time so. you're in my time zone, I could do I could do a nine o'clock."
14134.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
706.0,Provider,yeah we can do nine o'clock on Friday.
14134.0,Patient,yeah that'll be perfect.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's plan for nine o'clock on Friday to do your bps and then um yeah and you'll have that done and then all you'll need to do is set up therapy every two weeks and those will be. 30 sessions."
14134.0,Patient,And i'll be meeting with you as well. yeah okay i'm sorry about today.
706.0,Provider,"that's okay like I said life happens, but i'm glad that you showed up when we got this figured out. yeah Okay, I will see you on Friday."
