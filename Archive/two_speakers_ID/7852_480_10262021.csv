7852.0,Patient,hi.
480.0,Provider,How are you.
7852.0,Patient,Good afternoon.
480.0,Provider,orange county are you at home.
7852.0,Patient,"No i'm still out here yeah I just left. My friend's place like not too long, like maybe like an hour ago they just got back from Chicago so. yeah they ended up. There fly into getting delayed because the weather yesterday because I was really rainy out here, and then like even there, like, I guess, like it was just safer to just not lie so. yeah they came this morning."
480.0,Provider,"So, are you happy to be done with that."
7852.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it didn't really bother me, I think, with everything now I was just trying to recollect like what I wanted to talk about today, but I just notice. Well, all backtrack are you doing. i'm look good. But like I was just like thinking or mostly I reflecting what I wanted to talk about today, but. I just noticed that. Like it's been. it's been really bothering me lately how even though, like, I want to be like, for instance, like 10 steps ahead because i've said that before. Really bugs me because, like, I think, too much about like. What I have to do, and like what's going to happen, and then it makes me more anxious and like even like yesterday, like, I was like okay i'll have to do this, this this this this. And then I will do the team, and then I would wait for the next thing to happen, and then it will just like it would make me feel so overall, but I know I just like I cut it up in sections so so I won't be feeling that way, but so like. And it just like hard because it's just like that, like a constant like anxious feeling throughout that whole entire time like it just never goes away and i'm like trying to figure out like. Like I know we went over coping mechanisms, just like really frustrating when i'm like trying to I know what I need to do to help prevent like how i'm going to feel and yet, even though I do it, I still feel super anxious yeah. hi."
480.0,Provider,"So Okay, let me ask you when you do coping skills, what are you doing mostly are you doing things that bring you into the present moment because it's. sounds like that's, the issue is you're just having trouble staying focused in the present moment because you're constantly thinking about what you need to do next right."
7852.0,Patient,"yeah I wish it was more I wish it was easier said, but when I when I Okay, let me think how I am my name is this one like even, for instance, something simple like waiting for like to get on this call, like, I actually went on a virtual clinic before I got here. My bad I didn't know you're supposed to do. But like like okay like, let me just like tell you like how my morning way like. Okay, just just today, so I knew I had to wake up, because I knew that my friends are going to get back I just didn't know what time but I knew before noon and. Already I had a list of what I had to do like I was gonna get them like if you suffer because, like their server broke guests on me yesterday, last night, when I was feeling and then I had to do like okay what that was on my list and then. i'm. In the morning when I was like oh yeah and then I did. blind people like little things like just like little seat and, like the littlest things which, like, I feel like shouldn't bother me now because i'm going through this process. it's just It makes me feel like this, like this, like roadblock still like it's really annoying and I know I felt like this, like where I you know I felt it worse before but. I just now i'm like feeling stuck again. doesn't make sense."
480.0,Provider,"It makes sense, and I think. So I have a couple of thoughts about this, I think, part of it is the expectation that you're not going to be anxious just because you've learned coping skills. So that's part of the problem is anxiety is chemical right so coping skills are curing anxiety they're helping us manage it so it's not realistic to think the anxiety is going to completely go away. it's just. learning how to not judge yourself, for having the anxiety in the first place, because that's part of it, too, is like judging yourself for where you are or where you think you should be. versus just going through the motions of the day, so it sounds like these little tasks are feeling really big which can be an indication that. there's some trauma with doing little chores or tasks or whatnot when things feel a lot bigger than they are that's usually an indicator that there's like underlying trauma underneath it. So i'm wondering like what. Okay, thinking about childhood and growing up, and all that, like was there always pressure to get chores done and get them done in certain time."
7852.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. yeah I mean like I am talking to my dad about talking to you about my dad like he'd always just wanted to end right away, but. As I remember, I really associated that with how i'm feeling now but I mean in this moment like even like just like thinking about how I was this morning I was like being like. Even when I was trying to breathe like I couldn't catch a break and like on my on my drive. Like on my drive. To my sisters and I dropped off food there before I came here i'm thinking like Oh well, Okay, I saw to meet up my friends later on this afternoon. And then i'm like thinking like okay like i'm just trying to figure out my time, but then i'm still feeling overwhelmed because i'm like Okay, well, I can go back to present and i'm like Okay, this is what I do now. And then that feeling of like that fight or flight feeling feeling never leaves. And it's a feel like it's been like I felt oh yeah i've been gauging it like i've been putting in my notes, like every single time like it high end. Like whenever I feel it and it's literally been like consistent like just like that feeling like anxious feeling drop my day and then like something will happen it'll spike spike spike but it'll never. go away."
480.0,Provider,Right yeah.
7852.0,Patient,"I mean, and even in this this morning. is actually scared me because. Well Larry is the dog like he was barking in the middle of the day, or in the middle of the night, and I remember my friend Lucy has I said something about like. Like how her son always looks like in the hallway like she's like joking about like spears or something bold blah. And then, like layers over here barking like four o'clock in the morning and then like i'm scared like legit like scared because i'm like okay well why he barking and he was just like rally and I was like. Well that's not like that doesn't make me feel good, and I was just trying to like sleep it off, and then I know that, like internally, I was like scared too, but I knew I shouldn't have like to be scared on anything. So that I sent me off to, and that was another thing that happened this morning, but I mean Besides that, like i've still since we've seen each other, even like Friday to like. No, no."
480.0,Provider,"So. I think part of the. Part of the problem is, you have to just get used to having some generalized anxiety like baseline is never going to be knowing it. So we have to get rid of that expectation that you're not gonna feel anxious, because people with anxious minds, we can create anxiety out of nothing basically like."
7852.0,Patient,"Seriously, like it's so frustrating we we literally like it's out of nothing."
480.0,Provider,"So example I was vacuuming the other day, this was like Sunday and vacuuming and I don't have a ton of like big stressors in my life, right now, which normally I do. And so I was a good five minutes into vacuuming before I realized, I was anxious I had spent five minutes worrying about where I was going to put my Christmas tree it's October. Like that's an anxious mind for you, I literally had nothing pressing to worry about so my brain decided to worry about where my Christmas tree is going to go, and it was a good five minutes before I was even aware that that was happening. But like that's what I mean by if you have an anxious, mind you can't expect that to go away, you just have to get better at not judging your thoughts and turning. The anxious feelings into So for me, I feel anxious every day like it's like you were it Spikes and then it comes down and Spikes It comes down but there's never a day, where I am going through my day and I just feel completely at ease all the time. But I also don't. want to feel like that, because the anxiety for me, makes me connected to my body so i've learned how to use it in a way that's actually helpful. And then it forces me to use coping skills which are helpful too so it's not like i'm a suffering with anxiety every day but i'm aware of it every day it's just not as because I think the The difference is, I know, to expect that i'm going to have anxiety. I don't. i'm not bothered by my anxiety, so I don't judge myself for having it. And that's The difference is there was a time where I was where you are where it was like I desperately just wanted to not feel that way, and I was judging myself for feeling that way because I thought it was something I could control. But it's not really anything you can control, you can work with it, you can cope with it, but you can't necessarily control, whether or not it's present."
7852.0,Patient,"that's so hard like I think what also bothers me, too, is when I when I feel like you're feeling anxious, but like I just feel like that, like sinking feeling in my chest. Like right now, like i'm just talking to you and I feel that, like. Like even like on the phone and I was like in my sister before this this call, like, I was feeling that, but I was just sitting down. And when I not. doing it like we're having conversation like i'm telling you about my day and like it's still like. yeah and. I mean like present you get much like like okay this very moment, if I were to tell you how I, like my very feelings i'm not thinking about anything other than this session, right now, like he would not have things to do later, but like I don't know how to come this down right now. Actually let's try let's try. Since I really misleading."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly okay so what's your go to when you're coping what's, the first thing you do, do you try breathing do you try distraction."
7852.0,Patient,yeah I say my name i'm like jailing. Like yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so. bring your awareness to your body i'm going to do, just like i'm going to totally make up a little breathing exercise with you so roll me and see if it works. Okay okay. Okay close your eyes, take a deep breath. Okay, I want you to and with."
7852.0,Patient,my eyes closed oh.
480.0,Provider,"yeah still closed. So feel. The parts of your body that are experiencing the anxiety so whatever parts of your body, whether it's in your chest or your arms or your throat or all of the above, wherever you're feeling the anxiety, I want you to picture. there's a ball right where you're feeling the most anxiety and the ball can be any color so I want you to. see a color with this ball inside your chest or your arm or your wrist or your throat wherever you're feeling it. So we're going to do some breathing and every time we breathe in I want you to imagine you're sending oxygen to the ball and the air is breaking up the ball into little or particles so every time we breathe you're going to imagine that the ball is being broken up by the oxygen okay. No deep breath. So, every time you exhale see the little particles whatever color they are. bursting away from the ball. About five more deep breaths. And we're still imagining the colors are bursting away from the ball every time we exhale. Okay now bring your awareness back to those spots that were tense the beginning. breathe oxygen to them, one more time and then open your eyes. To that help at all. Okay. So sometimes visualizations like that can help that one I like I like the ball one and then there's one where you imagine you close your eyes. And you imagine that the sky is opening and there's like bright sunlight just coming through your forehead or not forehead crown of your head and just like warming up. Your whole body so and then you like breathe and let the sunlight go to different parts of your body so walking yourself through visualization exercises, I think, would help more than just breathing on itself. So those are."
7852.0,Patient,"done that. was good, I like that."
480.0,Provider,"yeah I really like the ball color one because, for me, my anxieties very, very physical so it's like, if I can imagine sending oxygen to that part that actually feels tense. is almost like I can see what's happening in my body, and then I feel like i'm treating it. Even though, like i'm not doing anything other than breathing, but it still feels like i'm directly treating it because of the visual. So those ones are good and then also just any sort of distraction right, so if you're feeling I mean. Every person is different. But. For a lot of people if you're feeling anxious for no reason and there's no single cause distraction can be a good thing, like getting on social media and I don't know how you are with social media but, for me, like all of my feeds are very like therapeutic positive stuff. So when I scroll. instagram it's actually a coping skill, because I get all these like cute memes that are like really inspiring and stuff. So something like that to distract you from just how you're feeling, because a lot of times. I know we've talked about this in group when you focus on how you're feeling it almost makes you more anxious because you're not. aware of why you're feeling that way so then your brain kind of runs with that and you're like oh my gosh Why am I feeling all these new symptoms what's wrong with me."
7852.0,Patient,"I definitely feel a little bit, what do that exercise, I actually like that a lot. Even like. The reason why i'm actually here at this specific location is I could have stayed at my sister's but I knew that I like I was already I was already feeling anxious like I. knew that space was not doing it for me, but I know that in this particular area and Huntington that I was always around. When I was living here like it was my spot so i'm like okay perfect I already know where to go and then like like I need. So."
480.0,Provider,"And sun helps to because feeling the sun like actually hitting your skin is very therapeutic for people with anxiety because again it's very. Physical like anxiety because it's so physical coping mechanisms that are more effective tend to be more physical like that, like something like that, or like I don't know if you like, bath but a bath a nice warm bath is really good for anxiety."
7852.0,Patient,haven't done that in a while actually. they're like. Do you know any podcasts like say these you know how you're just coaching me through that or do you know any that I can write down are like any like YouTube videos.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so insight timer is an APP that has done a ton of ton of just random people that walk you through these kinds of relaxation, so you can literally find anything on there I love insight timer because it's. Free it's free initially you can subscribe and, obviously, that makes it easier to access more stuff but. there's a lot of good free stuff on there. Okay, and then also um if you're looking on YouTube or insight timer progressive muscle relaxation is a really good meditation to do because basically it takes you like head to toe and it has you clench your muscles and then relax them. Which is really helpful because a lot of times we don't know how tense our muscles are until we're like making ourselves tense them and then relax them."
7852.0,Patient,"um. It was really interesting because. i'm actually like the first thing i'm going to do when we're off the call like go through this. But yesterday I was actually I was in the car with my sister was it yesterday Sunday and there was in the garage my sister, and I mean I know she battles with her own anxiety and she doesn't take much she takes shahada. Like for that that that is helping her. and I was actually I was telling her how I felt because I wanted i've never actually asked her how her anxiety feels we never really had that conversation before. But she is more like. on the spot, like when she's triggered like when an event happens, but for me it's it's different because i'm more like it's just like a you know how like generalize localized. localized and i'm generalizing. And um. It was it kind of set me back a little bit with that conversation too, because I meet your rages about mud water and she rages on that, and all this stuff and then you know I thought I was like. cuz she already knows. medic like taking meds and you know at least like I knew that she could support me online that every single time like I like tell her like oh yeah like I just say actually switched my meds like. A couple months ago but giving me like side effects and she's like oh that's I don't want to take it she's just like like low blowing me like every single time I say something like that. And it doesn't make me feel good because already there's already like a negative connotation about like. Taking medication, but like I feel like I need it and it's helping me, for the most part, is just kind of hard because. You know, like the like really depends on like how my body takes it and, like the duration of how like when it'll take effect blah blah blah. Right and she wasn't like she the way she was just saying it like I understand looks like pretty much what we're doing like we're just trying to figure out. How it'll affect my body like specific dosages and all that stuff so she was like. Oh, the way she said it was just like yeah I just think you guys are just doing a whole bunch of experiments and blah blah blah like, let me just change what she's saying like i'm just like being a whole like experiment and i'm like. yeah and i'm like. I mean like technically locally well we're just trying to figure out like this, this dosages but it's not like I don't know the way she said, like experiment like i'm like an experiment like it, I didn't make me feel good because. yeah yeah. I know i'm experimenting with different like drugs up will potentially make me feel better, but she just said it in like a quantity."
480.0,Provider,Like a negative quantity yeah.
7852.0,Patient,Like derogatory like. yeah making.
480.0,Provider,"Oil that's what. You have to remember that just because her anxiety can be managed without medicine that doesn't mean. That yours can because that's something I had to accept about myself is, I have to stay medicated for my brain to function normally right so like my normal baseline. Medicated is like a lot of normal people's baseline unmedicated so that's The difference is reminding yourself that its chemical. it's not something you can willpower your way out of you know what I mean and the medication gives you the ability to use the coping skills like what she's using so basically for you. You look at it like that, so this is sister, this is you right, this is baseline so you're a little here without medicine so with medicine you guys are kind of at the equal standing point so, then you can use coping skills that make you feel better. And part of it, too, is she probably just doesn't know as much about anxieties you because people that think that they have anxiety if they can like talk themselves out of it, then. They tend to be."
7852.0,Patient,The ones that like give.
480.0,Provider,"unsolicited advice, because it's not the same."
7852.0,Patient,I just wanted to bring that up because I was on my mind to go yeah. That would be our.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and you have to give yourself grace to because you're still in Huntington you're still probably experiencing ptsd because of what we talked about last time."
7852.0,Patient,"yeah yeah for sure I am I just don't like saying it, but I know like internally, that I feel it like rough."
480.0,Provider,Are you staying. Longer are you headed home today.
7852.0,Patient,"No i'm gonna go home just gonna wait until traffic is down i'm going to meet a couple of my friends later on. Like five six so like I can go home by like 730 So yes, i'm here for a little bit longer just enjoying the sun. What ah that's another thing okay i'm glad that you said, we were they were to tell you, because I was like comparing how I was like i'm here I mean granted I don't have the perimeter anymore I don't live here, but I was comparing like how my feelings are here. How my feelings were at home, I thought that was like an interesting thing to do, because i'm like okay well you're two different environments now like he kind of gets to see like how you are, as far as your feelings, and I mean like while i'm here. It was really crazy, because when, if you let him like when when i'm home like oh i'll be happier here man like when i'm here and i'm like Oh, maybe i'll be happier at home, but then like I was feeling miserable at home when i'm at home, like Oh well, I feel happier when i'm in Huntington. And then i'm in those areas and i'm like I still feel the same. i'm like."
480.0,Provider,"Which is. Part of the human condition like that's The thing is. it's really it's hard, because people that go to therapy become very aware and insightful right and part of that is understanding that the human condition constantly wants us to focus on. Not where we are so like grass is always greener over there, or when this happens i'll be happy, or like. Always waiting for the next thing to make us feel better and that's partly because of society's conditioning, partly because that's just how natural human brains work. So that's entirely normal and I think a lot of people struggle with that and the best way. To deal with that once you're aware, is just again like bring yourself to the present moment and focus on okay well what am I grateful for right now that's happening today where I am. Because gratitude can shift your perspective, a lot like it's sunny i'm outside it's warm i'm in my favorite. place like. Focusing on that stuff can help a lot. But I do think part of the issue is just. This idea that like we shouldn't be human which happens when. we're raised with very critical parent. that's totally normal to. feel like when everything around us is constantly criticized then it's like we expect ourselves to not struggle to never have to be human. in the sense that we shouldn't have to experience any of this."
7852.0,Patient,"yeah like even like just like those couple days from like when I saw you on group why also did you last week, last Tuesday to so from Tuesday to Tuesday. I was googling or owls due to being like. Like. gonna sound weird okay I miss me but I knew to just say trying to find, like other people who like felt the same way, I know we do group, but like. It even though I was like watching them and, like talk about their feelings and like how they cope with it, it was just making me freshers because. They feeling, but in my mind i'm like Oh, they don't feel the way I do. It is making me mad because i'm like well why am I Why am I feeling like they're not feeling how I feel is another they uploaded a video like how they feel. that's what I was doing I was that's what I was very my whole this whole week China see other people like paddling and it's it but it's weird because your thing that I would use that for comfort, but instead it does the opposite is made me more."
480.0,Provider,"See, and that is weird because typically it does comfort people to know that they're not the only ones experiencing things."
7852.0,Patient,"So I was like that's interesting Maybe it was just like the people I was watching I. know your bias like i've told i've never seen those people i'm never like watch their channel, but I was like kill children, I feel more comfort into watching this even though i'm feeling more anxious and like bad and mad that they have to like."
480.0,Provider,Do you have. yeah.
7852.0,Patient,I do.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe instead of YouTube. hashtag anxiety awareness on instagram and see if there's anything that pops up there. Because i'm wondering if it's the like the storytelling part of it, because instagram is more like with."
7852.0,Patient,"Words and so yeah. Probably I think that's what I needed to hear more like like little posts of like. I can read instead of like seeing like people that I don't know. I think it's different with group, because I, we are with them all the time, so we form a bond, but then people like unmute I guess okay yeah that makes sense because on YouTube. I don't know them, so I don't know how they are and it's just maybe that's why I got mad I don't know I think i'm going to do that too, I actually read those type of posts on social media like like anxiety is like things that I can do to. Still, like it was still feeling. yeah so i'm like really a membrane and right now I really usually have really good conversations right now i'm just like you'd like good luck. Thanks for."
480.0,Provider,"Which is fine, because that's what anxiety, does it makes us scatterbrained and like."
7852.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't even mind because, like there's like people like like like back and forth here and it just like i'm so like a face. But I actually really love how we did that exercise I don't know if you do that often during your there because engines what company do another one."
480.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
7852.0,Patient,"Okay, do you. normally do that with like your your your sessions."
480.0,Provider,Are not normally.
7852.0,Patient,No.
480.0,Provider,"I mean all. Okay, then I came out wrong so. let's let's back up I have done it before. Some people respond really well to like. Doing actual exercises in therapy, so the most common things I do is it's like someone's on the verge of a panic attack or crying i'll do grounding techniques, just to get them back to like let's be able to have a conversation. The guided meditations I personally i've gotten over this, but for a long time, I felt really uncomfortable like doing them. So it's something that. I do, if I feel like people could use them, but it's not like I do every session."
7852.0,Patient,Here okay.
480.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so what time do you do you want to try a progressive muscle, do you want to do the sunlight one. Do you want to do a new one that we haven't talked about we're going to do a new one, and then you can tell me if you liked it. Okay okay."
7852.0,Patient,i'm i'm i'm excited okay.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so close your eyes again."
7852.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"Really comfy ground your feet on the ground, feel the earth beneath your feet take a few deep breaths. Okay, and I. am going to ask you to pick out a symbolic representation in your head of something that shuts and has a lock, so it can be a suitcase it can be a purse, it can be a safe it doesn't actually have to be something you possess, but just get an image of something that you can close and walk. Let me know when you have the image in your mind. Yes, Okay, so now what we're gonna do is we're going to take all of the little things we're worried about and we're going to pack them away in this box, that we can lock up, so I want you to. First, put away. The idea that we should not have anxiety and do this by picking a symbol, like a pen a pencil a necklace something to represent this expectation. That anxiety should not be present. And then, once we have the. symbol you're going to imagine yourself putting that inside the box. And then, once that's put in the box, I want you to pick up another item in your mind that represents something else you're stressed about and you don't have to name it out loud, you can but name it while. you're putting the object in the box so something like this pen represents my sister and you're going to put the pen in the box. And as you're putting different items in the box, make sure you're labeling them all in your mind so Pearl necklace is traffic pen his sister. tennis ball his dad. Whatever you can think of that represents worries, you have in your life. And then, let me know when you feel like your box is completely full of all your worries. locked. Okay, so now we're going to make sure it's locked really good check the lock again make sure everything's tightly in there and I want you to pick up your box. And you're going to bring it with you into your car. you're going to put the box in the passenger seat next to you and you're going to watch yourself drive to the ocean. In your car with the box. And then, when you get to the ocean you're gonna stop your car you're going to take the box out you're going to walk to the edge of the water you're going to throw the box into the ocean. And then I want you to watch it slowly drift out as the waves come and push it further and further away. As your box get gets further away you're going to start. backing up and walking to your car and then I want you to imagine driving yourself with no box of worries next to you back to where you are right now. And then whenever. you've seen yourself get back to where you are in the present moment you can slowly open your eyes."
7852.0,Patient,know why this thing.
480.0,Provider,What do you think the emotions from just like permission to let go of some of these things.
7852.0,Patient,"I was first I started law because, when he said Act, the box in your car the actual item that I was stuffing."
480.0,Provider,"money. Well, I guess, just drive the whole car into the ocean box."
7852.0,Patient,"yeah I think that made me emotional. I think, just like back coaching like putting away worries and something, and since i'm never like done this before like. Oh good good. yeah."
480.0,Provider,Sometimes emotion lets you know you're connecting to something yeah.
7852.0,Patient,"yeah okay i'm great i'm not even. Saying. It kind of reminded me it took me back to it, I used to train with my my trainer and we'll hear and I was having such a shitty week and. It was called our initiation and it was like pretty much like a really, really hard workout where you just like. lift the. friggin. Bring tired like move tires down the street, like all that stuff like it was it was intense. And I got to the point where like I had all this support system, just like yelling at me like good like like cheering me on like you can do Pablo like just imagine like blah blah blah like like. smash like the tire like is it someone or put all your anger into it and I started like that whole entire time I was doing that whole workout I was crying until I finish. And it was just like that. You know that release. is definitely different because, like i'm sitting down here and I was actually. Being super active but. it's interesting how we can chat emotions like."
480.0,Provider,"Oh for sure yeah well and it's always so interesting when you're emotional over things that you don't think will be emotional right it's almost like your emotions surprise you sometimes and I like that, because for me. I like to be surprised by emotions, because for so long, I was so unaware of my emotions that it makes me feel alive, it makes me feel like connected to life."

480.0,Provider,"So that is. Oh, my gosh that one actually has a name, let me see if I can Google it quick so basically all of these are just visualization exercises and. anxiety box, you see if I can figure out if there's an actual them. Okay calming visualizations for anxiety is what the like actual if you search under that you can find a bunch of them um."
7852.0,Patient,was that it was that exercise that uses something that you've done or did you just do it like.

480.0,Provider,"So there's a big script that goes with that I didn't do the full script I basically, what I do for. Any of these is like they're things that i've done in the past in my therapy sessions, and I just kind of remember the the the main points and then kind of make up my own script because I don't like reading scripts it sounds very."
7852.0,Patient,Like ginger like it's true.
480.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. Okay, so. I think this one's just called this visualization box. But yeah write down visualizations for anxiety and then, if you Google. goal that there's gonna be other either scripts or like you said YouTube videos that will pop up that will walk you through those. yeah and I like that one because it's easy to teach people. Because, everyone can imagine, like a box of some sort so i've even done it with my kids before and it's helped."
7852.0,Patient,"Oh that's nice yeah i've never experienced that, until now, so there you as a child, I think that would really help."
