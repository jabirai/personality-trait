99.0,Provider,"i'm with the virtual clinic I am I don't know I gave them a number over an hour ago and i'm not sure why it didn't get to you, but yeah I trust that you went in and."
239.0,Patient,"I did a drug screen to I didn't realize that I am I had missed one actually yesterday my sister had it with her, she had it since October and um. I didn't realize I hadn't done it, so I did it today and then try checking in and everything and they said they couldn't find it but either way i'm glad."
99.0,Provider,"yeah good so so tell me how are you doing i've been somewhat concerned about you, because of the text he sent a while ago, saying that you had been using and i'm just wondering what's going on with that."
239.0,Patient,i'm good i'm i've been doing pretty good I haven't used since I sent you that text. yeah I guess it was just more just admitting it to somebody.
99.0,Provider,well.
239.0,Patient,"I had um I had been using like on and off for years, like I wouldn't really see it as a problem but whenever I would get money I would you know I would use, even if it was just once, like, I would still use I wasn't like clean 100% clean."
99.0,Provider,and none of that was coming up on the drip screens.
239.0,Patient,"I think one time it did. yeah. I wouldn't use all the time it was just like once and you know, then I wouldn't use anymore, but. I was still using some."
99.0,Provider,"And I I guess i'm wondering to what. What was in the way of sharing with the group I know you, you know I wanted to respect that you kept saying no i'm not I don't want to do that, right now, but what a."
239.0,Patient,"another kind of like a betrayal like if I retrieve them like by attending group, and you know pretending to be in compliance and when I wasn't clean, I guess, I don't know it was more just like I felt like I had betrayed them. You too, I felt like I had betrayed you too i'm sorry even to send the message I couldn't send it my mom is actually the one that sent it for me because. I can send it I can't send it and she's like yes, you can she pushed it and it's not that hard seat. Thank you, I told her I wouldn't have been able to send it and then have her like helper or support."
99.0,Provider,"yeah well let's do, or what would you like to focus on today, I mean I know i'm kind of going in on that just to check on you and see how you're doing, but what what feels important to you to to check in around."
239.0,Patient,"um I don't know i'm a little worried about my medicine, because I, I have enough to get me to Monday, but not for Tuesday, and I think that's because i've been taking two a day. And I know that's something I talked to the doctor about, but I don't know, I was looking at a while ago and I got kind of worried about it because I can get someone but um I don't know money so. might be, you know. Not funded, but another person that I get from the key. I don't know how to say it. make you one sex, sexual favors in return for the medicine and they don't want to do that."
99.0,Provider,"So so it's the why, why are you using twice as much or. Dr candela about that."
239.0,Patient,"No, I haven't I haven't talked to her about it because I didn't want to admit that I had been using but. When I stopped I was taking one and one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and it was getting me through the you know it's getting me through the day but. that's what i've been doing and i'm always posting one and a half, so I tried doing that this past week and i'm like towards the night i'd start feeling like the withdrawals like I get. My bad night sweats and wake up next a sweater you make sure that we're take the other half, and then it was getting me, you know it was getting through the through the day, but it was twice, two of them a day, instead of one and a half."
99.0,Provider,And you haven't talked to Dr Kendall that you've been using yeah.
239.0,Patient,"No, no, I haven't because that would mean that meeting that I had relapsed I don't want nobody to know."
99.0,Provider,"And it's impacting your script, though."
239.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"I mean, do you get that we are not judging you i'm not I mean i'm i'm more worried, for you, but in talking to you I don't actually feel worried, right now, but do you get that we not shame you or we're not judging you are thinking that I don't think you'd be trading. So this is your recovery so it's more like in a sense. But. yeah I just hope and and click gosh she's so cute."
239.0,Patient,I know.
99.0,Provider,"I just hope you get, though, that you can that's why we're here for you to tell us okay i'm i'm struggling and I used or what like sooner than later, so it doesn't go on."
239.0,Patient,"No, I do I understand that it was more just. To say I felt like if. I would get judged I guess it was more just the way I was judging myself I didn't want people to know. yeah yeah. i'm more comfortable now like in group of i'll talk to her about it i'll tell you what's going on and stuff. And I still feel bad like I get anxious I guess worried I don't know why."
99.0,Provider,"No encourage you know when you're comfortable enough and I didn't imagine it will still be there, but if you're willing enough to share because that's what group is for you know it helps. Others, to see that oh. My gosh our brothers struggling like you know i'm sure they would just lift you up i'm pretty sure and and and maybe be able to relate like yeah you know when i've relapsed I have felt ashamed and it's like I don't want anyone to know but it's like you're the one carrying secret right."
239.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
99.0,Provider,I think that'd be even more.
239.0,Patient,"I know. And then was school to like I don't know it would help me get. Well, it wouldn't help me get through school, but how would I would be stressing out a lot, and you know, then I get hey man I just wouldn't stress on it, I just get the work done. I have gotten sick number i've gotten sick I was sick for like almost three weeks and. I missed to my classes, but I still be viewed the recordings and it did the work, but I did the work a weekly but i'm so good, you know good grades on it, but I had never done that, before like I had never not turned in an assignment or missed a class I was always like on top of it that."
99.0,Provider,Was that because that high. That you did a good work.
239.0,Patient,"No, I was sick I was like I couldn't even get out of bed, but um I got a high just so that way, I could do the week and it. was like energized you know because I was still under the weather, I was still sick, but I had used and I had enough energy to get everything done. And then I kind of feel like I use that as a crutch just to reinforce the using and then that's when I you know I talked to my mom about it. Until two of what was going on, and she told me that I needed to get help, or at least you know confiding in fight with you and tell you what was going on. Like well I don't even know how to start the conversation and she's just pretend like yours yours you're sending the message is about what you say, so I wrote the message in a. hurry that and she's okay send it she tells me as I know I can send it out, so what she thinks and she's all know she said she said, I hope you like it basically everything you told me and. she's right here, and she hit the button son. said no, I can't believe you did that you. know, I think, to afterwards I was like I wouldn't have been able to do it without you and. yeah."
99.0,Provider,"What can are there other times in your life when you've held things in to such a degree, out of just you know feeling ashamed, or just like not wanting people to think a certain way about you."
239.0,Patient,"know a couple of times actually we got into an argument me my mom and then the she hadn't brought up about the past and about my addiction, where it's got me. That you know I basically have nothing to show for it and whatnot and I felt bad, but I was clean at the time, but I went and I got I got drugs, and I was like using just despite math despite her, but like to cover up that like what I was feeling like the shame and the guilt and. And everything, and I was fine when I was high, but it was like when. I didn't have no more that I was, like all hurt and you know all crying and whatnot but. You know it wasn't healthy healthy to do that. A bad way to cope with it, but. That was like you know I quit my cope with it."
99.0,Provider,"let's go into. The feeling of the afterwards, you know after you got in a fight with your mom after you finally you know admitted to your mom and sent me the text let's go into the. You know, maybe the I don't know what would you name, what are the feelings that you're left with."
239.0,Patient,"guilt felt guilty, because I used all my money and like we needed the money you know for minutes, and you know, to pay the bills and surfing."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's go into the guilt so just take a moment and and really sense into it see if you can connect to the part. of your. or tension related to the guilt."
239.0,Patient,and get stuck in the stomach like at the bottom of my stomach the pit of my stomach I get this feeling of like. Like I know I messed up and I don't know what i'm going to do. A shame take us fishing fulfilling.
99.0,Provider,Okay let's go down to the pit of your. And it's interesting your little dog is right there too he's just right next to that part of you. Just take some deep breaths into this part. What sensations do you notice.
239.0,Patient,"I feel more comfortable like more at ease with it, I don't know if it's because it's out in the open and we talked about it and i'm not keeping it in anymore, I feel I feel better like huge weight was lifted. And now that that gets out in the open, I can fix it like I can overcome it instead of just keeping it in like keeping it a secret, you know."
99.0,Provider,"to remember, I know i've shared this with both groups that I facilitate at some point in the past and don't know I think you might have been there, the hawaiian story about the bowl of light Do you remember that."
239.0,Patient,"I think, so I guess."
99.0,Provider,"yeah so it's making me think about a lot, you know the i'm going to tell it again. So, in a way in back in the old days when. Things were more intact for the hawaiians here in the eye. The children were all told that they are born with a bowl of light. And this ball of light is within them and then metaphorically, they carry the their grandparents give them a little bowl that they carry around throughout the day and if they do things that they're kind of ashamed of or not proud of the they fill the bowl of late with stones. To get you know if they get angry and they say something mean to someone. They fill up the phone and, at the end of the day is the grandparents would take the children to the ocean and then. They look at their bowls and ask them like okay why you know why is your bowl so fuller you know someone's bowl wasn't for ask them about that too, and then. All the kids would dump their bowl of stones back into the ocean and then start again the next day but. there's it's just this this idea that we have this ball of light and when we just are holding things in and filling it with these stones it gets heavy and the light gets kind of like them out. So it makes me think of that as you, as you said, you know you feel late and it's like a weight was lifted a psycho you empty your bowl you entered the stones out of your bowl of light."
239.0,Patient,"yeah that does make sense and it's true because when you do hold stuff in like that it does make it does like weigh you down, you know it. does affect you emotionally you wouldn't think so, but. It does."
99.0,Provider,"yeah and. let's just let's just kind of explore this a little more, if you want, if you're interested, are you. So that that feeling of feeling kind of ashamed and. guilty, if you could just connect to how old is that feeling like how old, are you how old is that part of you that feels that."
239.0,Patient,"i'd say like still young like adolescent. Like seven or eight. You know, young yeah I remember feeling that to analogy. And back then, I had a real bad study so every time I tried to talk like the words were there but they just wouldn't come out, so I wouldn't say nothing at all. And then, it took me a while, but I worked on it, and you know I got over the study, but sometimes like it'll happen, where I want, I want to say something, and the words just won't come out there, like the on the tip of my tongue, but. The harder I try to see it, the more like it won't come out."
99.0,Provider,"So, so this is holding things in it started really young when your words wouldn't come out. yeah yeah. Well, was there anyone that you were able to talk to back then did anyone feel safe enough for trusted enough that you could share with them."
239.0,Patient,"yeah my mom knew my mom we were talking about and then i'm I am I was always really good in school, but they wanted to move me a couple of grades ahead because I was. Like testing out of my grade but um my step dad didn't think you'd be good for me, because he was older than me, and I would have been agreed higher than him, so I got to stay home a lot because. My class and my mom were talking, we were talking a lot about what I was feeling and stuff and she helped me with my study and then we used to talk a lot about everything we were talking about everything."
99.0,Provider,"A months, been a really good ally for you, for a long time."
239.0,Patient,"yeah she's still there, she helped she helped me a lot."
99.0,Provider,that's great. that's good i'm glad you have her to confide in and know that you can share something most anything with her.
239.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"I don't know that was an assumption, maybe not most any but the important stuff."
239.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
99.0,Provider,So is there anything else that you want to get out your your. Senior bowl.
239.0,Patient,"i'm no i'm pretty excited schools almost over, we only have two weeks left and then I finished, one of my 10 papers, I had to turn it in last week. And then we get into these groups, and then we have to read each other's papers and then i'm doing like an oral Defense kind of, we have to read, each one of the papers and come up with a questions and comments and know like ask them about the paper and. Make challenge them, I guess, so mmm i'm looking forward to it, I haven't received an email yet to know which group by men, and you know and. whatnot we have two weeks left, so the next to thursday's will be the oral Defense and then. For another, one of my classes out to do a final essay we're just analyzing my two. pumps like a two poems that relate to each other, which is analyze them and. Talk about how they relate to each other and stuff. In my last class. that's do a score of two minutes course to make a make an audio and put it to video and then analyze the score and then read a paper on that so it's pretty easy like I said a lot of work it's you know just three classes i'm kind of glad because the first half of the Semester, I took. A claimant culture, and it was just an eight week course so. Like me, I don't have like a heavy workload or anything."
99.0,Provider,"Good. Thinking i'm going to look up your treatment plan. let's see. Oh, my gosh yeah they were things were the goals were from back in October, so okay let's do this let's go through some of your goals here, so one of them was to make sure you pass all your classes how's that point."
239.0,Patient,Even though I miss those. Those classes i'm still i'm still ahead of my English. literature course I have. i'm 20 points ahead so i'm good in that class well all my classes i'm good and one of them i'm behind 30 points but that's still a nice class.
99.0,Provider,Do we want to do that one or say it's it's completed because you're not done yet.
239.0,Patient,Get that yeah i'm not done yet.
99.0,Provider,When when would be a good time to check in and make sure that you did pass all your classes.
239.0,Patient,i'm in the next two weeks I have them the next two weeks in classes are open.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so what we have you come into individual therapy every two months so let's see let's see i'm going to see what two months from now we'll just have i'll have all these texts. And it's two months so good for you, or do you want one sooner."

239.0,Patient,"I haven't I haven't done that yet, but i'm I am I got a job with ups, they offered me a job, and then I start on the first so i'll be able to do it once they get paid i'll be able to to turn it up. I didn't change it or not, that counts, but it's. Like."
99.0,Provider,"Okay yeah let's let's let's check in at the end of January, about the tune up. Okay, so this is a big one smoking just one cigarette a day replacing your smoking with healthy behavior mindfulness practices have you done that."
239.0,Patient,"i've been beat being you know more than smoking just because they can't afford cigarettes. But um. I guess yeah in a way i'm doing it because I haven't smoked a cigarette and make to two days, two days I haven't smoked but i've been beeping in place of it and and it's not healthy but."
99.0,Provider,yeah What would you what would be a goal regarding.
239.0,Patient,"i'm just did not you know not do it at all, I could go for a walk I know meditate or something in case of it, instead of. You know, making all the time or smoking it."
99.0,Provider,"By the end of January, do you think that's a realistic goal that you won't be raping or smoking at all."
239.0,Patient,yeah yes i'm doing i'm doing pretty good.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great all right we'll keep that um how about you have to be more active, to be able to run until you reach at least three miles a day."
239.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't even tried I haven't done for a run in so long i've been more active, you know going for walks and stuff to get a sense for."
99.0,Provider,What do you want to. Do you want to kind of revisit maybe three miles a day is a little bit ambitious what what would be realistic.
239.0,Patient,Like we didn't have I guess running one and a half miles a day.
99.0,Provider,Every day.
239.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,yeah okay okay we'll put that okay um you had by car seats for your new car.

99.0,Provider,yeah you did okay great. So that's completed. How about saving money.
239.0,Patient,i'm horrible at saving money.
99.0,Provider,"Okay well let's make it realistic goals so and specific. So how much money by the end of January, realistically, do you think you can see."
239.0,Patient,I don't know it's at least 1000 making savings.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so we'll say $1,000 by the end of. And then, how about. Having more human interaction."
239.0,Patient,"yeah i've been where. Do you see. Like when I go to the store and stuff I do talk to a lot of people like, even if I don't know them, you know say hi how are you what not."
99.0,Provider,"Making times to get together with friends or acquaintances from school, have you done any of that. Something that you would wanted."
239.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it would be a good idea. homebody I don't like to get on people. And like my dogs, you know they don't talk back or anything in the really good talks. yeah tell them anything and they don't tell anybody."
99.0,Provider,you're satisfied with with things.
239.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"yeah I mean if it's not an issue then it's not an issue I just I do worry a little bit about. Really isolating a little bit, and you know. I can make it. Maybe more it could be more profitable. This there's not. Really anyone show up for maybe your mom but."
239.0,Patient,yeah yeah no I mean well this next semester they're having. In person classes at the College so um I think three of my classes actually have to be there physically so i'll have to be interacting with other people and stuff.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so that so would you want to make a goal around. spending time outside of class of people, or is it just not interesting to you."
239.0,Patient,know not really.
99.0,Provider,Is it scary.
239.0,Patient,yeah I guess.
99.0,Provider,yeah. I think it's more scary than not interesting.
239.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm going to keep this in my head and i'm definitely not going to push you to beer people, but I just I do wonder how this may be impacting you. To to turn away from connection with other humans, because it's."
239.0,Patient,"When i'm when I would use, and I was hired like I had no issue with that I could talk to anybody, you know. or anything like that even the people that I was getting from the like really good friends, so I would you know spend time with them, you know a lot. And then I don't know it's like when i'm sober I don't want to be around anybody, but if i'm using the night, you know, make a little butterfly on talking to everybody. And maybe that's why I. Like isolate myself."
99.0,Provider,know what do you think is going on.
239.0,Patient,"In my mind I think it's more like a crutch like if I think I need to have any to be on drugs in order to be social or be active, or like beyond the top of my game and. I think that's it is."
99.0,Provider,"What are you noticing right now, how are you feeling, as you as you tell me about this."
239.0,Patient,"No, no it's not anything else anybody. Can. make a secret, I guess, something that I don't really talk about to anyone. i've never really admitted."
99.0,Provider,"Well, I appreciate your trust and sharing with me and I think i'm kind of poking in there, a little to. What is it like to be witnessed and to be you know, to actually name it and have me here you."
239.0,Patient,"know I kind of feel like if i'm in trouble I don't know why, but like I got sent to the principal's office or something and i'm like in trouble. You, but at the same time, I know that i'm not in trouble, when it does feel good to see it like. Like I guess saying it makes it real. And now that it's out there, I can you know, do something about it."
99.0,Provider,"yeah yes, I can imagine it's exposing you're really showing something like like you said you don't you haven't told anyone it's a secret. Do you want to make some art or write a little more about this to to just be with it, or is this does it feel like this was this was a lot, even just name it you don't want to talk about it anymore."
239.0,Patient,"No, I think this is good yeah it was good to talk about it and get it out."
99.0,Provider,"Do you want to stick with it a little longer, and do a more process with it."
239.0,Patient,um yeah.
99.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, what would you rather do, would you rather right or or draw."
239.0,Patient,um. I don't know john I guess.
99.0,Provider,"So. So if you're willing to draw this part that when when you're sober and you're not using you tend to isolate. let's let's put that inside of a circle and then just see what happens see what what is within this the circle around you have you know the field that you're in any thoughts any. Anything that you want to place in there and then and then whatever is outside of the circle, just imagine, this is the stuff i'm keeping out, this is why i'm isolating because i'm keeping this stuff out. Okay. What can Is this the new number that I can read to it."
239.0,Patient,"i'm above the other ones good to it's just I don't have enough, and then the one that I messaged you from is an APP you can reach me on it, but i'm. There the other one will work cross when I get paid up with minutes."
99.0,Provider,"shoot I just I just deleted all the one. i'm gonna write down we tell me the two what two numbers, would be the good numbers to reach you at."
239.0,Patient,This. Time. 377505375147 that once the APP the messaging and the other one is some 505-692-0588.

99.0,Provider,"that's good if there is one thing on the outside that you could give voice to that that you can imagine, would maybe say something to you which one would you choose."
239.0,Patient,um I guess nature.
99.0,Provider,Oh go ahead.
239.0,Patient,No nature and want me to be able to talk back.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do that let's give some space. So if you want to get a fresh piece of paper and. Imagine that nature is writing you a letter and nature saying hey Joaquin exclamation mark, what would make her say to you."
239.0,Patient,"Sorry, they were scratching at the door. finished finished up."
99.0,Provider,Okay we're.
239.0,Patient,Working on nature here just wanted to let you know that you spend too much time worried and anxious that you end up missing out on all the beauty that's around you every day is a blessing with wonder speed to evolve. don't forget to appreciate the beauty I create for you. Sending Mother Nature.
99.0,Provider,"I wonder if it would be helpful to read that more frequently and also on your own time, if you have the time potentially write letters from the friends from the activities from what was the bottom one there was one below."
239.0,Patient,Some sort.
99.0,Provider,of care. So if you feel inspired you know right write yourself a letter from all those does other things that are outside of the circle. yeah okay very what key and i'm so glad you made it today and.
239.0,Patient,Thank you.
99.0,Provider,Okay yeah bye bye.
