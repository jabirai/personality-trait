416.0,Provider,Oh really where have you been.
8933.0,Patient,"And we went with Brian to San Jose for work, and then we thought it was a good idea to because he was to live in San Francisco to go. hang out there for a little bit. It was fine. I officially hate suitcases."
416.0,Provider,you're just ready to be home.
8933.0,Patient,or a look exhausted.
416.0,Provider,"No, you look great just more worried about you."
8933.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that's why I didn't make it to grow, and I was going to email you, but I figured. You know, eventually, tell you."
416.0,Provider,"So last time we talked. You were kind of trying to get back into the health, the stuff that was making you feel healthier before right and kind of reconnect to that and also reconnect to expressing your feelings, rather than shoving them down or push them away. How how has all that stuff and going."
8933.0,Patient,"Actually. Surprisingly wow. Okay, do you want to take 20 minutes right. yeah and that. So we got a little behind on our work anyway and. i'm. I think we're actually getting better. And I came, I was very open with him one day and i'm just glad he realized like he let me talk to him. and"
416.0,Provider,And what was the talk about.
8933.0,Patient,Just about family time and because I was upset with him because we're supposed to go out of town for for Christmas. So I don't know what if we're gonna if i'm gonna make it to group next week and I hope I really I really need to i'm just. Smart. and He wanted to come to your.
416.0,Provider,House how did you prioritize that.
8933.0,Patient,"I don't know i'm sure I could figure it out. set some time apart. make a schedule. Know zombie um. yeah i've. made it for. A meal plan for Christmas, I know where to go grocery shopping so i'm sure I can. figure out how to set. The title part to go to group."
416.0,Provider,"Right yeah. I mean not just because I want you in group which I do, of course, but the. From what you've told me that group is an you know it's an important kind of grounding activity that you do each week."
8933.0,Patient,yeah it's.
416.0,Provider,I want to support some priorities in that.
8933.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I mean what does he support you in that like if you were to say this is really a priority for me how can I.
8933.0,Patient,yeah he's actually paid more attention. But I was really enjoying the time we had because I was so mad at him for like you know because we couldn't talk. Like honestly about. And how we feel or how I feel. and yeah he's he's better and at least I feel more support from him now.
416.0,Provider,that's great. that's great and how it is like the fighting in the kind of explosions or how has that been going.
8933.0,Patient,"Oh, my God actually we had some serious reasons to be angry, we had problems at the hotel. Like the reservation they've messed up the reservations, they. They were very rude to me he he set up for me and we ended up moving hotels, you know to it and. To where people were a lot nicer. um. yeah he just went NUTS not crazy, but because they were severely severely rude to me. and apparently having pink hair they thought I was a hugger I went out for breakfast and I forgot my room key and. I didn't know what number, we were in cuz he's you know he deals with that. and Eventually, they got into my room and I told him what happens and he's like they. They profiles and it's like what are you talking about I just forgot my key and they didn't even like kept giving them my information and everything. Like know the profiles and and then he went downstairs talk to the lady talks to the managers really failed the whole report and. I haven't seen in that protective in a long time. So that felt really good."
416.0,Provider,"yeah how about your responses like you're. You know, when I mean when we first started talking one of your goals and therapy was really about sort of managing your own anger responses."
8933.0,Patient,"yeah that was. That was the other thing and. A domestic Barbara are my cart you forgot, they were power washing that the apartment garage. and The last last time I got the cartoon because I forgot to go move it or we ran out of town again remember and he is a total jerk This is like every every year or two ago, and this time he had it was his we both forgot, and anyway, the car got towed and. We should have been really, really angry. And he started to go down that road, and i'm like honey, you know everything's Okay, we already had our incident, we had a blast at San Francisco always and you know he went down memory lane, and we went out to dinner to some places uncle has and was really nice like it was just so pleasant. You know, he was going to start going off i'm going to talk to them this and that, and this is the second time they do this to us, you know, like honestly for how tired we've been i'm just glad to be made at home safe it's i'm not going to run it. And you know he kept a policy. Like he thought I was going to react how he reacted. Here, like. i'm just. I don't care let's just go get the stupid car and I can get laundry. Like i'm so done being angry and he was so happy he tears than he hugged means like Oh, thank you, you know, for being so supportive. i'm not doing this, so. We had a feel for you. I thought. I felt good to not. You know, to just kind of cruise buying that instead of going down then it's your fault it's my fault it's all on me blah blah blah. It was really nice."
416.0,Provider,"And what do you think it was that allowed you to to do that, where you wouldn't have been able to in the past."
8933.0,Patient,"And maybe just feel closer to him the. Like I feel heard. Like he said he had my back, and now I felt like, even though he was. Doing this to himself. That I have his back and to be appreciated it. Is Nice."
416.0,Provider,"it's really lovely. So. you're you're kind of it sounds like, if I were to rephrase that it's like you're spending a lot more time in your wise, mind you know."
8933.0,Patient,"All right, i'll take that."
416.0,Provider,Do you know what I mean by that.
8933.0,Patient,"um yeah like thinking, I think I do, and like thinking things with it cool had like not getting a lot of letting your emotions take over then like just looking at things in ones and zeros."
416.0,Provider,"Well kind of. it's actually it's a little more emotional than that. Just thinking ones and zeros that's our rational mind right where it's like we're detached from emotions completely and then way over here is the emotional mind where we're like running on pure emotion. it's where those two things collide and overlap that's a wise mind right so it's like you're considering your emotions you're aware of them you're not detached from them you're you're connected to them, but you're not totally 100% driven by an emotional reaction. you're balanced. it's a really healthy place to be."
8933.0,Patient,"like eating salad out of the say instead of the. bacon or MAC and cheese, maybe now."
416.0,Provider,I would say it's eating salad with some bacon on top.
8933.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
416.0,Provider,Right it's not just makin to us it's not just you know boring broccoli.
8933.0,Patient,it's a.
416.0,Provider,"nice little mix a nice little balance. Like you're like your metaphors these are great. boots perfect so fantastic I love it i'm so. really working on, and then you talked about how you've been like expressing emotion, so that it doesn't build up so much and you've been doing that, with talking to him, are there any other ways that you've been that you found that really work for you to kind of express things."
8933.0,Patient,"Okay um. I don't know if this counts on. The you know, like when your stay at home or in your first kind of link and traditional ish. I guess like making out and making the coffee and making the breakfast and. And instead of getting he then because I do that sometimes when he's mean i'll just take your hand and be like you can make your. And then he sits there, and he sad like it feels like he's getting punished and."
416.0,Provider,me is.
8933.0,Patient,And he is. And of course I enjoy it. um.
416.0,Provider,But it doesn't it doesn't end up working out very well for your your relationship long term right.
8933.0,Patient,"No yeah. Yes. Oh. yeah like today he's he went to work and. I could have. he's he's still getting used to it, like the whole taking care of everything by himself thing because that's what he did in his previous marriage and like I woke up I made him his breakfast meeting a backpack lunch, and you know beer for. He was in really bad shape this morning. And not just. cheering him give him a beer for breakfast. No, not for Brett in his lunch pack, you know company he leaves the office and then he sits in his car and because. They hate each other. And because he deals with all the difficult customers and their extra difficult. So he just he has to worry that lunch to like keep a sanity so I made him a nice healthy little sandwich and put a beer in there no water in his lunch pack so that he can like relax isn't big guys like he doesn't get drunk or anything. And he really put extra ice in there, you know, to keep the call and he just."
416.0,Provider,He looked at me like always like.
8933.0,Patient,She does care she. tries to take care of me. And that felt really good like I could feel the heat I could see that he felt loved her you know at least that I care. So I was.
416.0,Provider,kind of that kind of filled your bucket too right.
8933.0,Patient,"yeah my buckets fall and so what I mean this is like online. so bad, I do I do this. is like this is half this is like not even half, and I still got two more lives that's that's what I got. it's worth that. Yes, so little things like that i'm just take you off right like oh how I used to feel the need to learn lessons like oh you think i'm the made like i'm your servant like that's. I don't feel like that right now. And I hope it lasts."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8933.0,Patient,So you got another trip.
416.0,Provider,So you said you're going somewhere for Christmas is that what I heard.
8933.0,Patient,"yeah so we're going to big bear for Christmas. Originally, because we were fighting a lot, I was like whatever last summer I got it just cuz lexi Mrs smells like okay i'll get i'll get the bleep away from you and do have you know personal time with my daughter and. It was really cheap in the places got three bedrooms which I felt guilty because. let's just see if it just feels wasteful but um I I talked I think I talked my aunt that we used drama with into coming, and you know that came to thanksgiving. And there's no problem with anybody, so I haven't talked to my mother, thank God she's over there in Texas, right now, which I found out last night, so they might not make it, but on the we're in a good place with my family. i'm just. yeah I hope it lasts."
416.0,Provider,And it might not and we'll deal with it.
8933.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I mean every family has sort of natural epson flows and their relationships right.
8933.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I know yours, has been a lot more extreme than others, but. So. What kinds of things do you feel like you're really working on right now how I actually before I ask you that how, how is the drinking going."
8933.0,Patient,"We we went out, we were drinking a lot that we were we were on you know date mode, so I thought that was okay. definitely been dragging a little more. But it's it was."
416.0,Provider,"More like. What what does that look like, for you guys."
8933.0,Patient,"Oh, all these are really angry or try not to fight so we went to another hotel on have like two three champions and and now the cups are tiny, this is my excuse for everything it's a lot and eventually they went back. To shower. yeah and then. With dinner. Because we know like. About a drink with dinner after that, like a strong like a Margarita. You know, strong trunks. That was for two nights and then last night was horrible you know how there's the new stranded coven."
416.0,Provider,yeah oh my.
8933.0,Patient,"Oh, my God a few. i'm so glad it was I was wrong if I started getting this sentence, and then we were watching the news, and you know i'm sitting here checking off all the lists and I had a major anxiety attack. And because, but he he just gotten tested out of work. And you know it was negatives and it's like okay we're being safe for good and then. And I started. feeling weird you know, like that you can hear it, the throat and. Then the tiredness and. And all that, so we took a test last night and he we both free doubt and then we're sitting there, and he got a little frustrated because if we we've never done this before and, finally, it turned out negative but. Oh, I have like three shots to to heal and to wines, because I was so. You know, I was mad at myself as like what, if I have been like I did all. Of this, and just to pet my daughter, I was trying to have fun, but. You know I felt guilty. I said something about your response."
416.0,Provider,"To that stress in that moment, that you would do differently if you could do it again."
8933.0,Patient,Now. I would have. I would have done the exact same thing today.
416.0,Provider,i'm just not super clear like is there a desire on your end to drink less or are you really comfortable with where you are.
8933.0,Patient,"uncomfortable right now, because. i'm trying i'm doing way too much, and I know normal people do that sober but i'm just not there yet."
416.0,Provider,"So, right now, you feel like if you took away that coping it would be too much for you."
8933.0,Patient,"As i'm still working on my anxiety attacks like I. I had a horrible anxiety attack, as I had when we were at the hotel we had her issue with the. With the front desk and. I had to use the breathing thing you know."
416.0,Provider,Have you ever tried cold water on your face to.
8933.0,Patient,"Trying. To get after I try i'm trying to hide it. Other than that, now, I had a."
416.0,Provider,"really good one for anxiety attacks, and when you say anxiety attack like what are your symptoms you're just like over yeah tell me tell me exactly what happens."
8933.0,Patient,Just straight to panic.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8933.0,Patient,"Just you know i'm thinking about all these things at the timing, does the outfit when are we gonna eat me to shower. And our route, where are we going to stop by for lunch."
416.0,Provider,"It just becomes really overwhelming to you, and when one thing sort of gets out of place it starts to yeah it's just like."
8933.0,Patient,"Because it's not even stuff you should be worried about right. But if I don't do it, nobody else will he just. goes straight and that's my glad that he's paying attention is listening to me so that way I get. You know a little bit of my reins back because it's not just hammer mean."
416.0,Provider,"Have you always had this kind of like. I mean, is it always felt unsafe for you to sort of not be in control of this schedule and everything that's going on yeah."
8933.0,Patient,When I got.
416.0,Provider,Since you were a kid or. When you were little.
8933.0,Patient,"yeah sorry um well you know great when we have that the group about the personality types. And I fell under a few of them, but one of them was definitely the. caretaker or it's like yeah like you try really hard to look out for other people. You know, when I don't pay attention to lexi or she's on her own for a little bit she doesn't make the best choices right like she'll get sad if she doesn't understand something or she won't eat if she feels. uncomfortable so well, if you have kids right and then. it's Brian. Is a son he thinks he knows everything and he's he's very smart and I understand that i'm ignorant that. issue if he was in charge, we would be eating take out every night. yeah and be like 100 pounds overweight."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, I hear that I hear that, yes, I yeah I get that, believe me. My it's like that's one extreme right, where, if he were completely in charge, things would not go well. And then the other extreme is like you being not only fully in charge and fully responsible, but like having to manage and plan ahead every tiny little thing, and when things fall apart, if they really fall apart for you. Right and there's like there's kind of them, you know, the gap between those two things is pretty wide. Does that make sense."
8933.0,Patient,That that feels right yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So there is somewhere in the middle, like a place where. Where we don't put him in charge, but where he has like maybe a little more autonomy and. And where."
8933.0,Patient,I don't know what that word means. Autonomy autonomy.
416.0,Provider,"Like independence. Okay, and where you. You are able to just maybe relax enough or like let go enough not to stop planning and not to stop doing all of that, but just so that if something gets funky or something gets like twisted a little bit that you're able to pivot quickly and not fall apart from it. right or not have a panic attack."
8933.0,Patient,yeah okay.
416.0,Provider,"Right so somewhere in the middle of those two extremes right that doesn't mean being like Okay, Brian here you take over and out no that's definitely not what i'm proposing so don't don't hear that. But it's just a way for you know so, for example, you know the the hotel like they screwed up your room things went really wonky I mean you guys did pivot you were able to find another place. And it ended up working out, but then instead of like having a panic attack about it, you would just be like well I guess that was meant to be you know what I mean."
8933.0,Patient,"Well, we took it well, the first day That was the first I don't know if this is going to help, and the first day that's what happened, and then we had a great night and came back, everything is fine and then the second day. Second, second morning I just went out to go out for ISIS and they were really weird and then we had to get like that was that's where he he lost it. And then we had to get a microwave put in the room, because, like seeds we've been eating together and but she she wanted to get eat chicken nuggets. And there wasn't one, so we got one, and the first one that they brought sparked which was like it was scared the bleep at me because I was like oh my God is the whole electricity in this building, because they're really old buildings. Like are we gonna burn to death here that's that's I freaked out. yeah free last day."
416.0,Provider,So it was like a series of events that just sort of did it.
8933.0,Patient,Three massive horrible things yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So um I just realized the time you and I are only scheduled, however, we only get scheduled for half an hour this kind of keeps happening to us."
8933.0,Patient,Oh cuz we were doing really well.
