8331.0,Patient,every Friday afternoon I get up at 12 Friday so it'll just be a little bit after.
724.0,Provider,"sweet. So there's a good chance you're going to catch them after lunchtime that's a good time to do it it's like they're kind of full they're a little bit a little bit slow that's a good time to interview. If you had to like strategize you know first thing in the morning people might be flustered or cranky half asleep, and if you get too close to like when they're off of work they're not like in a rush."
8331.0,Patient,right before.
724.0,Provider,"lunch, yes it so catching them like right after lunch allow that food like settle in it, they kind of slow down a little bit so."
8331.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah that'd be a good time to do it. Do you know what our position is for.
8331.0,Patient,Next we get the exact terms but um I think it was starting with kind of like clerical work like back office support.
724.0,Provider,"So, like administration or."
8331.0,Patient,"yeah something like that, like hyper I think helping patients and inputting probably information and stuff. Okay yeah i'm excited because that's that's what i'm my brother in law and another friend of ours and that's kind of what they started with and then marriages able to kind of keep taking a little courses or classes. A lot of them online and then you can kind of get to do some other things around there."
724.0,Provider,"that's a good deal hospitals traditionally. provide a lot of opportunity for growth. And a lot of times they pay pretty well you know they're they're funded, you know appropriately so that's always a perfect. You know, health care, benefits or sometimes like. Are kind of like wrapped into their hospital itself so like like the health care costs are slightly low provided you go to like that hospital or you know for like your checkups and stuff so they have some really good incentives that would be. Well, when was the last time you interviewed for a job."
8331.0,Patient,"was like eight years ago, when I started looking at the school."
724.0,Provider,CD a little little little brush up.
8331.0,Patient,"yeah it's a good thing over different things. In a it works out and. And even if it doesn't so it seems like a lot more. I got a better idea of just look these applications are bad, but yeah I mean it seems like there's just a lot of openings in this area, right now, for everything in medical is shortage right now there is telling me."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's true that's true. There are some there are some like interviewing strategy videos on YouTube that I would definitely recommend you know. researching a little bit because it has like like a bunch of like old hr. People or people that work in HR or old CEOs were like like like the types of questions that they'd like to ask for an interview like what do you like about yourself tell me something. You know, unique or special sometimes like like you're going into these interviews. Somewhat unprepared, because you don't know what they're going to ask you so like it's good to get like a like a ballpark idea of some general questions that they're going to ask, so you can be prepared and like. Make sure you, you know you've researched the business or whatever, the position is it like make sure you understand, like what the expectation is like like asked about like little details about the job. At the end when they're like do you have any questions and a lot of people like nope you know you know really like you want to be like."
8331.0,Patient,"When I was first I did look up some videos I forgot all about that stuff so i'm writing it down right now to. Look at some of it, they did have so much of the stuff you're saying right now."
724.0,Provider,"One of the one of the questions that I like to ask. The interviewer at the end when they're like you have any questions i'm just like do you like your job, or do you like working for this company like like, can you tell me why you why you like working here like what are some of the. What are some of the things that attracted you to like this company, whatever it is so like like put the question like back on the interviewer you know a little bit of kind of like take some author. puts them on their heels, a little bit. And they'll likely remember that interview more than the other ones that are all like very generic you know what I mean, so I always look. At the. You know i'll ask like about like little details about the job and our last week, like what like How long have they been working for the company and like what about the company do they like. And it's like oh that's cool this guy's kind of personable and he's seems interested in, you know my role here, and then like so it just makes them feel good and it leaves a lasting impression, so I definitely encourage people to ask that question. At the end of an interview makes you stand out. So."
8331.0,Patient,i'm excited to. mommy yeah i'm gonna start that tonight because tomorrow. Actually right yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Oh, I thought it was next Friday oh yeah you're gonna want to get on get. on that."
8331.0,Patient,you'll be in a little late today.
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I mean get a notepad you seem like you're pretty organized anyways but I get a notepad and just see if there's like reoccurring questions that you keep saying watch a couple of videos you don't have to watch 20 of them you don't I mean just watch a few. Especially the ones that have a lot of views on the watch a couple of those and if. You see, like a pattern of questioning or line of questioning just write those down and have you know write your responses to those questions as if you were being interviewed and then you'll be more prepared for it."
8331.0,Patient,It will be something.
724.0,Provider,that'd be sweet. So what else is going on. how's the whole life.
8331.0,Patient,"Too much. Earlier in this weekend. So you had something going on. Just to some of these last couple I think Sunday Monday I was getting kind of stressed out, I think, just probably thinking about all this stuff and kind of preparing it and. Getting all that were separating it was making me. More confrontational than I would want to be like just even when there was no confrontation but just the responses were. Just kind of already not too. Positive and just kind of having that my. So didn't get as bad as it. was just a. Just stress, then I need to deal with it, but we did. manage to kind of figure it out more I got to figure it out we'll just talk about it more and. not let it keep going on past Mondays and. apply was was good."
724.0,Provider,"Nice, so how did you how did you cope with the stress."
8331.0,Patient,"And Sunday, I don't think I really did that."
724.0,Provider,What did you do.
8331.0,Patient,"yeah, but I just kind of. I just kind of like zoned out a lot of sunday's kind of highlights precedent, but Monday I was this. Is what I did Monday I started my morning routine different. That I woke up early enough to just kind of. Just kind of think about has been going on and get a little bit of studying done and think about. You know what things I wanted to kind of, say, to. fix the just the vibe that was going on the situation with the morning and it helped out a lot, because I mean yeah my wife, she was so a little stressed out from just having to help me with that a Sunday. And then I was able to. kind of back to her mind and just communicating more what else feeling or whatever was going on, I think it's I mean yeah it's up to us to kind of just move on with the weekend get things done."
724.0,Provider,Good so you still working on identifying triggers and then developing strategies to kind of cope with it. But it didn't get to the point where she was like why don't you go to your parents house for the night and never got to that point.
8331.0,Patient,That is say.
724.0,Provider,Okay well good that's progress all right. Good. Nice. and work is going through currently.
8331.0,Patient,"yeah it's still good so i've been. talking to a principal then a couple of days about just the everything going on with looking into this new journey and they've been very supportive, so I was, I was really nervous about that, like, I wanted to not really talk about it a lot. I mean I don't just want to talk about it's like stressful thing and then I also wanted to like matt alluded so last minute where it's like not leaving a good reputation between the. Just the employers are my supervisors prelate around so yeah I mean now they're. Like I brought it up a little while ago, so never it's everything's been going really positive, with all that."
724.0,Provider,And some no hard feelings.
8331.0,Patient,"yeah and like just helping them not have to like rush last minute to try to find replacements, and all that."
724.0,Provider,Good. Any change in on. medication effects or anything like that.
8331.0,Patient,"No one time, last week I miss those and I was feeling really tired like at the end of the day. But then I that's what made me realize like oh man okay. For had a dose but then I just kept on the next day regular and hadn't missed any so it's been good with that now. There wasn't anything. too big, of a deal with that."
724.0,Provider,So nothing like. Nothing D railing.
8331.0,Patient,yeah didn't interrupt. David I.
724.0,Provider,"over some of your chart here. how's the. outside of like the stress over the weekend how's the mental health, overall, for the past couple of weeks since the last time I saw you."
8331.0,Patient,"In a lot better when they were just we were Oh, you know actually we've been talking a lot these last couple weeks right, not just watching TV, but like. This just have a lot of things to just talk about today just different topics of thing we're talking about and then. yeah like that's been really good I think i've been. A lot better with communicating this week, like we're just talking a lot about a lot of stuff so that's been that's been nice i'm gonna keep keep that up."
724.0,Provider,We kind of things you guys talking about like long term goals are planning or just. day to day life.
8331.0,Patient,"A little bit about goals, but more just like. will be watching the show and then it'll trigger like an idea or conversation and then like will have to pause it because we're just talking about a like a whole tangent kind of thing so. Just like I think it just. kind of like just just fun just just talking like. Like. I mean there's just a lot of different things okay I don't know like I think recently she found. An old show that we used to watch I remember watching a smoother I think what I was like. Superman Superman."
724.0,Provider,"No yeah that's a good, those are good shows man."
8331.0,Patient,"yeah I remember like having to wait till the next week to watch and then we found out what this is on hulu and she was like Oh, I remember watching that shown as a you I remember watching that too and. And we're just like sneaking out on it and they're like oh that's cool let's check it out and, and this is funny like I think we're very like. Either like memories of things we've done in the past, or like or like was just talking about some. something about the show and then like we're just trying to like break it down and just have fun figuring things out or. I mean some things we're talking about like you know things we may want to do this year, the first step, I mean is It just seems like this is a lot more conversation like just like hanging out with a friend. And I think I think we've noticed that because I mean it wasn't like that so much like maybe last because. Like it's been getting better, but the like the stress that really bad stressful days would come up, and I even once you get over it it's like a residual."
724.0,Provider,This Laughter
8331.0,Patient,"Like just the more there's that I mean it's something we've talked about to like yeah I want to work on this, because even though, like. We might have a problem, and then you know what are you about it, or just you know be upset with each other or something yeah we'll forgive each other and kind of move on, but it's like."
724.0,Provider,it's still there are kinda.
8331.0,Patient,"yeah it's like even though, like we're not bringing it up anymore like she never brings up things once we like finished it and leave it but it's like. there's still that like it did do some damage emotionally like there's like it pushed it pushes whoever you have that argument with a little bit more so it's like you know that. tight as you were maybe before that argument, so I mean it's just a process so i've been working on. Just having that less. So that we can just kind of give back to not wasting so much time being stressed out or said."
724.0,Provider,That we talked last time about having like like a code word for. It like like if the conversations are getting to the point where. No real progress is being made. That y'all just calling a timeout and be like we'll just table it and then reconvene like other day on it or.
8331.0,Patient,"yeah I think we did we talked about it to. Let me see she tries to remind me about that too so and so yeah we haven't had to do that these last few weeks so that's been good and. I feel like just not having a big block for like. I think it's maybe like three weeks, like a bad freak out yeah since that last time, when I had to go take a break to reset site we've been able to kind of just not always be like on edge like on Am I gonna freak out today or not, you can just kind of. yeah I think that's that's the thing it's like it feels like. I feel like I can relax more. Like I. Like I haven't played before I was always on it, because I know it's a very real possibility and I could probably speak out on right now, you know it may not have to be a big reason for it and that's going to ruin our beans and you know right look through all that but. I mean just having these last few weeks to just kind of not have to let our not let myself get to that point it's I can kind of relax a little bit right now."
724.0,Provider,Good. Good. Do you do you exercise at all.
8331.0,Patient,yeah so a little bit in the mornings some some stretching and little bit exercise before I go to work.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean do you work up a sweat you get your heart rate up or is it just kind of like a casual. Do a couple push ups on call it."
8331.0,Patient,"This month I haven't done that too much, but I was talking to her want to get back into that that kind of a more strenuous workout."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i'm i'm a huge advocate for for physical exercise would helping with dealing with you know anxiety anger management depression. So much of the way that that we feel a lot of times is connected to like an activity, you know if you're just. Getting up going to work. coming home eating dinner sitting down watching TV going to bed waking up going to work, you know what I mean like like there's. We get on like like this routine it's very robotic and there's no there's no incentive for the body to want to produce additional serotonin or. dopamine and it's just like whoa we can pretty much function at this. At this routine and not exert a lot of energy it's okay with that, but like mentally you're not you know I mean you're you're looking. You know you're fantasizing about better paying jobs and more time with the girlfriend spending more time with the dog and more time to keep but. When you get home you're just too tired you just don't have the energy and it sounds counterproductive to be like yeah you should be working out. it's like but wait I don't have the energy to do that it's like which you will like when you do work out you do get energy, you know what I mean like it jumpstart. Your your vehicle you know what I mean and and a lot of different ways and it's like an improves physical health and improves. Mental health which then improves emotional health, like all these benefits from from doing something that should. 30 minutes you know what I mean, like most people commit 30 minutes out of their day you know get their heart rate up a little bit you know just do some. Rigorous activity and then benefit long term all day from like a bit for 30 minutes it's like it pays off like most of the day, so no I definitely encourage you to to you know work on developing a routine like in the near future and then kind of like factor that in you know I mean. I promise you, when you probably see like a lot, you probably have like a lot fewer dust stops you know when you're physically healthy and when you're physically healthy you're you're you're mentally healthy so."
8331.0,Patient,It allows you some. Clarity and.
724.0,Provider,"You know, all those all those benefits that you get from this being in good shape just feeling good. The runner's high that and i'm not a huge proponent from running running is a lot of work for for me and for like a lot of people but. You ever heard of like the runner's high."
8331.0,Patient,yeah yeah I think. I don't I don't find anything.
724.0,Provider,Some enjoyable for me.
8331.0,Patient,"And uh but I. I used to work out a lot, and we will do that a lot but yeah I feel like these last couple months I haven't done it as much and i'm glad you brought that up because I think I just needed to get that reminder like I know it's really good for me and they mind. But I do wanna get get a routine for that going up a little more."
724.0,Provider,"yep I definitely I definitely always encourage it and you know if you have the luxury of going to a gym or having a gym in your House Those are all good but, most people don't have that option, you know so. i'm a huge proponent for like bodyweight exercises because it costs you nothing to you know get on the ground and do some push ups. You know cost you nothing to do flutter kicks or sit ups or anything like that, or you know if you got a table or a chair, you can do you know. You know dips off of the Chair like little things that cost you nothing to do you just walking around in your body, you know bodyweight squats just doing a squat motion without way it's like you know prison squats like all those things will help. move the blood flow get the heart pumping get some oxygen into those lungs and then it goes everywhere, I mean that's just kick starts all the positive neurotransmitters in your brain and you know you're off to the races so. You know. 15 minutes when you wake up and maybe 15 minutes for you go to bed it doesn't ask for a lot, but if you just you'd benefit all day from it so. yeah definitely a."
8331.0,Patient,Bigger team and breaking it up that way.
724.0,Provider,"yep and i've talked to people before. during the week I don't have a whole lot of free time is i'm working in when i'm when i'm not on costumes and I entertain like two kids and a puppy. And then i'll go back down and i'll do more counseling and i'll get a break and i'll come up and i'll entertain them so like I don't really have a whole lot of free time. For anything so I keep playing cards like a deck of playing cards on my desk and i'll just systematically like pull five of them right and. Each suit vote each card suit i've developed a an exercise routine whether it's a push up or bodyweight squat or something. And I pull five cards and i'm like Okay, and whatever that number is that somebody I do so for the heart right so by cool like a five of hearts that means I gotta do five push ups. If I pull like a five of spades it means I gotta do like like five rows hank something to do like five rows. or pull ups, you know getting into like a pull up bar downstairs and then it's like I just do that and I did it like three times a day. And, as I finished a card, I put it in a pile and then by the end of the week I look at that pile and I was like okay. I did a whole bunch of stuff this week, you know I don't feel like a total loser like because I couldn't dedicate 30 minutes or an hour to the gym but i'm like I was kind of active this week I did a little bit. And all that stuff adds up you know what I mean so like when you don't have a whole lot of free time and you only got five minutes to do a couple of things do those things you know. So yeah I use playing cards as a way to like trick the body, and you know when I sit down at the desk of my gosh shit I gotta do 10 push ups, before I move on to the next card i'm like all right i'll do it right now, and like i'll get down and i'll do it so little things like that for. You know if you're at work, and you have time, like every hour or so like it down and be like five push ups, at the end of the day, you've done 4040 push ups, if you work eight hours, like alright cool I got paid to do 40 push ups today too. So just a little tricks like that to help you know for for us super busy people I don't have the luxury to work out all day like it's just a little bit a little bit helps."
8331.0,Patient,yeah. reminders.
724.0,Provider,"So we only got a couple minutes left. I got somebody else coming in, so let's see i'm going to book your next appointment and I think i'm booking out until February now. So is this time so good for you."
