Right, especially with my styles. were worried about that. And my job."
235.0,Provider,yeah. Bad you couldn't do like telework for like. Two days a week and then go in. and

3170.0,Patient,"Everyone airbnb is their house because it's working you get more if we lived like a New York, they have. Like limits set Oh, you only get like 90 days to have your your airbnb.

235.0,Provider,"i'm just wondering, would it you love the area you're not going to move that's that's where you're you're rooted, I mean I, this is my my my thinking. I would really think to take a look at what a space would cost over there and mo motor home park unless it's unless it's a real, which we call it. You know, like a drug. or something, but if it's like older people, or whatever yeah."
