Three for an adult is like that's the I."
252.0,Provider,"And for kids I always thought that was too so yeah I was you know one time, I was really lucky because I took my daughter she's just a baby and.

She she was sitting there, I was trying to get her to nurse, and she just couldn't breathe or her nose and so she wouldn't nurse and then all of a sudden, she just like. was looking up at me and she started to like get really lethargic and I thought Okay, maybe she's gonna take a little nap and she started to turn blue. It scared me and yeah so I called the ambulance the ambulance took her to the hospital and she was in hospital for 10 days with the rsc.

You know, and so last day as I kept getting up throughout the night to like take care of them and, at one point I was like starting to feel really tired and frustrated and overwhelmed by it and. I went into my son's room and you know, he was coffee, so I gave him a nasal spray blow his nose and was rubbing his back and he looked over at me he's like Bobby you're the best Bob ever and I love you so much. This is like melted my heart, and I was like you know.

252.0,Provider,I tell you what we do right that's why we suffer in silence and we make sure that they're taken care of and. You know those moments like that we never get them back.
2514.0,Patient,"No, we don't."
252.0,Provider,"You know, and knowing that you're up front and present for him, even though you're sick and you're in pain is amazing."
2514.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah and it's kasich yo I have those days, where. yeah I do, I am I, like. Either my husband and I like we haven't been very intimate just because, like i'm so thin right now, you know and he's bigger so it's it it's just. it's uncomfortable you know, and I honestly part of it, too, is like I don't feel comfortable in my in my own skin and my body I all bone and. You know i'm bony and I have no meat on me and you know my boots has shrunk the whole size, and so I feel so insecure about my body and. You know my husband he just helped me last night and he said, how do you like you know I love you for you, you know about whether you're sick whether you're well like it doesn't matter I I love you, and if you just want to lay here and just you know i'll just told you. And you can fall asleep Okay, I know I know and because I had been feeling guilty, because I hadn't I hadn't felt up to it a lot lately. You know, and his love language is definitely physical type. Words for me my love language is more like. You know, helping me doing things for me, you know, like that's my love language like if he does the dishes like that is something that you know it's like a turnoff for me it's like Oh, all you see is like you know those those types of things, then. Or you know gifts, for no reason, like those you know, thoughtful things like thinking of me and something that would make what helped me or make me feel better make me feel good Those are the things that are my love language and. You know, for him, I already i've known for years that his love language was touch and so you know i've been trying to like massages back, and you know other ways that I can make him feel loved and make him feel you know. That have that physical touch without. You know, always having to have the intimacy. and pressure. yeah but, when he said that it just it really made me feel better because I had this feeling like I wasn't. doing enough for him, you know, like, I was letting him down and he just totally like he's like that's a lie, you just need to let that go that's a lie, from the enemy, you know they'll hold on to that not true."
252.0,Provider,"Whole. Tell me that that things like that make you feel so close to your partner. You know, safe loved you know they just really do to cure, you know, all we need you know."
2514.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's true. yeah security is so important for a mom or a wife, you know it's so important for us at our partner, and for them to you know. And after everything that i've been through with marvin you know with the abuse with our our separation and you know just our everything I am so thankful that I have a man that was that was willing to grow with me. yeah that looked at himself and said, you know you're not the only one that has areas that you need to change and grow, and you know i'm ready to do this with you. And he was slow at first, he was he was very slow at first, you know you was kind of like, but your problems, bigger than by type of attitude, you know you really be focused on your problems. But then he kind of started looking more into himself and lately it's been more about like you know we're growing together like. As you know, as husband and wife says one like we are, we are growing as on the same page, so it it's It makes me feel very, very secure in my marriage, whereas I never I never felt that before."
252.0,Provider,"that's amazing, especially when you're going through physical illness, you know what I mean that. You know. it's just huge. It just shows you that you know relationships go through so much and. If you could just stick it out, if you can just. hang on you know, yes, some point, it has to change, you know."
2514.0,Patient,"yep I agree, I be I have a friend. Who i've known since. elementary school and she actually lived with be a marvin for a little while we were back when we were young and dating. And she had two kids with this guy they never got married, but you know her mom passed away very tragic that she fell through a table and had a brain hemorrhage on literally on new year's Eve. A couple years ago. And you know she was very bad alcoholic like had the heavy heavy and. My friend always kind of had that same issue, where she she would drink too much he would get you know, really, really, really wasted like blackout wasted and even from the time like I do are in high school. And I mean we were always taking care of her you know, like she was always just would go take it too far, you know and. She so she got together with this guy they kind of had the same issue, you know and. Recently, she went through kind of a crisis where she was just like I can't be with heavy war, because he refuses to make any changes. And so, she left him, and she left, the only thing that that kind of broke my heart is that she left the kids with him. And so, she was like well I I just need to do some self seeking so i'm going to go away for a month and leave the kids with him and I just need my own time. And I was like whoa you know, are you drinking good you know, like what's going on and she's like no I just I can't be with him and i'm like well why wouldn't you take your your kids you know. And she she got really defensive, I have another friend that we were all really close to me back during that time. And so I called her up and I was like hey Tara really needs like she needs us to like can you give her a call to because she's not really responding and Danny you should not really hearing me, you know, and so I thought, maybe another person talking to her would help her and. yeah but ultimately she ended up finding a new boyfriend and then she went and got her kids and now they're in this nasty custody battle and it's just. it's heartbreaking you know, and I look back and marvin I could have been that could have been us very easily if we didn't make that choice to fight for each other to fight for our marriage to put. You know, it was always about the kids it was like kids comfort comfort kids come first, but in reality. Our marriage has to be solid, in order for our kids to come to be at a healthy place and to comfort we can't make them a priority if we're not together and we're not solid and we don't have a good foundation. What. idea okay you i'm almost done okay. alrighty. I love you. By my five year old if she says yes. You can take a look at do. Like either you know. yeah. i'm."
252.0,Provider,"really goes, true to what to putting your own mask on before you put your kids my son on that airplane it's like."
2514.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know they go through what you go through.
2514.0,Patient,"They do. You know yep. yeah absolutely. I mean what, when I was away from marvin for Ted Ted days there was one night marvin called me and he he was like you know billy's really upset she she just had like a total breakdown and she had a seizure. And I was like she had a Caesar and he's like yeah they think it was anxiety or stress induced and. And I was like oh my gosh is that even possible, and you know it just broke my heart that she was so traumatized by everything that. me and him were going through it affected her physically not just emotionally, but it like you know that and I hadn't learned at that point, how trauma can affect your body. You know and yeah that was that was in a really hard but heartbreaking moment for me. And I never wanted to put my kids through that ever again, you know marvin and I, at that point where like we need to. We need to decide if we're going to make this work, you and me, or if we want to co parent because us being apart and not being there together for them is not working, so we either have to co pair it or we are you choose each other, we got to make that choice you know. and yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, makes a big difference that solid foundation, you know, is the rock. You know that helps kids grow healthy, you know and feel safe and secure you know and oftentimes we get so enthralled in our own hurt and our own pain we we don't think about what's in you know what they're going through to you know."
2514.0,Patient,"pharaoh and I think part of it, too, is like my oldest she started talking so late, and I she witnessed the most out of all my kids. You eat marvin I you know some like brutal fights and. You know ugly stuff and you know she saw hidden hurt me, and I think about how that affected her how that may be slowed her speech, you know, maybe she wanted to talk, but she couldn't because. Of the trauma and everything that she had seen and was going through so she preferred to be in silence and. You know it breaks my heart, looking back, but now I see her and where she's at and i'm like. she's amazing she's grown so much you know."
252.0,Provider,Just.
2514.0,Patient,"yeah and I see what these two years have done for her and she's just. she's to get so frustrated with things she's to just start crying and he tybee like edo told her and she did something wrong or she got in trouble, she would just have these breakouts all the time and Elijah close the door and now she doesn't have those breakout sitting, for you know. Sometimes, she she still gets frustrated and she'll. feel like like you know and i'm like really just take a break, let it go for now come back to it later and before I mean even her teachers are like this is a really big issue where she was she gets too frustrated and she starts crying. Yes, school with even just with schoolwork and. Do that anymore, you know she got through that and I think about all the times over the last you know, especially this last year, where I I talked her about talking about your feelings. Talk about your feelings tell me how you're feeling what's wrong because she didn't talk until she was she couldn't you could not fully understand her till she was six and a half ish. yeah and even now, as he still kind of has like. A speech impediment. To her voice. But you could understand her when she speaks like spaghetti so say like. get to know like she hasn't got like really pronounce it to get it right, or else it comes out. and other and other one is that Chris thought, sometimes it comes out like criticize."
252.0,Provider,The two s's because this is.
2514.0,Patient,yeah so it sounds like Christmas thought.
252.0,Provider,"And so, continued to continue to outgrow it, you know that you know you guys are working, a solid foundation and the solid marriage supporting one another and that's how they thrived yeah."
2514.0,Patient,"yeah when the home when the the energy and the positivity is at home is healthy and the parents are healthy, is it accidentally the kids thrive in that environment, and you can tell. You know when i've been around other kids, especially at the Church, or when I was volunteering for. back when the before the pandemic when I first went into recovery, I used to volunteer for the Church. And we would go to. They had this toy drive and then they also had this the volunteer once a month, where we go to the Foster home. And you know just say they're talking to some of those kids like you don't see that same. joy and light in their eyes that you see with kids that that are from a safe, healthy home, you know, like you can see that there's there's something in them and I recognize it because I used to see it and lily. My oldest are used to see that in her where there was like this, this thing inside of her that you know prevented her from feeling all that joy and love and. And and security and safety, you know it was it was like written on her face and it's become obvious to me now when I see when I talk to kids I see kids if they. You know, they just ignore great joy that's what kids do and when they're lacking that wonder, you know what. Okay i'm sorry Rebecca to the kids keep coming in and no."
252.0,Provider,it's all right.
2514.0,Patient,"What. believable close the door go nope I can't believe you just ask that buddy like you know better close it close the door a little bit get your head out of there you're gonna smash your head. Did you smash your head all both. kid I I want you to bow. i'm trying to get them away from watching YouTube and when they get they get an hour of pad time usually every day. When they get home from school, I give them like their hour break like okay guys could watch YouTube you can play games for a little bit or you can. You know, watch watch a movie watch a TV show, but you have one hour, you know, put the timer on it everything. And lately they've been watching a lot of game watching on YouTube. And, like all of these older teenagers playing games and you know a lot of that stuff you know the kids are just it's just not age appropriate for them. So i'm like you guys can start with the YouTube please because it's it's they're getting addicted to it."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
2514.0,Patient,"I can tell that they're getting addicted to it because it's always like do we want to keep watching do we want you to tell me what you choose to reassess you know so now i'm like okay when they went to YouTube like I got to approve every video. I make them bring me the the pad and asked me. Like hey can I watch this video because there's so much on YouTube and even with the settings on that I have for them. So there's a bill yeah if they find stuff then i'm like oh my gosh you get what's that. How does that even show up Vito and the ads are so kid appropriate to they have scary movies, and just all kinds of bad stuff so yeah."
252.0,Provider,That is a big thing with kids right now is watching other kids play games now I don't mind in my house I don't mind if they're watching a kid play minecraft.
2514.0,Patient,yeah yeah my kids like minecraft too. yeah minecraft.
252.0,Provider,"minecraft or building game it's totally cool, but any."
2514.0,Patient,Some of those years.
252.0,Provider,he's teaching you how to play a game that's about killing people no. i'm not mad yeah. I know there's there's this game called robach.
2514.0,Patient,"Your kids love it and they used to love this game called adopt me. And they have all these different pets at it and it was a really safe game, but then they started venturing. out and started looking at other games that they could play a roadblock and there there's one called tell us how like there's role play games there's all kinds of like bad stuff on there wow and. You know that and. Well, I was looking at their their pads and it's like recommended for you, you know, whatever he would play, and it has, like all these like kind of like how netflix was. You know, and so i'm looking through them, and I see ones that are like you know LGBT Q, you know and, like all this different stuff and i'm like oh my gosh that you know or or paradise. Or the bachelorette you know they have all these different games are like way advance and really the game is you play in a virtual world you know. And so yeah and I don't want my kids to get too attached to living in a virtual world you know with you know fake things and wanting to buy, you know that, like caring more about how their Avatar look, then how they look and. it's very easy to get sucked into that fake world and I don't want that to happen, for them, or they like lose the reality and care more about the non reality. And you know, obviously that's what the people who make these games one. Because they make more money, but i'm like this is dangerous for kids. You know, because it's it's a. delicate balance for them as the stage they're sponges so if i'm teaching if I allow them to place up, they were there in a virtual world that they can role play, and they can do things that are you know might have been appropriate scuff it it it's it's not healthy for them. know so."
252.0,Provider,You know.
2514.0,Patient,"Even my even my 10 year old you know and she's like well cannot eat Oh, she she plays like you know all of this, she plays this game, and she please amanda said i'm like you're not playing that i'm sorry."
252.0,Provider,To her good for her but.
2514.0,Patient,you're not playing among us like that's not happening that's just that's yours you're it's violent you know.
252.0,Provider,"I don't blame him, you know they've got so much stuff at such a young age, that are exposed to so much. That they shouldn't have to even worry about it, a young age when they're in that virtual world and. it's easy because that's exactly what they want, you know when kids are stuck in that virtual world. They lose themselves, they forget how to play outside they forget how to be a kid you know."
2514.0,Patient,"And now we face, but coming out with the maid of birth or whatever and it's like going to be like a virtual reality world you know where you can create your own, you know how said, have all of your you actually you can use crypto coins to buy stuff in this virtual world and. Well, made a verse of the more I was like looking into it reading about it, what Facebook is coming out with with this made a verse I was like this is there have you seen or heard of the movie ready player one."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
2514.0,Patient,"I haven't wiring it's very much like that it's just like so in ready player one they all the whole world is just they all live in this virtual world more than they live in reality. You know they spend all their time in this this virtual game world and the whole world has gone to craft. You know it's. it's you know they they live in, you know houses that are you know, like little. trailers, you know, like truck trailers like what they would put on the back of the truck like. To like live in stuff like that it's so bad in the movie how they show the world because they just forgot about the real world and all they care about is this virtual world and. yeah it is, and the more I was reading about the data versus like madness it's just like ready player one like I don't want my kids to be involved in anything like this, you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean. You gotta you gotta check their mind you know.
2514.0,Patient,yeah We really do it it's getting harder and harder the. stuff that they have out there now it's hard there's. there's so much. there's so much.
252.0,Provider,yeah so minecraft i'm cool with anything else I don't want.
2514.0,Patient,"yeah my kids love to play minecraft you. i'm good with minecraft. We played this game. is called it takes to add it's a it's a Co op game my husband and I actually got it from me and him to play my brother and his wife recommended it and it's like. it's basically about this. This has been in wife, they tell their daughter that they're getting a divorce. And then daughter is like heartbroken and so she's like she makes these little wooden dolls of them, and she starts crying and their tears actually bring the little dolls to life. And so you know, obviously it's not real she doesn't know that they're they came to life, she can't talk to them or see that their lives, but they are alive. And so, they have to work through all of these problems, but it takes both of them to get through each part of the game. So you can't you can't do it by yourself, it takes to write and throughout the game they end up fixing their marriage, by working together. And so it's like it was such a good, it was such a good message and and wholehearted game, I was like you know the kids could play this with us, you know and it's kind of like an rb game, like in a puzzle game like you have to. figure out the different puzzles and the arby's, and I mean it took us like six months to finally get to the root of that game, because we could only play it every so often. Do you know but and on the weekends i'll let the kids play it for an hour to and they they love it, you know."
252.0,Provider,that's cool.
2514.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, but it was it was kind of like a therapy therapeutic game for me, it had to play in a way, you know was like we had to work together and figure it out together. And then, when we beat it we were like we. Finally. Together together."
252.0,Provider,"yeah it's funny because. One of my co workers and I were talking about kids and games and. She was telling me that you can look online, you know for games that that they have to work together board games that they have to work together to solve."
2514.0,Patient,"You know, whatever it."
252.0,Provider,"Is and the more that they play those types of games, the more they build the skills to be a team Member right."
2514.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely.
252.0,Provider,"And so. It was something that we've been looking into for Christmas presents you know, work together games games that are. The kids that you know get them to understand that they are one of a team."
2514.0,Patient,"Their team yeah yep absolutely. I thought that I mean that's what me and my brothers were still so close you know because. We had parents that that taught us, I mean, especially by mom my mom was always telling us like you guys you guys meet each other you're always going to need each other, you know just say i'm sorry, you know she would do like a forgiveness like. Like we would have to each tell each other, like i'm sorry I. You know, we use forgives me as the other person would say I forgive you and to be like okay kiss or brothers like I don't want to kisser yeah i'm not can see my sister. she's like okay that has you know and yeah we did that all the time, and my brothers and I, we were we were always so close and it was always important that we remember when we did something wrong to each other, or we hurt each other that we went through that forgiveness, with each other. Because we didn't want to hold on to and I guess my mom had really bad relationships with her, her brothers. Whereas her sisters. She was much more close to and her brothers, you know they. She would like to race, the same way, so she decided I want my kids to be close I want my kids to always be friends with each other, even when they're adults. And so, she really tried to instill that in us and I want the same for my kids I always want them to lean on each other to be there for each other, even after you marvin is gone or i'm gone. You know."

You know i'll never do anything intentionally that's going to harm you, you can always trust me, I will always have your back you know those things are so vitally important.
