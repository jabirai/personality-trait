16106.0,Patient,"I spoke to. My mom and my mother's sister, so my aunt their lives in San Pedro. But that was it."
498.0,Provider,"What led to what led to the decision to kind of draw the hotline and a fan, is it was it a continuation of the relocation."
16106.0,Patient,"Well i'm. A lot has happened since I last spoke to you and I was having issue one currently having issues on my apartment with roaches. So, on top of you know, the transition and being in a new environment and living in apartment for the first time and dealing with roaches like. This the infestation it's really bad, so I was dealing with like anxiety and I just kind of felt like my mom's will i'm currently at my grandfather's house and that's my grandfather on my dad's side. I just kind of realized that will be in here i've realized that my mom's side of the family is just not their dysfunctional. And it's just I can't deal with it, you know, like i've dealt with it for so many years, and now that i'm grown and I know better it's like I just can't. I can't like I love them still, but I just I can't can't be around them."
498.0,Provider,"That you can do both you can love them and still. protect and maintain a boundary for your own mental health in your own success. Right, good for you for that."
16106.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,"Well you're okay you're safe in your grandfather's House so that's that's allowing you to like maintain and the good thing. Is you're not home. So I know it's so stressful yeah you're not having to be subjected to you know, an environment that you're not accustomed to."
16106.0,Patient,"Right and I don't have to worry about certain things like you know they gossip a lot and just create drama and, like my whole experience of like moving and stand with my on that was hard like. It was really hard and I kind of felt like she was like manipulating me and just like staring me the wrong way, and so I just kind of was like let me back away from this because. It was just hard like and I just recognize the characteristics of my mom my grandmother. My aunt like they all are the same type of person and it's just like i'm recognizing certain things and. i'm realizing where I want to be in my life as far as like I want to be married, I want to have my career, I want to be successful. So i'm thinking, what do I need to surround myself with to make that happen, I can't surround myself around bitter women that are angry and jealous and deceitful manipulative I can't do it. So that's why I chose not to. You know, be around them and I realized my space my mental space in my energy level is I don't have to worry about anything."
498.0,Provider,it's not being penetrated and broken down with. That that's going to deplete you.
16106.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,i'm happy with you and your father.
16106.0,Patient,"We still talk he lives in Atlanta, so we text every day still and. it's been very interesting because I feel like i've known of my dad side of the family, but I didn't really know them and so being here, because i've came here i've been here since last Sunday so just being here, I learned that my grandfather had a. Two brothers, I only thought he had one this whole time and meeting certain family members and just realizing their values and how supportive, they are. to certain things versus I would never get certain support from my mom's side and i'm thinking back to like. When I had a boyfriend my dad side of the family, they were supportive my mom's side of the family, they never supported any of my boyfriend's I was never allowed to. bring any of my boyfriend's around and just kind of everything that i've been going through like my on like they try and tear down every relationship that i've had and just. Just awful just awful people and very dysfunctional and I just i'm thinking about like how my mom will kind of make me feel. Bad for one in a relationship with my dad but then, in the same time, say Oh, I want you i'm encouraging that. So it's it's kind of manipulative because it's like that's really not what you're saying, but you're trying to make it seem that way, so you don't appear to be an evil person, but you really are."
498.0,Provider,Happy you since you've had a chance to. resume your relationship with your dad Have you had a chance to talk about your new perspective on your dad with your mom. How did that go.
16106.0,Patient,"And he just you know, asked me what could he have done what could he do now to like make our relationship better because I told him like I recognize that. A lot of it had to do with my mom's influence you know if my mom if my dad bought me something or he wrote me a letter they would say something about it. and try and make me feel bad or try and say certain things like my dad didn't care about me or you know just anything like you know anything."
498.0,Provider,"Are you happy talk to your mother about. The resumption the resuming of the relationship with your father and how you see things differently, no."
16106.0,Patient,"I have talked to her briefly, you know I think she knows, like my mindset and how you know i'm operating now is different. What I used to tolerate I don't tolerate it anymore, but I used to make an excuse for I don't I call it what it is, and I don't care if it hurts their feelings, the me speaking my truth."
498.0,Provider,was a mom take on. On where you are now and. Just kind of your evolution in your growth.
16106.0,Patient,"I don't know, but I know I talked to her recently, and I did tell her I said, you know I feel like growing up you taught me to kind of be abused in a way, like it was Okay, because you're never you allow people to walk over you and you never. Like you wanted me to forgive your son for a lot of this stuff that he's done to hurt me but we'd never like he's never corrected the issue it's always been forgive him cover you know cover up what he does, and I feel like that's you telling me to just be abused in a way. he's never had to take accountability for anything that he's done, though i'm supposed to walk around and sell that's my brother I forgive him nothing that's you know it's all fine where we're just going to be a hill family know we have to do work. He has to do the work he can't just keep hurting me and keep doing I said he kept doing the same thing over and over again, you want me to forgive somebody who keeps doing the same thing over and over to me. Now. And I think it's crazy how she wants me to forgive her son and to love him unconditionally, but she couldn't even do that for herself, as far as like any other relationship when she speaks about my dad she says. Oh, you know your dad cheated on me and that's why the relationship didn't work, but your son can abuse women in you're supposed to forgive him it's no different if you can make it work with your son, you can forgive and love another man."
498.0,Provider,The behavior the behavior regardless of who committed.
16106.0,Patient,mm hmm.
498.0,Provider,"So what about what about you. What about next steps for. For you, moving forward with regard to. Your mother's side of the family and are you comfortable with where you guys are now, and do you feel like. you'll be able to continue to love them and limit and maintain those boundaries before."
16106.0,Patient,"yeah as long as i'm out of their touch. And they don't know what's going on with me and they have no access to me because you know they stopped me my cousin and my arm they drive past my apartment. You know it's weird like they act weird towards me and I really felt like I couldn't trust any of them, because when I was living with my mom she was tracking my phone. And she didn't know that I knew that she was tracking my phone, because every time she would track my phone I would get an alert and it will tell me exactly who it was. So she would track my phone thinking that I wouldn't know. And then you know they talk about me behind my back, and then they stopped me just you know just all of it like it's just a lot, so I feel like with me being. At my grandfather's house i'll be able to find a place that's suitable for me and i'll be able to do it on my own terms because I couldn't live in Montes house. I stayed there for two weeks because I couldn't tolerate it like. The private she's like she went through my stuff there was no privacy she's gossiping about me she's jealous of me because she can't figure out why I can find a place in two weeks, and she it took her two months to find a place, she was trying to. Use me to use my credit to buy a house like it was a lot, it was alive in that I ended up getting the apartment that I got in a rush, because I was like I can't I can't stay with her and I chose the wrong part place. And plus I operated out of fear. You know I went from the situation when my brother, to be in a motel to my auntie took me in, and that was a terrible situation, so I ended up taking the apartment that approved into the first one that approved me, and it was horrible. So, now that i'm here at my grandfather's House and you know, because my original goal was the reason why I stayed with my family so long was because I was saving to buy a house. I never wanted to live in an apartment that wasn't my goal, I wanted to move from their house to my own house and. I kind of when everything happened I kind of felt angry and bitter because I said I love this man to take me on the character, where he pushed me out of my goals you know me being in San Pedro I felt like I was out of alignment. I wasn't doing what I wanted to do I wasn't living the life that I wanted for myself, I was forced to be there and it wasn't what I wanted. And so, now that i'm getting out of that apartment and i'm staying here with my grandpa it just makes me feel like they get it, you know, because my father, he kind of did the same thing he didn't live in apartment he went from living here to find his own house. Until that's the kind of structure that my grandfather, and my father, they have their business owners, they own property they're going to encourage you to buy a house they're not going to. Try and you know if I say Oh, I want to buy a house they're not going to try and tell me Oh well, you need this or you can do it, you know seeds of doubt they're not going to do it they're going to be like okay what's the plan."
498.0,Provider,"Like you have a good like a really good support system in your grandfather. So the plan for you now. is to stay there, with him, so you have a safe supportive space. Get out of your apartment and. Secure your own home purchase is that okay. yeah. Now it actually it sounds like you're in a eat in even better space now. or yeah your goal, then, even when you were first."
16106.0,Patient,"exam. And that's why. I can't be too upset because i'm here and i'm able to work I don't have to worry about you know my brother sabotaging me with loud music and cussing and whatever it is that he's trying to do the kids being loud, but my grandpa's house is bigger and it's just him. No one lives here so i'm able to work he doesn't disturb me, and you know I I can do what I need to do and I don't have to worry about anything."
498.0,Provider,"Important okay. Thanks basically. yeah. It sounds like a sounds like an ideal environment for goal achievement. yeah mm hmm. So all has not been in vain. Even even the Pasty relocation, it was difficult it was painful it was uncomfortable it still led you to this space."
16106.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,and So what else. Other than being in this wonderful new space to. utilize as a leaping leap board to achieving goals one. and What else has been going on since the last it's been it's been a long four weeks so you did that a lot of stuff that's been going on.
16106.0,Patient,"Any disruption crediting just trying to get out of least at this point, going back and forth with you know. The leasing people, and now they didn't take out the rent buy my stuff is still there. Moving it I should have everything out on Saturday, but i've been reaching out to them, seeing you know what's going on and. You know they didn't charge me rent so Does that mean, are they breaking me out of the lease and their radio silence so that's making me kind of feel you know, like what is going on, but I had anxiety man they're. Like it was it got it was too much and then dealing with my aren't telling me oh you don't have a Roach infestation trying to tell me I didn't have a Roach infestation when the exterminator came and confirm that I did. You know, but I guess for me i'm going to move. The rest of my stuff on Saturday and i'm going to have my mom helped me, but I have to mentally prepare myself for that, because she's a lot to handle like. And just her mindset and and some of the things that she says it's like i'm not to convince like she apologized to me that i'm not convinced that anything has changed."
498.0,Provider,"I know. oftentimes that's the case. oftentimes the case that people. Are apologetic they do have empathy for. The heart that they inflict. That it's not a determinant of. A change in behavior change in behavior takes some real accountability and some real work. you'll you'll you'll have to prepare yourself. To deal with the relationship, despite the behavior."
16106.0,Patient,and
498.0,Provider,"Just being aware that you still you can still maintain boundaries. Your the boundaries that you have set for yourself. they're not contingent upon other people change in their behavior. Regardless of their behavior your boundaries can stay in place, you can continue to excuse me, you can continue to engage with people. However, you see fit, but the boundary can still be maintained even even during your move. The move the move is not an excuse to cross those boundaries."
16106.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm like she's like i'm grateful for her helping me, but like when she was when she was helping me she was going through my stuff and i'm like you don't need to do that, you know. Why, why are you looking through my papers like, why are you going through every little thing you don't have to I told you how to package, it, you know. Just do you don't need to snoop around, and you know."
498.0,Provider,"If because, if he has questions you can direct them to you."
16106.0,Patient,mm hmm.
498.0,Provider,"You can be willing to share what you're willing to share and what you're not willing to share you're just not willing to share and that can that can comprise like the beginning and the end of it. Thank you, whatever questions you have about what's going on with me, I welcome them. If it's something that i'm willing to share i'll let you know if it's something that i'm not willing to share i'll let you know that you don't you're absolutely correct you don't have to. Nor am I, giving you permission to actually i'm giving you an explicit directive to not go through my. theory it's respectful you can still love her, she can still love you because you all's relationship is not contingent on her you know, knowing everything. There still a fair balance, they still awake for the relationship to sustain. yeah as long as the boundaries are adhered to."
16106.0,Patient,"And that's part of the reason why I don't want to. continue my relationship with my art, because with my mom I can set boundaries. She knows who I am i'm like no absolutely not with my aunt she doesn't respect boundaries. I can say oh I don't want to, I want to talk about it she'll keep pressing to keep asking keep asking and it's like no. You don't and even when I lived with her, there was no privacy like she would be read in my messages like at work or if i'm right next to her she's reading my messages on my text, and you know, like. i'm grown like i'll need you in my business. And then they know like I haven't been. In that apartment because my car hasn't been parked there. And they. Face time and say oh i'm open a door we're downstairs. I said downstairs to what. She says oh to your apartment I said i'm not there okay and i'm like you guys have any visit me since i've been there and I was there for three months. don't try and act like you care it's always been a one sided thing if I don't come visit you you're not coming to visit me. And only time we call him, he is to gossip."
498.0,Provider,"That. They did just come to visit in that you've already made your mind up about. your intention, because of past. occurrences."
16106.0,Patient,"Well, the only time, the only reason why she came was because my cousin was in town. And i'm close with him. But she wasn't coming on our own. into Oh, this is her apartment."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, I just thought are. You okay with saying me again in four weeks have you are you continuing with your individual therapy. Yes, okay okay okay. i'm not snooping and that's the thing it all just wanting to know if. you're okay with updating me in four weeks about how the continuance of how everything is going. yeah okay okay OK schedule a four week appointment with me. Continue continue continue to hold firm to your boundaries. Because you're out of the environment that you were previously and you're able to determine and maintain boundaries. i'm sure you'll continue to see more and more successes and then the apartment was just a temporary and success, it was provided you. The environment that you need for Tipperary, time and now you're in a space that's even. more appropriate for your long term goals and so now it's time for you to be focused on that your goal and a continuation of yourself, so you don't exactly what someone in your position at your age should be doing at this time. Just be mindful. that everyone is not on this. journey of goal attainment with you. And so there, there may come some times, where you want to. include other people want it and that's absolutely fine but you're doing, really, really good with maintaining the rigidity of those boundaries until. Those around you are demonstrating that they're on the same path it's not your responsibility to pull them on the path. that's that's not that's not your goal and that goes for regardless of the relationship brother mother. Potential significant other. and protect where you are right now Okay, the rest of it will take care of itself. Okay questions for me concerns for me."
16106.0,Patient,Do I need to get out of this can you make me to the chat so I can make the appointment for the follow up.
498.0,Provider,"I don't think I can i'm. Ideas let them know to check you in for this appointment so that's taken care of. I can't move you wish to actually there should be a way for me to do that, but i'm not aware of that. way to do that so you'll have to like go out and then hit the link to like the checking in link in the next you want to schedule an appointment okay."
16106.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, see you in four weeks here."
16106.0,Patient,"All right, by."
498.0,Provider,"The car Henderson is. corey Anderson is a. 27 excuse me 27 year old female enter familiar. relationship breaks down breakdowns that. went to an impromptu relocation and presented to bright heart or adjustment disorder. she's continuing to do well, and our last appointment for weeks ago indicated some huge improvements with regard to Steve and anxiety, with regard to her relocation.
