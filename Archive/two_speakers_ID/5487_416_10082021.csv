5487.0,Patient,"yeah so they told me only to take once a day, but I mean I feel like his son, you know working for me."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then I got all that, and you should consult with your medical. practitioner before, yes, that don't. change it without that because you can overdose."
5487.0,Patient,"On vitamin yeah yeah i'm in an up by Mila team already. To the heaven, or like what's wrong with me and stuff and see what's going on with my stomach system it's also been hurting and I feel like it's because the. Maybe like the stomach pain and, like all the tugging and pulling that I have it's because of that humans and because of all those surgeries of an hour that i've had in the scar tissue that's build up in there, so I need to get those. Hopefully, taken down when no surgeon wants to do it, for me, because they tend to come back. But I need a little bit of relief from it, because it's just hard and it's painful. So yeah but other than that, I mean. And then, what happened, I grew up it's just been in back my head, so I just been trying to think about it. To my party brand what happened, like with my sister and. Just like I don't know I feel like that kind of pulled me like in a depressed bought a little bit."
416.0,Provider,Which part.
5487.0,Patient,about it. You know the way the. mahogany mom my mom's accident and. yeah she was so traumatized and her not you know just thinking about herself I kind of put it. So I just.
416.0,Provider,"got it, what did you think of the feedback that you got from group."
5487.0,Patient,"I love it and I love, my group that I have. Because I mean if. I can't talk to anybody else we talked to like base. And there's nobody else to talk to you, so you know. But i'm glad like a lot of people are understand me. and give me the feedback that I need so it makes me sleep better, but I mean like I said, the last four days had just been rough. yeah yeah so tomorrow's my grandson's birthday so just before I looked at the clock and i'm like oh my God times, it was like. Like 10 like 1055 enablement go where my earphones so I was Bernie going to get like everything else they make us cupcakes. So I will get you get everything ready, because he likes fortnight so i'm going to make us cupcake support night, and I was like oh my bad at tennis I mean, I have to hurry up, so I have to everything in the kitchen, so I have a lot of baking to do today so. That will give me no kidding busy."
416.0,Provider,"Fine, actually."
5487.0,Patient,yeah i'll slow.
416.0,Provider,"So what part of the feedback that you got from the group, are you are you feeling like what's the most helpful."
5487.0,Patient,"Where I felt like tanya said, my sister is like a narcissist."
416.0,Provider,yeah. And I don't know I don't know the industry is a narcissist and well I kind of feel like.
5487.0,Patient,"cheating shifts on my part yeah I think she is. Just I don't know. I really i'm not really about my sister really don't. Everybody has their own different opinions, but I mean everybody can be like you know that your sister needs to give her a chance, or you know, try to talk to her, but I can't after. Like so much trauma that she has also caused me not just herself having trauma she's also caused me trauma so. I don't know I really don't know what to do, or what to think or. You know how to how to even feel at times towards her because. She is my sister but."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
5487.0,Patient,I don't know.
416.0,Provider,yeah she is and and I get that and I think that it's funny that that's the Ad of all of the advice that you heard there the piece that you really grabbed a hold of is that she's a narcissist. Because that was like one tiny little thing and really most of the advice that people gave you in the feedback was about trying to consider her. perspective yeah.
5487.0,Patient,"Try and beyond that she might be doing the best she can, under these circumstances, to."
416.0,Provider,And that she's involved in her own grief session just might not be able to see it but.
5487.0,Patient,"I think yeah I kind of thought about after I got off the group I kind of thought about that also but then it was part of me was just like I don't care. You know. I don't know. I think I just had so much trauma in my life that it makes me just like not even care anymore of. Of what you know what goes on. Just just like. How my grandkids to take care of right yeah and it's just it's just too much Sometimes I feel like a lot of people just don't see my part of it. Of what I go through or is she how she doing or you know, like I said, the only time I I don't get invited to like birthday parties or baby showers or whatever else you get invited to funerals and I don't think that's okay. So that's why I think that's why I drew a line to me, you know where it's like I wanted to do with my family. And that's I was just saying I wish I had my mom you know she could tell me, you know. You know everything's gonna be okay or. Whatever advice, she could have given me. it's just hard. I don't know. I tell my I tell my older sister that I talked to and I text a lot. to her and. I just tell her you know why do we have to. grow up without our mom. told me it's just. She lived for 30 years of life honored. You know, which is her time ago I guess."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5487.0,Patient,But it's hurtful you know. yeah.
416.0,Provider,So we've been talking about how you're taking care of yourself. What are your how have you been managing with some of your thoughts right trying to turn those thoughts into healthy or thoughts.
5487.0,Patient,"i'm just trying to keep busy i'm just trying to keep busy, but like what the lack of sleep that i've been getting it's just like I can't even think sometimes. I can, because I feel like i'm just like I haven't caught up on the rest and I don't know what makes me. we've got from my sleep, you know it's either divorce. sleep so it's like I lose a lot of sleep so it's like you just made me give you time to think. And then i'm you know i'm trying to take care of my granddaughter and kind of take care of my son to make sure you get schoolwork done so, he could graduate in December, you know but. Other than that i'm just. Trying to live day by day Julie."
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm so um you know definitely we we had set some goals of really trying to focus on the present and be mindful when you are spinning out about the past or. You know, really worrying about a future right. yeah deep breathing. All of that and. You had said that it's difficult to do mindfulness in your House, because it's a busy house. yeah but how are you how have you been doing that how have you been practicing."
5487.0,Patient,"Whether it is asleep. Or, and how often are you doing. Not as much as I should, but at least once a week."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, can you try to do it every day."
5487.0,Patient,"Hopefully, I could try yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you know the way, have you tried me it's just my sleep."

5487.0,Patient,"I don't know in order, I need to have like a floyd I will just see before I can even think and get my body going. You know I don't know. I just bought I can't even be I can't think. Maybe i'm just going maybe i'm just falling into like a depression, I don't know. I don't want to be sad what I don't want to be depressed because once I get depressed that won't get out of the House. A lot of don't think start ready for your way."

Okay, as much as a tray can and it's like I said since i've been 12 years old, I mentally like this. You know I have these episodes words just like a cry and cry and you know cranes, not a nine no crazy i'm going to bring my parents back it's just i'm crying you know my juices flow mater just flow on this, it could be, just like like I can't even walk from what.

416.0,Provider,"I mean that grief isn't going to go away completely. But um. But the The thing that concerns me about your grief is that. Is that it's almost like it happened yesterday, I mean with kind of with normal grief things. Things do tend to sort of. At least. feel a little more distant over time. And and but you hold on to the grief like card. And I don't know I don't know why that is, why do you think that is."
