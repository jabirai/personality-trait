6419.0,Patient,"um that the about the caseworker insurance, you know I haven't heard from her so no news is good news."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good. yeah because a lot of times they should be able to let us. know. And even I sometimes I know that when someone does I LP you may be able to continue with like the groups, but sometimes they put a pause on the counseling."
6419.0,Patient,"Right that's why letting you aware, because she said it's Okay, if I still see the doctor and get my suboxone and do my group, I said that's fine. As far as the counseling goes as of now she got to meet every two weeks, and she said it probably go to once a month because it's a 12 week Program. So. i'm familiar with it and familiar with her so so far, so good."
540.0,Provider,"Good So what are you in your counselor working on, there have you guys plan to work on certain things."
6419.0,Patient,"she's got me, you know doing my meetings which have already been doing so do it too I got three meetings, a week and then I gotta write my book, you know. twice a day you know asked myself, you know why am I here in this program you know what am I doing you know what what do I get out of the group meetings."

540.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know if it maybe it's the zoom connection I feel like the past Dr cell and I, we talked about it because it was happening with us earlier, we were meeting with somebody and anyways but okay so that's good, how is the juggling the iot program and the babies."
6419.0,Patient,"This was the first week of actually going go ahead, you know dad come over and watch the kids in the morning with his schedule it's a little adjusting but it worked out fine very good. And she thought I got my stuff in the morning and. Then afternoon, you know I got the nurse come and visit the kids and then you know I got the social worker once a week get the nurse come in, once a week, so you know it's busy with between mine in the morning and kids and afternoon so it's like a full time job."
540.0,Provider,It is our first one. On top of the full time job of.
6419.0,Patient,kiddos yes yeah okay.
540.0,Provider,"But, everything is going good how how have you been with like the stress of."
6419.0,Patient,"Everything actually have been pretty good the nurse actually told me today she's like you handle it so well, she was like the way you know you talk to your kid and with everything going on, she said, you seem pretty calm. So I think, for me, you know it gives me, you know a little break it and more than a breather. You know, and then I go get my stuff done, and you know I come back and come back to them, and you know, do the mom duties it's true."
540.0,Provider,"that's true, it does kind of like force you out of the House to take that."
6419.0,Patient,yeah yes yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Especially I know like with this programming you're only able to get so so much because you are juggling with kids and running around, so the iot is definitely going to be a little bit difference like suited with groups you'll probably get a lot more education. yeah have you guys you started groups, this week, did you go each day this week for the group."
6419.0,Patient,Monday through Thursday.
540.0,Provider,what's the dynamic how many people are in your group.
6419.0,Patient,"i'm actually Monday, there was probably like four and then come by Wednesday and today there was probably a total maybe I think yesterday there was total like 13 and then today there was probably like a."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so it. Yes, Sir yeah somewhere i'm sure that some people with iot is some people are mandated with different reasons, so some people will go for the full time some people will go just. Usually with iot usually go I think it's four to five days a week in the beginning, and then by the end of it usually they taper you down."
6419.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
540.0,Provider,And so that and then you're gonna say.
6419.0,Patient,"yeah that's dependent if I need to go to Africa, where they call it. So I just have an upcoming court date it's not till November 29 you know for the for the kiddos and you know that's this is part of the agreement to complete the program and i'll be pretty much completed by then maybe one week off."
540.0,Provider,"and well, they need anything from our program or they're just going to base. Most things off of that Program."
6419.0,Patient,"At the moment, she uh she said she doesn't need anything, and you know if I do, I could just contact you guys will let you guys know."
540.0,Provider,That was.
6419.0,Patient,"He said long as you're aware of it, and there were view you know, like said, the only issue would be insurance, but I haven't heard anything oh it's okay with me, you know I rather keep it like I got it."
540.0,Provider,"I know, and a lot of times insurance they usually will stop the counseling on this end. While you're an iot. So, whether or not you're going sometimes they stop the groups too. So, what with that it usually would be that you would end up meeting with Dr cell individually until you finish the Program. Okay, so because I know someone and my other group my other Wednesday group they went into like this residential program and they stopped our treatment, except for the medical portion. Okay, about like three weeks of her being into it so don't be like to blindsided if. They just."
6419.0,Patient,"yeah because i'd rather keep like the medical portion with you guys to they've not had to start all over you know, and you know what that means you know gotta jump through hoops and do all the paperwork all over and then you know the time get away to and everything so."
540.0,Provider,"yeah we don't want that so usually they don't stop it completely, but they will stop it, to the point where. It would just be like the."
6419.0,Patient,Therapeutic so I don't lab.
