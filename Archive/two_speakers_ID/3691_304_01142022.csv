304.0,Provider,"Brittany, no don't be sorry i'm sorry if you were hanging out there for just a minute I was, I was just finishing up with somebody so it's good to see you."
3691.0,Patient,"Know it's. actually called like early because they i'm like okay we're co pay $60 and i'm like what i'm like I still have them out card, but they didn't have my new ID. That kicked in like December first and I don't have a copy of it like i've been trying since like December 2 to get one i'm going to keep telling me they're gonna mail one, and they have it, and so I called DHS but like with coven. You can't get Ahold of anyone you just go to a record he leave a message and they call you back in like two to three days if you're lucky. And they're like well, we need the ID number and i'm like Well, I can try to call Molina but DHS like I won't be able to get it for a couple days, so I called Molina and they answered right away and i'm just like this, my name, this is my birthday like I need my ID number like now. i've told you like times you keep calling to welcome me. But I still have cards and she's just like why don't know why, and she told me, you know we'll get them sent out but they've told me that three other times too so. I got them the ID number, finally, because I yeah I didn't even have it."
304.0,Provider,"Well, oh what an ordeal yeah you know a lot of people have gone through that like with the new year kind of with their insurance so um what a pain yeah and you just keep the number yeah that's into was bright hurt you call back and you gave them the number."
3691.0,Patient,"Oh, I was on the phone with me when I call them. Okay, so yeah um it was just that they have to send it through like eligibility so it's kind of like. It hadn't gone through yet, but they just sent me to you anyway, but then, when they sent me back to the girl to check me and she's like well that's not what it says here, what did they tell you and i'm like they told me to come back to you. And then they were sending intelligibility, and to check in and she's like well I can't check you with a copay and I was like oh I don't it's my fault I don't pay attention to like the names, so I was like I don't know who I was talking to like whoever you sent me to."
304.0,Provider,"yeah no, they should know Oh, what a pain Brittany i'm so sorry, you had to deal with that um well kind of I have some good news i'm. Dr Steve and I are going through, like everybody's charts now after group, and so we were like oh my gosh brittany's spin in the program for like at least over a year, probably a year and a half now um So if you want, I mean if you want to like you're not getting like. You know, reduced, but if you want to you can start coming to group just twice a month. Like you're eligible to move to twice a month. So I don't know if you notice us saying that to a few other people, and I was like oh my gosh I didn't mean to forget about Brittany, just because you know you are so so stable and you've been with the program long enough, so if that kind of helps like, with your insurance. You know and and just your time to. and hopefully that'll start kind of evening out our group a little bit when we have so many people but yeah. I don't want you to feel like you can't come every week, if you want to, but."
3691.0,Patient,Okay.
304.0,Provider,If you want to free up that time to do other things and come twice a month you're you'll get and then like you'll as long as you know your surveys and and you know you show up which you always do show up and you always do your drug screen you'll get a two week supply.
3691.0,Patient,"Of okay um the surveys, would you I still do them weekly. Or do you just do them with the meetings."
304.0,Provider,"um that is a good question, I would, I would say, you would just do them at your group meetings. Okay, let me, let me verify that um but yeah wouldn't wouldn't really make sense to do them weekly. review them we'll just review them on the days that i'm like Okay, you did your survey, you know you this is your depression score and we see you in group them are like a Britney are you Okay, so I would say, you would only do them on the days you come to group but but. that's a good question. yeah and you heard we're going to change group to Wednesday."
3691.0,Patient,Yes.
304.0,Provider,"So, like so you were in group this week so say say you don't come next week, then your your new group would be. The 25th and no, no, the 26. yeah."
3691.0,Patient,6pm right instead of seven.
304.0,Provider,"yeah so since you were just saying well, but how much Minutes do you have two weeks of minutes."
3691.0,Patient,i'm honestly I don't even know I don't even pay attention I just. pick them up at night guy just plain wrong once a week.
304.0,Provider,"Or maybe let's have you come to. This coming Tuesday. And then. we'll we'll get you switched over to the two week i'll let Dr seek know that you'll be on two weeks, and then you'll start coming on Wednesdays."
3691.0,Patient,And then yeah I.
304.0,Provider,Think i'll get you in.
3691.0,Patient,Love but i'm not at home i'm babysitting so yeah i'm like I don't even know. And i've been so sick lately like.
304.0,Provider,it's going around yeah.
3691.0,Patient,"Oh, everyone we don't like. The girl I babysit for she's an RN and. her and her oldest son were sick. So he didn't get to go back to. School after Christmas break until like. Two days ago. And he was the only kid that was sick. But he was the only one that tested negative or yeah negatives, a little younger to tested positive and they were completely fine the whole time. So I still have the youngest one he's not he goes school half day, but he can't go back until Monday, because he's a preschool are not good about like their mass and keeping distance so they make them stay out like the whole 10 days still."
304.0,Provider,"yeah and that's hard for you, because I know I have little my my kids but it's like kids are just sort of germ incubators."
3691.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
304.0,Provider,"I think I don't know where I got sick my kids aren't sick thankfully knock on wood, but i'm like did they bring it home and they're not sick, but they gave it to me, you know."
3691.0,Patient,"Right, I know a lot of people that have like. kids like under 10 in the last like month there's got to be at least like 20 of them if they're under 10 they're not sick like they're testing positive but I mean, thank God, I it's good but I mean i'd rather have it than them but. yeah even my son. They like do random testing at his school if you're around kids that do and whatnot and. he's like in wrestling so close contact sports but um he was at school, he was fine and he tested positive and ya know be like he has nothing at all."
304.0,Provider,"You know what that makes me think so I haven't been able to get a test anywhere. But there there's a testing site by us just for kids who are in school because you know they want them to get tested i'm like Maybe I should take my kids to get tested, because when if they're positive, they have no symptoms."
3691.0,Patient,"Right so it's like every kid I know that undertaken, and of course Tyler he's going to be. You 16 but. Every other kid if they're under 10 and they've tested positive like they're fine it's so weird."
304.0,Provider,"that's so crazy, which I mean you're glad that they're not saying. that's hard, because then there they could just be out spreading it and I was like I better get tested all the stores are sold out of tests. Oh it's."
3691.0,Patient,"so hard. there's like there's a place here in town that says. i'm. results within minutes, which is they'll tell you 24 to 48 hours."
304.0,Provider,Right.
3691.0,Patient,"But I know this girl she's been waiting five days and still nothing, and then the girl I babysit, for she went and got her oldest son tested when they first got sick. And they had she called on a Monday to the pharmacy and she couldn't get in till Friday to even get tested it's just like everywhere, is so backed up."
304.0,Provider,"yeah that's the next test they had was next Friday i'm like well. I am i'll be better so but that makes me think maybe I could get my kids into tested and then because i'm like i'm not really going anywhere but I was like I don't want them to go to school, if you know it's just. yeah, but I hope you feel better and yeah I hope this all gets under control because. it's bad."
3691.0,Patient,But it's crazy.
304.0,Provider,But you mentioned you at court or was that for Tyler.
3691.0,Patient,"yeah. Nothing happened, I like try to even like have the judge which the paperwork like. he's going to be 17 on the 20th of this month. And I mean his dad are starting to realize like this is going to be a very slow process and so instead of like in the paperwork saying that I, you know want custody and whatever I switched it. To visitation because I realized that custody, it would not happen in a year like it's so hard to get anything done. And I know I knew it wasn't going to be soon, but just to try to also to get them like hey i'm willing to work with you like I don't need him to live with me, I just want to see him and that's All I want like I just want to be able to see him and talk to him. And so I had the judge because he's like you know just like well that changes things like you know, would you guys be willing to do that, and my dad still like nope nope nope so. it's either so next time, at least, there will be a decision in February 7 either we're going to mediation, which I honestly don't want to I think it'll be a waste of time and then that just more another month or two to be in the same position or. They get like a gla. like an attorney for. For a. highlight bad would split the cost which i'm fine with that, like go for it, I don't care what I gotta pay at this point like do that."
304.0,Provider,But that's that's ridiculous like you guys you shouldn't have to if he would have just.
3691.0,Patient,"A great dad don't want to pay that so now like his lawyer send us some paperwork to fill out which some of it, I understand, like I don't care if you know you want to know where I live, and all this information. But at the same time, like it doesn't make sense, like if it was custody, I could see like you want to know every financial like everything. But if it's supervised visitation. If the judge wanted this information i'm all for it but it's like, why does my dad. need like no offense but, like the last person, you would give like that information to your bank account information your social security number. You would not give that to your worst enemy and no offense but that's what he is like the man hates us like Why would you, you would not give that to them so i'm trying to get Ahold of his lawyer like. If it had if it's pertaining like to Tyler but if it's some stuff like social skit like i'm not comfortable because it says, you know, like Mr Decker requested this stuff well i'm sorry but I don't think that there's any reason at all that he would need to know our social security numbers."
304.0,Provider,For your benny for me yeah.
3691.0,Patient,"Right like if he's not going to be living with us. He isn't even going to get to come visit us at our House, so I could you can have my address, but you don't need to know every little detail if he doesn't even get to come over."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no, I agree that and that's yeah that's all private yeah I would So do you have an attorney your own attorney."
3691.0,Patient,"No, I mean honestly we keep. Thinking about getting one. The only thing we'll do is make it move quicker, but the other part of us is like. Why spend the money, because the lawyers we've talked to a handful and honestly, most of them have been great and they even told us like if you guys are clean and doing good like I like the natural say like honestly I you don't even need to waste the money like. Right it's not a judge in this world it's going to keep you away from him if all you want to do is see him, especially if you're willing to do supervised visits. exactly like there's not a judge is going to keep you away so it's like we'd hate to charge you, you know, like five. iron retainer 300 an hour for something that. We could do on."
304.0,Provider,"our behalf. Right, maybe if if he's like filed a motion or a petition, maybe you just file your response, saying like please demonstrate your justification for needing this information. it's not supervised at you know, a location like, why do you need our social security, why do you need my bank account and. make him prove it, if in fact you do need that but to me it sounds like no. permission."
3691.0,Patient,"that's what I mean most of the questions I mean, like most of it, I don't have a problem with it's like. me and Fred both got one obviously like if you ever seen you know one parent abuse the child or this or that and it's like. First of all, you know the answers to these questions like I haven't been around since he was five like he's never been abused in our care. And i'm not saying that using around him isn't but physically stuff like that, like no we never been in trouble, he was never taken away like. So it's like you know all this so it's like I honestly think also my dad's doing stuff just to its I think his lawyer just from what i've heard from family. Is his lawyer must have told them like look if they're clinging they're going to at least get to see him, like the end result, they will get to see him and he's really mad about that and so he's going to try to drag it out and prolong it as long as he can."
304.0,Provider,"and make it as difficult as possible for you. yeah so right so. we're knows that I mean if there's lawyers deliberately doing that yeah I would say file something to see if you can be like well why, why do you want this information."
3691.0,Patient,"Right and that's I would tell the judge like i'll give you anything you want any information, you need. But when the paperwork specifically comes from his lawyer and says that Mr Decker has requested this, there is no reason, Mr Decker needs this information, like some of it, he can have, like you, would you like me to pick and choose. What to answer."
304.0,Provider,Like.
3691.0,Patient,yeah it's one thing i've been reading everything.
304.0,Provider,"yeah like it's one thing if the Court or like DCS s has that it's confidential they don't release that to him. But right I don't see why he would get that information and maybe if you push back Brittany on it, maybe didn't they'll back down and be like Okay, well, we thought she was just going to roll over and give it."
3691.0,Patient,"But yeah it's happening you. know and I don't mean to be like that, but it's like super like I mean when I say, like my dad like he hates me it's so it's. there's no reason at all for you to ever need this information it's like I mean i'm just like it's not like we're just being like we seriously do not trust him and not that he'd been dumb enough to do something now. But this information doesn't change, so I don't know what you're gonna do with it, you know after tyler's at. Like there's no reason you ever have it."
304.0,Provider,"like this is confidential, this is highly sensitive information that if someone used it could be yeah."
3691.0,Patient,very damaging.
304.0,Provider,reputation your credit all of it. yeah that's me and it's like in you want access.
3691.0,Patient,"To all of that, like that and there's that's what I mean there's no reason, like, I cannot think of any reason at all. That he should have any of that information like and i'm not just being stubborn like I honestly can't think of a reason why that would matter on supervised visitation. Like I could see if they want to see, for you know financially stable enough to take care of a kid if we were going after full custody. But like."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
3691.0,Patient,"You provide visitation so none of that should matter to you like if the judge has any questions, it said more than willing, but for him to have absolutely not."
304.0,Provider,"And maybe you even just Google it Brittany, I don't know like what information is needed in the state of Illinois for supervised visitation. Right biological parents like yes, I mean Okay, maybe they would need to yes know your financials how much money you're making if he was going to live with you but. I mean and and some people get supervised visitation and they're not working at all. Or, I mean like."
3691.0,Patient,"are supervised visitation that's what I mean it's like I know I have read about like I don't even have to be working I don't have to be stable, I mean, yes, clean, but I mean like. I don't have to have you know, a bedroom for him if he's not going to live with me I don't need to i'm we do, but that's not needed."
304.0,Provider,For donation through that.
3691.0,Patient,"Right right there's no reason that's the part I don't understand like what are, what is your angle like what are you guys trying to do now."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I feel like it's just kind of hassling you i'm in there just. yeah aims and if he's paying the Attorney the Attorney was like well let's do this like it's not illegal. Right, maybe they think you'll just say Oh yes, of course, here here in."
3691.0,Patient,"And i've read like every review on his lawyer and that's. Part of why I want to get a lawyer, because everyone said, like my dad's lawyer he's great at doing paperwork like he's a good lawyer for stuff like that, but like to actually be in a courtroom or going against another lawyer like. he's awful and that's what people said, like you get what you pay for he's like the cheapest one in that county. And so, when he's up against another lawyer and I read hundreds of reviews. Is that he basically okay to whatever the other lawyer said, like kill just be like you know okay okay like he doesn't fight back so that's why I kind of want to go lawyer."
304.0,Provider,hmm.
3691.0,Patient,So i'm just be like. I just wanted to move like I. just want to get somewhere.
304.0,Provider,because that seems like part of your dad's and his lawyers tactics it's just to keep delaying it.
3691.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
304.0,Provider,"Well, no. Like yeah just like a legal aid, or like a program that could help you know, like a low cost attorney."
3691.0,Patient,yeah no yeah i've looked there.
304.0,Provider,it's hard to find a no.
3691.0,Patient,Oh yes. But if I mean it's worth it be so worth it.
304.0,Provider,yeah.
3691.0,Patient,"And that's the other part, I mean now it's like well I don't know how much if we have to go the route to get Tyler the Attorney I don't know what those costs like and i've looked it up and it's a huge range. So it's like I don't know like if I should prepare for that expense, so I don't want to you know get us a lawyer and then have to come out of pocket a few grand for that, like I like so I don't know part of me is just like I just. cuz even the judges like you know I know he's representing Mr Decker but you know, maybe, if you have questions you could call Mr right like his lawyer. and obviously I could ask him questions, but like not like i'm gonna say."
304.0,Provider,Anything right and then not privileged like whatever you tell him you're not his client.
3691.0,Patient,So he will be back on that.
304.0,Provider,So.
3691.0,Patient,But yeah definitely like. Why this paperwork like.
304.0,Provider,"yeah maybe you could ask the Attorney that why, why do you need my social."
3691.0,Patient,Why do you need my Thank you.
304.0,Provider,For supervised visits why see what he says put him on the spot.
3691.0,Patient,"Oh i'm going to i've already called and left a message like oh yeah i'm gonna ask him, like I don't have a problem with most of these questions, but some of these like. it's not even your paperwork doesn't even say you want it says my dad ones that like i'm not i'm going to tell like Absolutely not. Would you give someone that hated you your that information no nobody would nobody would. Like. I mean you are taught that from like when you're tiny that's information."
304.0,Provider,"You don't people. right if he was sorry. I know i'm like my mom probably has my social security somewhere. Probably. When I was a baby, but you know."
3691.0,Patient,"It when it comes to my information, my dad honestly probably has it but it's not it's mostly me defending Fred like he I mean he despises him for no reason."
304.0,Provider,And no dad that's info.
3691.0,Patient,"And so it's like I definitely. it's like if you don't have mine around still I don't want you having them, but to like there's absolutely no reason in the world for you to need fred's information and that's mostly my thing it's not mine, because he probably already has mine somewhere. that you do not need Fred that because he's not me when it comes down to it, he can like make himself. Look, as Nice as he wants, but I mean it's not just me anyone that knows him knows how he is and that he's not a nice person like. Everyone knows that, like he's really good at like lying and making himself Look how he supposed to look in whatever situation he's in, but when it comes down to it, he's not a nice man he's not forgiving and he's done some shady stuff just. Because he's not Nice and he gets mad. So yeah I just I don't. I don't trust it yeah I don't."
304.0,Provider,"Well, good for you you're just advocating for yourself ask those questions like make you know put them on the spot and you're not just going to give this information up."
3691.0,Patient,"So yeah before I had been like Oh, you know, whatever you want like. Get you know a few years ago I did just been okay well I wouldn't even been going through this because. It would have been pointless but i'm. Right yeah now i'm just like no and because I, my dad and I just don't want to deal with, like the headaches the heartache and now i'm just like. I just keep like tyler's grandpa's Tyler scramble like I don't even say my dad is just like Mr Decker or tyler's grandpa like i'm not even going to think i'm like that I don't want to get upset like i'm not trying to be mean but i'm just. i'm. yeah i'm here trying like I I can't. So."
304.0,Provider,"protect yourself emotionally still because he did this, he did this to you and let's just not okay."
3691.0,Patient,"So yeah i'm. that's right it's all like my boyfriend like when I get stupid again in a couple months in decide, you only try again. Like please just kill me like do not let. me do it because it's. I don't know why, and then I like X surprise like oh I can't believe he's that mean, or like is that bad. And it just like I know, but yet like I set myself up again, knowing what's gonna happen, just like I have to quit doing that because it's going to drive me like insane."
304.0,Provider,"And it's that it's that parental moved, you know, like it's a deep wound, and I think there's still that. Part of you, that is like, but this is this my dad like could things."
3691.0,Patient,"be better, but you know."
304.0,Provider,"That longing for that, and then the rational part of you knows that this is not a healthy relationship everything."
3691.0,Patient,"know and it will never happen, I mean. The major part of you know it will never happen, but there's a small part of me that wants it to happen so bad that. I keep putting myself out there, but it's like every time I do it i'm the one that goes through hell. And it's like I like I seriously can't anymore. Like since this court stuff started i've lost like 15 pounds, which I cannot afford to lose like and then i'm up crying you know, for it out of the week to like three in the morning, like i'm. And then I just get mad at myself because i'm upset like Why am I even upset like I know this i've known this for years, and just like is there ever come a point where it won't bother me because I really wish I could get to that point."
304.0,Provider,"In. it's maybe that it's not going to go away, but it'll be. Different like grief, you know right it's like a living grief, you know the person is still there. But everything everything that he's done is just and he's never apologized right or never."
3691.0,Patient,Oh no.
304.0,Provider,never tried to admit any so you can't yeah like that's. Everything everything you will never.
3691.0,Patient,"admit it when he's wrong, he will not ever apologize to anyone for anything and that's like. My mom said the other day, and like. I know she don't like him, obviously, and she loved him but. He will do nothing but bad mouth my mom and has like my whole life, she will not say anything bad about him to me. Even though I know what she thinks she will not say it to. me and she the other day finally she's just like he thinks he's God and like he really does like that exactly like. i've just never met anyone, that is. honestly that shitty of a person, but thinks that highly of themselves. Like it's I don't know I don't I mean I wish I had half that confidence but. yeah I don't get it. And it's that's so the parts it's so irritating is that even the people around him like his family, his sisters, because I talked to a sisters. it's like nobody really likes him everyone just afraid of him. So it's like, no one will stand up to him, no say anything it's like everyone kisses but because everyone's so afraid to upset him and I was like what are you scared of like, why are you afraid to upset him like. that's the part that drives me crazy and has literally since I was little like i've never understood why people like you let him talk to you and treat you like this and you like worship the ground he walks on like, why do you do that. So it's like you guys are just feeding into this mentality of his like he thinks he's so great like I don't understand."
304.0,Provider,yeah. And how are things with your mom.
3691.0,Patient,How.
304.0,Provider,Can you in her mean.
3691.0,Patient,"Better okay. yeah she just i'm i'm getting better with her, I keep her didn't. um she's not a good mom. she's you know nice to have somebody to talk to is like a friend. mm hmm and i'm getting better at like accepting that. And, just like I know now like this is all she can offer take it or leave it like quit expecting or because you're not getting more like. If you have a relationship with her, this is all. can be take it or leave it."
304.0,Provider,"And that's healthy Britney like that is so, like insightful and so healthy for you to be like you know you have that kind of longing for that, like mother relationship, but like she's just not capable of it may be. In sobriety be like well it's not healthy for me to like keep pursuing that is. not going to happen so just be like Okay, this is how it is and that's Okay, we can just kind of have a friend relationship chat every now and then yeah cuz so those expectations and."
3691.0,Patient,"right but it's like, finally being able to accept that and it's like okay well, if I can accept that with her like Why can I get to that point. With my dad but it's like her there's still no communication that's the part I don't understand with him is like you want absolutely nothing to do with me like I don't comprehend that. But also like. When even when I did talk to him way before I even went up to Chicago like. He just made me miserable and feel like crap so even when robust communication it wasn't good, and I know that to like it's never been good every when I was little like it's never been good, so I know it never would be it's just that, why do I feel guilty like that's the part that. Right like I feel guilty over everything."
304.0,Provider,"And no, you did not I."
3691.0,Patient,"wish I could have like. accepted what it was years ago and said it taken me this long, but my boyfriend's mom. Is no me since I was like 16 and I moved in with her when I was like 16 or 17 and so she is like a mom and her boyfriend he's been around for like 20 something years. And he knows how my parents are so every time you know he's like how's my daughter. Like he's just like i'm your dad i'll be your dad and he's like just a sweet old farmer and just like. Seriously, like sent from God, like the nicest man, you could ever meet so luckily I have them and that helps a ton."
304.0,Provider,"And and yeah you've cultivated those relationships, on your own in that sometimes too yeah like family we don't have to have this narrow definition of family anymore like sometimes it is the family, you create for yourself."
3691.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
304.0,Provider,"And yeah you found that so you find your people, and just love them hard you know. And yes, when you're you are like yeah a year into recovery like it's it's good you can do this yeah and let go of that guilt, because you, you have not done anything wrong Absolutely not. you've been through so much and you're stronger through it all. But no, you did nothing wrong."
3691.0,Patient,"yeah and it's just it's like I do feel bad because then the other part of me wants like obviously Tyler like hates my dad like he does he hates him. And I don't get me wrong, I completely understand that, but i'm also like you know well you know, maybe when you move out like you guys can have you know, like a regular grandpa like I want him to be able to get along with him if that's possible. Like i'm not gonna say anything bad about my dad to like I learned that like from being a teenager. Like I don't need adults in my ear. Like forming my opinion, if someone like he can figure that out for himself, so I don't say anything bad so it's kind of hard like when Tyler because you know I want to go off with him like yes, I know he's a piece of crap. But it's just like a yo I just gotta suck it up and. The middleman and try to like see it from both points of view but."
304.0,Provider,you're doing what's best for Tyler yeah.
3691.0,Patient,Right and it's just like he's gonna end up resenting him and I I feel bad for that. Like for my dad like this kid is going to end up hating you and I feel bad for you and why because I shouldn't.
304.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah and I think you realize like that is the right thing to do to not say anything bad about him to Tyler because then it just damages your relationship with Tyler. Like It makes you look bad. yeah that's hard, though, to just but get it out you're getting it out here it's it's cathartic."
3691.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean he I say that to Fred all the times like we were total monsters at his age and he is such a good kid like I have no idea how he's our kid. And like he's even and it makes me mad because it's like even tyler's uncle makes it sound like you know he's worried about what would happen if he's with us you're giving them opportunities to smoke weed and drink which. Like I do not want him anything like me, so no, even though I do have guilt, there is no way he would get to do whatever he wants like absolutely not like. My number one priority is making sure he's nothing like me and I don't care if that's gonna make me mean I don't care if he hates me for a while, like i'll be the bad guy. But you're letting him do this this, and this, and he he doesn't do it, even with like getting all the other cousins will be wasted and there's Tyler the only one not drinking and i'm ecstatic but at the same time. Like How is this mikey mikey move."
304.0,Provider,How Where do they get the alcohol.
3691.0,Patient,"Oh, he bought it."
304.0,Provider,he's uncle dad.
3691.0,Patient,Or the uncle yeah.
304.0,Provider,Your breath that's your brother.
3691.0,Patient,"No it's um my boyfriend's brother Tyler but yeah so it's like you guys are so worried about us seeing him. yeah but yet your daughter is getting so wasted and puking and everything else and she's like tyler's age, both under age, but you're giving them permission to drink and do all this other stuff like So what are you so worried about a seeing him. Right like. Especially like Tyler you know he's not 10 like he's 16 he obviously made the choice. Even though you're with him. And you're giving him permission. to drink all he wants to get drunk and he still chooses not to like what you think i'm going to force him to do something he'd like. yeah it's like he's not a little kid like if I was doing something wrong. he's not with rate like he'd be able to tell you."
304.0,Provider,"Know yeah. So, like it's all control."
3691.0,Patient,that's what I try explaining.
304.0,Provider,"Like what's best for Tyler will know you're a bad influence because of your history which I mean your history wasn't with alcohol anyway or marijuana, but it seems that control."
3691.0,Patient,"Like you, oh definitely. I mean like it's not even about Tyler it's about their hate for us."
304.0,Provider,"and using Tyler. yeah on. He seems like a great kid and he's making good choices, even though God shy he's influence human you're worried about kids being influenced by like bad kids are getting in the wrong crowd but like, here it is like his uncle and his cousins and his. mom like."
3691.0,Patient,"Especially because, like my dad would never let them do stuff like that, but also with my dad like tyler's in the same position, I was in like he's running away so the COPs and DC fs are getting called. And now, with me, I was in trouble. Like so when I finally like break out of his prison I be running wild getting into trouble like tyler's running away but he's just going to sit at his friend's house he's not out running the streets like. he's not getting in trouble like he is really a good kid he's just so miserable in that house and he gets to a point where like he. doesn't know what else to do so, he runs and I don't blame it like just because it's bad there and it's basically like if I didn't leave. Like he was gonna hit me and Tyler even said in my dad is good at this it's like he'll get and Tyler space in like literally push it like physically and yell at like trying to get him to hit him and I told. Her like. You cannot like he will put you in jail like he will. call the COPs. Because I will get in his face and you'll be pushing him screaming at him telling them like come on hit me hit me and i'm like. You cannot do it like."
304.0,Provider,As as Tyler like told anyone this like a counselor at school.
3691.0,Patient,"Probably not he's so afraid because when I would did that, when I was in school. I would within they call my dad and tell him, and then I just be more trouble. So it's like he's so afraid of my dad finding out anything, because then it's just going to make his life worse. it's only he's afraid to do anything. That would make his life Parker."
304.0,Provider,But there is the CSS case open.
3691.0,Patient,"I think they dropped it she came by once and basically told Tyler you know, like well he's not physically abusing you so you know you're going to have to suck it up and deal with it till you're 18."
304.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
3691.0,Patient,"So it's like horrible yeah that's what makes me mad like D CFS in some ways is great, but it's like you see that all the time, like the people that need help don't get help. and"
304.0,Provider,Use like goading him. And pencil and pushing like that's emotional abuse that's. All kinds of like us.
3691.0,Patient,Like yeah oh in the mental is awful awful but since it's not really like.
304.0,Provider,physical or you know.
3691.0,Patient,"We don't have bruises and marks they won't do anything and that's still part of like this tiny town crap were like everyone knows everyone, and you just push everything under the rug like you know the COPs don't give you a dui they take you home type thing. Like yeah oh it's still like you know something out of a movie like cannot be real like oh I hate it so much. But. one more year."
304.0,Provider,there'll be 18 and he.
3691.0,Patient,"and hopefully this will get moving and we'll see him before that, but. yeah worst case scenario. Another year and that's what he said he's like a day on my birthday you better come pick me up i'm gonna have my stuff."
304.0,Provider,or. Did he play football this this past fall. yeah good. And that's like. His his outlet right just.
3691.0,Patient,"yeah well, he told me that he doesn't even really like football anymore, it just that he can get out of the House, so he does it. But he didn't wrestling now, and he loves. And it makes sense, like he can like release anger and up."
304.0,Provider,"In a state of physical way, but a safe way right."
3691.0,Patient,"So, because I mean when he was. Like a few years ago, he was getting in trouble like he punched out a bus window he hit some kid in the face like he was like he was angry, but now you know he's got this. Little girlfriend who's a sweetheart her and her mom and he's just like mom she made me nice like. Just like she's soften him up a little bit like because even like you wouldn't like hug his grandma because you don't get like hugs at my dad's are like I love you so he. never gets that so he wasn't used to it, so now that he has the girlfriend that you know, is a hugger and so's her mom and so that helped him."
304.0,Provider,I was able to spend time at her house right and the mom is. Early yeah.
3691.0,Patient,"They are amazing amazing and he even told me I don't know like he's like I don't know where i'd be without him and. Her mom is told me like if it was anyone else, like, I would make my daughter break up with him, just because of how my dad is like it's like kill even text the mom like that she's a horrible mother and like he's crazy."
304.0,Provider,"So I didn't see let Tyler go over there, though."
3691.0,Patient,"Someone yeah he. I don't know about now because, like wrestling but he was getting to go there, usually like every weekend, or at least every other but that also goes with his mood."
304.0,Provider,"And friends will he let Tyler do stuff with with. No, but go up but it's okay that he could drink with the customs."
3691.0,Patient,"Oh, my dad don't know that."
304.0,Provider,Are you guys know about that.
3691.0,Patient,"Oh no. that's what I mean so it's kind of like Oh, if I said that then. But then Tyler wouldn't be going over there, and he already gets to do nothing and i'm honestly. And it's all but I think it was like a one or two times thing over the summer, when they were camping it, you said, like you know my history and fred's history like, why are you going to introduce him to anything. Anything young of an age and even if we didn't have in history. Why would you, but especially. Since you know how me and his dad were why, why would you even do that, like that pisses me off so bad. Because I know he's could oppressed and in pain, so the last thing you need to give him is something that will know him."
304.0,Provider,Does your dad have any history of of drug or alcohol abuse. Both both yeah see so.
3691.0,Patient,"I don't know if he does, drugs and I don't even know if he drinks, to be honest, like I don't know anything about him anymore um. But honestly when I was younger like you kinda use the type of guy like you didn't want him to be drunk but you didn't want him to be sober like somewhere like in the middle, like a. But otherwise he's just awful. But yeah there's like some little. You want to do, but not sober and not to my stop."

I didn't know just like we have literally been sick for like two weeks, so I wasn't even checking the mail and I just saw it, and I was gonna grab it but, since he was home there isn't really a way I can do it, not in front of him so."
