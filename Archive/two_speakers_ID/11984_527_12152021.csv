11984.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because I wonder if that might be a starting place for you to to get a better understanding of why she's making those statements. And maybe a better way for you guys to communicate. together."
11984.0,Patient,yeah I had a hard time communicating how I feel.
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I know you mentioned that last time so. What do you think about like writing out some things that you would like to ask her, and then we can kind of put it together review it or or you know help help you formulate it together."

11984.0,Patient,yeah yes.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so how many days are you working up until then do you work."
11984.0,Patient,"On let me put my mama. Oh i'm working today, tomorrow Sunday and Monday."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so you still got a few more days so what's what's the game plan because i'm sure you're gonna have a chance to talk with your employer, but. What what kind of game plan, do you want to come up with to help me an edge work over the next few days."
11984.0,Patient,"I don't know I think I would like to be leave the House and there's something else that came up late. She I feel like she makes me so stupid and I think. I don't know how to say it like. Okay, I don't see a problem with going out in the rain and she made a huge deal about it. Okay, and she got really upset about it and i'm like it's not going to kill her to get back for a second to get in the car."
527.0,Provider,But.
11984.0,Patient,"She made me feel really stupid about it and so we've been sitting in the House which sucks because she's freaking home all day. i'm stuck in the House with her all day. Okay, which is you know I feel like i'm being watched. she's just not a good feeling. yeah oh is."
527.0,Provider,Is there a reason why she doesn't want you taking her out in the rain.
11984.0,Patient,I have no she's going to get wet so yeah she's gonna get wet for a second till we get her into the club it's not a big deal.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11984.0,Patient,"She says it's like well, if you want to go out and get her wet to get in the car and drive when everyone's driving crazy yeah you can take her and i'm like. Well Okay, then. let's just like she makes me feel stupid and I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I know you mentioned, she is drinking. yeah is she."
11984.0,Patient,doesn't drink during the day she's happier when she drinks. Okay he's pleasant when she drinks. But she's my hobby.
527.0,Provider,"Well, because that's why I was wondering is, if you know if she gets a little more angry or on edge if she's been drinking and if that's what you're getting."
11984.0,Patient,"No she's. it's weird because I if I make her mad during the day she'll come home angry after she's been drinking and that hasn't happened in a while. But it's, just like the snarky comments. But after she's been drinking she's normally. happier she's just gets really repetitive she'll say something forget she told you and say it again."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So what's her daughter want to do, like, I mean that's what you're there for Tina is to kind of cater to her and do. It I mean she's 19 to like she's got some say a little bit I would."
11984.0,Patient,"Think. doesn't she can't speak like. Oh she's. Okay she's she's nonverbal she's about three years old mentally. Okay, well, I think the Community we do these things. Should I help her Dave and I feeder and do all these things but. You know she can't fit actually tell me what she wants to do. Okay."
527.0,Provider,Does she does she like going out.
11984.0,Patient,"Yes, she loves it."
527.0,Provider,I bet like just to be a little more normal and socialize.
11984.0,Patient,About she liked right.
527.0,Provider,"yeah, what do you think what do you think her mom's worried about. She would you rather rather you just stay at home, all day with her."
11984.0,Patient,"I would hope not, I mean she knows that she enjoys it and. She like I used to not be comfortable taking her up because it took me a long time. To get comfortable driving with her on the car after had a couple of accidents."
527.0,Provider,sure.
11984.0,Patient,"And I was when I started writing in um and so she's like oh i'm glad you're here, you know. It made me think that she was glad that she was going out again. Sure, but it's just the rain thing and i'm like okay. Today, we can go out. yeah but. I don't know."
527.0,Provider,yeah is have you and natalie had a conversation Tina.
11984.0,Patient,"Not about this, we normally don't work on the same days."
527.0,Provider,"Do you think it might help to have a conversation with her just to kind of check in and say hey I just want to check in with you and see how things are going and. You know how, how are you managing things with you know with the with your boss or with you know with your."
11984.0,Patient,they're really good fence. But I do enjoy work with natalie and she's really good. To talk to him.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11984.0,Patient,So.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I wonder, I wonder if she gets some of the snarky comments, too, though."
11984.0,Patient,I don't know.
527.0,Provider,I can't I can't imagine that she wouldn't if you're getting them to I guess but.
11984.0,Patient,"let's see I think i've ruminate on them. I don't know if i'm getting them as much as i'm thinking orphan just thinking about them so much. Okay, good I mean."
527.0,Provider,yeah so what's something obviously you've got a few days of work still what's something you want to try to work on. To kind of counter those are challenged those over the and not just keep ruminating on him like Is there something we can do to kind of monitor let him just kind of pass through. Like obviously.
11984.0,Patient,"Just thought yeah I know what you mean I don't know how to not let them. get to me, I mean I don't. I think my anxieties hit a point where it's just become unmanageable because I don't remember it bothering us much. Okay. And lately is becomes. Almost debilitating because I just constantly think about it. Like i'm having a hard time getting through a shift and that never used to be a problem for me."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Does it help it all to be able to leave the House. Like when he. says it. Does it help.
11984.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's it. Yes. But we only fail for like two hours because it's crowded to. But yeah it does help.
527.0,Provider,"yeah because I because I wondered if maybe kind of scheduling some time over the next few chefs like each each shift having some times, where you go out or you're not you know. And I don't know how nice the weather is Tina like if it's if you guys can go to the park or anything like if it's that that Nice to spend maybe a little bit more time."
11984.0,Patient,it's clear but it's cold again it's fine. yeah it's we under any takers target because it's familiar for me.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. And who didn't love it. And who doesn't love target.
11984.0,Patient,We call it rj.
527.0,Provider,"rj yes yeah mm hmm. yeah. But i'm also wondering too if it might be helpful, like you said just to remind yourself like Okay, this is, this is an anxiety intrusive thought i'm going to let this pass for now i'm i'm working. You know, going to take some deep breath i'm gonna you know I know that this is not like you said, with the rain, like the rain is not going to hurt her it's not going to hurt anybody like it's Okay, like you, you have a rational thought for that that statement."
11984.0,Patient,I feel like I do within what do I do with it it's like a woman just strangle or sometimes just and I know that's not rational.
527.0,Provider,How long have you worked for her now.
11984.0,Patient,Almost three years.
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say.
11984.0,Patient,"You know, we used to have a really good relationship, but. And so I got well before I went in and treatment, I got I got sick. yeah I was hospitalized and stabilized before the treatment, but I feel like something happened when I went to treatment and I don't really in my brain, because then I got out of treatment, I could not remember how to do my job, like I didn't remember what I used to do with Madeline. I didn't remember what my job duties were and I had worked with her for a year and a half, I was only in treatment for six months, but I couldn't remember what I was supposed to do, I didn't remember her bedtime routine I didn't remember how to get to her house."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11984.0,Patient,"I mean I didn't remember any of this um and it took me a good six months to eight months to like remember to. Remember, to have to learn how to have a full conversation. With people. And it was like I don't know something just smoke in my brain or what but. it's been a process. So now mandated things. It is coming back to is like there's not that shut off in my brain. The more I can think the more I can ruminate."
527.0,Provider,Okay well because you're coping mechanism before is not there anymore.
11984.0,Patient,yeah probably.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah which you know as you described that Tina just made me think about like how sick you really were yeah. and trying to recover from all of that.
11984.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah I wonder if, maybe sitting down with her and just talking through you know what this has been like for her to i'm you know i'm sure that was probably she probably had some concern and scary feelings about how you were doing and. You know."
11984.0,Patient,"She did and she's the one that encouraged me to go to the hospital like we have. We had a couple of conversations about it, which. I did not like I don't remember a good portion of what happened, like she's. Sure, told me about what happened before. But I don't remember going. I remember. vaguely taking an uber to the hospital because I knew I couldn't i'd gotten into a car accident mom. mm hmm which. You know, prior to which I shouldn't have been driving not to buy chicken again, but I was just I couldn't I couldn't function anymore. Sure, but. I didn't remember that I had had a social worker call her because I couldn't remember my symptoms. But apparently they had a long conversation about it, I didn't remember talking to her in the hospital. But I didn't remember like the first time, my first month of treatment either. Okay, but there was a huge snap there and I don't know what happened."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11984.0,Patient,"So, like he's had conversations about it and i'm grateful to her. I just have these feelings now have. Another question I guess. And I don't know what to do about it and I don't know how to deal with it, because all the coping mechanisms, I had. All gone."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11984.0,Patient,"And I don't drink I don't have the medication, I used to use to calm down. And i'm afraid of taking my other one. hello, my home."
527.0,Provider,hmm. What are some things that you learned in treatment for your anxiety. Like did you guys practice like breathing skills or any sort of like relaxation like like progressive muscle relaxation skills or.
11984.0,Patient,"You know, we did progressive relaxation, but, in all honesty, I was on to PR ends and treatment."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11984.0,Patient,I mean it to be brutally honest I was on if I was on. Content up to four times a day and how long three times a day.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11984.0,Patient,"I was medicated every time I felt the anxiety attack coming on I was a lot of pain medication which. I mean. I had so much anxiety going in and. Being there, I was a wreck so. You know. it's yeah I learned some things but I couldn't tell you, because I there's so much that I don't remember."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11984.0,Patient,um I remember progressive relaxation that didn't really work for me journaling was helpful um I had this therapist you know she's back 2017.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11984.0,Patient,"And we did things like they were called like stop worksheet. Okay, and those us to work because it was like I remember something about like we went through that it was db T."
527.0,Provider,yeah okay.
11984.0,Patient,Do you know what i'm talking about.
527.0,Provider,Is it is it halt maybe.
11984.0,Patient,"Maybe the same thing, I thought it was stop as to pee pee."
527.0,Provider,You.
11984.0,Patient,"It could be the same type type of thing, though. i'm like things like that worked. Okay things right fill up papers like writing it out worked for me."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11984.0,Patient,"Okay repetition those things work. Progressive relaxation never really worked me. Because I was too tense to let go. Okay, so that was difficult walking it off no work for me, because it just pissed me off, and I wanted to run."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so. here's your stop is it. So stop obviously then T is take your breath. And they oh is observe so describe your feelings images thoughts body sensations triggers. Right and then P for pullback are putting in perspective what's the bigger picture. And then the other P for practice what works what's, the best thing to do right now for you."
11984.0,Patient,For that right. And so I fill it out.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, do you have me send this worksheet to you."
11984.0,Patient,That would be fabulous Thank you.
527.0,Provider,Okay i'll send that to you i'll email that.
11984.0,Patient,"Things like that and. I don't know well that comes to mind that I go she we practice a lot of that so things like that works, and I wish we had done more, diversity and prevent. Okay, like the worksheet type of things, because those things in I got real i've been really hard time with free journaling but filling it out of filling out."
527.0,Provider,Things like having having more of a direction I need that.
11984.0,Patient,Okay yeah I need to answer something.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, all right i'm going to send that to you so that you can use that while you're gone to."
11984.0,Patient,Thank you.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think that'll be a good resource for you to use while you're with your family too. yeah being able to have some if I find something else that might be helpful i'll email it to you as well. Great couple things that that we can start implementing you know to challenge, some of those intrusive thoughts and just improve your feeling, you know more adequate about yourself."
11984.0,Patient,to thank you.
527.0,Provider,"yeah, but I want you to think about to like putting together some things. You know that you would like to talk with with your employer about like how, how do you want to initiate what kind of conversation, do you have what what kind of topics, do you want to talk about, and you know just write some ideas down, and then we can put it all together. And figure out how to how you want to say it, or how you want to have that conversation with her, so that you can feel. more confident with with yourself obviously there's been you know, things have kind of turned upside down and you know you're back at work, you, you were not well now you're. You know better, but you're still struggling and so, how can we, how can we continue to build on progress for you to."
11984.0,Patient,"hey I mean she's a good person and she's got her she's issues, but he did like she's. A solid person I just don't like. and adequate for her. Sure definitely I think my part in this is women at night and. yeah you know what I mean."
527.0,Provider,Yes. yeah so we're going to try it so we're going to work with that stop worksheet and try to get that. A little bit more managed so let's look at scheduling something so we probably need to say something when you get back right.
