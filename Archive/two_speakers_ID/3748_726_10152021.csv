3748.0,Patient,"yeah I tell you what that code, but it's it's amazing you would never think to like some kind of the virus, or you know sickness like that would like mess with Mike you have anxiety or mess with your anxiety already have it, it really does. That was. That was the unreal part there was probably. A more probably six to eight different times that I just like was on the verge of having a panic attack and could feel it coming on, and it was just yeah it was crazy."
726.0,Provider,"What what What about being sick what coumadin is increasingly anxiety, do you think like what what what goes through your mind."
3748.0,Patient,"i'm not sure I think it's the I think it was. That made mine worse, I think, was me worried about because I had we had people around us that. That you know me and my fiance both knew for a long time that was had passed away from it."
726.0,Provider,Oh okay i'm sorry.
3748.0,Patient,"Growing health stuff you know what I mean I have high blood pressure type two diabetes, I have COPD so it's like you know with having all that and and having that that's I was you know I kept thinking oh gosh I probably go yeah i'll be like your major. yeah it was days I didn't thought I was going to make it through it, but. We didn't. Order this is."
726.0,Provider,"You know. We know Kenny, even if you aren't so you know I will see if it's possible if you could, if they let you stay home, but if you can they will let you stay home. With work and whatnot. You know I don't know we're doing now, but definitely try to take it easy when you're home and not do lunch, so you can like let your body. Because your body's just fighting off whatever's going on inside of it and that's why you feel so tired and sick to source of times, just like resting and being able to do that, but."
3748.0,Patient,Right.
726.0,Provider,yeah and you said you got the vaccine to write. A robbery.
3748.0,Patient,That.
726.0,Provider,I did or no okay.
3748.0,Patient,"I was going to and. yeah me i'm going to just talk i'm going to get. And then, it was like we went to my grandson's we're checking in it, what couple days later me my grandson and my daughter, all three of us had."
726.0,Provider,Oh.
3748.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"How often are you feeling the anxiety or that feeling like you can have a panic attack isn't quite often, or is it what's in."
3748.0,Patient,"Here it's been it used to be, once in a while. You know what I mean, but since ever since the cave it has been it's been daily it's unreal how bad that it messes with something like that."
726.0,Provider,And it's just Although all the fear that you're that you're feeling because of what happened to that friend combo sounds like. That they would have to wait.
3748.0,Patient,"that's what I was thinking is that because of you know people around me that was passed away with it and then like in being stuck on because when I was in quarantine I didn't go nowhere I didn't know where didn't go real nobody. You know, I think. People should do, because a lot of people I don't know a lot of people get it, they seem to still go out and do whatever that's how you know, everybody else's getting it. I don't know if maybe it makes it that and having to sit at home, and you know, made it worse. than my daughter experienced the same thing, she had like her anxiety was through the roof or she's usually okay. Yes, it's a weird weird virus for sure."
726.0,Provider,"One thing I know this sounds on this is like more of a therapeutic thing, but you know it might be helpful to just for yourself, not for anybody else just. write down some of the things of the fears that you're having because sometimes you're writing it down, even though it sounds silly because you're just writing something. Your body feels like it's physically doing something with it, rather than it's just. it's different when you just think about something and it just goes in the circle in your mind, but when you write something your body feels like it's purging it out in a way, because you're writing it I, and I know it sounds silly but it's it's."
3748.0,Patient,It sounds like because that's that's one of the things I like to do too I like to write so yeah I can see that as being helpful in that aspect of it.
726.0,Provider,"Well, are other people scared to around you or is it just you because I wonder if, maybe you're feeling to like other people's fears about it."
3748.0,Patient,"they're not really not know by rail mm hmm like that, because you know, like what me and my fiance which, when I first got paid. First, found out that my daughter my grandson all had it, you know I didn't sleep listening battles him I kind of tried to stay away from me constantly clean stuff every time I use the bathroom or everything and he ended."
726.0,Provider,up.
3748.0,Patient,"He never got it yeah. They you know he never he never got it he ended up with a head cold here for a couple days, and you know, then it was gone, but he's not wanting to usually get sick he's pretty good at hands, he must have a good immune system that. So it's just I don't know it's just basically you know my fears of looking on Facebook and see how the numbers, or how many people signed."
726.0,Provider,"up. You know I know it sounds bad probably um I think sometimes like. I it's going to be informed and sometimes when I start getting anxious about the news I have to just stop watching it because I can't like. I can't function normally if i'm worried all the time, like just be hyper vigilant, of what you're reading and you're seeing because that could. Sometimes we look at something and we don't think it made an impression in our brain and then the next two days you have a dream about it and you're like oh so my brain really did take in that information. So."
3748.0,Patient,"i'm bad about that too, if you know watch something on the news, or if i'm reading, you know, an article or something i'm bad about someone who then people that will go no dream about it too."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah so sometimes we don't realize that when we watch what we see.
3748.0,Patient,"And i'm an HR person anyway i'm i've always you know i've dealt with anxiety, since I was like 14 years old. stereo i've been on this role, since I was 14 years old, because of it, but that's a separate like kind of came on in high school, you know as an adolescent. it's got a little bit better because I am able to manage it better, you know what I mean. I can sometimes kind of feel like. Like you know, maybe it's coming on and i'm going to have a panic attack. Because all man or one year, if I have one. yeah and it's you know i've got better to consciously good breathing techniques, you know. If I get in my face I do better with it and have somebody you know somebody around me always have somebody talk to me about different stuff just get my mind off of it yeah."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
3748.0,Patient,So my fiance he's pretty good at that he can he's pretty good at like get me through any.

726.0,Provider,"and work, so I think. yeah I would I start Pacific time six but it's really for me nine o'clock so it's really not that at all."
3748.0,Patient,"way that Dr Julie came done a good job in that, reading the other day. liked her, I thought it's always like coming away from a meeting and having a having a good meeting you know what I mean."
726.0,Provider,"She wasn't really, really informative. It was a great group I love that I like it, you know I only get to I work with the people that I work with, so I don't get to meet everybody that does groups like I don't meet all the counselors I don't meet all of the doctor. So when you get to like meet them when they come and fill in it's kind of cool because I like to see them and meet them, and even if it's like within a group it's nice yeah. Andy I have in two weeks it's a Friday, and if. You it's on October 29 right before Halloween."

3748.0,Patient,"A lot that I can think of, I you know I just got a I think it was like you know, like I said from being like having what what's going on around me going on and just just what's going on in general, just this whole pandemic thing."
726.0,Provider,"You know I know this sounds really silly but different Coleman when everything was shut down one of the things that really helped out is, we would just like put us and God and hang out and we wouldn't even watch the news we were just hanging out, I think I bought like a karaoke microphone. And it was just fun, it was with like I was with the kids so it was just like a fun time to get your mind off of. Things so you know you don't when you feel good, I think it helps your health to even physically so whenever you can do whatever brings you joy trying to tap into that and try to lean into that a little bit more. All right, well, can he thinks all i'll See you in our next group."
