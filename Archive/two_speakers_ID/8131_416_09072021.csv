416.0,Provider,"Okay, so."

Okay, so I ended up kind of just so much silence, so I just kind of did my personality kind of definitely like is it calls that are just like. ask if you could just like talk about something, because we, I think we just did the daily reflections, which was really good as about like cleaning up your side of the street and that's one my friend, we things to say it's like. hey why don't you.

416.0,Provider,Great.
8131.0,Patient,"But yeah. So I tend to use a lot of things for the word but. Some but. i'm kind of currently here at the House, I am going to be leaving in about an hour now back to ucsf. hank is really sick. yeah i'm."
416.0,Provider,A coven.
8131.0,Patient,know he.
416.0,Provider,gets merged nobody had covered. it's mercifully.
8131.0,Patient,"delta yeah but no, you got an infection you gotta scratch on the back of his calf. And just got infected and it. became mercer it was Murcia and because of his immune system. it's traveling to his lungs. And like zero support from dad like jazz like dude i'm married I got a wife about things to do, I own my own business, like, I guess, that is, it will take you there. But um you know. He can't see the night there that it was like that the whole 13 months, when we were there quarantine when he was born. um but yeah i'm. Pretty we're all really worried he's hooked up to a lot of things and for 10 year old that he gets his treatment once a month it's pretty easy you know. And they talk to him, like he's an adult because he's he's pretty smart and he's been doing this going to the hospital stuff and that gives me he's like. But the merson I i've had worse than before and I gotta admit they did, but it was all my books They sat on a toilet seat. They had it and I don't I must have had like a pimple or something. But I didn't know that Murcia can get into your system and, just like relocate itself in other places and it's like i'm trying my best not to just want to like. Just screaming his dad say no he's trying to do his best and that's one of the main things when you have a kid was scared or skin infections like. Like 90% before they started doing all the testing after the bill got tests are the bill got past. Little kids would like scratch themselves, you know, to get those damn my reasonably fingernails. They express themselves and they get ready from like a sword, and they died and they wouldn't know what to test them for or they. They would just get a like a boat rash in that boat rash wouldn't there was no immune system to fight it and they wouldn't even know how to diagnose it when the kid died like 72 hours later. that's why it's so important to get these kids tested. But yeah like I before I called zoom I was on the phone with them and. he's Brown and he's not and. These are you're coming right you're you're not going to not come right like oh no i'm coming, because no one is there with them right now just dead at home. In so. yeah so i'm just i'm packing enough stuff I mean they just give me scrubs anyway, you go through an answer room and they make to take well, maybe take a shower with isn't neutrogena so. In the give you these special tells you about a plastic. And every like every time you wife, you have to drop on the floor take another one out raw floor and you do that drive on the floor. And you comb your hair and then you get put it in this like bonnet thing which is fine and when they give you, you have a choice of like the the out like the you know the top that when you go the emergency room and just Iran and. With the pants or you can get a scrub up and pants and you get socks in booties. And, and then you go in and you can't leave and that's okay. And it's scary because those this other part of the rooms that. Because it's just like a MED pass thing it says to hold for two arms go through, and I collect a mess and I became an expert at giving him meds. baby."
416.0,Provider,"So, are you going to be able to stay there, like sleep there."
8131.0,Patient,Only like.

416.0,Provider,yeah because.
8131.0,Patient,I have to get connected to some kind of community.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, I do all three of the people were from Leo."
8131.0,Patient,"And they come from American Canyon because it's seven in the morning there's no meeting. In Vallejo. That early and they like to start the day off. With a meeting, and then they kind of like check that off the list and they're good for the day so. Yes, so that's that that's available and it's within walking distance it's like. If i'm hauling ass it's like 10 minutes if I wanted my times 20. which will probably be always about 12 minutes because i'm always kind of a little bit late instead of like that. yeah makes me sick to my stomach even talk about it, so I want to be right back i'm gonna go grab some thumbs which i've been living off."
416.0,Provider,So how are you getting into ucsf.
8131.0,Patient,"Rangel is driving us. I don't know, Sir, there is no. Thanks dad. Okay yeah and. I had a test yesterday, and he came back negative is one of the fast ones they gave to me like three hours later. And so, so many hours to. get there, and be exposed and I probably shouldn't have gone to that meeting, now they really think about it, but I was the only one there with a mask but Lisa had a mask on. i'm glad I went I didn't even think about that I was kind of an asshole move. towards on yeah he. Is your your master full time so you're probably yeah. I just won't mention it. yeah i'm sure they're gonna trust me again when i'm there I don't know."
416.0,Provider,Well yeah.
8131.0,Patient,"yeah I got I just stayed with him outside the door. two nights ago and just night I slept they gave me one of those hospital chairs. Yes. And just stayed outside the doors and wasn't alone but. I couldn't get a test and the downstairs emergency room. Only quit equipped to give. family members tests in the floors and either. Because we're supposed to do that on our own, I guess, because you're there or not. And I mean wrinkle came picks me up. We took them and I know I was going to be able to get in and. wrinkles it's tested having seller get tested regularly like oh I don't know. They bought a bunch like off the counter stuff the rapid ones that you buy just for the that they're aware. But. But he left he literally he's walking bounce like. But he did that, when he was three weeks old Rangel doesn't do hospitals very well. Yes, I mean it sounds like he does a lot of other things really well with that yeah. And I think he's intimidated, because I can understand the like Dr talk they've had myself so much time in the hospital that you just kind of understand that, like when they say certain things it's really not that scary. And it freaks them out, but. I have to remind myself, these are not candy. crush saga."
416.0,Provider,"Yes, but it's yeah you don't want to get. Take too many. So Okay, so you guys are gonna. Be wet and."
8131.0,Patient,"I gotta throw that out there. um. I found my a weed pin from a year and a half ago. I took like two hits off that thing and I dig in the dirt them out. john went to bed. And i'm pretty sure he showed up positive on the test I don't know what's going to happen, I was in the hospital."
416.0,Provider,You mean if it showed a positive on our test you mean. That we yeah. I mean we want. A lot of our patients but.
8131.0,Patient,it's not.
416.0,Provider,Something that we. I mean i'm not going to like super endorse it for someone who already struggles with addiction. But it isn't something that we're going to be like kicking you out for anything.
8131.0,Patient,"You reminded me of like well I don't. know it makes all of my pain worse, and this, I know, like it because I haven't done this alone. I was just like boom. i'm done was nice I got a lot of really good sleep and then I just destroyed the pen. yeah. I mean just really searching for a SLE. i've gotten emails from you and. I asked the people, though, the meeting. That was recommended to go back to that the one I went to but just in a different location and I was like i'm not real. I call my parents. For all. They said that they will support me 100% and they said they will support me financially, they just can't have me come home. They just said it's just well and I hate that because it's kind of like when you have money you just like throw money at the problem. And that's just the way it made me feel. I know it's not."
416.0,Provider,really hurt.
8131.0,Patient,"You know, but. I wouldn't be doing them any. service if I if I went out I probably I probably helped my mom out like a cook. and which are made amazing thing last night. and clean and just like take sure i'd help my dad with a farm stuff but."
416.0,Provider,"So I mean there's there's a ton of sober living house it's just a matter of finding one that you want to be in, and if you want to be in Moran i'm like there's. there's a sober living. house in novato there's some insane well."
8131.0,Patient,"Are there any that like do the Vallejo thing it's like prop 47 is called where if you've never been arrested for. alcohol or drugs ever in your life they'll pay for your SLE and then what they'll require you to do so many meetings, a week and test and live in a legitimate folk and SLE that have like girls and. stuff I don't know if you've ever heard of that I didn't never heard of that yeah it's called prop 47 it's like invalid Oh, and a lot of people from napa."
416.0,Provider,Then why don't you call them. call them and ask them if there's any other locations. thanks for the honesty.
8131.0,Patient,I don't even know yeah it's online i've looked it up thoughts i'll try i'll try to figure it out in a. way when you were taken and.
416.0,Provider,what's it called again.
8131.0,Patient,"ambling called prop 47. And it's. it's a program that pays for people to go to SL leads. But you also need to follow, like other rules that go to meetings and this net I don't think you have to be on probation. So."
416.0,Provider,"prop 47 reduces penalties. For drug and alcohol crimes from felonies two misdemeanors that looks like. And let me see, let me look, let me look. hold on, let me look it up this face ever. said and sober living. and"
8131.0,Patient,Somebody Robert from on right now and it's free and so Joseph and so as I can't remember the dark hair girl's name. amanda. And they're all in Vallejo so I don't know if it's just fillet o
416.0,Provider,Maybe.
8131.0,Patient,Not.
416.0,Provider,"not yet. But this is a good, I mean you'll have a lot of time when you're at the hospital is a good project for you."
8131.0,Patient,"yeah i'm I definitely know now. That, if even if it's just for a dare to say going to jail, how to program because it's. The whole different environment and if I don't even know what floor we're going to be on and. Now that these 10 I don't think we're still going to be on the baby floor but he's still pediatric right. Because we were we were literally just chillin in that when you're really sick to teach to the back door legend elevator and everything is like vacuum, sealed and you go through, and they take the kid you know. Like done about it, and then the parents. That want to come through, we have to go through the anteroom and it's because it's all like kids with cancer autoimmune diseases and so it's a. Like when you see those commercials about those kids like St jude and ucsf it's real like it's it's a different it's a different thing like. it's a whole different. concept of dealing with reality. I think like it everything changes, when you go in there, everyone talks different everyone looks different. Everyone tries their best to be like normal but. there's nothing fucking normal about it. I just pulled this up like one of the floors where they played the lullaby because, when we were there. What they play this lullaby and that was the key for the parents to go to the door shut the blinds and if the kid was old enough. And distract him play, but nine out of 10 times what you do is you hear you hear the mom and the dad first before you hit the wall by like of them, just like crying. yeah this is hard. Okay. yeah yeah I don't get goose goose months and yeah definitely don't want to hear that song."
416.0,Provider,Now.
8131.0,Patient,"So. it's like that easy. I mean yeah. i'm trying to be so optimistic, and I think i'm."
416.0,Provider,scared.
8131.0,Patient,"yeah like I wanted to get to 10. And that's it, you know they told us he wouldn't make it to be a year now is like 10 chillin it. and I don't want like this, like like I want him to be. The oldest kid whiskey in your man."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8131.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I mean he's he's survived worse than this. So far right.
8131.0,Patient,"This is well yeah it wasn't that bad honestly for him i'm considering because. But I don't know, I have to sit with like, I have to have like it's gonna be a different talk when I get there with the doctor and I like they don't you don't get to talk to the doctor and the nurse she gets talked to. The doctor on the phone you get to talk to the nurse that has like two patients and the very critical and they don't have a lot of time to talk and I have a hard time with that, like getting to the point, yes and no like a. And i'm sure me he couldn't be like we've always said there's only one place, that we would ever put them in in these in that place and. Dr jenn parks, already been by the doctor that saved his life and i'm sure we'll see double chin. And i'm sure he right now as miserable as he is whenever when anybody comes in, he pulls it what he does he does, what I do like when we're nervous, or like we felt the worst. will be too early and he's but he's cute cute so. I just kept on like it really hurts, you need to let them know like because it don't don't tell them you this big tough guy because. They don't feel like there's a golf ball on the back of his calf, and they have to take it out and stuff it and that sure mind is like right next month, so i'm sure i'm in China. And stuffing it not smell is so awful."
416.0,Provider,So yeah.
8131.0,Patient,"Just let them know man, but i'm pretty sure they're not gonna like not do it the pledges give them something anyway, even if it's just tylenol but. I just don't want them to not say anything until I get there."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So what me what time, are you leaving Jennifer."
8131.0,Patient,"sprinkles going to be good at 11 3012. Okay i'm. Just thinking it in my brain is add.
