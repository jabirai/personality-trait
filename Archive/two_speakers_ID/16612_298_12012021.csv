16612.0,Patient,Good.
298.0,Provider,hey have you been gaining weight and that's not good.
16612.0,Patient,yeah not a problem with binge eating I think that's what it's called i'm not sure if it would be labeled as binge eating.
298.0,Provider,"Sometimes that can be a side effect of the medication, if you want me to help you with that I can it's good to get rid of that it's good to get rid of the depression, but then, sometimes we can deal with. Eating and gaining weight so. I don't know if you've ever tried wellbutrin it puts dopamine in the brain we use it for over eating people who do smoking. it's also helps with depression, but it helps with weight gain and it's up to you, if you want to go down that road, we don't have to i'm just throwing it out there okay."
16612.0,Patient,moving toward.
298.0,Provider,"You are willing okay and it's nice it's probably one of my most favorite drugs out there just because it does it puts dopamine in the brain you take it once in the morning because it does give energy and it'll mess with your sleep, if you take it later in the daytime because it's energizing. It also works on depression, a nother way, so the paxil put serotonin in the brain this put dopamine in the brain and dope I mean we like to me. we've definitely like to believe. and Any. Any. suicidal thoughts. Okay. and How would you describe your mood any other move that you're having."
16612.0,Patient,"Lately, like before I was on that. I guess, I was on a different mindset, but. Now my lately any, the main thing that's really been bothering me or not so much bothered me but. there's a lot of ideas I can run through my mind, I want to run on. Just pinpoint one and put all my focus towards out there."

16612.0,Patient,"um, no, no."
298.0,Provider,"All right, well, you are good to go, unless you have any questions for me."
16612.0,Patient,"Sir. Is it a subscription for both beautiful as well, no."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, it is, I sent it over to the pharmacy in two weeks if you don't have any negative side effects we can go up to the next level, you should know pretty fast if you're starting to feel a little bit more livelier and less anxious to eat, and so it should start to help with the paxil. Have you had any negative side effects from the paxil for any sexual problems. No Okay, if you did the wellbutrin would kind of help with that too. All right, you're good to go thanks for coming to see me."
