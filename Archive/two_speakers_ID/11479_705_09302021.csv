11479.0,Patient,yeah and sometimes when I have free time during the day I just just did that and do like 10 minutes meditation that they feel so good.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah all that is great. yeah and then how about to is there. Any new updates I know relationship wise and you've had some. You know, dating and."
11479.0,Patient,dating know that part doesn't feel good. yeah. So I yeah I lost lots of confident about that part. yeah those stating that I know it's the part I still feel frustrated about.
705.0,Provider,Someone to I believe that you were kind of contemplating whether to continue to kind of see is that still.
11479.0,Patient,"um I yeah I thought, and so the guy i've been dating for mothers and I thought everything goes well, the. insisted that that guy it's sometimes it just suddenly disappear yeah, but I think is maybe more normal yeah and there's nothing like. Some noodle have any fine or anything like ours, you know nothing everything when we make women, men and everything's good, but these disappeared like yeah so yeah we we haven't contact for for a while to. Think yeah I think I should probably I should move on to the next one."
705.0,Provider,And a way to read it seems like you're okay with that decision you're like well and ran its course.
11479.0,Patient,"um it wasn't okay before and I yeah I experienced and very. You know, sometimes before out when I was young. it's always I disappear, you know the guys is chasing me and I feel I feel confident with the talk I don't feel shy, I feel very confident talking to guys and forming with the them. But I started to find out the woman's to certain certain age is not like too much like 20th before it's I love loss of confidence honestly never thought about this. yeah. So yeah it wasn't good I I don't feel good but. I try to convince myself this thing's not working needs to just don't like don't force it is yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I like I like that right it's it is where it's like you know it wasn't maybe the best match, and you were already kind of contemplating whether to continue, and you know the two is building yourself back up when you're ready to get back out there."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah I and also, I feel like the medication or also really helped me to relax so all those not just so for those slot at it, I used to have that I. I feel more relaxed, I know I think it's the medication, because there are there was few few days that I cut the cut the meditation that the feeling that back again yeah cuz this guy um yeah at the beginning, this is a really nice guy yeah and he is the he's a captain is a pilot. yeah it's very, very talented talented love music and very nice. have very nice person person yet how to say that. yeah. And at the beginning, he shows. up. He shows very strong feeling and always talk to me and messaged me and asked me out of this is just like feel like the things, little by little fake like fake out like that yeah, but I think, maybe it's normal so."
705.0,Provider,"It could be to that. yeah it's more of whatever was probably going on with him and maybe there's some other stuff that didn't happen, and it has nothing to do with you in particular, it just was. yeah you know."
11479.0,Patient,Just yeah yeah so yeah I know if if somebody else's they don't want me now I shouldn't like yeah I shouldn't put like effort to. yeah so.
705.0,Provider,"to know you know with romance and and how it's going to work, but you know it's a lot of times it's just getting back out there and I know, especially after divorce, sometimes it's really hard to get yourself back out there and get your confidence back and all that, so I. Think it's great that you even went for it. You know."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah it's hard, because it, you know it's hard to have a feeling for some some some guys that this guy really started when I started to help feeling with him and I start to feel he calls back yeah so that's that doesn't feel good."
705.0,Provider,"it's confusing to. yeah looks like Okay, what are we doing here."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah so at the beginning, I he shows all those interesting and so when I started to have feeling and he also like the template level the Sam. I think yeah for dating. You think that I think yeah that's that's very it's hard. yeah but it's Okay, I try to convince myself, maybe next will be felt better. Right yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and it may be even a better match and the person that you had before."
11479.0,Patient,"Maybe but it's really, really. lost lots of confidence, you know. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"You know, just like meditation so meditation has helped with the relaxation and feeling better same thing for the confidence is what are some things that you can start doing for yourself that you will feel more confident."
11479.0,Patient,yeah I don't know. I yeah I don't I don't know. Okay.
705.0,Provider,"Do you ever have an opportunity to go out with your friends, and you know just tell a couple of people hi and just to you know get back out there and build the confidence back."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I have lots of good good friends, so we had yeah good conversation yeah that that part is okay just the romance phil."
705.0,Provider,"I like so how you're taking it in stride and you're like okay well you know we'll see maybe the next one will be better and you never know but you're you're probably even more so now like really close to what you don't want you're like I don't want this, I know that. But I do want this and it's like getting you closer to it."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it also I feel like it's just it's so hard to open your heart to someone else you don't even know you know if you make some new one new guy and you have to spend some time to know each other. into like open your hearts until you open your heart is in this case okay oh I started to open my heart and he was he disappeared. yeah so it's a little like you, you want, so you probably really experienced that that that that thing again so yeah you get to me, you get to know someone so you spend some time, maybe you don't have feeling and you have to know the next one, and we it's it's just so tired."
705.0,Provider,"And I know too that it's you know valid reasons to feel disappointed, because you put a lot of time and energy into it and you know it didn't work out maybe the way that you had wanted it to and it's like there's some some disappointment, there too, and. it's always that risk, you know with the heart is putting putting your heart out there and kind of risking like is this going to. be a match."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah and also my ex husband. he's been contact me a lot recently and show a lot of kind of does yeah and I don't know, maybe he won't get back together or not so. that's another thing to to to bothered me so. I can feel he's still care about me. And i'm because we know each other for for long we live together for a long time. um I don't know i've been thinking if we get back together. So it's that at least someone that we know each other. familiar with those things that will you use to live together, but I don't know it's because something happened before, maybe never be like. Maybe go moving our come go back. feeling before I don't know, I must stress so it's so. so complicated so."
705.0,Provider,What would you be comfortable with then if it wasn't like let's just get back together what would you be comfortable with.
11479.0,Patient,"um know if everything is just like nothing happened before, and we still like can. Like before we still care about each other that's I think that's that's the best of what that's, the best thing. um yeah. But I don't know."
705.0,Provider,Would you want to see him again just to see him just to to even as friends.
11479.0,Patient,"Oh, we do see each other. Okay yeah we do talk and message and see each other and he he always asked all do we do need something do you want me to buy some food for you sometimes yeah he come over to grab some tea still have some Mel. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Do you feel that there's still I mean I know you care about him, and do you feel that there's still a connection when he comes, and you know he's in the House."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I feel yeah. I feel that and. I feel you want to come back, but he just afraid to. Speak it out. yeah. card. So the one one part that i'm afraid like if we get back together and. Something happened again like this, we will be the worst before you know that if this doesn't happen again why will do will do will do get back together. Maybe I should find you another one, find a better one, but the other side of that view all so it's so difficult, maybe even harder to maybe the next one is even."
705.0,Provider,"and trying to work out to that is it the case, you know with your ex husband that you feel like you could work through it, what the two of you went through is it worth working through to give it a second chance."
11479.0,Patient,yeah. yeah i'm thinking yeah i'm thinking me should I we're not.
705.0,Provider,You probably don't have to make a decision like this week right.
11479.0,Patient,"yeah, of course. This has been law as being kids who've been. married for. 1314 years. yeah and i'm thinking cuz. I don't know how much time I still can wait, I really want kids and now i'm at at 38 you know women. After like certain age is it's be more difficult to get pregnant. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"It is so a lot of women are waiting, you know later and and people, you know in their 40s are having their first pregnancy."
11479.0,Patient,ya know.
705.0,Provider,I know that's a lot to think about is. Do you see yourself with him having a child.
11479.0,Patient,"yeah. I know. kiss the reason that we've diverse is he having a fair yeah so that's the reason that maybe they they broke up can then yeah do you want to come back to me. In the other way that I feel like he starts really like love me now, if not he won't have the fear and you want to divorce, but. yeah maybe he just wants the bag he where is he. yeah he. I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"there's options to I know, sometimes if people are contemplating getting back together is going to couples counseling to see if you can work through, especially if someone's had an affair, to see if if you both can. Talk about it heal from it and be able to see you know if a second chances warranted or not."
11479.0,Patient,I don't think you can do that because before we the words alfie asked him do you want to see the counselors its thing if things can work out with a counselor no he doesn't want to do. yeah. And he's he knows i'll be seeing a therapist and taking medication knows. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"I you can revisit it and you know a lot of times too if it's on your terms, then you could share like what would motivate you and you would feel comfortable with if if you are to entertain the thought."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah we should have some like conversation let's see yes, what do you think. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"You know what's really good, though, is you've allowed your time, you know read it to heal and to do things like you're discovering you know meditation. you're discovering like these other self. Self discoveries. That maybe that opportunity, if you have been in the relationship it wouldn't happen and so it's like now you have these things to draw on to have yourself feel better and more confident and working on that."
11479.0,Patient,yeah because it really because everybody one life better a cell yeah those are things they have to be thinking workout.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. I know, last time to we were talking that with with drinking that it kind of came into the alcohol had come into the picture and newer letting some of that you know decreasing your days how How has it been you know, since we talked about, I think it was over three weeks ago."
11479.0,Patient,yeah yeah I do much less. um but I filled out that that the whole thing like I think I did one or two days yeah.
705.0,Provider,"that's awesome just that, alone, though Rita so you lasted a couple of days sober."
11479.0,Patient,Like one one or two days.
705.0,Provider,"You know what to me that is still success because. Excessively did that right. In in the case that you want to do that again, you can build on that, but you know that you have it in you, you already did it."
11479.0,Patient,"Okay yeah yeah. And so I just feel like I don't have the cell I don't have self control it's not hard why why yeah I know. it's some me time when I add the night and the nighttime or they can't stop myself. But actually I know a new it because, when that day I don't drink at all. um I have trouble sleep at night, so if that day I don't have any drink. I will like I will wake up every hour. Of the night. But the next morning is OK, the next morning I feel Okay, and actually feel good. Because you know when I drink and the night next morning Sometimes I feel. Tired or have a good something. yeah, but no one feels good but it's just. um yeah it's just hard at the night."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and and by you buying and exploring new things, such as the meditation at night is at least getting some other tools, because alcohol usually at nighttime it's more of a relaxing people want to relax and wind down from the day. And usually alcohol disrupts your sleep so it's it's usually will wake you up in your rem sleep where yeah."
11479.0,Patient,yeah there's lots of people say alcohol actually may do sleep when it's words like you cannot sleep well but for me i'll keep keep my slip a little longer. Okay yeah um. yeah I think I should I got some prescription from a doctor so for first firstly for Sonia Sonia.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11479.0,Patient,yeah cuz otherwise I will wake up every hour is so it's so hard.
705.0,Provider,"Right and even though with alcohol that you're reporting that you're still you're asleep, but then the next day you feel kind of a little bit. What would you say, less than I."
11479.0,Patient,yeah i'll tiger.
705.0,Provider,yeah it's probably still affecting you where your deep sleep you're refreshing you know sleep isn't happening so it's good to maybe try the medication.
11479.0,Patient,yeah I should ask a doctor if it's okay with that medication and with the. This one that already have installed.
705.0,Provider,"Right yeah to make sure that there's not an interaction and then also do, especially with the sleep medication. is most of them you don't want to mix it with with."
11479.0,Patient,"Alcohol yeah yeah so and also, I know it, this sleep is very important. and especially cause lots of mental like mental problem if. If if people can sleep well. Right yeah i'll be doing lots of research about this mental health thing. And yeah I try so hard to to make. workouts."
705.0,Provider,yeah have you been to some type of physical exercise because that's definitely one of the key elements of having good mental health.
11479.0,Patient,I didn't have chance.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, but it's on the radar you're thinking about it."
11479.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah maybe some walk when they walk to my friend's house that consider a light.
705.0,Provider,"That is exercise, you can put a check on the list of physical exercise."
11479.0,Patient,"I have, I have some close friends, we all live like a couple blocks away and sometimes they invite me to for dinner at their place, because I live by myself, sometimes I feel lazy to cook cook and they invite me so what's it all my dishes don't drive I walk there yeah."
705.0,Provider,that's that's good and it's stuff like that to where when you're reading about mental health like what else have you learned about with mental health and what they're saying is a recipe to feel better.
11479.0,Patient,Now i'm just have subscribed some channel from YouTube is that they have very acute the cartoon drawing and then every clip is short like couple minutes and explain some what's depression was entirety what that looks like. And some good habits and you can have every day. Some positive things he how you can think about yeah. yeah sometimes I play when I drive and I just listen. yeah it's a very good thing.
705.0,Provider,i'm glad that you're using that sounds like a really good resource and that positive psychology where the things that we tell ourselves if we can just that alone they're showing can lift the mood even even slightly you know.
11479.0,Patient,"Together yeah they have lots of things that how to build your self confident and how to make people like you, are like some. Some lots of interesting thing and another channel as subscribers some it's a psychologist says she we're exploring more like medication thing and how those map different medicine effect it's a different kind of situation yeah I love to do research."
705.0,Provider,"that's good and something like that, I mean it's really neat to research, it and then start to implement some of those things that you find you know that hey I want to try this and then you try it like the meditation and then it works."
11479.0,Patient,hey oh that's amazing meditation is amazing.
705.0,Provider,"It definitely is, and you know part of it, too, they say diet and exercise and walking is definitely one of them, that has many health benefits. and sleep like you were saying sleep is important yeah."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah So when I work because my day job is working on dental office some some sometimes like so many things going on in the same time. Before that I always think that my brain can't function well, because I always forgot things, and if this is too many things happen at the same time. it's so hard for me to do those motor tax things a phone call and patients coming in, and they should go out and have to write down certain things and payment I feel so frustrated I can remember things, but I think after this I feel my brand can function better and feel yeah."
705.0,Provider,"i'm i'm sure, with the medication with you know, having the counseling and just lifting your mood and. You know the next part two, is what the self esteem is. Every day, if you can write down at least three things that you, you like about yourself or three things that you are appreciated about yourself that day."
11479.0,Patient,"And yeah yeah it was them last week and it's something that I, I forgot to do in my office and. My my boss and talk to me, and you always forgot things so I said that moment, I feel bad, but later I feel like I did my best I yeah."
705.0,Provider,"That is a good affirmation, because it is at the end of the day, rena we all make mistakes, things are going to happen because think of how many times that day that you did things right. repeatedly you did them right did them right."
11479.0,Patient,"Yes, I tell I started to tell myself Okay, you did he did he do fast it's okay to make mistake."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah exactly and that's a good way to especially with self esteem to handle ourselves with care it's like you know fragile because. we're human we're going to make a mistake. be perfect that's not you know attainable."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like i'm in this journey that i've been seeing. A therapist i'm talking to a doctor and john Ruth I think it's really helps a lot yeah because before I always think I have to do everything perfect if that is my fault. I will. criticize myself, and I feel I feel bad, but now I started to accept that nothing is permanent nobody's perfect you eat beef, you cannot do it that's not your fault."
705.0,Provider,"And even though it's hard to get in the habit of just saying I did my best once you do that, and you probably have been saying that to yourself a couple more times."
11479.0,Patient,So yeah so thank you so much for your call you helped me alot so.
705.0,Provider,"In already you're the one that had to do all the action and so that's part of what we do here is just giving you some tools, but you're the one that takes it or not, I mean it's your choice. yeah chose to do it and that's what's empowering is you're choosing to do all these things to help yourself, or you want, you know to feel better you want to have different things you know."
11479.0,Patient,i'm glad I got those know. i'm lucky to have all those help yeah.
705.0,Provider,Oh good how salted i'm eating like you know nutrition is so important.
11479.0,Patient,"yeah I started to eat a lot of salad because every doctor in the Office itself and fruits yeah so I started to you love salad to. yeah but um but the one thing that maybe the medicine that helped me to gain the weight, so this and the other thing that's bothered me, so I tried to eat like not that heavy thing, but sometimes I feel like i'm craving for. Before this I don't eat that much I try to avoid that carbohydrate I know you have too much that does not need a body don't don't need that much. But a lot of meats know vertical before so nice and so you start to eat a lot of the worst of all that I feel like the medicine that made me feel craving food carts. I believe this this one, because before that I don't have don't feel that way."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
11479.0,Patient,"Yes, and I try, I tried to cut some but i'll be eat health. um yeah I don't have junk food and never I don't have like those unhealthy snacks know have eat very healthy."
705.0,Provider,"yeah with with alcohol to and i'm wondering with because you've been reducing it, a lot of times with alcohol, when you start to decrease or quit. That you really crave sugar because alcohol changes the metabolism and it's more of like a bad sugar, which could also be why you're more tendency to want some carbs."
11479.0,Patient,"Because yeah because. I hate sugar I had sweet thing a and and never eat dessert so every time when we ask the people that my friend have dessert and they all know that we don't random like dessert and I don't drink like. beverages with sugar, I just don't like sweet thing I don't know if that's because I think it's because I drink alcohol or I don't know yeah and. I just don't like sweet thing. And when so they're terrorists period of time I doing the keto keto diet so it's a couple your carbohydrate. hey in that time. I started craving sweet thing. I think it's the body react, I think, is the same as you say that you fed Cup. Alcohol cravings for sugar."
705.0,Provider,"yeah a lot of times when people you know stop drinking and and they might gain a couple of pounds and i'm always like you know what it's healthy it's it's healthy wait until you get. where you can exercise more and things like that, but the body is like Okay, you know, because with alcohol it depletes your body of vitamins and nutrients, so the body's like look i'm going to store this in case you do that again. years."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah and I know also i'll give us a while to be added, also the source of like an energy source right your body take them as an energy source."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah and that's where you know if you combine everything the sleep the getting your vitamins and nutrients by eating well sleeping well emotionally well, like all those things tied together. makes it where you have more energy where you may feel calm or or if things are challenging that you handle it differently and a more like manageable way then before you know where maybe the overwhelming feelings."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah I hope this this thing can get a little better and better and better, little by little yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and out to me even I think we met almost three and a half weeks ago i'm just talking to you today, you seem happier and and lighter like on a more relaxed today."

11479.0,Patient,"yeah and I remember one day when I drive to work I play. A song that they like, and I started to smile when I driving like when I hear that music that I like and I feel good. And I realize. I smile."
705.0,Provider,"yeah because in the inside, is matching up now, because you feel better, and so, then you know you're smiling, and that makes a big difference."
11479.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you're the one that did all this it's like you chose to like get in there and do something different, and you've really shifted things."
11479.0,Patient,Class today we have a little like yeah that will progress this.
705.0,Provider,"You already are you love music, and so I think that that's already something that we talk about positive psychology is parent with music and you already have that too."
11479.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. it's just. When I feel depressed I don't want to hear me like don't listen music I don't want play that's effort, no like no like em. um yeah but no yeah I do like to listen, some. My favorite songs and. Sometimes sing along and play."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Now, with depression, especially as you, you lose that desire to do the things that you love before it just everything is kind of on that blah level."
11479.0,Patient,yeah so as. I watched the video that can I watched it about psychology one of them is showed how the depression and as a sanity people looks like and when I watch that that's exactly what me. yeah so don't don't want to get up in the morning one saying beds and people people think you're lazy you're not lazy you just don't feel like that way.
705.0,Provider,"Right right and it is and that's where it's you know, trying to discover things that can make you if you can you know get out of bed and function and that's why I say every day's a win just getting out of the bed, you know it's like that's a win and then build on that."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah and i've heard some Muslim friends their their co worker. They they're very like active very happy and have lots of friends that she had this year also have very she also have depression, too, I think, is one of the that the other thing that people don't like doing. People can tell cannot tell."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11479.0,Patient,Only yourself can win no. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"very true and I think that hopefully we're shifting where more people understand about mental health because it's like if you have a broken arm and you have a cast people understand you know. yeah and they would ask you to like use your arm to do things, but if it's mental health and its internal we don't see the bandages and that we're healing and still trying to get better."
11479.0,Patient,"yeah it's interesting just just before, when I drove back home there's a boss in from my card and there's the boss of just all kids everywhere alameda as it alameda county has like 30 percentage identify ation and then just less than 2%. Like a have like mental health like approaching mental health services yeah so."
705.0,Provider,That that is definitely you know way too too low and and by having more Community places people can go and especially virtual like this now. I hope that percentage goes up.
11479.0,Patient,"I understand that, because before I find it find help because i'm so afraid I because I don't know what this is. And then. I feel like, if I have mental problems is a big problem."
705.0,Provider,"And what depression to you know firsthand how it is, is the more you don't talk about it and you're like your friend that has depression, as you may not know. She hasn't depression until she tells you because usually if you're depressed you stay home and you don't communicate and you don't talk about it, and then it just gets usually worse in time."
11479.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And so now you're doing the opposite, and you know more about it now and then like you said you're sharing with your friends about meditation and so they'll take that away too and try it. yeah that's the neat thing as more and more people are starting to open up about mental health, even if you look at. You know some of the famous people we had even with the Olympics, where I think one of the gentlemen gymnast chose not to cause mental health, why she wasn't there and that put everything on a bigger platform to start talking about mental health."
11479.0,Patient,"um yeah, it is important. yeah and also sometimes people, maybe, people are afraid of people died were mental problem because people don't judge a physical problem, but sometimes people have different like react, or if someone has a mental problem you that."
705.0,Provider,"there's definitely still a level of people not understanding and know what what it means to have depression or anxiety, you know I love when I hear people say well why don't they just get over it like if they can't get out of bed."
11479.0,Patient,I don't.
705.0,Provider,know. yeah yeah it's like clinical depression is different than hey I want to snooze my alarm because. I don't want to go to work. it's a lot different than that.
11479.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm so grateful we're having people like you to help all those like people like us, and for those mental health things."
705.0,Provider,"that's to me it's i'm always grateful to to work in this field and part of it is like with groups of why group works it's just getting people together, where you can share, about this and it's like breaking that stigma that we're talking about with mental health. I say you. know a lot of people have anxiety, a lot of people have depression."
11479.0,Patient,yeah so yeah you feel like that all i'm all alone.
705.0,Provider,"Right and if you feel like you're not alone and that's where that humanistic part of us where we want to feel connected and we want to feel good about ourselves, but when you feel like you're just you know different and why you know why me it just starts unraveling."
11479.0,Patient,"Actually I started to feel. I started to feel Maybe my mom and my uncle my uncle had the diagnostic mental problem. He was in hospital. Before that I started to feel like my mom have I am Saturday to these just not that level not maybe the lower level. yeah cuz she's all those tiny little things that she she have reacted very like. Then, even that normally people think, maybe I don't know how to make an example of a very little thing then she cannot sleep, the whole night."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. worry about it over and over again. yeah yeah and that's a form of you know, anxiety always talk about like sub personalities there's the warrior. which worries like you're talking about with mom and she can't get out of her head like what if what if, and then there's the critic that usually sits on our shoulders and wants to criticize what we're doing. there's the perfectionist where the perfectionist is like, why did you make that mistake, you know and i'm in you know that other one is more of just Valley. So futuristic so overwhelmed with everything else, they can stay in today so it's it's nice like, with your your mom it's just. Part of maybe to read is not only was it maybe genetics, where genetics, you know one factor of with anxiety, but also the learned behavior because, as a child, you probably knew that mom would worry about these things."
11479.0,Patient,Oh no I don't I never noticed before.
705.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
11479.0,Patient,"yeah I know this one, but no, and now I know that's that that's part of the anxiety that that's quite one kind of society like how. yeah I think it might be genetic we have some like something the brand chemical thing."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11479.0,Patient,yeah I think is yeah probably the step family have some.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so, knowing that you're more prone to you know worry about situations and then ruminate where the, whatever your thoughts are keep happening and then it's tied to sometimes not sleeping. understanding that and then being like okay now I gotta if I know it's the worry, how can I do things like you were saying earlier, with the affirmations of just I tried my best or with us it's just like, no matter what you know you're going to manage and you're going to make it through."
11479.0,Patient,yeah and yeah and I got hell here so i'm lucky.
705.0,Provider,"I hope that you give yourself to like a lot of praise that. You were somewhere else, even a month ago, and make vast improvements today and that you're continuing on your journey."

705.0,Provider,"May I give me an example. Sure okay it's maybe daily and you don't have to write it down if you don't want to write it down, but at least thinking three things each day that either you appreciate about yourself, or you can say that you like about yourself. Just each days i'd like to start chiseling away at that self esteem that sometimes gets eroded, I want to start building a backup."
11479.0,Patient,Okay that's a good idea.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and you can, however, you want to do this to just you know each day be mindful think of three things. And just see how it goes."
