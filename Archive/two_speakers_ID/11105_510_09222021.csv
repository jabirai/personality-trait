510.0,Provider,"This is terrible lot therapist I have a bio psychosocial appointment with Cora skyler mason and. They have not checked in so we're just waiting a date of birth, for them as 214 2000. We are just waiting to see if they check in and join. ty styler how are you."
11105.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
510.0,Provider,"i'm all right good to see you. Know to. Be our official intake and just as a reminder and I apologize, you were scheduled a couple of weeks back when I was out unexpectedly and then last week I don't know if you were in group I kind of like Internet issue so i'm glad you got rescheduled. Now, before we get started out, I was able to review your paperwork and I think you told me when group and we had chatted briefly, you have an outside therapist Is that correct."
11105.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, now is the name Rebecca orchard, that was the name I saw that you had listed is that who you see."
11105.0,Patient,"Yes, I see her once a week."
510.0,Provider,"once a week Okay, I did not see what I didn't see is a release of information, I saw one for Dr bd which I believe is a psychiatrist Is that correct."
11105.0,Patient,"Yes, she's the one that I had when I was in the mental health facility in ventura but I haven't talked to her since gun."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so you don't see her regularly we're managing our men okay all right, so what i'll do, and as you know, I think, actually, you were one of my few that I didn't get to sort of. meet with one on one to share my status, so my last day with bright heart will be October 1. You will have a new therapist Karen Clark now since i'm doing your intake today. You won't technically be scheduled to follow up with her for another three months so that's. When you're already seeing an outpatient therapist we don't want to duplicate services so you'll be good for three months and that'll give us time we really need to get a release of information, though, signed by you, so if Karen needed to coordinate with. Rebecca we could because I didn't see that, though alright alright so i'll just make sure that gets taken care of. But let's get to it i'm really sort of bummed because I feel like i'm just sort of getting to know you a little bit better you've actually been talking a bit more in group, which I think is great, and I. love the things that you share like yesterday I just love the tortoise I just. um so as far as today we're going to get to know each other, a little. bit more, and I know that's tough knowing you're going to be seeing someone else but you already have sort of an individual therapist that I think you do your primary therapeutic work so. You know a little bit more on file for you, because it technically should have been done many, many months back so. Tell me a little bit, I was able to see that you had been hospitalized is that the way you got referred to bright heart that's what it appear that they refer to you too bright heart. yeah okay. Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that hospitalization was it your first time what were the circumstances that led to the admission, was it helpful tell me a little bit about that."
11105.0,Patient,"It was my first time in mental health facility how I got there is I I tried to OD on a bunch of pain meds. Okay, I spent I think two or three days in a hospital and they sent me to ventura where I stayed like I think a week."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, and that was your impression, since that was your first and hopefully your last right, but we know it's it's there if you need it, but what what's your impression of."
11105.0,Patient,"impatient um it was all right, the communication between staff and patients were all that great. Because I didn't even know that. I had to ask to get like showers applies, so I stayed in there for like two three days without a shower and I was like what's going on and."
510.0,Provider,Okay yeah and you didn't have anything to compare it to your that's their job to sort of show you the ropes and sort of go through those. You know procedures i'm sorry to hear.
11105.0,Patient,"That. Oh, goodness okay. I didn't make a couple friends in there, I gave them my number, but I still haven't heard from them, so I feel like maybe they just wanted to leave that part of their life in the past, which I totally understand."
510.0,Provider,"yeah okay okay. um and that was your first hospitalization now i'm assuming you're pretty young i'm assuming those pain meds were not yours, was it a parents or someone else how did you get those pain meds."
11105.0,Patient,"It was my dad's. Okay yeah. arthritis so he takes much relaxers, and all this other stuff and then my mom they were like a combination between my mom's and my dad's."
510.0,Provider,"I see Okay, and as far as I know, we're managing your meds that you take, do you manage your own meds to parents are those locked up i'm just curious how they're managing."
11105.0,Patient,I managed my image.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and since that time how how good, are you about taking your meds are you pretty compliant do you ever have days like you know what I don't feel like taking them today what's your overall yes."
11105.0,Patient,"I have those days like yesterday I didn't take them today, I haven't taken them yet, but. i'll take them when i'm like in a good mood and. Like feel like I can get through the day like if I feel like I can get through the day without them that I won't take it, but if I feel like I absolutely have to, then I will like if. i'm working that i'll take like a five and take my meds so I can like it can help me get through the day without a whole bunch of stress."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, now I only have you taking one medication lexapro are you taking others."
11105.0,Patient,No that's it.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right now that is i'm sure you know, an antidepressant and it's not meant to be taken, like a prn there are pure medications which basically means you take it as you need it. This one doesn't really work that way so some people can have sort of not great responses, some people can start to feel a little bit of a draw, even if they miss a dose or two. So it's ideally one that you take so it can be consistent in your bloodstream. If you're thinking about kind of wanting to see how you do off of it obviously that's something I would highly recommend you talk with shauntel i'm not suggesting that at all. and, obviously, your therapist because I know some people start to feel like you know i'd like to see how I do off the MED because, are you are you reluctant to be on medication, do you have some like beliefs or thoughts around being on psychotropic medication."
11105.0,Patient,"I don't know it's just it's hard for me to take hills sometimes. Okay that's. Okay, I don't know, I have a really bad gag reflex."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's more just the process of taking it okay all right okay. Now How long have you been working with Rebecca once a week has that been since you're impatient and mission."
11105.0,Patient,"um I actually was a patient of hers back when I was a senior in high school, but we stopped. We stopped going or I stopped going there because I was graduating and my schedule wasn't really like my schedule is very spotty."
510.0,Provider,And so I told him.
11105.0,Patient,I said sure whenever they open and I just never messaged her again but. I. recently got back to her after the ventura thing.
510.0,Provider,"gotcha oh good i'm glad that you all were able to reconnect sounds like you have a good working relationship that's great. Prior to that impatient and working with her as a senior in high school, did you have any other mental health treatment and your past."
11105.0,Patient,"um I had a therapist when I was a freshman in high school, but I didn't really like her, so I stopped going."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so one other outpatient therapist got it okay. And as far as diagnoses are you aware of your mental health diagnoses i'm thinking possible depression, but what what are what's your knowledge of your diagnoses."
11105.0,Patient,"I was diagnosed with depression and I was actually diagnosed with ADHD with my therapist here. Oh, I know that. And I have high high anxiety and everything."
510.0,Provider,"So something exciting to now you had shared this was a while back and grew up, and I think I saw one notation on your paperwork that you filled out when you got connected with us. Is eating disorder like you talked about you know really not eating starving yourself have you ever been formally diagnosed with anorexia."
11105.0,Patient,"No. Okay, when I was a freshman I decided to become a vegetarian, because I thought it would help me start myself a little bit better."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11105.0,Patient,It did for a while. Like I. I would eat only if I was in color guard like I don't have a little snack so I won't pass out. And sorry she just.
510.0,Provider,wants to well she just wants to be part of it it's adorable I know that's how cats are.
11105.0,Patient,You just got fixed yesterday so she's kind of like.
510.0,Provider,Oh she's she's wanting some love okay yeah.
11105.0,Patient,"Anyway, so. out only eat if I was active in color guard, so I wouldn't pass out. So that happened for like I want to say a year and a half, I was never really diagnosed with like anorexia or anything because I never talked about it with anybody."
510.0,Provider,So I common.
11105.0,Patient,"yeah but around like junior senior year that's when I started to make a change in my diet, but since I starved myself for so long, it my. stomach couldn't hold like my food, the way it used to so if, like I eat the wrong thing i'll feel sick if I too slow or too fast or not at all or. is just I have to find an easy medium and if I eat too, especially if I eat too much it feels like my stomach is like getting stretched apart and it hurts to like sit up straight."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are your eating, how would you describe your eating habits now i'm skylar."
11105.0,Patient,"they're pretty good right now actually i'll try and eat like. At least one if not one meal a day i'll try to shoot for two. um I actually I snack a lot. That really helps my appetite with everything. But the main meal, I do eat his dinner, because my mom makes it for everybody here."
510.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, when do you have like a medical Doc that you get an annual physical and sort of curious that that has a you've been able to fly under the radar often I worked with. Eating disorder clients and often it is not something they want to offer unless they are truly in recovery and have gotten some treatment, do you have a medical physician like when was the last time you had a physical and do you. have your period i'm curious if you. yeah go ahead."
11105.0,Patient,"Well, the lot I actually recently had a an appointment, I think, two, three weeks ago with a medical doctor, it was like a new patient. checkup because before that I haven't had a checkup since I turned 18."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, if."
11105.0,Patient,I told her about how like. Like my way and everything like it goes back like my weight skilled kind of goes between like 94 pounds to 100 and like six pounds and it's like nothing goes back and forth depending on like if i'm eating that day or that day. yeah didn't really say anything about that. And she told me to like when i'm to like schedule a physical or something. But it was a couple weeks ago I don't really remember all of what she said.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, and did did you have any bloodwork your analysis anything else. done okay okay yeah it, I mean I would definitely want you at a minimum doing. I would actually probably prefer quarterly check ins i'll be the first to say there's. A lot of primary care docs or they're not experts on eating disorder, so a lot of times they're not really assessing or asking the right questions. So people can really fly under the radar I would just I don't know if your therapist is skilled in eating disorders, I don't know if it was. For two things come up about making sure kind of tracking your intake your weight and a lot of times blood work is really important that it's done as well as heart rate like basic vitals right when I worked with anorexic severely underweight. Or, and even slightly underweight right their BMI BMI is not the greatest but you know for height weight kind of where you're at but. The heart rate can be so low, and it can be that's really dangerous, so I just is your therapist skill does that come up at all or D, what are you know if you feel comfortable, what are your main goals that you work with your your outpatient therapist on."
11105.0,Patient,"We don't really I haven't actually mentioned that part of me, we. We like to ask her check in questions like how are you doing today what's your week look like and I just I just kind of tell her about what happened, the previous week and show like kind of like help me problem solve with that. And if I have. A problem that's like how like deep inside that i'm dealing with like i'll talk to her about it and she'll like helped me through it."
510.0,Provider,"yeah and I like that, I mean obviously you're focusing on the here and now kind of what's going on, we just don't want that to get lost, I know how easily it can go under the radar especially. If people aren't asking sort of those questions and and to your point you haven't really offered it so she might not even be aware Okay, I appreciate the honesty, I hope that you do stay on point with the medical follow up and certainly if you have not had bloodwork. or like a basic panel that looks at you know your sodium levels your potassium levels, these are really basic labs that are done usually in association with a you know, a new intake as far as a physical I would highly highly suggest that so okay. As far as any other medical I mean you're pretty young do you have any medical or physical health issues that you are managing outside of the mental health."
11105.0,Patient,"i'm a little bit with my periods, I have. Ever since I started it like in sixth grade i've had irregular periods, so I would have it, like twice a month once at the beginning, and then, once at the end going into the next month. Okay i've never like i've never had more than twice a month and i've never skipped a month until actually a couple months ago it was extremely weird because I had three in one month, and then the Month after that I completely skipped."
510.0,Provider,"Oh wow Have you ever seen like a specialist Ob gyn, because that will immediately warrant some further testing."
11105.0,Patient,I have an appointment with an Ob gyn on October eight.
510.0,Provider,I have to oh good.
11105.0,Patient,"First, but."
510.0,Provider,"i'm really glad to hear that yeah your age, especially it sounds like this has been sort of like a baseline of irregularity and that's not typical so i'm glad you're going to get."
11105.0,Patient,"i've got it checked out once before, because it was it was extremely weird like to my parents that I placed in one month. Right, so I did get it checked out, I think, when I was like 15 or 16. They put me on medication to try and regulate it."
510.0,Provider,"And I birth control, as my guest that's usually the first ones, possibly."
11105.0,Patient,"know they didn't put me on birth control, they put me on like fish oils and, like other things it."
510.0,Provider,"Really oh wow so you've never been on birth control because that's one of the. Common to try to help regulate a period. Okay well i'm so glad that you have an updated appointment, it sounds like it's been many years since that has been checked out okay i'm really glad to hear that okay. um What about currently I mean obviously you had a suicide attempts i'm sort of curious about your current safety status, do you struggle with parents suicidal thoughts at this time."
11105.0,Patient,"Not at this time, no i've been actually pretty good at keeping myself busy and keeping my mind occupied off that stuff like. My therapist here she has given me like exercises to help me like keep my mind off of things so she suggested going outside once a day, even if it's just like two seconds she suggested like. I have kind of a hard time doing like big tasks like cleaning or something like that so she just said, like take it one small step at a time."
510.0,Provider,kind of like.
11105.0,Patient,help me through stuff like that.
510.0,Provider,"yeah small incremental steps lead to much better long term sustainable behavior changes if we. Try to like do it all at once people get really overwhelmed and and mobilize so that's why we say start small, so I think that's great glad that you are getting that support. So when was the last time even had suicidal thoughts, was it at the hospital post discharge like when was the last time even having them."
11105.0,Patient,"it's been a while, since you enter."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, good all right now. April excellent What about Have you ever struggle with homicidal thoughts wanting to hurt people kill people go after people physically. I mean it's only ones back in."
11105.0,Patient,"sophomore year, but that was because my best friend and his girlfriend was screwing them over, and I was like i'm gonna kill her read the whole plan, but. Not since."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, and did you ever go after that person or okay now, what about self injurious behaviors do you have our cut burned by yourself yourself anything like that."
11105.0,Patient,"um I used to be a cutter. I think my last time I hurt myself was like sometime last year. Okay, I do like bite the inside of my lip and like outside of my lip when I get like nervous. And play it. If i'm driving and like i'm irritated with people kind of like pinch, the inside of my thigh."
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay and that's more recent but the cutting it sounds like that was. Over a year ago, or at least last year. yeah okay okay um as far as substance abuse, do you use abuse even recreationally drugs, alcohol prescription pills illegal drugs."
11105.0,Patient,"No nonsense. I don't know the beginning of this year, maybe."
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay all right that sounds like you've had some experimentation, I did see it on your paperwork, but nothing really since the beginning of the year. Have you ever struggled with psychotic thoughts like Have you ever had auditory visual hallucinations seeing hearing things that other people can't I need delusional thought paranoia. Not ever open for you."
11105.0,Patient,"I don't think so, but I do believe in paranormal activity, and so, if I see a shadow go by i'll just assume oh it's a ghost."
510.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, but it doesn't sound like you actively have psychotic where you are responding to internal stimuli that other people can't see or hear so. paranormal is pretty cool. We talked a little bit about the eating disorders and I, and I apologize I sort of just jumped in there, because I immediately thought of what you shared in group but anything else you wanted to offer about your appetite nutrition history that you think might be helpful that we know."

But my parents owned the restaurant and I worked there like as my first job i've been there forever so i'm kind of like worried that they'll I don't want to say fall apart, without me because there's only it's not many people who can run the window."

But the surveys, I was checking to see, I wanted to kind of get an update like on your depression, anxiety surveys Those are the two that I always look. and preparation of my individual sessions and, hopefully, I think the new therapist is going to be trained on the same format. I have not seen an updated survey from you, I didn't see one, since you started with bright heart, so do you know where to find those do you know how to get those I can show you what I think is the easiest way to make sure that you do those. bright heart ask that you do them weekly before your group that helps shauntel be able to write your scripts. But do you know where to find those."
11105.0,Patient,I do not.
510.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to show you to me, this is the easiest way and. I would invite you, and encourage you, hopefully to do this in preparation, I would go ahead and do them today, because you are really overdue, but i'm going to share my screen and. Show you this all right, and of course. All right, are you able to see actually me to go to the home dashboard for Brighton heart, because this is like the main do you see the dashboard the main website for bright heart. If alright, so what you're going to do, and since you have group on Tuesdays I would go ahead and do it today and then get on a rotation like on a Sunday to update them but. You do see the home about services videos but you're going to go to contact us so you're going to select that. And then you're going to scroll all the way down. and These are all the patient forums, you do not have to do all of these I know it looks a little overwhelming the easiest thing I want you to take a look at, though, there are two surveys that actually have numbers in them, and that is the band seven and the pH Q nine and. These needs to be done weekly and then there's one more that also has to be done weekly and go back to. The physical health survey, so this one right here, unfortunately, it does not say weekly there's a few that you'll you'll look at, and they have weekly in it, but the two that have the numbers. weekly and then this physical health survey. The other one, and this pH Q nine, by the way, that is a depression survey and then, once you start that it has the anxiety sort of coupled with it. So it's sort of two and one, and those are the ones that I always look at and that sort of gives me a snapshot. of your depression, anxiety and if I see Spikes if I see it, improve you know it, it bodes well, something we can talk about. Now, obviously I know you have a therapist already working with but just this helps shauntel who manages your meds because she looks at that to within your compliance and your chart. The other one that you're definitely overdo with is the patient satisfaction. And i'm just going to go ahead and click on one just so you visually see what comes up so whichever you know the surveys you do you put your name in and then your date of birth and then you just basically hit next and it prompts questions. it's as easy as that does that make sense, so. Like I said I would go ahead today and do the BAM seven pH D nine patient satisfaction and that physical health survey I I didn't see anything updated. Since April so just fyi. Okay, make sense, do you want me to go through it again, do you think you can find it. yeah I think it's pretty straightforward but perfect Okay, and then obviously I think you know this, but bright heart, you have the group weekly. You will only have to see Karen every three months, so the next in query and all i'm going to be. Giving her some cheat sheets and it'll be clear that you actually so September, October November, December so you're not due to check in with her until December. And so, usually what I do and i'll encourage her to do is we'll send the inquiry for the care navs to outreach you and say hey you're due for your quarterly check in with Karen and that's what that is. But I will also make sure that we get the release sent out to you, so you can sign that, so we have it on file for Rebecca orchard. And that's really it you just continue to come to group you do your quarterly check ins and then Sean do you, you probably see shauntel at least once a month How often do you see her."
11105.0,Patient,i've only I think i've only had one meeting with her ones.
510.0,Provider,"Oh really oh goodness okay all right um because usually I know she likes to see you all, at least once a month, so I mean that's between you and her but. I mean the good thing is when you come to group weekly if you need refills or questions she's there so but. Okay, if you did like I said earlier in the call if you had other questions about meds and need more one on one that would be the ideal, you know reason to set up more of a one to one with her. Perfect alright, well, I will see you next week, if you didn't have any other questions concerns comments you're welcome to drop off I hope you're going to participate and show and tell. I will see you next week for group, what did you say i'm sorry."
