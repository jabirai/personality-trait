Like I don't understand how people get do it, but when they look at the statistics I almost guarantee you like there's only a small percentage of people I guess there's a bigger project, and now, but I there's a huge percentage that doesn't do the online school. And I feel like. When the numbers come out they're gonna be like dang like 30 or 40% of people stopped going to school for like dropped out. yeah or never even completed. Because this whole thing anyway. So i'm just hoping, I can finish."

11533.0,Patient,"Being yet, though it is convenient but convenience is killing me. I don't know what to do."
527.0,Provider,Well i'm wondering if maybe just is there a particular classes you're behind in or just all of them you're behind in.
11533.0,Patient,"it's. I think it's like you have a certain amount of time to turn something in and then, if you don't turn it in you can't turn them. And so the works not hard and it's not like I can't can't catch up, but it's just like, even if I do all the work, who knows if all you be able to turn it in, and in the blackboard like sometimes like sometimes the videos don't work and sometimes you can even load it or do anything. Okay don't like. glitchy."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so what What if we just kind of organized it as far as the class, you know in in emailing your your professors and just saying. You know here's where i'm at you know i've you know, been a little behind I had shoulder surgery like just explaining the circumstances here's where i'm at in my work is there any leniency you can you know offer. Or you know extension to getting these assignments done i'm in the process of working on them, but understand. You know per the the you know syllabus you know, there may it may not get counted so i'm trying to prevent that and affect my grades, you know what what can we do to work together so that I can get my credits."
11533.0,Patient,"they're going to ask me to do my homework and. And then each classes like three hours and then, and then you got another three hour video after that."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11533.0,Patient,"homework, so you have you have in class homework and then you up out of class almost see it two times as much homework that and it's. yeah you have to watch the entire video it's not like oh i'm just in class that's it like."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah can you let them know you're having issues with the videos and things like that to like let them know that there's been glitches and difficulty with getting them downloaded.
11533.0,Patient,They know they already know that.
527.0,Provider,They say now.
11533.0,Patient,Work doesn't work they know that the whole thing's glitchy like most of the time. Like 50% of time it's not working.
527.0,Provider,"isn't an option drew maybe to like go to a library or something to. To do your your studies or anything just to get out of the House and have you know, a different environment."
11533.0,Patient,"They can't can't go to the school so i'm vaccinated or if I show my maxine. they're like. So I mean either turn that and before you go to school. Okay, open there."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Do you have any like local library close to you or something that you could study at.
11533.0,Patient,"home, I thought that I had to do it on the computer it's just. I just don't have the motivation do it like by myself okay why i'm paying. $3,000 a month, so that's a teacher can teach me. i'm not being three. month to watch a YouTube video. yeah yes so stupid."
527.0,Provider,it's.
11533.0,Patient,"ridiculous I can't. I feel that, is there, so like I don't know. me I don't know what it's gonna be like in the future, but just like."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. I mean is that, at a point of do you do you feel like maybe dropping a class or two. To maybe take some stress off of you, and in allow you know the the recuperation from your shoulder and everything."
11533.0,Patient,"I don't know I think i'm just going to try to do it and just. Hopefully pass the class D. or C whatever alone. it's not like it's hard it's just. it's just sitting doing all the homework. yeah I. mean not explain it. Like magic going to school your whole life and then all of a sudden, you can't go to school anymore, you have to do it on a computer. So yeah never done school on a computer."
527.0,Provider,ever. yeah it's definitely different now for sure.
11533.0,Patient,yeah it's like. The only thing I do on computers is make music and Edit videos and.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11533.0,Patient,"I guess that's what i'm doing now, but there's like one class where half them. get a soldering gun and like solders wires to this other wire and it's not like i'm not saying that's hard i'm it sounds cool but it's like how are you sister. And like and who are these kids I bet none of these kids even know how to solder, and gun is. yeah are they supposed to do that."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, you would think that they would have that obviously they probably have access to that stuff at school, but you guys aren't. Yet the order cool."
11533.0,Patient,"And then you have to go to the guys. And it's in the bush and some bag wires it looks like some drug deal. They meet me at the school at this time i'm like, finally, good to go meet them and talk to them and explain to them what's going on."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11533.0,Patient,"And he's like oh i'm not there, come to my house right down the street it's five minutes away what the heck is this is it's in the bush go grab the bags in the bush. Nicholas like this is so stupid like. yeah but it's good drug dealer teacher like. yeah and like. Any get like it was so hard like because in the civil of this, it says, you need to pick up the cable package and i'm like can I pick up the cable packet."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11533.0,Patient,"You need to read the syllabus before you send me a message. And the Does that mean they've been like a week later, goes by i'm like if I don't pick this up i'm going to fail. Right so read the syllabus and it says the cinema message action and pick up the packet am i'll just make any sense, then they send them another message on the hey I need to come pick this up like a hurry. And he's like he's like what time he be here. it's just so weird i'm like. They still have this where he sent me a message i'm like. Like can I come pick up the stuff now like the heck."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11533.0,Patient,"he's a cool guy for sure, but I think teachers are lazy to now. I think every. Are certain ones are more leads than others. Sure, affecting them. Like. they're just it's too convenient now. But it seemed like good guys but i've never met them never talked to them. Sure, so I don't even know what they look like."
527.0,Provider,yeah sounds sounds like you're really frustrated with everything with the process and just.
11533.0,Patient,yeah I think there's up and i'll feel better just.
527.0,Provider,"yeah is there any is there any of your classes like you're. You know you're on schedule and you've got done or you need to finish like one assignment or two assignments, and then you can."
11533.0,Patient,The only.
527.0,Provider,Put that aside and focus on ones that you're a little further behind.
11533.0,Patient,"There is one, but like this is, I do for the class like it's I don't even know the name of it, I think it's called like science something and it's a general ED but it's not the major. So it's just like just a whatever class and. All you do is you log on like today, I had it with the guide i'm not going hopefully I don't lose any points but. use as long as you're present this, the only in person class, but you could also go out of person. But he says it doesn't matter what you put on the homework it doesn't even matter if you answer it right or wrong he's like it doesn't matter if you do anything you so passive blast as long as you turn it in. and So after he told me that, like i've never done one thing, and all I do is like when they asked for like a question. On it pops up. Sure, so. it's just like whatever quiz I just do that and. I think we do have homework that I haven't been turning you i'm going to get on fear it today, but. Like I don't even know what I did on the last test. And it was a function tests. And Google and they had this quiz answer sheet and every single answer for the guys test in question already So what is this like."
527.0,Provider,This is ridiculous yeah.
11533.0,Patient,I feel bad like Why am I even going to school i'm not learning.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah which makes it much, much more difficult to stay motivated when here."
11533.0,Patient,"is like it, you have it's hard to cheat and you got to like think of ways to do it, but now it's just like. I would, I want to see why no one would it be cheating. yeah. Everything no one's gonna I think that's what's going to be the issue, no one's gonna learn anything because there's typing on Google."
527.0,Provider,yeah and it sounds like you really like that learning process so that's what's been frustrating for you.
11533.0,Patient,"I don't like it. But I know what i'm used to it, and I know how to do it. yeah don't the class you do your homework and bring it in the morning, but now it's like don't show up the class, and yet the turn your homework in by midnight. Like Whatever happened to waking up and doing it really quick. But they do it by midnight if it's not turned this is like that's even more stressful I think it's if they're going to do this. I think they should just allow everyone to turn in the homework, by the very last day of school, as long as you have every single time turned in with all the tests done. that's it, why is there a deadline, if I don't have to show up this class by there at the show the class, why do I have the tournament by Tuesday."
527.0,Provider,yeah I mean that's a good point.
11533.0,Patient,"You know, like what just turn it in by the end of the Semester songs everything done like a job, as long as you build the house, by the time you're finished. You know you this every week and stop like I guess inspections, I guess, but. that's how I feel if they're going to do this whole online thing if they really want to make it convenient. allow people that time to do finish."
527.0,Provider,"Do you have any accommodations at school, drew for your ADHD that may be something to check into."
11533.0,Patient,"There is there's so many things, but the whole campus is closed, like there's Tutoring areas there's places, you can go."
527.0,Provider,"Well, but you should get like some extensions on time to get stuff done or take. Taking your tests. So. I would reach out."
11533.0,Patient,"Oh, and they have one guy digging extension, but I just gotta catch up and make sure I know what's going on and what's what. yeah and if you don't turn in your. I think if you don't turn anything in. By seven weeks that is automatically drop you so I gotta start turning my stuff in. Okay, five or six or now. All six. Okay. yeah yeah, I think, by the end of this month, I think that's what it's my turn in my coven 19 thing and then. Some compliance sexual harassment homosexual compliance video it's. Okay, most ridiculous thing you've ever seen her life. So I think yeah. So I got a cup I got. Three days I think I think it's. yeah I think it'll be fine I just got a tough job."
527.0,Provider,Okay what's what's your kind of direction today like to get yourself structured and.
11533.0,Patient,"Just do my homework consists. Okay, all you have to do is it's not like homework it's it's the play watch a video and that's why it's art it's like. yeah if I want to do my homework either it's like. You know the YouTube tutorial videos where you're trying to do, like a photoshop edit that's what i'm doing. Okay watching this video it's not like i'm doing it, I can ask the teacher question it's like Oh, how do you do that, and then I look, and I do the same exact thing on the video. But it's not. And I watch it over and over and over and over again i'm i'm Christmas same exact buttons but the literally whatever is popping up and it's things not popping up. So it's like what am I supposed to do it out. yeah he's like you press this button zoom and I precedent nothing's happening. That I heck is. Like questions to ask."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11533.0,Patient,that's what's like imagine doing editing a photoshop graphic. That you've never used this program but you're kind of familiar with it.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11533.0,Patient,"But then it's like, how do you copy and paste and color it and then you watch the steps, and if you missed one step, you can do it. that's where it that's what a thump doing. gosh."
527.0,Provider,yeah very kind of time consuming and tedious work it sounds like.
11533.0,Patient,"yeah this the download program took me three hours. Because, yet that USB. flash drive for the bahram even run and then you have to have everything up to date, the interconnect of your school email and activate it and if anything's wrong in that step it doesn't work. Oh, my God and then you have to have this this thing. plugged into your computer. Okay, or no sound comes out. And that's another like $500. So, luckily I already had all that stuff but like. sure if I did it, it would have taken me three weeks, just to get all of it. And i'm sure if I was at staff at school, I think, probably the same thing it's just time goes by, faster I guess."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11533.0,Patient,"So, since you don't realize that you're there you're in the moment."
527.0,Provider,"So they don't even do any like zoom meetings or anything where you're all together, and you can ask questions and."
11533.0,Patient,"One guy there's so many kids going to school and one classes 310 and that's what i'm wearing for the audio but the guy has so many kids he's teachers actually a photoshop class instead of the audio class. So he does do the live zoom but he does it for a different class and I have to do all the videos asynchronous but asked him a question but he's teaching photoshop. So what that is so weird it's like i'm taking a class with it only teach. What you're learning. But they teach it in different weeks, so what he's teaching now is what i'll learn a week for. So weird it's like I don't want to go backwards. And why why why murder about photoshop phone new audio."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11533.0,Patient,I don't think it's hard i've done it i've already done it a couple times.
527.0,Provider,Sure sure.
11533.0,Patient,To follow the steps to do what they want.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I think that's you know part of it is you know feeling frustrated about it, but this is. This is where schools at right now for you, and so, how do I make the best of it and get myself organized so that I feel. Like i'm you know get staying on track with things so you know I don't know if it's you know, putting appointments you know setting setting your schedule and your phone or you know, making sure that Okay, I have to have this homework done by this time I need to do this, you know."
11533.0,Patient,yeah I think that job. I think I just got us don't ever fall back behind.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah and I think just you know, taking an assignment, you know if it takes you an hour to do it then finish that assignment take a little break. move to the next one, so that you know you're not just like trying to go boom boom boom boom knock them all out, I mean that's the goal, but you know, taking little breaks to so that you can you know catch your breath and just kind of. not think about school for a few minutes and then go to the next assignment kind of regroup for yourself."
11533.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I know you got to get going to class, but I was going to look to see if we have any more appointments scheduled to. cope with. No, we don't, we have to get our October appointment scheduled it looks like so. Does this time in the morning work pretty well for you drew. Or what time works, good for you."
