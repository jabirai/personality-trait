Okay, Dan so if we look at your. start date with us oh June you start was June 19 so June, July August September, so this should be at least 14 so should should have. At least 14 urine drug screening results okay Now I know you move you misha cup and July. Okay, so if we just count here, what we have just. just looking at. All right, let's start from the beginning, so pending let's see if any urine drug screening results are here, did you ever get get your labs and stuff done for us. Yes, all right all right, so it looks like we don't have results on that one, so, if you so many times, if you don't get it done in a month that it sent in to show up later so let's count that off there were no results their their results here. July 2020 days. 1234 looks like this five June 2026 December 2021 you skip January went to February seven looks like eight a march. looks like there's one in nine in April, and then there is to it and so there's one on three for that poor the layup order was collected on August, so how many is that tan. So this 10 year and drug screens overall right do accounting right 1234567 819 okay so 10 so that's not that's not so bad so you've gotten tenure and draw screen out of 14. Okay.
