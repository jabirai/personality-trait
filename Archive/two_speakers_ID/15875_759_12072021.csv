Good so what's been going on how you been since I last talked to you."
15875.0,Patient,"Actually. When I checked my calendar I because i'm supposed to start my periods asleep. But. yeah i've been. Just anxious I also had. a hard time. For me and my resignation, you too, because I actually as much as I like working here i'm pretty burnt out and I noticed a lot of things it comes from here. uh huh because there's I know it's not going to be. there's always gonna be that philosophy culture, but it just those. kind of the success of here I don't know if it's because the people that work here or the personalities, are the fact that we've all just been together during the pandemic or what's going just we're all burnt out we're all over words. it's just i'm I feel anxious coming to work and I just going home and I try that well what am I doing right now. thing, but sometimes the situation but. Just what am I doing right now. yeah so i'll be. i'll try listening to music and I have a fidget toy, which will help me get my mind off the things. But. This new job I think it's going to make this for me to schedule a little bit more spread out i'll be looking for trends anymore, I see working five eight. mm hmm and. They really care about myself."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15875.0,Patient,"Oh there accommodating my commitment song for greater. Good, so I think they will accommodate a service of some."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15875.0,Patient,And then the department i'm going to be in I know we plan. And we respect each other's so it'll be. I think it will be a lot better.
759.0,Provider,"yeah it sounds like it's gonna be a lot more, better for you and your mental health, which is important to have a job that respects mental health, you know who prioritises kind of like your mental health, which is sacred, which is nice. yeah. yeah so you've been having anxiety coming to work, and this is kind of like the same thing as we discussed before just you know thinking about the day thinking about what could happen or might have happened. it's a kind of still doubt when you leave for."
15875.0,Patient,"yeah especially today I. For a simple way that we really did it was because I thought we manifest sample so I messed up there, but finally the doctor didn't really care. Because it sounded like they're able to run the lab work. And you're able to get results, so I had made a little bit ago my. doctor wasn't freaking now and then the other stuff from freaking out, I noticed, I was only one kind of freaking out. Because of the previous. Other previous possible which I tend to hold on to whatever I went through quite a bit I guess. So. I guess. worst case scenario happens at night bodies for referring. Because the. Previous call flow works that. The doctor will actually throw some surprise for you. So I think I have a little bit of. Yes."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15875.0,Patient,"Another good I was. Making a bigger deal than they weren't so I tend to make things as they are, I think, because of that. mm hmm so. I think, just a little bit of a plug in a sense, ptsd have I have some of those people, I have a tendency to overeat. And situations that somebody else's that really reacting to. And I try to let their energy kind of calmed me down but there's always a voices on the background, because the Earth is shouting at me."
759.0,Provider,"Just shouting at you yeah. yeah we can talk about maybe the records of dad you know, like in terms of you know, like when did you first started to notice that she had. You know this kind of like anxious thought kind of like cycle, or do you think is just mostly circumstantial are situational and now are where you think that comes from."
15875.0,Patient,"It seriously circumstantial but then it kind of doubles. Everything. About. In the past or. Just. trigger where a circumstance happens outward and then everything just kind of spiraled from there. I have to somehow quiet. So that's when I typically will play music too loud or play was legit toys. That I have because I noticed last time that my brain was spiraling I have. Something sense, where it wishes, and I like how it switches. And I personally with that and focus on how that felt. Really calmed me down."
759.0,Provider,"that's a little bit of a grounding technique it's just like guys all know where my rockland but basically just holding an object. And, just like you said just seeing how it feels in your hand and playing with that can really ground do some mindfulness technique actually you know something that can help you so i'm glad that you do that that's actually a really good technique to learn to have."
15875.0,Patient,"My panic attacks, I noticed, so it happened some sensory things like the lights were to buy it or sounds or to route and it would become overwhelming, so I figured most of my stuff. Is sensory so feeling something. Probably. freaking out I figured something, something that I like to go with me on. Friday my mind, a little bit. mm hmm so has the remnants of my body just. write it down."
759.0,Provider,"Do you feel anxiety like you mentioned sensory overload with you know light sound different things of that nature do you tend to feel it in your body, you know doesn't manifest physical symptoms."
15875.0,Patient,yeah I feel it might be.
759.0,Provider,feeling your feet you feel.
15875.0,Patient,"Heavy be. insanely and I. yeah I felt the most of my interest and then stresses, and my shoulders and the other."
759.0,Provider,"I. mean you definitely have you know it sounds like generalized anxiety disorder, because he had this more for more than six months right you've been a fan like this for a while."
15875.0,Patient,"yeah I can't remember, I think the earliest, I remember feeling."
759.0,Provider,Your 10 yeah.
15875.0,Patient,yeah. So you had earlier.
759.0,Provider,"And earlier this year, remember yeah i'm wonder, you know, like kind of like learn patterns that you do when you feel anxious, is something that you know it's it's hard to break a pattern in our cycle in terms of how we've been getting what we do in terms of like anxiety goes on. i'm wondering. If kind of i'm not sure sure like which approach to take, because you mentioned stay in the moment was hard for you right. yeah and. i'm trying to think of. Other coping mechanisms for you one, one that comes to mind as thought stopping as another kind of. You know kind of like mental exercise that you do when you want to go to the worst case scenario, or you want to repeat the cycle of worrying about different things it's just simply tell yourself just to stop you know and."
15875.0,Patient,Does that make sense.
759.0,Provider,How you ever heard of that concept thought stopping. yeah. didn't work you ever didn't do it before.
15875.0,Patient,"Then. I was kind of asking myself Why was this planet, when it was because I forgot to take on them, so it should look like. And then. Everything just sign up the phone down. But definitely I tried doing that, before I was medicated work I haven't tried some sort of another. One time invited myself Assad, and then I got their medications that fishing that hope."
759.0,Provider,"Like. I really want to get to kind of like the root cause of like, why do you feel so anxious and maybe we can do, and then our session linear more private setting or do you feel comfortable in a setting for us to go back a little bit to the past."
15875.0,Patient,"Alright, so my our."
759.0,Provider,"mo private setting yeah that's. All yeah yeah so yeah well we'll discuss that we're in more private setting. yeah for right now, like, I want you to yeah do like the little mental exercises to thought stopping for now to help you and this kind of like. You call it brain exercise like you know how we do physical exercise, and we have to keep on doing that, until we train ourselves to be good at running or doing any physical activity, think of like these little mental exercises, just like that training the brain to do something okay. Does that make sense. So yeah Okay, so you know with this thought stopping just telling yourself just to stop in those moments when you want to repeat the cycle going to the worst case scenario, or you want to repeat the cycle just thinking about. The next thing, and you just want to kind of like bring it back to like the Center and just tell yourself, you know stop you know, so I think that might we'll see if that helps. A known thing you can do you know with anxiety it's just to accept the fact that you, you feel anxiety. And stuff the fact that this is happening to me right now and don't try to you know so much as warder the way or just a subset. You know by something like the feeling or emotion bird so violent it to past us and you know the thoughts are just stopped and just remind yourself of that too. yeah. Tell me more about. kind of like you know you're going to new job and you start to job in January right right. yeah Okay, so you start to job new job and in January, and right now you're still working at the current place and you have like anxiety when you come into work, is it just because he knows, going to be a long busy day."
15875.0,Patient,and What that they really are part of it is. Perfectly fine. Everybody back and listen and it's just that thought of what a plan is time for the strings out. hey this desperate need to please everybody. i'm fine. But it's really a lot easier said than done.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15875.0,Patient,Like I want everybody to like. But every.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15875.0,Patient,A lot of times.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15875.0,Patient,So all those things.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. So i'll justine's compiling yeah and do you feel like you're a little bit of a perfectionist a low incomes work. Yes, very much so. yeah like you want everything to go smoothly, you know perfectly you know, like and no hiccups yeah. yeah and you want people like you, you know, on. Do you trust yourself. Trust yourself, you know I only ask that question because sometimes you know when we feel as though, like we're trying to get things perfect sometimes trusting ourselves that things. You know, will work out the way that they're supposed to and allowing ourselves to feel that way or think that way can go a long way, you know so maybe we can talk about trusting yourself and preacher sessions as well. i'm just writing down. yeah yeah. Why do you feel the need to be you know, like like by other people."
15875.0,Patient,"Right. I never. About somebody's. not really to me. Because a lot of times like I still have to be in that person's life so i'll have to talk to that person second person third person certain people were. I mean I don't care is situational but still like there's that little like whoa I should be nicer To them I want them to like me in the back of my head or something like that. I think a lot of it was because and maybe it's because i'm a lot as a kid and. I was bullied quite a bit, as I said."
759.0,Provider,yeah you may.
15875.0,Patient,Have around.
759.0,Provider,Your dad was number around to yeah so you little bullied as you bullied as a kid yeah moved around a lot. yeah so it's hard to make those. connections with other people.
15875.0,Patient,yeah and if i'm still having a hard time connecting.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. So kind of like even your adult life or finance difficult to make those connections. yeah. or something more to dive into dive into the past, a little bit more. What time, are you usually done let's work."
15875.0,Patient,"On Monday, seriously that off at."
759.0,Provider,434 30 okay. So you must work early in the morning really early in the morning. 6am oh wow yeah do you want to do your dairy sessions a little bit later so that it's a more private setting you might feel a little bit more comfortable.
15875.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good and how is, let me see what I have available for next week okay. How about what time do you usually get home."
15875.0,Patient,depends on traffic but.
759.0,Provider,"636 and 630 Okay, do you want to do my last appointment, the day would be I could do 630 actually since this 30 minute sessions so i'll put you in for next we December, the 14th at 630. yeah in the meantime, I want you to you know, like. Some of the central themes of things is is just going back to kind of like when you started to feel anxious when kind of like the onset was and just going back to kind of like. Learning some thinking patterns with anxiety as well you know, so I like to do some more a deeper dive into the past, you know, in terms of you, you know how you're feeling today how it affects you today okay. In the meantime, keep on doing what you're doing as far as listening to music like you know what works well for you to bring yourself, you know the Congress of down. Do you fidget toy, you know, like practice on one you know, focusing on one object and just focusing on that and how that makes you feel in the moment. If you can you know after work or beef you seems like you get up so early in the morning, so you probably don't want to draw on the morning that's probably not practical I mean sounds like you're tired when you get home right 10 hour days. you're super tired. You probably just want to be agile and go to sleep after after that, but on your days off like Fridays are your day off right. What do you think of like self care things you can do you know, like on Fridays, even if it's. kind of like relaxation thing that she doing like maybe walking or going to a Park, or it can be going somewhere engaging with people on something of that nature some type type of self care routine that you can do on your days off okay. yeah. yeah any last thoughts or words. Okay, all right, well, it was good to see you today and we'll get your scheduling and everything worked out and we'll do weekly sessions and next week we'll talk okay. Okay. Nice talking to you today."
15875.0,Patient,Thank you.
