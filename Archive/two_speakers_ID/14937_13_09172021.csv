13.0,Provider,"OK. So the group is on Fridays at 11 you got that part right and. So the medicine, did I put you on, let me see, let me open up your chart. you've been taking."
14937.0,Patient,"i've been taking two Now let me tell you. i'm i've been calling this week I know you're busy and got a, I guess, a lot of people. I don't I feel like i'm kind of a. Strange standoff. I have my regular doctors for my blood pressure, etc, and I was talking to him I loaded he's you know, he asked me what the hell is this suboxone right, why are you what are you doing and. I was talking to him about I kind of don't mind it it's not to taste as horrible horrible but i'm mobile and i'm a mo i'm all right i'm all right until I went back to work, Tuesday, when I really started having to have my cases. i'm in pain i'm in pain my next was like my head is going to roll off like a there's a giant fist at the nape it's, the only thing it's not really working on he's whatever you gave me for night the. The first thing that's allowed me to sleep at night it works."
13.0,Provider,i'm so glad.
14937.0,Patient,"i'm so glad by waiter in it the first two nights really know I got a little tired, but I was up within like two hours. Second night nothing third night I accidentally took a whole one I was taking my meds that night I slept all the way through, I thought wait a minute, so the next day I took a home sleeping at night and i'm not waking up crying again."
13.0,Provider,"Okay. So whatever whatever you can do if it's massage acupuncture whatever you can do to address the neck pain. Then that's that's what you need to do, I can't give you more medicine it doesn't make sense to be giving you more medicine so. you're going to have to address the added pain, however else you."
14937.0,Patient,"know how to why not a fentanyl patch of time released for the week, why not a patch according to I mean I again I don't really I don't want to be offensive to anybody um but I. I came under the the total guys have pain management and honesty and it was until afterwards they said Oh, we only do this and it's I don't want to knock it because it's the bottoms not that bad um. it's really not that bad i'm dad got sick one time, not having pain pills it's just a pain is kicking and it's it's a freaking tight, I do have a 10s unit, I have multiple. streams foam pain relief gel phones bio freeze etc and it's just not working, and when I talked to my doctor, he said, to talk to you because apparently owns a box, I signed a waiver and I did. That he said a fentanyl patch is safe to coincide with the suboxone."
13.0,Provider,it's it's a while I didn't know about safe but.
14937.0,Patient,"it's not a pill going to my liver, which I really don't want."
13.0,Provider,"Right so fentanyl is an ultra short acting and the patches are made to distribute the medicine, a little bit at the time. But you can't take you can't take the buprenorphine is on the receptors the opioid receptors in the fentanyl won't get on the receptor because in do anything because it's occupied by buprenorphine. So the other doctor just doesn't understand how the receptors are acting."
14937.0,Patient,"yeah he's not a pain doctor and he's not a subject or some maybe right. So there's just nothing that I could do topical. For me, I just feel this big between the top of my head and the top of my shoulders I like dad i'm looking like this um. we're doing hot towels my husband, we use the microwave and keep doing hot towels and then i'll do a little cold and while i'm using the towels or if i'm in water it's totally realized, I can just lay there and lay back, but I can't live in water."
13.0,Provider,"Yes, it's a dilemma."
14937.0,Patient,"So what do I do, I mean i'm just asking for help, because now, I mean I I like this stuff isn't really bad I don't think it's that bad I just don't know what to do, because i'm still this is, I mean it's it's shitty paint I got operations coming up to me, what do we do."
13.0,Provider,"You do what you have to do you. Use the hot cold packs you get a massage you get acupuncture you do the stretching you you look at you know what it is that you're thinking when this pain develops, because some of it. is stripped attention. Of what you're thinking, and if you know if you're not you got to be talking to the therapist about what you're making what your mind is getting up to what because your body reflects which Mike is. It has no choice that's."
14937.0,Patient,All it doesn't mind body and soul.
13.0,Provider,So. Whatever happened when you went back to work in that stress there's no pill for that there's no. there's no while that can. address that.
14937.0,Patient,Why not.
13.0,Provider,So just isn't.
14937.0,Patient,"Just being facetious i'm sorry oh yeah yeah I know I know, most of it, I go I really don't know anything I just know that this stuff isn't bad I don't want to say I don't want survives on because it's worth. appears to be working for me i'm not sick i'm not pooping i'm lucid i'm okay and i'm sleeping at night, from whatever that medicine is you gave me the first time, out of all the pills i've ever had that i'm able to sleep at night but it's not how you directed directed it in half."
13.0,Provider,"No, for I said. I did not. It says one PO at hs one tablet at night that's how it was directed."
14937.0,Patient,Maybe I read it incorrectly sorry.
13.0,Provider,It doesn't matter if you're taking.
14937.0,Patient,"Directly networking, I am taking it right, I guess."
13.0,Provider,Okay. So I will write you some. buprenorphine that will get you. To next week. And meanwhile you're going to have to get an appointment with Quinn if you're. into therapy because. you've got to be doing that you got to be understanding what what your minds getting up to and.

14937.0,Patient,"I don't need a graph I just need you to talk to me that's all I need I don't know what the hell, I need."
13.0,Provider,"Well you're you're mostly out of pain. Mostly, except when you went back to work that's a great clue I mean if that. that's like such. Important information something you're thinking about work is causing you neck pain so. That that's what you have to be with the therapist about."
