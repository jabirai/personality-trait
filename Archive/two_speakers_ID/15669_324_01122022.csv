15669.0,Patient,But I was going to tell you that. Instead of prescribing the 220s in the 10 maybe I don't take the 10 I just take the 220s so you can stop seeing a prescription for the 10 milligrams.

15669.0,Patient,me tell you that.
324.0,Provider,I remember. 14.
15669.0,Patient,"Okay it's just the 220s another this past time but usually, when I have my brother go pick it up for me it's the 20s and the 10 and i'm like I don't want to keep putting a prescription on file when i'm not taking the 10 it's just the 227 so. Still still bottles."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, my question is, though, is my name on it prescription because i'm going to show you what i've done. Okay. yeah. I put the first one in here that's not a prescription that's just hearing what you were on. And then, right here is where I said 20 milligram tablets tablets."
