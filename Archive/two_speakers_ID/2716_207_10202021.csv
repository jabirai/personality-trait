Jeff was on his way to work and I was at work. And then, when the COPs left, I guess, it was all over stolen bike in them to jump in some kid. And then, when the COPs left the people that own the bike was their kids bike for over here yelling at aiden. And then, our neighbor upstairs was in a specialty on them, you know I said, good I said everything that he's been doing wrong is finally catching up to them it's just like last Saturday. I had my bank card with my whole check on it and jeff's whole check was on in his wallet so there's almost $2,000 in his wallet. And you can go on to just bone and see him because his checks are downloaded to cash out and made him like 10 minutes before this happened said oh dad you have $830. And, just like yeah that's my paycheck and it's going towards bills and here like maybe 2025 minutes later I go to get cigarettes and go to get jeff's wallet and the wall it's gone and I know where I laid it The night before. And we go looking all over the House and Jeff was saying well i'm not going to cancel the card i'm gonna wait for somebody to use it, so we get them on camera at the store using it, and then i'm pressing charges. And then I made up something I said yeah well my bank cards in there, too, so there's a federal feds and he don't know no better. And I said there's a theft, and I was like just let it be dumb and use it, we knew a bunch of young and then like 10 minutes later miraculously the wallet appeared in my road pocket. That I just took off I knew it wasn't in a row, because I had my soapbox into my pocket and like literally five minutes before this happened, I took my robe off I picked. I took my pill out of my pocket and put it in my mouth, so I know, there was no wallet that's how I know, there was no wallet my route, so I just recently took the pill out of my pocket I put it in my mouth."
