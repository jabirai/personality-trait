383.0,Provider,"Okay, great. Have any questions for me."
17241.0,Patient,um do you think therapy will help.
383.0,Provider,"I think it does help. People um. You know people have different and some similar problems, some people, because their problems are very, very long standing and. It generally sometimes can take longer, but it depends on the person, you know how receptive they are how how ready, they are for change and so forth, and other people feel better right away. And sometimes if you know it's also based can be based on the connection between the therapist and the the client. You know if it's a kind of a fit and if you feel heard if you feel listened to and attended to that's really important in selecting a therapist to work with. But yeah i've seen people make. amazing change and i've seen people kind of struggle with change and so it's kind of a, but it is helpful and research has found that. therapy and medication, if one needs medication is more beneficial than just medication so yeah."
17241.0,Patient,"I think, and it helps with anxiety as well."
383.0,Provider,yeah learning tools to for you to cope with your own anxiety or reduce your own anxiety on your own. I work with people and give them homework and and it's important to do the homework in between appointments so that you are gradually implementing coping skills for yourself to do on your own when you're out in the world or your with yourself.
17241.0,Patient,Sorry.
383.0,Provider,Did you have any other suggestion.

17241.0,Patient,Think it's with. Maybe Dominique. Is it with Dominique. And it's for anxiety and depression.
383.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, so the group of. People a lot of people really like the group's. You see this, you see similar people every week, people like yourself people very different from yourself, but you kind of realize you're not really alone in. how you feel and how you know certain life stressors and just being in the presence of others, even if it's online it feels good people like that, for the most part. there's some people that don't want to be in group but, for the most part, people enjoy being in the group and you learn something you get a chance to hear what other how other people are dealing with it and you learn something from the therapist that's leading the group so."
17241.0,Patient,And are you forced to talk.
383.0,Provider,"No, you are encouraged yeah you're invited to share when you're ready, but generally in the beginning, people know you're never forced to talk at least i'd never force anybody in my group, I. will be a check in so usually people check in how are you doing how's your week how have you been there'll be a general check in and and and we do encourage people to participate in that.
