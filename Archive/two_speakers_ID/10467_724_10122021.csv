10467.0,Patient,yeah okay hear me.
724.0,Provider,awesome yep absolutely. So what's going on.
10467.0,Patient,That too much man just in our own this whole time. yeah and i'm trying to you know i'm trying to build up the motivation and go back to work and ship and it's not killing it right now I mean.
724.0,Provider,"You haven't been back to work, since the Court."
10467.0,Patient,"I haven't been back to work, since my dad got coated in me."
724.0,Provider,Oh OK OK. didn't know that.
10467.0,Patient,"there's plenty of work, you didn't mean works on the issue, I just don't want to line up I don't want. i've been telling my dad that's a lineup any big contracts, because you know I don't want to line them up and then. You know I know we got people that if we really needed to they could cover us and chip but. I just. want to tell my dad you know after you got out the hospital and shit. You know, to take it easy focus that shoe that she was really serious you know. And I told him, you know understand because he's been working the past two weeks, like half days I pour our days and cheap and I guess he's still recovering you can tell now like. is still recovering from from covidien Shin all the side effects that uh that yet. But I told him I just live live man, you know, this should be a reality check, you know, for you, and not just for you, but for all of us and. You know me and me and all my brothers and my dad were super close you know, and I told him I was like I understand you want to make money, but I was like thank you, I got you know I kept I kept it 100 with him, you know I kept a solid would have. Really, you got money, so I told him I was like no be not I got money and i'm pretty young was like you know my money don't compare to my dad's money. And I was telling him I was like look man we're blessed we're in a position to where we're not even tripping over money like at all, like in a mean like he can go the rest of the year, without working no problem he'll still got plenty of money. For next year and ship but. I told him I was like look I understand you know you want to get back to work, and you want to get back into the flow of things like you know. pretty much get back on schedule, you know it back into the repetition and being used to want to work and getting up early every day, and you know going in and building jobs, and you know. Sending emails sending proposals and voice fucking invoices. And like I said in line up George it, but I told him I was like if you are pretty much tell them. You know. As sick, as you just work when he was in the yard at home and and I I told my appreciate that you know you want to be motivated and everything in work, these half days, but I told me it's way too soon as like I was like you know. I pretty much song you can't make money if you're dead, you know, like."
724.0,Provider,To spend it if you're not around.
10467.0,Patient,"It for sure I mean, are you supposed to make money and spend money you know the most, the most important thing is, you know for him to take care of itself. You know I feel bad that i'm not there with him every day because you know we don't live together, but you know we work we work together, every day, you. But ever since."
724.0,Provider,"It is that enough is that enough of a motivation for you to get back to work, and maybe try to offset him since. I got a feeling that your dad is probably a super hard worker he didn't get to where he was by taking the easy route he's probably real stubborn I don't want to listen to his son tell him what he should be doing he probably knows what he's supposed to be doing but. You know old timers with a strong work ethic man they're just as equally stubborn and hard headed and all those things but that's how they got to where they you know where they are now. You may not be able to talk him out of that situation just probably in his bones to be like that not me, but what you could do is maybe. take some of the load off of him, since he ain't gonna do it on his own maybe maybe that should be a little bit of a motivation for you to get back to it, too, because you're struggling with wanting to go back. that's one option. He won't do it for themselves so anyway, he chewed up to go on run some interference, even if he doesn't know that's what you're doing just kind of take the burden off of my little bit."
10467.0,Patient,"No yeah definitely and and I agree that's honestly, the only thing. Like i'm pretty much torn you know, like i'm not i'm not feeling like i'm not trying to go back to work, like emotionally and mentally i'm just not just not having it right now, you know. there's the time and that's how I am I, my family hates it, you know my girlfriend he my friends understand it, because my friends are understanding is in direct goals and I understand my parents who girls my girls and adult but it's different. it's just different like the perspective and that my dad has a perspective that my girl has, as far as like you know my life, and you know. pretty much work. And just. yeah like my friends, is it would be a little bit more understanding to like why I don't want to go back to work, but again i'm torn and I agree. I agree hundred percent like the only reason why, even when I go back to work, even though I don't feel like it like at all is for my dad you know I mean because that's you know we were really what I mean We work very well together, you know any mean my key. He has the experience I mean I have experienced with my experience doesn't doesn't compare it isn't all and you know he's fast, you know. at certain trades that that I can humbly admit I don't have to speak but. mom pretty fucking fast, you know, compared to like you know my dad and you're right, you know my dad. Is a very hard worker he's very stubborn, I mean that's where I get that's where I get my my personality from pressures from my dad you know we're so much alike, that you know we we argue and we butt heads all the time, but. You know, at the end of the day we we know what's important and that's family and that's you know just seven a. really strong bond in it, I mean like an unbreakable bond like that's what my dad always instilled in us as we were kids and shit, and I mean. I can, I can admit you know my dad didn't always do it the best way not that my dad, you know as like how a photo or no, because he really lesson, but just certain things like now that I think back in and then like i'm so used to doing. And i'm so used to the. Difference pretty much like the LIFE lessons and Mike the values that were taught that to me my tool to better my two younger brothers two younger brothers going to that, I think that shits normal but I mean you know i'm i'm intelligent enough to know that that she doesn't like."
724.0,Provider,"Well it's your normal you know what I mean like it's it's what you were raised on it's your perspective so it's your normal it's abnormal to other people, and something i'm sure some of their behaviors. The things that you're comparing yours your history up against might seem like that's what what the norm is supposed to be, but maybe it's not you know what I mean maybe maybe that's the abnormal thing it's all about perspective. times."
10467.0,Patient,and good good.
724.0,Provider,"I was gonna say I can see why, like you know you're not motivated to go back to work, too, so on top of like you know your dad stuff you definitely got a bunch of stuff on your end too, but you know I would advocate that. Why don't you do half days you know what I mean like the more you, you know, the more you sit in that House and you see stagnant with your thoughts and stuff like that, like that you know I know you're depressed. You know, you could just bury yourself in a hole, you know it probably benefit you to get out a little bit. Go preoccupy your mind with something that you're good at you know what I mean, so you can be on autopilot but it's not going to control. Like your whole day maybe just ease back into you gotta do man because. What you don't want to do is get stuck in that holding pattern where you're hanging out the House man like it's not going to improve your mental health, you get a lot of. A lot of negative energy right like in that place there, right now, so maybe we're going to pitch you're getting out a little bit."
10467.0,Patient,"I agree i'm, in my opinion, who knows, maybe I am depressed I don't I don't think I am depressed I know i'm like I met a real fucking Oh, right now, but you know i've been depressed before and I know that feeling like i'm close but i'm not depressed you know."
724.0,Provider,"Where you're teetering you know what I mean like you're probably close whatever, whatever your threshold is. I don't think hanging out at the House and not and not getting back to what you're good at getting back to like interacting with people and your family and your dad like you know what I mean. You know you're like one bad day away from like you know just nosedive and per se, so my encouragement is always when people start to like feel down low and. is to get out go outside go for a run work out, you know reconnect with people like force yourself to do the things that you really don't feel like doing right now. But you got to get out of like the phone you know because it's easy to to. stay home, and when you have the luxury and you've got the the financial means to do it, you don't have that extra pressure, you know what I mean so it's even more of a pitfall I just don't want to see you get stuck. So yeah I mean I would encourage you to get out a little bit, even if it's a couple times a week just get back try to get back in the swing and preoccupied today a little bit were a couple other things other than what you've been doing what I mean like you need a win that's for sure. So."
10467.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yes, I appreciate it. yeah I think. I think I need to just go out my girl somewhere, you know I mean I."
724.0,Provider,"Do a date night or go catch a movie I don't know where you live, or what what there's the to do down where you're at you know but. Go to a game I don't know if the baseball so going on the red SOx just went won their division so they're moving on up, so I don't know what's going on on the west coast for baseball but."
10467.0,Patient,it's probably.
724.0,Provider,will help you get out.
10467.0,Patient,"yeah i'd have to check the other scheduling everything. i'm saying, as far as like baseball I like i'm not I haven't even been paying attention to any sports like you know I love certain sports, you know, like I love football, I like basketball school and then I mean I like it baseball's cool I like it. But I just haven't even been focused on and he's rewards are."
724.0,Provider,On the same we're. On the same way.
10467.0,Patient,"yeah I just. I just got a certain habits and breaking shit like you know when i'm not feeling good i'm just. I just push like everybody away and like I said, my my girlfriend hates it, I guess, when I do that, like I won't answer anybody's calls I won't answer anybody's text like. Like i'll reply to somebody text like a week later anatomy like that's how much i'm not yeah that's how much i'm not motivated to be on my phone and. But uh yeah I think I think it would be a good idea if I I don't know about tomorrow, but as I could have went to work today, I could go to work tomorrow but. i'll try to go to work right like. there's a Friday and Saturday, if not, you know next week's a new week, and again I, I just want to push myself to it."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah I mean. You know don't go 110% into it, you know where where you're acting like the pendulum where you're going from one extreme to the other, you know I mean like like swing into easy, even if you just. On Wednesday, would say Monday even off on Wednesday you just get up like the normal time you would go to work walk into the office see your old man if he's there. push some paper around is sit down and we're like, whatever your, whatever your office and your routine was get up, it was like stopping local coffee shop just kind of go through the paces of as if you're going to go to work and then just get to the point to where. You should start the project and then leave you know what I mean like. Work your way back in there, like this go in there be casual just see what's going on hang out shoot the shit kind of get out of the get some sunlight. You know kind of get a little distraction, and then see what happens with the rest of the definitely don't start working, but like push on paper around you know. check some voicemails do some administrative stuff some light duty that's what you would call light duty go back to light duty for a little bit just for a couple of days kind of get back into the routine. That you do I get I get wanting to like disconnect and nicely and. Do like a pseudo comfort zone but but it's trapped in a long term with the trap now."
10467.0,Patient,"It is attracting that's what I was saying earlier, you know, I have certain habits and I need a break and. I don't know why i'm like that i've been like that, since like my uncle my uncle Mike he died, and I was like 14 that's like when I started having problems sleeping like insomnia, and like I go I go like two three sometimes four days without sleeping. And you know I tried melatonin tries, the low and no. Oh no, I know I know sleep is super important, and I know till unhealthy that are not getting that much sleep but."
724.0,Provider,it's really no.
10467.0,Patient,I just with everything going on and again i'm not trying to bring up anything negative or not.
724.0,Provider,"Oh were you and I just here talking some shit I mean that's that's all it is it's not positive not negative just life, sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad and we're just having a conversation about. turbulent times."
10467.0,Patient,"yeah I agree, I agree. To man having a having a intellectual conversation about life and problems and obstacles and finding solutions. nope you know."
724.0,Provider,that's all it's about really.
10467.0,Patient,"You know. Again there's certain just habits, I need to you know what plenty of sessions to go over a bunch of shit you know throughout my life. To pretty much I mean what. pretty much the parts of my life, like in in my childhood and growing up. Certain experiences. From my past like why, like, I want to know why they left such an impression on me and why pretty much think away, thank you, and I mean, because I, you know I keep telling you like, I have all of these habits that. In my opinion, or not healthy but."
724.0,Provider,They got you through.
10467.0,Patient,"I don't view it that way, and then I mean like."
724.0,Provider,"What their habits that got you to that point in time, in your life so like when we talk about you know when a therapist or Dr talks about like a coping skill. Like really what they're just talking about is like things that you've done to get through traumatic events in your life so like major life events you're talking like financial ruin relationship breakups. breakups with your friends, you know people that died when your dog dies, you know what I mean like so like when a major life event and if you're younger you don't really have. The knowledge or understanding of how to process the event and especially when you're a kid and you like you blue stuff it's like the idea of death being finite. is very ambiguous, who are young young person's mind because they can't really wrap their head around what that means. You know, for a lot of people, just like Oh, that person is not here anymore, but like what does that really mean like like the long term impact of not having that person around it's like. Oh yeah now they're not going to see me my graduation. Now they're not going to walk their daughter down the aisle or their wedding now they're not going to see the grant united me like in all these things that we learned, as we get older like holy shit like the impact is a lot more than you thought then. And then the coping strategy that you had back then that's your baseline someone in the event something like that certainly happens again your default is well this is how I reacted. And i'm going to stick with this for a little while and then you might pivot a little bit because you're like I don't like how this makes me feel or to try something different, and then that becomes your new baseline and you just experienced. These these these techniques or tactics every time of life is like that happens, and hopefully it's productive and a lot of times it's, not because we just don't have all the information of the time of the event. And then, as we get older and we're like Okay, you know, the way that you process like your uncle passing at 14 is, if you had to relive that with the knowledge that you have now you would you would do things totally different."
10467.0,Patient,You know I mean but absolutely you didn't be did at the time of with with the information that you had and that's that's what life is.
724.0,Provider,"You know I mean it's about making the best informed decision that you can have the time having the right people in place having the right people looking out for you. And, and hopefully you learned like a valuable lesson and then what happens again your default is that and then just move forward. And like manage it a little bit better and that's all it is you just a little bit better a little bit better a little bit better every time, but if your default is like. I would draw out to get back to people, you know what I mean like that's what you did when you were younger, because even though house and management so it's like. What are you going to do, different now you've been through in the past. Four weeks you've been through like a lot of shit you know what I mean in the past 60 days, been through like a lot of lot of shit. stuff with your dad stuff with your roommates stuff with the legal shit you know what I mean like So what are you gonna do about it, like are you going to deal with the what a 14 year old Jason would do, are you going to do with how old you are, but like you know, a 20 southern to. Jason yeah what's a 27 year old Jason going to do what all this shit because these are heavy things, these are heavier than just a single event, you you got back the back the back shit going on, so like what are you gonna do."
10467.0,Patient,"i'm gonna you know what I what I think is the right thing to do is just to keep being open about it, even though, as difficult as it as it is being like. You know, like i'm sure you can imagine, you know Boston i'm not sure you live in Boston but you're telling me about Massachusetts and I haven't messed. That."
724.0,Provider,I live close enough.
10467.0,Patient,"Right yeah. I got I got a buddy who Kenny, one of the Dudes who actually remember, I was saying that story last Thursday about how I pretty much got into. opioid and heroin and I moved to one of my friends from San Diego pickers his mom messaged me asking if I do that favorite remember. yeah well they're from there from I don't know if they're from Boston but they're definitely from Massachusetts and they're the reason why I, like the red SOx unit, I mean they're, the ones who put me on to the red SOx. I like I like the River river cats but that's the minor leagues right and even the major so. Lisa kind of."
724.0,Provider,The call SOx to. Rhode island.
10467.0,Patient,"yeah you know and that's why I gotta fucking clean as Mitchell an s fucking. it's like a whole stitched Boston red SOx Jersey it's it's Hella dope and I got to have to go I barely where is. It I mean it means that much to me it's just because I haven't cared enough to even watch sports, you know I mean but. Going back to that question, you know what would you know 27 year old Jason do just try to be a little bit and try to talk about it as much as I can, because. You know I keep I keep going back to the fact like you know I got these bad habits, one of my bad habits, is not just pushing people away when i'm in need and when i'm hurting. In enemy because i'm just used to fucking koeppen was it like right now it's been like a domino effect like I really feel like in life is testing me right now, you know I mean like. it's not necessarily like God because i'm a religious unit, I mean like I grew up Catholic and. And shit, and again I don't go to church I haven't been to church in years but you know that's not what religion is about anybody that knows anything about religion it's. it's the one person's own individual bomb, you know with with Jesus or with God, and I mean like it doesn't matter going to church doesn't necessarily make you. A good person, just like going to prison just like went to prison doesn't necessarily make you a bad person, you know I mean i'm sure there's a bunch of rapists and pedophiles who go to church every Sunday you get me."
724.0,Provider,"started on the Catholic Church man, so I mean like I know what you're saying."
10467.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just saying like. i'm Catholic and i'm very proud to be kind of thinking shit i'm just saying like. I don't need to go to church to make it seem like i'm a good person thing and again going back to those bad habits like i'm used to just keeping everything in and not talking about it with anybody i've been doing this for. Over a decade, almost two decades, and then I mean that's how I deal with it, but thinking back on where that gabi and how that made me feel as a teenager you know going up in my. adolescent stage in an amine like that she didn't do anything positive for me if anything's herbie. And again i'm so used to as a child as a teenager i'm so used to keeping it inside, even though i'm hurting nobody's going to ever know why because. I have an unhealthy habit of never sharing how I feel and people see that in the group in I mean I don't try to portray that shit, and I mean I try to hold it in like when i'm talking to the group. But is there, certain when i'm when i'm up for fucking two three days, and you know i'm all these native thing all these negative. Things keep happening, like a domino effect over and over and over again, you know, again, what can I do to make this situation better because, in my opinion, the average person. You know, we definitely fold like in this circumstance, and you know i'm not 100% sure that's my opinion but i'm pretty fucking sure like a normal normal as person that has an experience anything i've experienced. So I. would definitely be folding right now, meaning like. Giving up. And depressed and. And and just horrible thoughts that are thinking. You mean like again like. i'm just so used to like death in like. Like I don't fear death at all like, and I wouldn't lie to you chuck I mean one on one I don't fucking fear death I don't and I go looky looky straight in the eyes and say I don't fear, but that doesn't mean that I wanted, I absolutely not I cherish my life. And I value I don't fear death, but I value my life and I cherish you so much because. I know i'm a very talented young man I you know the sky's the limit was mean, and I mean like i'm a fucking dope ass artists, I used to do tattoos I was Hella good. And then I mean like there's so many little hobbies that i'm into like I like painting I like going and getting camus's from michael's like just a bunch of shit that somebody that grew up the way I grew up. You wouldn't expect that they have that say mean i'm just used to death unit, I mean like one of my best friends were my homies from my head. That I grew up with one of my Asian partners vz he got shot four times I think like two months ago you got shot twice the chest and twice in the stomach and. You know I mean like my instinct like. The first thing that i'm like pretty much the first thing that comes to my mind, and like people hitting me up like I want to go slide I want to go help my time now, I want to make sure. It didn't mean I wanted to you know I want to go, make sure my plan is good, and I want to make sure that people pay for what they did, and I mean, but I know just from my past experiences that i'm very lucky, not to be not to be in prison or dead in, and I mean and. fucking. accounts, there are the. accounts or add before you came I don't know if you ever met her. And she was yeah amy she was part of our group i'm not sure if you ever met her."
724.0,Provider,A couple times.
10467.0,Patient,"He was cool and she did me a fucking solid as favorite around like she wrote a letter a letter to the judge like telling the germs like i'm the reason why, like. pretty much it's just a built in built in safety mechanism, like the reason why I always feel like I need to have a gun on me. And that's just from past trauma. In it I mean like she was breaking it down to like these are certain signs of ptsd like you know i'm not out committing a crime, I didn't get cognitive gun in accessory to. committing a crime to home invasion robbery grant them to I didn't brandish a firearm I didn't you know flash it on someone I didn't discharge it know the crime on being charged with is the firearm itself even saying like. possession yeah you know which, which is bullshit because I don't even want to get into it's just it's not my fault, I was born in California, if I would have been born in Arizona fucking free state. This wouldn't even be a charge unit, I mean it's not a gun that was stolen it's illegal fucking gun in it, I mean that was in my brother's name. So again, like I don't know I just it's a series of unfortunate events, but I just learned take it on the chin and keep rolling with the punches but i'm doing my best to learn from these experiences, but these."
724.0,Provider,"are most certainly are, the more you talk about so this is where this is where the 27 year old Jason starts to to deviate from the 14 year old. Right, so what you're doing now is you're being more open than you used to be you're exploring your feelings, a little bit more you're allowing other people total strangers, you know what I mean file by. file accounts on this group to gain some personal insight into who you are you're sharing like tremendous information about yourself and you're giving. useful information to others, to help them get through their shape because they're all they're all going through their own thing we all are, you know what I mean so. These are all positive things that you're doing, and the only time that you're going to know that this is the right thing. Is a next time something like that happens years down the road you're going to be like oh shit because this. Every day that you've been going through this is building your new strategy your new coping techniques, we don't see it that way, until you have to apply it down the road you know what I mean so that."
10467.0,Patient,make sense.
724.0,Provider,"To me, and what you said about like being into art and creativity, all that kind of stuff. You know my hope is that you lead into that So if you are going to stay home, and if you are going to withdraw a little bit from people. Because that's your thing first off try not to just trying is enough to change that thought process second. If you're going to stay home and not do shit you might as well lean into that creativity, if you got it. You know, express yourself if you're not ready to do it 100% with your words or would people do it in your art, you know I always had to be people that have the artistic brain. Because I don't have it, I can't create shit you know what I mean, so the people that can and they don't use it it's like. you're robbing the universe, have a gift that very few people have you know it's it's a form of intelligence and not everybody has intelligence, not everybody can throw a curveball or a knuckleball So if you can do it then do it man, because people want to see it. And even if they don't people still want to see it, you know if they don't want to admit it so lean into these things as as a way to escape some of your thought process give yourself some. Some healthy mental distractions because you've got you got the talent, you know I mean, then you should use it a little bit to your benefit doesn't have to be anything crazy, but like. Go to michaels by a couple campuses see what happens what's the worst that could happen you're out of 40 bucks on some bullshit canvas. And some acrylic paint whatever you know what I mean so it's like do these things, you know, these will all help build that reinforce that strategy that you're developing right now the leaving the things you don't necessarily want to do, but try a little bit. that's my recommendation."
10467.0,Patient,"yeah I agree with your recommendation for sure, and I appreciate it, I just need to make a step in. This step forward and actually actually doing it. Again, you know I don't mind spending $100 on supplies to me it's number. Right you mean like. There was one thing that amy was telling me and I. don't mean to keep her shoes, and I mean like she was really cool I mean like. she gave me how like she was super lenient with me because she knew like. Like with me with my surveys and like with me like missing meetings and she's like that she knew it wasn't carelessness she just had a lot of insight about me in my life yeah. And again i'm not making an excuse it doesn't mean it's okay to miss meetings, and so I do my best and. i've been doing the surveys and shit hopefully i'm all the way, caught up with my surveys by the time Thursday comes around, but I know i'm not going to be able to do the little the drug testing yeah because that shoots out my brother's house in it, I mean I live in. Like in Alberta with me and my girl and her at our House."
724.0,Provider,So do we need to send the test to a new address.
10467.0,Patient,"No i'd rather just keep on him, you know my old address because I just you know retraining you it's just I just don't really want nobody to know man, I mean. That goes that goes back to like. You know, certain habits, I need a break like it's not even paranoid it's just like i'm part of."
724.0,Provider,The call it hypervigilance.
10467.0,Patient,"yeah for sure you know i'm not paranoid, I just have learned to carry myself a certain way, and I mean like when I pull up to a red light. I, I have to look around me, I have to look over both of my shoulders because. It I mean like I would if somebody says pulls up but isn't pull up all the way at the light, and it goes on the window and i'm not paying attention and bandages shoot in the back of the head neck pain and I know that sounds like. No, no."
724.0,Provider,"You know what I do. tires and pavement you've heard of tires and pavement anytime I pull up behind a car if if you can see the car in front of us tires touching the payment that means you can turn. out from behind them either right or left you can break away tires and pavement. If you can't see their tires such in the payment there's no way you're going to get out from behind them in a last minute ditch effort if you get a bounce. I do the same thing military training combo training it's like if you're cruising and you're in a line. I don't see their tires on you don't see their payment tire such that payment you can't turn and you're stuck you're essentially traps. You know so that's a piece of advice that I tell everybody and it's like like even my girlfriend she's driving I was like keep a distance beyond tires and payment. That they're stopped up ahead of me I saw I saw breaking way early and I boom I see it, i'm like i'm good to go, I do I do I do a three point check all the time. Mira Mira Mira Mira Mira, all the time, you know what I mean so it's like. And that's just to avoid like they give somebody like speed and up on me and i'm like oh shit I gotta like move away cuz I don't wanna get rid of you know what I mean like it doesn't even have to be like worst case scenario, but."
10467.0,Patient,"yeah exactly. And I want to be aware of my surroundings. that's literally instilled in me and I don't think i'll ever change honestly it doesn't matter how much I worked on it it's not necessarily a bad thing. Because again my my intentions are pure and then I mean they truly are, and again I wouldn't like my intentions were to be out here fucking people Overdoing grimy shit. Robbing people befriended people just look them over fucking people's bitches, and I mean. Excuse my language, but you know but that's not that's not who I am you know I mean believe in, I have, I have the capability absolutely I have the power, but it's not who, I am as a person, and I mean i'm not a bully i've always you know i've been getting into so many fights my whole life. I can choke and then I mean like i'm sick of fighting i'm good at it, but i'm sick of a in a in I don't enjoy hurting me I don't mind defending myself but. And this is not something that I enjoy I don't take pride in denying that I just you know, even though i'm a very like I could think of a very Honorable fighter, and like i'll show you can any person after we're done win or lose road and I just got out in January this year. The jail and attendees 10 days later, I called another fucking gun case. And again, it is. I don't know going back to what amy was oh I that's what I was trying to tell you earlier, you know amy. pretty much brought up a very like a pretty much gave me a reality check in, and I mean like she because she was asking me questions like obviously i'm not going to incriminate myself. I don't care, you know I mean the statute of limitations on I know that statue statue of limitations on certain you know crimes penal codes, but you know the statute of limitations, as far as taking somebody's life that's you can you could have tokens, and this is just hypothetically."
724.0,Provider,There is no fascism limitations on it.
10467.0,Patient,"Exactly that's all i'm trying to say so, somebody hypothetically if somebody takes somebody's life for two years ago, yes, what they find evidence for some reason that. pretty much connects into that murder guess what it doesn't matter that happened for two years ago and they're still going to charge them and they're still going to come. So again, you know I would tell her everything that I could tell her, but then obviously incriminating myself. But she you know she pretty much like. me and gave me a reality check and she asked me like wins last time, but first she asked me, you know. do I have any any you know I mean I was like no I don't you know I mean i'm a grown ass man and I don't need to be fucking it with nobody you know I don't need to have crowns and nobody. And if I did have problems with somebody right now, you know I would do my best to talk it out as an adult trying to be the bigger person, but at the end of the day, if. I don't know there's just certain things that I can't. sounds dumb but there's certain rules that I can't break so so he so somebody calls my face somebody. Calls me out like they want to fight me especially in front of other grown men have no choice i'm obligated not not I can get punished in me. Or the same thing if somebody calls me a bitch or a PC or a punk or mark in in again and if, in front of any other grown man. You know I mean like I, and I don't know anything about a pound fighter in university consequences that I have to pay for it, for not standing up for myself. And again it's not a good thing it's not healthy whatsoever, but i'm not proud of that, but. Going back to amy then she asked me was last time you had problems with somebody you know I mean like i'll say Oh, when I was, I told her pretty much when I was 18. I had Helen in it, I mean there's plenty of people that wanted to take my life there's plenty of people that tried to take my life. And I mean, and I just told her like you know those certain situations, I did my best to defend myself, and then I mean like and and that's that's when I left it, I mean she told me she asked me was the last time i've been shot it and I told her. And she was like but I thought you don't have any enemies any problems anybody, I was like I don't you know not since I was like 18. And that was another reason why I moved when I was 18 2019 that was one of the reasons why I had to move to oceanside North county San Diego because. I had a rash mustang at the time that I bought with drug money, I mean cuz I was like 17 and 18 I was 16 1718 you know with like looking. $20,000 and you know not being able to explain how I got it from my parents, you know I bought a roush mustangs cash. In in a mean, and I was 17 I didn't have a credit score obviously and I gave my brother was like 19 or 20 at the time, and he was in the marine corps and I gave him the money and he he bought me a fucking nice set of core I mean, obviously I paid for it but. pretty much at the end of my senior year, I had so many problems so many people that my dad and my brother hobby when you came to visit right right when he got back from Afghanistan and spirit, he did two tours his first tour was in 2012 I think. yeah. yeah it was in 2012 because I remember, I was still senior and I was still with my one of my ex girlfriend and I only like like I was just I was just. In it I mean like I just my senior year i'm so fucking ignorant like I thought I was scarface you know I mean like read it around it's like. And again i'm not worried because I don't I don't do this shit anymore and and modal run around with things like this anymore and it's been so long in enemy has been like over 10 years. So, like you know I don't not around with an s cancer, like a block and a 38 special an Ak 47 in the backseat I mean like. Like that he never made an attack getting you know people shooting at me out in public in the point guns on people. And, in broad daylight, or like inside of a liquor store on camera and not giving a book about the consequences agatha i've met very poor choice. And so you know I made so many poor choices that pretty much my parents and my brother my brother came back from Afghanistan he came up to sacramento promotion side and he brought he pretty much told me that they're going to take my car away me they're not going to support me anyway. You know in any in any aspect, if I don't move away to. To San Diego with my brother. And they just found out that I was doing. coke and I don't know it was just a big deal, and so I had no choice but to move out there, but it definitely benefited me in it, I mean a lot, as far as at that point in my life. But uh so going back to him, he asked me, would you have an enemy, since you were like 18 and 2012 you know, once you get shot in 2019 I just thought I was like. And again i'm not going to incriminate myself because anything i'm saying right now just me i'm very conscious of what i'm saying. I didn't do anything you need to be and I just want to go support some homes, you know couple a couple best friends that I care about him that I love dearly. And then I mean I grew up with them we're all from the same neighborhood which is from different streets of it from the same neighborhood and."
724.0,Provider,So there. My thing crashed.
10467.0,Patient,"Sure yeah my man, I was just saying that. It was pretty much saying like. You know I I had a friend, one of my best friends that I grew up with you know we're all from the same neighborhood is a little cousins and all his partners were all from the same neighborhood. Where I grew up together we've known each other for over 15 years but we're just different streets are often the same everyone just different streets that we grew up on. And like you know they called me one night and he told me, you know they're going to go fight like 10 guys, you know, a couple blocks down. pretty much from like where I grew up and at that time I didn't live today I didn't live in your talents anymore, you know, since your size, because me and my brother, I have bought a house. And you know they pretty much call me, and you know I made the decision to go and have your back and. You know, we got there was like 10 of US was like 15 of them, and we all got down and we definitely got the better than in, and I mean like we definitely like. I know I didn't give you to definitely be new people you know at least two or three you got grown ass men during that rumble and then we left we're all happy we go back down the block like three blocks away. And you know all my friends are going across the street to a liquor store to after we had retreating back to my friends little cousin's house. After after the big rumble they want to cross the street, because there's a liquor store there and they're going to grab a bottle of tequila. So we can celebrate and she you know I mean just pretty much handling business so like eight of my friends have walked across the street, and it was only need one of my one of my best friends. Little cousins that were left out front of his duplex and I just hear tires as REACH, and I see a carbon block and I was slipping meaning like I wasn't paying attention. I had my back towards the road and I in my friends little cousins houses on the corner like three duplexes from the corner so straight there Daniel owner and interesting tire screech and I instantly turn around and luckily I have black on and luckily the front lawn I was in. My friends, little cousins for long is patio like was completely blown out so they didn't see me but they just started lining up my my. My best friends little cousin they started lining them up and running, I grabbed them, and you know I take him to the SUV and I pretty much put them behind the engine Bay is you know if you try to hide behind any of the fenders of the doors you're going to."
724.0,Provider,The movies.
10467.0,Patient,"yeah but it, but it, but if you hide behind the engine block, believe it or not, you have a very high chance of not getting hit me because it's not likely that a nine mil or 45 or even a day 57 or fucking."
724.0,Provider,sort of like i'm not going to penetrate the engine block.
10467.0,Patient,"yeah def definitely not you know it's going to be difficult for Armor piercing like 556 a green to penetrate that you know, and that that it's not a guarantee but. let alone a pistol rounds so again, you know I grabbed him and I moved to safety and i'm making them pretty much stay down and I told him on three we're going to run to his backyard you mean the. I told the my friends fucking because I was like on three we're going to run to the backyard, but we're going to zigzag I told him don't run straight directly because. From what I heard and just a matter of less than five seconds of them like it was shooting at US already for like five seconds, and I know there's two shooters is I hear I can distinguish. Two different calibers unit, I mean one was probably like a 45 or 350 700 sellout and the other one was like a 22 or 25. And so I told him I was like you know be ready, and then I told him 123 go and we started running back to the duplex pretty much. forced the gate that leads to the backyard decide gay and I was exactly you know between the neighbor's lawn and his lawn but he ran straight he got hit in the ankle. And we were running up carrying him because he was like he he, like he got hit, and he was falling and I grabbed him and I didn't fall and I kept running with some pretty much. Like carrying them, but I was running I don't even know how I did it, but then we make a you know jumping it was probably my adrenaline. But we have a fence help another fence. make a long story short, you know he's screaming and shit and I put my mouth, I put my hand over his mouth and I was like hey I was like don't screen. Because I don't know if people are going to be following us, you know I mean i'm just taking i'm just taking precautions and shit. And so I just you know I told him like hey don't screen I take my hat off and not pleased on screen, you know, and then I put pressure on his ankle and you know I mean he's in pain. And cautionary I didn't be hidden sit, but again that's that's Another scenario, how was like you know could have been losing my life, and again I I know it's my fault, I know it's self inflicted I know I shouldn't have. been going over there and doing that."
724.0,Provider,"But that was. That was an environment that you're racing the so it's not you know it's abnormal for somebody on the outside looking in to say that that's crazy but. You know, when you live that like in a lifestyle or setting like that decision is not up to you it's. it's no more of a decision to you, then, like the color your skin when you're born or like were you born, you know what I mean like it's not. That type of stuff is not up to you, you just do the best you can so I like you'd like oh six years old i'm just going to move out of the hood you know if that was the case everybody would move out. So you are, you know the saying is like being a product of your environment and that's absolutely true it's absolutely true i've seen it i've witnessed it i've done all those stuff. But every once in a while you like in that movie the the departed you know jack nicholson's good that line in the beginning, where he's like I want my environment be. Was he said I want my environment to be a product of me right, you know so like that's the outlook so. You did you did a lot of good stuff man and you managed to pull yourself and get out of the hood and take some of the lessons those hard lessons that you've learned you've turning them into positives you doing it all the time, even if you don't think you are. So I commend you for that you know. You now continue to talk about this real shit you know because I can relate to a certain degree, you know I get my my street by street experience I definitely have my military experience, so I can relate, I can empathize with what you're going through. So we'll continue to do that, and I think you're on the right track, you know I mean you're processing all the shit that's been going on with you the past several months in a pretty productive way you know just a little bit more a little bit more. Is all i'm asking for you and that's really just to keep you from you know falling into like a. into a comfort zone into your old comfort zone so it's possible to push you just a little bit more to get out of that so. we're just going to keep doing that all right Jason I got somebody else in the waiting room waiting to pop in here and then i'll schedule up with you on Thursday you're going to be there."

Chocolate milk before bed like a tall glass of chocolate milk makes your stomach do some work makes you tired, maybe it'll help you, you know if you feel like your eyes are burning a little bit how the big glass of chocolate, milk and then try to restaurants man."
