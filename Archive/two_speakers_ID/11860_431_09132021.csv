You went to your group and your next group you're being proactive about it.

For the next month treat each other nicely the way they want to be treated itself when see. anyways, this is not official medical advice as far as your medication dispenser i'm just going to send a message to Julie. To a letter no you can't make it tomorrow, I think it's probably better if she just electronic prescribes for you, because this way the pharmacy gets all the information there's less questions. If, for some reason she can't do it, I will get a called in, do you still have any medications left."
11860.0,Patient,"hand has been usually has them because I don't trust myself. And I used to I used to be so good, and then after I realized i'm."

431.0,Provider,"Alright, thanks amber my. Insurance and amber gilles' date of birth January 4 1992 was assistant in the rfc see for an upcoming prescription bridge due to expect it and missing of her appointment tomorrow during group. Given that the patient still has meds and she has already proactively cancelled her appointment a notification will be sent to her provider Julie Keynes to electronically prescribed her medication as usual. pharmacy can serve as a safety net, if we cannot get the medication in today, and we will call an embargo order, if needed, in addition, discussed with patient about her social support. Due to recent issues with her husband patient also reported ongoing nausea and vomiting. that she is going to see an outside provider for a better workup she has recently taken advantage which she did not do well with our President, current medication no further needs at this time, oh, the call was started at 1158 pst to 1212 pst."
