15467.0,Patient,"It was all right, I kind of hated it, but I kind of just I did good in school. So I just kind of. I did like honors and ap courses and things like that, so I got good grades, but I kind of just went to my class where didn't talk to anyone well."
760.0,Provider,What did you hate it.
15467.0,Patient,Because I don't like the kids there.
760.0,Provider,You think you got picked on at school.
15467.0,Patient,"No, no, I didn't really get picked on, but everyone definitely like knew I was weird and didn't really talk to me, but I didn't like people were like didn't go out of their way to be mean to me, but I just kind of just do my own thing."
760.0,Provider,So you felt kind of isolated that.
15467.0,Patient,yeah maybe but yeah maybe yeah.
760.0,Provider,"So do you think you took on some of that belief that. Because you just said they knew I was weird is that something you you believed about yourself, then."
15467.0,Patient,yeah probably.
760.0,Provider,"Do you think that's something you still believe about yourself. Okay, and what we're doing to."
15467.0,Patient,"I didn't I guess I can't really like talk to people very well, especially in like social settings like. that's not good at it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's fair to say that perhaps you are an introvert you know what that means."
15467.0,Patient,yeah so.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. And so that makes you feel like you're weird. yeah okay if that's something you want to learn about."
15467.0,Patient,yeah maybe.
760.0,Provider,Okay i'm going to make a note to that I don't like that term weird I know that's something that kids do in school and. yeah I think the the further you get away from your school experience you'll. start to learn that but.
15467.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know there's introvert the things that i've learned, you know because i'm way older than you Jordan, the things that i've learned is that. There is weird is I don't know to me, is another word for unique which. Is kind of Nice and the other thing about introverts versus extroverts like especially being in the field that i'm in i've met with. Severe extroverts that are suffering on the inside, just as much as the introverts offer and that you know, sometimes, just like a mass is just a way of processing how we feel, and if extra introverts can be it can be a very positive thing, because it gives yourself time for self reflection. And to go inside. and work on yourself. yeah and since I know you're so young you've barely had a chance to start doing that, but it's my goal that, through your treatment and. Recovery that that you'll start to build that does that make some kind of sense to you. yeah yeah there's no says. Because i'm an introvert to. And I remember suffering in school and feeling weird and now that i'm way older than you I really valued introvert. Because I didn't get. It made me reflect that means I go inside I don't go out. And that makes self reflection is really important. yeah so I just kind of want to like plant that little seed, I thought I sent. That to you, so thank you for sharing that all right um. let's see. You said you're working, but what do you do for work."
15467.0,Patient,I were to Victoria secret right now.
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah Okay, and you said you're going to school where do you go to school."

15467.0,Patient,"um it's like i'll be going when I go back it'll be like five days a week, and know four days a week."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so that's but that's full time schedule, as far as your units and such."
15467.0,Patient,I believe so yeah.
760.0,Provider,Okay it's just online or.
15467.0,Patient,"We have, like some of my classes are online, but most of them are in person."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so how is that stress level for you how's your stress level. managing all of this and. going to class in mind and going to class driving to get to. You got to drive to riverside from Los Angeles, I know. Here in southern California, so I know what that means. yeah it's."
15467.0,Patient,"A lot me and my brother are planning on maybe moving to La. Together soon as he works down there too, and he's like makes the drive also So hopefully that'll make it easier, but yeah it's a little stressful sometimes."
760.0,Provider,that'll be another thing based on. Because of expense.
15467.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
760.0,Provider,renting in La yeah that that's a whole different.
15467.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"All right, um talk to me about yourself esteem Jordan."
15467.0,Patient,Not the greatest probably.
760.0,Provider,"Kenny taco is that. Go back to the schooling, that we were just. Talking about in school, did you, you know you're never made to feel that way in your House. In by any. Members of your family, it was always just in this fall."
15467.0,Patient,"yeah probably Okay, it is."
760.0,Provider,And how was your friendships now that you're out of school.
15467.0,Patient,And they're they're good I most of my like I have a couple friends that I kept in close contact with the most of them are like my same quite a few friends from high school that stuck around so that's Nice.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um nice see. And we kind of already covered your hobbies is there any other things you like to do that, we haven't already talked about I guess."
15467.0,Patient,Like to click stuffed animals.
760.0,Provider,"Go okay go, so I can see that. What are the, what are the ones that, like the like a caterpillar and."
15467.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"they're like that, like a hockey ma I see. yeah are they all pokemon."
15467.0,Patient,"know the most of them there is called like squish marshmallows. Okay yeah so I go. shopping for them, or I look for them all the time. Like to do."
760.0,Provider,"All right, and that looks like a lot of work to uncover that bed, or do you sleep a. Half of those."
15467.0,Patient,They usually fall off in the middle of the night.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um you don't have any kids see Jordan. Okay talk to me about your health habits."
15467.0,Patient,"I don't really exercise too much, I was vegan for a few years, but now i'm vegetarian."
760.0,Provider,"Other than that, I don't think here, do you think there's two types of vegetarians there's vegetarians they eat healthy. yeah and then there's vegetarians did eat a bunch of pasta and."
15467.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
760.0,Provider,Like that so which which of those two categories you think you fall into.
15467.0,Patient,"and getting better sleep when I first turned vegan That was really good at it and then I was getting really bad at it. So then, like that's why I started to turn decided to go back to vegetarian, because I was like okay i'd rather just eat something healthy for me, then, rather than just like a bunch of junk all the time, because I don't like. i'm not cooking for myself so then it got better again, and then I kind of started to fall back into it again, but i'm starting to cook for myself a lot more actually and I go out so much."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right is that is that something you want to work on that we can talk about that as well."
15467.0,Patient,"Yes, like something i'm conscious of, and I want to work on, but sometimes I like a little bit."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah because our diet. When we eat junk or when we don't eat at all, either of those two things. can have not only a negative impact on the physical health, but it also has an impact on our emotions."
15467.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,So that's kind of goes together so okay any any health problems that you're aware of.
15467.0,Patient,"i'm not right, no I don't think."
760.0,Provider,"No nothing Okay, do you want to start exercising as well, or is that not something you want to do."
15467.0,Patient,"I think I want to I don't like to, but I think I should and my mom's been getting back into it so she got like a new treadmill and everything she's been doing it every day, so I was like that could be fun to do also. Maybe with her something."
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and sometimes if if. If you know you could do lighter exercise some days you can do more intensive on the on the treadmill or such. More you even just taking a walk. Because when we have these heavy feelings of. Depression and anxiety it's. really important for us to move our bodies, because that also helps ease your symptoms, so is that something you want to work on as well."
15467.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
760.0,Provider,talk to me about your sleep habits.
15467.0,Patient,"um the when I first got on my medication, I was sleeping a lot and I was actually sleeping pretty good. Maybe a little too much because I. I never really have ever taking NAPs but I was actually starting to like take NAPs during the day. Which is actually good, because my work schedule was like. Three in the morning and stuff like that."
760.0,Provider,me in the head Victoria yeah stocking shelves yeah. In the morning okay. Okay.
15467.0,Patient,"It kind of was nice, but then once I got off of it, like the past month or so it's been pretty hard to sleep So hopefully it'll help me sleep again."
760.0,Provider,Okay alright well we'll we'll revisit that that as well do you do for the way the screen.

760.0,Provider,yeah cuz that that's that's also coming out but that hasn't too much of that as especially with social media. mm hmm yeah negative effect on on the mental health checks.
15467.0,Patient,For me i've been trying to get on social media. like that.
760.0,Provider,"All right, all right Jordan i'm me see you ever had any problems with the law."

15467.0,Patient,yeah.

Your your treatment plan is there anything else that you want to talk about or need to talk about or any support you need for anything.
