252.0,Provider,How are you today.
3019.0,Patient,"i'm i'm sorry I got a hair my mouth. You know. being honest pretty shitty. yeah yeah. it's uh you know yeah. it's like I said yesterday. Is i'm still like in a mode of like. it's like it's like I don't want to call it that, but you could call it denial, you know what I mean where. I just feel like I haven't fully accepted like when I do really think about it and I start thinking about it, I don't know, like my mind, just like go somewhere else, like like i'm I feel like i'm just not fat when I do fathom it I you know break down like to start crying and stuff but. I don't know a lot of times i'm just I feel like i'm just in this kind of state of numbness I don't really care about anything right now. Right now. And I expected."
252.0,Provider,"What, which is to be expected."
3019.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean from a 11 year relationship, I mean it's definitely not your typical you know break up and yeah we've been together. You know we've been we've been together since we were fit technically yeah 15 and like it's just like. yeah like I think it's so hard for me to fathom because I can't even. The idea of losing her as a partner is crushing. him I told her when she you know I told her I said I you know i'm just I am working and like trying to get to a point, and all and. I want, I told her like I wouldn't marry you like that that that's like 100% you know, true, I just want to tell her that. You know, like I wasn't like I wasn't like begging pleading like we broken up like for real like we've broken up like twice and our entire relationship where it didn't last that long but. You know I feel like it was very mature in the sense me being very immature like in my addiction and stuff bargaining bargaining bargaining, you know what I mean. yeah um So for me this time I mean. Like one like one of the worst parts about it, too, is just that, like, I mean for past first ever since I got out of rehab I mean. it's like i've expected this like i've been waiting on it and I, I saw I almost wish, she would have just broken up with me when I got out of rehab because. I could have learned to just be on my own, and I totally different science and now I just have to get over this and I, and I feel like it's like because the whole thing is, I draw I. That the god's honest truth is she is a extremely smart and capable person, one of the most smartest people i've ever met, it was weird that when we. got together in high school that she even wanted to be with me, because I was a total jerk off like in class but it's like I was an asshole but I was definitely a jokester and I didn't do well in school, and I did drugs that's cool you know, like that was and it's like. A but I was always so nice to her, you know, like we had like a different kind of I swear you know, even though we got together when we were kids you know we really had a serious relationship that. evolved, you know beyond, especially our childhood like you know, like a honeymoon so like you know we became like a real couple like. Through these years, and like know so much about each other, and I mean, but the truth definitely, the truth is that all the stuff that I put her through with my addiction. is completely my fault and she didn't deserve any of it, she didn't deserve being lied to all the time because her being so hopeful and honest and believing in me that I was actually just got to stop and all that kind of stuff and then. I don't know just dragging her into a world now have like a person who is constantly. You know just in pain and stuff that she doesn't that she just doesn't even understand, I mean she understands pain very well, she understands the human condition very well, but. You know, drugs, she doesn't understand she's literally I she's probably the most straight laced person I know. 100% the most straight she used we used to smoke weed in high school that's what we do that's it she's like she stopped like seven years ago and was like I don't like smoking weed anymore, and like so it's like she just super. Like you know yeah and so. I always felt guilty dragon hurt until world that it's like you didn't deserve to even have to be exposed to all this into have to like worry about all this so. I mean, I felt, so I understand completely that's why like I didn't fight on it, I mean I told her how I felt told her what I felt like I needed to tell her, but I was just like i'm not gonna like. Not gonna i'm not gonna like you know beg and plead like you know. Yes, night it's not fair it's just like. When. I mean. If it's true if you love something they'll come, you know you'll let them go know. If they love you back to come back. Right i'm not hoping for anything special anything but. In a way, I also have some I do have some idea in my head, that the one thing I do you think about her that. it's the part that I love about her that she just that I mean I I know a lot she knows more than I do, but I know a lot more than she does just about how the world works how people are I mean i've done a lot, you know i've i've accomplished a lot of things on you know, on the street."
252.0,Provider,Like tying in if you're.
3019.0,Patient,"getting around to people, you know, like, I know how people are you know and they're like and I just feel like she's not as exposed to that kind of world and i'm just like I do wonder i'm just like like. I hope she because, like the one thing I can say that I know for a fact is that I was always night, I was very kind to her always I was I probably raised my voice to her like seriously like four times and the 11 years were dating like I know that you don't like that I was in I you know. I was so I just I wonder like it's like I don't think you're gonna find exactly what you're looking for out there."
252.0,Provider,right but. Thank you think you're right. For sure you guys been together an awful long time you know. So that's kind of. God that it's just a that's a long time to be with somebody.
3019.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know. um but what I do know is that. Anything can be rebuilt, and you know, during this time, right now, amazing with a great time to work on yourself."
3019.0,Patient,"She told me that I should that's exactly what you want me to do. and yeah I mean that that's what i'm gonna do I mean it i'm not 100 like if i'm being totally honest like. In the past, like two years there's definitely been moments, where I thought, like man like. I could probably be doing more for myself if I was single and not saying that I wanted to be single but. going through becoming sober sometimes feels like it could be a little easier being single i'm sure it can seem a lot easier being not being single, but when we are you know it's double edged sword i'm sure."
252.0,Provider,Yes.
3019.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't. And it just it just can it sucked it came out of nowhere we we had we went out that. Monday night we went out Monday night we had a great night like I don't know it was great like we didn't get to see each other as much for like the holidays. yeah and. So he finally we're exchanging gifts and yeah I got her something like Pearl earrings some white gold like Pearl earrings and she got me like some nice stuff. And then we're happy and we drove them went and saw a movie out in walnut creek and went to dinner and. we're just happy, I feel like we had a great time we saw a romantic movie like and then we pull up into her house where I parked my car and. You know, and then she's just like we got to talk about something and just happened like that and i'm just like. Like I don't know I definitely I don't appreciate that you know, and I mean it's just like Why did we even do any of this because I felt like there was something weird going on between us, and then we just had like a great night, so what I don't know, like, I think. there's. I want to believe you know I think my narcissism wants to believe that. She doesn't know what she's doing necessarily maybe that's not exactly what you want, but something that she needs right now but. i'm not gonna i'm just not holding up any hopes, but the idea also just the idea of being. single again I don't know it's like. that's very daunting I don't know haven't been with anybody years so that's her you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah yeah. And it's very scary.
3019.0,Patient,"yeah just the idea like i'm, not even in that mode, yet you know i'm not like. starting a tinder account right now, you know but, like, I know, like you, if you know eventually yeah like it's gonna be like okay now some you know see what's out there and whatever and I it's scary yeah totally. It is, I. it's like cuz. I don't know the with like in high school I definitely was like. Like that was like my social butterfly time and I totally became so I feel like I became like way more of the person that I am. Like just expressing myself fully and like exactly how I fell and not caring what people thought and it worked actually like you know people liked me for him and like. I just liked it, you know I like the way people treat me because I had more spec for myself and so and that but yeah like that was like my hardcore years of like talking to a lot of girls, but yeah it's been 11 years, so I don't know how that's going to go at all, but. I mean it's not even what I live Thank you know what I would want a stress to get back together it doesn't have an interest."
252.0,Provider,"yeah I totally get that after you've been with somebody for. You know, and the plan was always to spend our life together right, so there wasn't any reason to look for anybody else or to think about being with anybody else."
3019.0,Patient,"yeah like I don't even have which I know for a fact that she has like. she's got a I know she's got a little black book, you know, a couple of names in there that she you know that, like we, in the past, like we argue like i'm like why he hanging out with this person like you know, because that was being you know. A dude you know hormonal i'm like but I I know it's like I know she has like. Like group with guy friends what it's like for me like I don't have anything like that my back pocket, and I feel like that's a sign because I truly felt like we're going to be together. Like it's not about having something in my back pocket like don't get me wrong that's not what i'm trying to say like i'm saying that's maybe something I would have done when I was 19 like. When you have friends, you have girls that you had crushes on and you moved on a bit, but you know, have you still you know you're still friends, but no none of that I left all that behind. So it's just whatever it doesn't matter right now, but like I don't know why that's not really my problem right now that's not why i'm bummed."
252.0,Provider,well. It did it does seem like it came out of the blue. You know.
3019.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"But what I also know is that we can't control other people right. And, whatever it is that has you know really got her going this way. And the best thing that you can do. is to work on you go through the pain, you know what I mean lick your wounds stand up on your own two feet figure mason out. You know."
3019.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I mean. It is a good opportunity and. it's something that I know weirdly deep down it's something that i've straight up had a lot of into conflict because the only time it ever thought. Maybe maybe like I don't know like maybe like things should change like in that department. is the only time ever thought was because I was like because I would have more time to work on myself and maybe become a little better like more financially better, more. You know, work on like what I wanted to do or something, but it was always like yeah but i'm not gonna leave eat it like I could do that, while so being either. But no, now that it's like that, like, I am going to i'm going to give like different things to try, I know it's going to be. in some way a lot less stressful like it's going to suck every day to day but it's also going to be a little less stressful day to day, not having that report to somebody you know."
252.0,Provider,Sure sure.
3019.0,Patient,"Like you know that's not how I felt, but when you just thinking about it in a whole like from an outsider's perspective, you know, like it's like how much time all have like and. i'm I am a very indecisive person which sucks and it's because I take a lot of things and accountability, so I guess not having to take just you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
3019.0,Patient,Her feelings into accountability of what i'm going to do day like. They don't make my day to day easier.
252.0,Provider,"Well, in some ways, possibly, but I can tell you that you know it takes time. Right. yeah it does it takes time, we have to we've gotten you think about it, we get so used to being with that person and then being in our lives that. When that to do is home, excuse me. it's almost like we have to detox."
3019.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's like. that's like the scariest part about it because it's like. yeah it feels like i'm like yeah like I have a weird there's some familiarity with like ending my relationship with like opiates like there's a small small familiarity of the just the Okay, this is how it is now like. start doing this, like you know living without that like you know I don't know."
252.0,Provider,yeah it's it's true.
3019.0,Patient,"it's not near yeah like as like superficial, as you know. No relationship with opiates but yeah like it's. yeah it's just I mean. It just really sucks and I don't know there's. there's in the past, there was always some reasons we're pretty clear yeah I didn't want to acknowledge them. Seriously, like diction was acting, but this time. yeah it's like I just don't I know but there's nothing I can do there's nothing I can change on thing that could have made things better, maybe, as if I. Just flourished and like got an amazing career and was able to save up enough that we can move out and do it so that's fine that's that's what I know is like she just wants to be in she is capable of moving on in life, she could do it with their own money, right now, so it's like. yeah so it's like you know I can't hold her back anymore."
252.0,Provider,"well. I hope that you know, on this journey that you figure you out and are able to really become the person that you were meant to become. And I mean that, by focusing inward."
3019.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean.
3019.0,Patient,"yeah I do the one thing that just really sucks about, that is, I for the last 11 years I thought that the person knows."
252.0,Provider,I can't hear you.
3019.0,Patient,"Oh, I was saying. Just like one of the hardest parts about is that. The last 11 years the person I thought I was supposed to become MP was you know with Edith. yeah yeah so I just have to reimagine all that wipe slates clean but i'm. i'm trying to focus on the positives like i'm like. Let myself like you said, like like my."
252.0,Provider,Up can't see I can't hear you again.
3019.0,Patient,Oh sorry I keep covering the Michael sorry i'm good but as can say. i'm. God I got a text from my mama totally threw me off i'm. processing.
252.0,Provider,Get like you wouldn't.
3019.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'm gonna live yes lick my wounds and you know it's kind of you know, take at least that you know couple days or so, but. i'm gonna definitely like I don't know change, like, I want to like reconnect with like some a lot of friends, so I just never really saw as much just because my regular schedule of day to day. And how it's gonna be all different now, and I know they all do miss me like good friends not like drug friends and. um yeah so i'm going to try to maybe just you know get way more involved in the. The weekly you know hangouts it like you know the good old boys friends i've couple really good friends, I could spend some time. So that know when i'm gone through definitely one for sure knows what i'm going through."
252.0,Provider,"And I think that that's a really good idea, you know definitely to hang out with people that. You haven't for a long time."
3019.0,Patient,"it's like i've seen them, I see them everywhere, I see them every like two months and it's just like we're best friends like we've been best friends, since high school and stuff like that so and I know that. They see each other, will more often than not, so I think I want to just back NUTS circle, and the only reason is because you know they know like oh yeah mason just so you know he just hangs out with his girlfriend aligned stuff so yeah i'll be different."
252.0,Provider,"You will be different, but don't I just want to make sure that you're that you. And it sounds bad when I say it, but that you walk through it there that's a better way of saying it that you don't try to run from the process of this whatever this is going to be."
3019.0,Patient,yeah. What would that look like like what would be a difference between walking through it and running running.
252.0,Provider,"When you run from it your mind you don't allow yourself to go into feelings or allow yourself to go into thoughts you just put it out of your mind and focus on. Work or or something completely different, so that you don't have to walk through those feelings walking on well the another good another good example is relapse. that's mom. yeah right. So we can we can get a job and we can become so intertwined with work that we don't get to breed. So, remember that not saying don't get a job i'm just saying don't work yourself to death."
3019.0,Patient,"Why, I just got a job actually i'm as an overnight baker for pinera which i'm actually i'm did you hear me. Okay yeah I saw I got that i'm going to start really soon i'm actually pretty excited about the job, because it seems very. lacks in the sentence overnight baker so i'm going to be there with one to two other people at the facts man it's just like you just bake the low side you bake all the frozen pastries and like it's it's like. I believe, like they said eight am to 4am and 10 or 8pm to 4am and 10pm 6am which i've been like super nocturnal lately, and so and but besides I just feel like it's not that serious of a job, like you know I. So i'm excited about that you know, hopefully getting a routine of that but I don't think it's gonna be a job that's going to consume me so that's good."
252.0,Provider,"that's just what I was saying, though I mean allow it to keep you busy keep your mind occupied but don't get so involved in it that you exhaust yourself out."
3019.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, make sure you're getting plenty of rest make sure you're drinking plenty of water, make sure that you're eating. on a regular basis. Okay, make sure that that type of self care is 100%. And you have to remember to that right now. Your raw."
3019.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Imagine, just imagine an open wound and that's what you have going on right now, so when you feel like crying cry. When you feel like not being around somebody for a night don't. Take that time and that this opportunity to heal. Because i'll guarantees I guarantee you that in within 60 days. you'll start feeling. Better there'll be less times that you think about it and more times that you focus on what you're doing. Gradually happens it doesn't happen overnight. Right unless we're running from it."
3019.0,Patient,Okay. Okay yeah.
252.0,Provider,I ain't got. Time to yourself right now.
3019.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that's what I want to do so, I will i'll take the time for myself and. Just kind of focus on starting a new job and i'm besides that yeah just you know. Probably just getting healthy cycle to work out needing."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, listen it doesn't even have it doesn't have to happen today. No, you can take you can take some time just to grieve just to be just to feel that uncomfortableness that fear about what's next. You know."
3019.0,Patient,Without just trying not to spiral about it right.
252.0,Provider,"I totally right, I, like the fact I like that you're looking at the at the bright side of it, and I think that that's important that you do. So, every time that you find yourself in the negative part of it, you got to try to pull yourself out with that other positive piece and own those feelings, yes, this hurt like hell. And yes, my life has changed it's not what I thought it was going to be, but I can walk through this."
3019.0,Patient,"yeah that's The one thing I know I can do, I can walk through this and that's I think the only reason I know that I couldn't walk through this is because of what i've been through."
252.0,Provider,And look at how far you've came. yeah also I want to talk about your comment last night. You are not defined by your addiction.
3019.0,Patient,yeah I mean i'm. not trying to like be. defined like it's just like it's true but. Real really is that totally true and other people's eyes.
252.0,Provider,It doesn't matter what other people think.
3019.0,Patient,What about. love them. hmm What if you love them.
252.0,Provider,She knew you before you became an addict right.
3019.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so have you struggled with a disease. Yes, and is it tough to get up and redefine who you are from the same disease, yes. The mason you're in this whole transition. You just spent time with a man that abused as a child. You just started that process which was more of a hindrance. Then, your addiction."
3019.0,Patient,yeah. yeah that's true. I guess I just think of all times too when I feel I feel like i'm like getting a moving forward in so many ways yeah or.
252.0,Provider,And it does suck. 100% it sucks. Big time and it's not fair. And it doesn't make any sense and it probably won't pass for a while.
3019.0,Patient,"I know i'm. i'm. i'm also just like. I mean it tears me up to because I mean like she's my best friend and like many ways to like that's what I really don't understand how I don't understand how that is going to. Work now all but I don't see my focus is not communicating with it that's some that seems very it's just like that seems. It it just doesn't seem right. Right I don't know I think she feels the same way about that too, I mean she kind of said that. But we're friends, we hang out with this stuff like. That bums me out feel I don't know what's gonna happen."
252.0,Provider,"Well, this can I tell you what I know. From experience. You have to you have to give your side yourself time. away from her. If this is how it's going to be, and she wants you guys to be separated because it's not something you wanted. you've got to at least get comfortable with where you're at with us."
3019.0,Patient,And you got a little time.
252.0,Provider,"For you. because every time that you guys talk if you guys are, if you guys talk daily right."
3019.0,Patient,Right yeah. it'll hurt.
252.0,Provider,"You in there goes another rip if. And then, if I don't hear from her you go into this panic mode."
3019.0,Patient,"i've been there with other times when we. broke up you know, and I know how it is like the the front, the manic call calling like we know you have to you feel like you have to learn you're gonna die. Yes, and I think i'm just a little more mature than that now, after going through some things like that was when I was an addict that's out, you know I mean but. So i'm definitely going to i'm not going to reach out manically at all if she wants to talk i'll talk to her like that, but yeah like. i'm just not going to beg for anything back. Just what she wants what she wants and. Why would I want to be in a relationship somebody who's not attracted something or."
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm. or want something different, and can I just tell you that it's not unusual for two people to have different paths."
3019.0,Patient,yeah you're right.
