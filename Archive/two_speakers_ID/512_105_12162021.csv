512.0,Patient,hi.
105.0,Provider,take some time to kind of update me where you'd like to.
512.0,Patient,"Oh okay um let's see I got antibiotics from my doctor. And i'm doing better better not great, but better in that department there's improvement. And I am. not going to go back to work until after my surgery. It just it the getting in and out of the car so much in such a short period of time it just was not right for me it was really making pain go like down my legs and. it's not like it was a career, you know. So I was, I was able to put money into savings to get us through the next two months of surgery and. I feel good about that and oliver's birthday Saturday. And that, but this is always just the hardest time of year for me when I always struggle in this short time period. um. But I am just really trying to. not be sad and make new memories cuz he's older and I can replace some of those segments."
105.0,Provider,mm hmm.
512.0,Patient,i'm just trying to go for that you know.
105.0,Provider,"Whether, what are the plans on Saturday."
512.0,Patient,"he's having a birthday party to. Cut I got a helium tank to blow up balloons he wants balloons all over his room so we're gonna stay up late and those room full of balloons. fun and we're making his birthday cake tomorrow. yeah just so a lot of things, but I am sad i'm sad that I cannot see Sophie this Christmas. My my dad will not let me come while i'm infected."
105.0,Provider,"Were you infected, the last time, your."
512.0,Patient,"yeah yes, the whole issue."
105.0,Provider,"And so, he didn't know that you were or something."
512.0,Patient,"No, he did i'd never ever lied or kept being infected from them ever I wouldn't do that to them that's dangerous. I would say i'm not infected just so I could come they. i'm honest with them and that's how they know that it's not great, and they don't want me there."
105.0,Provider,"it's not contagious, though. So I don't get what the problem is."
512.0,Patient,"The bacteria on my wound they're worried that it could go to someone else. So when I first got my wound Glenn they said I had something called Murcia. I have tested negative twice for it. Twice Okay, but until my wound is closed, and I am fixed the medical team cannot say I am not carrying Murcia."
105.0,Provider,Oh brother.
512.0,Patient,"so complicated and stupid and Sophie is just so sad. it's been a while, since i've seen her. Then I said okay well, can I just come get a hotel room for a night, can I just see her for one day i'll pay for my own room and. they're like well you won't be allowed to come in our House or say on our furniture or or anything like that and. it's just hard to explain that to you know to her."
105.0,Provider,she's old enough to hear the truth that marissa is I like a dangerous that's true.
512.0,Patient,yeah she knows that mommy has bad germs that are dangerous.
105.0,Provider,How old is she she isn't she. mommy has bad germs she could hear more mature language than that.
512.0,Patient,"Well, in his term that's how he put it. That wasn't my terminology."
105.0,Provider,Thank you probably got that at the hospital.
512.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, where people get it in prisons and in hospitals."
512.0,Patient,I was in there for on and off over a month before I got the Murcia.
105.0,Provider,yeah right yeah wow.
512.0,Patient,"So, so I I got the the best, most special Christmas present, I can order. Right okay I got this little wishing jar and it says um I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and it says her name on it and it's a porcelain. Wishing jar that she could put wishes in throughout the next year and then the following year, we can go through her wishes and try to make some of those come true."
105.0,Provider,So sweet.
512.0,Patient,I know. we'll see. we'll see.
105.0,Provider,So the answer back was no don't bother coming out or yes you're going to what's plan.
512.0,Patient,"No i'm not they. To spend one night and then for her to not even be able to stay with me um it just kind of you know, but then I want her to know that she's worth doing that. So i'm just torn."
105.0,Provider,well. Where would you meet if you couldn't go in the House how would the meetup occur.
512.0,Patient,"I would probably have to get stay in a hotel and she would have to come and stay with me, but my point to him was. Just the surgeon told me that if I changed my rooms, before I went and I have antibacterial not touch the wound and I don't touch it until I have left that really minimize the possibility, because i'm not touching the womb. And I chose to tell them that but. yeah it's just a losing battle here. So then, my mom said, well, maybe we should drive and meet you halfway for the day."
105.0,Provider,Oh.
512.0,Patient,mm hmm me she just said this last night. But our options between here and flag are.
105.0,Provider,Oh Ray.
512.0,Patient,yeah it's yeah so I don't know we'll have to figure it out.
105.0,Provider,They sound like they're a little flexible.
512.0,Patient,"And I think my mom my mom is because she knows how sets sad, we are, but my my dad my dad wouldn't even get on and watch all the open his Christmas present from them or his birthday. On video like he's just. I don't know."
105.0,Provider,You sure to know how to shut yourself up.
512.0,Patient,"Well, because there's nothing I can do."
105.0,Provider,What do you want to do.
512.0,Patient,"I don't know, I guess, I have this. When I say I don't have expectations, I guess, in some way I do, I have this expectation for. My parents like care about their grandchildren. Not just Sophie."
105.0,Provider,Have there been moments where your dad has shown that he cares.
512.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,Really.
512.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, even when he dropped her off to stay with us that one time she wouldn't even come into the House and say hi to Tom and lori um he just dropped her off. And then, when he picked her up. If Tom was an outside waiting, he would have never even talked to Tom. My dad has this reputation of just being a people person and treating people with respect."
105.0,Provider,He does because. Okay.
512.0,Patient,"Right right, so this is the reputation, he has built for himself and I see him not even trying to make an effort. To be respectful non not even not even asked him to be nice just asking to be respectful things that he would want people to do if they were coming to his home. And he he can't give any he can't I don't know. So then i'm left with the angry frustrations from Tom and glory that they're not getting from my dad and i'm not getting anything from him either, so it makes it like. All the side comments that they make about my parents I just take because. What else have they shown."
105.0,Provider,Was there ever a time when your dad showed he care genuinely about you.
512.0,Patient,"know, I think, since 2009 since i've had Sophie that's that something shifted. Something shifted and he he doesn't mind saying that that. Is his main priority over everything else."
105.0,Provider,Do you have a guess about. How he's able to care for her.
512.0,Patient,"See The thing is, is that they can teach her. They can teach her school wise better than I can but they can't teach her emotionally the way I can. I keep thinking about. Well, they had they have three children three raised children that have pretty deep issues, I mean not not great great issues and um the fact that. um. He thinks that he can just do a better."
105.0,Provider,"there's some missing information in there, see if you can go out of it again my dad treats Sophie this way versus me my brother, and you have two brothers. To see if you can fill in the missing part."
512.0,Patient,um. He just doesn't see the negative. The negative behaviors. Whereas with his children that's all he seeks. So all these issues that have. come up over the years that have made my dad feel the way that he feels I feel like those same behaviors that I had to go through to learn. Because they didn't teach me Sophie is gonna have to do the same thing and figure out her way and are her behaviors gonna make him hate her that's what I worry about.
105.0,Provider,that's certainly a legitimate concern. What what is it that he's going to do. predictively.
512.0,Patient,well. I feel like my mom is going to criticize the crap out of Sophie and then my dad is going to set. A false expectation of her that she can't obtain. because she can get past the criticism. You know if that makes sense. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Well, talk about it from your own experience, so my mom criticize me and to sort of start there."
512.0,Patient,And she did criticize me but I guess I didn't notice it growing up as much as I see her criticizing Sophie okay. um. I just feel like they're. I feel like they're trying to do something without the resources to help them do it.
105.0,Provider,that's summary.
512.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"that's true mature and very general, but it's not dropping into the experience. very deeply."
512.0,Patient,But my experience is different than sophie's experience right. we're not.
105.0,Provider,Not if you were to watch this video.
512.0,Patient,uh huh oh.
105.0,Provider,You go oh. i'm worried about Sophie because i've been in that house. Try it again what was it like being your mother's daughter.
512.0,Patient,I don't know why I find this such a difficult question.
105.0,Provider,"Well, because you do probably a lot of compartmentalization you stop yourself normally you just you just say I dad is this and then you close your lips you go to this. mm hmm and you wait for me to ask a question."
512.0,Patient,"Okay. So growing up. I think that her mom put in her head, an idea of what a family should look like, or what she needed and my mom tried really hard to keep up the appearances and that's when the critical illness came in. Well, everything in private can be messy and not put together everything of public has to be put together and seen properly."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so stay with that. Okay What was it like to be your mother's daughter."
512.0,Patient,This idea of perfection that didn't exist. Still doesn't exist it's hard to. To try to reach for that perfection.
105.0,Provider,It was hard to reach for perfection as a daughter. What else.
512.0,Patient,I think. I think that that's where a lot of the line came in for me.
105.0,Provider,Whose line.
512.0,Patient,"My line. to paint this picture of perfection. That I don't know it just like kicked in, and as long as you make everything else seem okay out here. Then you're okay. Then i'm Okay, and my mom is okay she's not mad at me."
105.0,Provider,"Well, it does seem like the perfect house. to feed. and maintain secrets."
512.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. yeah that's the that's the other things, the breeding ground of secrets the family of secrets I hate it. I think that's what destroyed our relationship."
105.0,Provider,I assume she's not interested and change changing that structure.
512.0,Patient,"um she she is she you know what over the last year she's tried i'm referring to her, her closet smoking. My brothers and I kept it a secret from my dad for many years. And then she started doing it with Sophie bribing her with chocolate stay in her room while my dad was gone. So many fights ugly ugly fights because it was like she was telling us to be one way um but then asking us to cover up for her and it just. It wasn't working it and I set a boundary. I set a boundary and she quit smoking she did she she did quit smoking yeah. But then she started again and then she started with Sophie again. At the beginning of last year."
105.0,Provider,Have you and Sophie talked. about them.
512.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,So she doesn't have to hold the secret.
512.0,Patient,"She. Not. My mom quit she's quit smoking over the last year period so not to push Sophie in this position. um. But when Sophie get gets angry she's still threatens my mom with it like i'll tell Papa if you don't sign this piece of paper that says, I was naughty today or let me go to the dollar store and get this or that kind of stuff it's awful."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
512.0,Patient,and I think that yeah it just became a compile compile meant of secrets like my mom's secret smoking my secret pill addiction my older brothers smoking marijuana my younger brother. Who knows what he was doing just all kinds of secrets in one house and no one talking to results of the secrets.
105.0,Provider,And everyone afraid. of death.
512.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. But i'm happy that she spent this last year, working on the. The guilt that she's had over the years, with this closet smoking she spent a lot of time this last year, working on that."
105.0,Provider,How to know she's working on the guilt.
512.0,Patient,"And because the things that she says, or when she were talking and we talked about when we smoke door. stories."
105.0,Provider,She tells stories to the people who already know she's smoking you mean.
512.0,Patient,Oh no just her and her and I as we're talking about it. Over this last year. I don't know that um. Other than us that anyone knows that she smoked.
105.0,Provider,So. Do you have a thought about that.
512.0,Patient,"um things done in secret, will always come to light."
105.0,Provider,wow okay. that's your final word on it.
512.0,Patient,They do it always comes out can keep it forever.
105.0,Provider,Do you have anything more to say about that.
512.0,Patient,Ending that part.
105.0,Provider,"To turn automatic notification off. disappear, one of those moments for you to see that this is your time you rely heavily on me pulling. This will be one of those moments for you, you find that this is your time. That you get what you need."
512.0,Patient,"Sometimes it's just hard to go to different places, so quickly, because I have so much going on."
105.0,Provider,"Okay well. don't have to move quickly you could see if there's more. Right, where you were."
512.0,Patient,"Okay, I like that. Just I feel like I just always. All right. Okay, so. I struggle with. Everything just being. So far apart from each other. That was close and. I guess I do really well Kurt Kurt me how do you sing it."
105.0,Provider,On her. Part mental realizing.
512.0,Patient,"Yes, because. that's how I do with everything. that's how I. view everything, nothing is. It all together, but it's all far apart. And I know how to bring it all."
105.0,Provider,"Well, take over."
512.0,Patient,This situation here and then this situation over here it's really hard for me to deal with both. fully.
105.0,Provider,"Well, see how true, it is when you just that statement, you said well the secrets come out eventually."
512.0,Patient,"Well, I mean. yeah they come out and. it's you either get to. yeah you've been doing it in secret. And you're willing to not do it in secret anymore and take on those repercussions. instead of waiting for it to come to light whenever it does. juicy and i'm saying."
105.0,Provider,Once you bring.
512.0,Patient,I like to bring it to light myself and deal with it.
105.0,Provider,uh huh that's very different than what you said earlier.
512.0,Patient,This is how I like to deal with things I don't like dealing with other people's random secrets.
105.0,Provider,"Your sophie's mother, the secret she holds. Are they not yours to manage as well."
512.0,Patient,For sure they are.
105.0,Provider,"Which philosophy, are you living by."
512.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh. I guess i'm living one philosophy for myself and one philosophy, for her."
105.0,Provider,How are they different.
512.0,Patient,"Because I. Oh man My response to that was not good. My was my response was that I tried to be truthful and honest when i'm dealing with it, where she will denied denied denied until the end. So I don't know what secrets are true or not."
105.0,Provider,What we're talking about you and Sophie.
512.0,Patient,yeah with Sophie to.
105.0,Provider,Shelton denied denied denied.
512.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,But. being asked to keep a secret to begin with. To begin with.
512.0,Patient,Right a secret that wasn't hers. To have to burden.
105.0,Provider,that's it you got it where's your role.
512.0,Patient,I guess. I. I just love my mom do the same thing to her that she said to me.
105.0,Provider,that's no fun to say or to feel.
512.0,Patient,"In the moment yes yeah it can get really angry, but then I think of how hard my mom is tried over the last year."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, you start feeling and protecting your mother."
512.0,Patient,"um no I just know that the fight that we had about this particular thing um was probably one of the biggest fights my mom and I have ever happened. And I was, I was pregnant with all of her what happened. But it may change. My mom. selfie."
105.0,Provider,Okay. The Sophie say. Nana bribed me to shut up.
512.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,So earlier when you said Sophie denies denies the Nice nice what we're talking about.
512.0,Patient,"Things that she's done things that she's done in secret. And then you enter the unhealthy. arena of using their secret against them when they want, which is what Sophie is doing now. Even though my mom has. Not smoked in a while. Because she's still engaged in that behavior and in that mindset, even though my mom is getting out of it, she hasn't helped Sophie with the mindset."
105.0,Provider,You have been helping you have to help me the secret is kept for who.
512.0,Patient,My dad.
105.0,Provider,"Is does your dad no. No. Then, what do you mean the secrets resolved it's exactly as it was, it has not moved."
512.0,Patient,Oh okay so she quit doing the secret behavior. And now selfie.
105.0,Provider,But listen.
512.0,Patient,it's still on Sophie.
105.0,Provider,"And now, not only that she is leveraging it."
512.0,Patient,You. That that encompasses right there what I mean by. I may not be able to teach her book everything but I. I know what Sophie feels. that's what i'm trying to say.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, how does that teach her How does she grew up."
512.0,Patient,She doesn't that's that's the whole point of all of this is the big lesson learned is being missed because they'll be emotional capability to do these things they're not providing for her.
105.0,Provider,"you're getting no argument for me. there's you feeling it's not easy to switch from one thing to another, there was no need to switch just needed to stay. talk more thoroughly about, and you can continue to do it because i'm here to listen what's it like. This thing you just did I want to teach you this life skill. yeah and are you doing it. what's that like."
512.0,Patient,i'll bet yeah.
105.0,Provider,What is it that you think would happen.
512.0,Patient,I think. I think my dad is really threatened of that and that's why it worked so hard to keep us apart.
105.0,Provider,"If he knew, his wife had been smoking. And bing. Is. His wife. and his daughter. The secret would be out what is it that you think would happen."
512.0,Patient,"Well, growing up my dad instilled in us. Let me just say this way my parents, we were really young five or six and my brothers my parents got into a fight and my dad took us camping for the weekend, probably the funnest camping trip, we had been up. But we didn't know that he took us without telling my mom. And when we got home and my mom was really upset and I was looking through a person I found cigarettes a pack of cigarettes and he pulled it out and my dad from that point on just said, if your mom ever smokes I will divorce her just drilled into us. This up. Because he's so perfect."
105.0,Provider,"No wait a minute wait a minute. What just happened. He put you responsible for keeping the marriage together, you understand. Children babies. You are five and six years old, responsible for keeping the marriage together. that's ridiculous."
512.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,Never should have heard it. Even if it was said to wife.
512.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"You little ones. had to keep your family together, the only way to keep it together to keep."
512.0,Patient,and
105.0,Provider,Only one.
512.0,Patient,Right at that same time is when the sexual abuse start. yeah a House of secrets.
105.0,Provider,"So let me come back. Okay you're doing great this to touching in to some really old. conditioning that happened. What would happen because you're in a growing body now may not feel like it, but. you're in a grown adult body. Well, what happened, do you predict, if you. don't get caught up on on the execution of this dad can't have secrets anymore so healthy for my daughter. she's been been your your wife. My mother. has been in some way or another. Asking family members to not tell you she's been smoking. That is not been good for us to hold that secret, but we have held it. To keep you from leaving it has been a burden. It has been a sickness. And it's happening to my baby girl. And I know you love her dad not healthy for her. i'd like to break that. What you decide to do is your choice, but making me responsible or Sophie responsible for holding a secret, it was none of our business to hold is toxic. Now. Not so much interested in how I deliver that but I want to know what you think would happen."
512.0,Patient,My mom my not or speak to me again.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, keep talking what else."
512.0,Patient,and My dad my call me a liar.
105.0,Provider,Okay. What else. liar liar. Then what keep going what else.
512.0,Patient,"I don't know what after that I whatever feelings, they have I i'm not in touch with."
105.0,Provider,You haven't mentioned Sophie.
512.0,Patient,I would hope that they wouldn't take any about on Sophie.
105.0,Provider,"You have confidence that maybe your mother wouldn't speak to you, you are confident, he would call dad to call you a liar, what do you think will happen to Sophie. What do you think your mom would do."
512.0,Patient,It but. I don't I don't know my mom would to selfie but selfie with see. I don't even want Sophie to see.
105.0,Provider,You can't even say it.
512.0,Patient,I can't say it.
105.0,Provider,You just got to get better.
512.0,Patient,I know I try it.
105.0,Provider,You just got to get better.
512.0,Patient,I know. I know.
105.0,Provider,You gotta get that girl.
512.0,Patient,"I know. And so, and all of her out of here."
105.0,Provider,yeah you have to toxic environments.
512.0,Patient,"I do, and that's what makes it so I didn't see her that I know i'm not perfect, and I can guarantee everything but damn it I would make sure it was okay. And we won't let me do that oh."
105.0,Provider,"And I can't advise because i'm not in your body I don't know what the real limitations are i'm just taking what you say, and I believe you."
512.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,If you can't deliver pizzas if you say we can't get these two kids out of there you go be a mom.
512.0,Patient,I know.
105.0,Provider,"When i'm with you i'm here for the long game don't give up on therapy, though, whatever."
512.0,Patient,i've got two months. Two months.
105.0,Provider,"The obligation as a parent. And the obligation to the self is just they're just neck and neck it just right there just right there it's like where do I do to make sure it's for me, because without you. there's no chance, so we got to get you healthy."
512.0,Patient,"that's, that is what i've been working on the last year. I remember this time last year I was so abusing xanax and suboxone it just. icky feeling and I have. done a lot. And that's helping me go into the surgery. that's our future. Your future."
105.0,Provider,So. Would Sophie be able to comprehend. Some of what we've talked about.
512.0,Patient,yeah I. think she might resonate more than I would like to.
105.0,Provider,But it might give her a chance to come out with less scars. feeling crazy.
512.0,Patient,It was possible.
105.0,Provider,"To be able to say. This is happening. I wish I could get you out of it right now. I can't without risking like further injury and then not being able to be there for you like dying. Right, yes, so. yeah like just simply put. But you still in this scenario, get to the mother and say this power. That you have to tell this secret, although you might enjoy and it gets you some things. is sick. And Sophie. We don't do that in our family this family does and I grew up in It made me sick. kept me sick. You need never have been told the secret put in the middle of it."
512.0,Patient,huh yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Never should have happened, and therefore the scenario that you have right now the power, the threatening that to do. would never have existed. that's the station, you may way and decide whether your daughter psychologically capable of understanding it. hmm so that she does not live with the secret and and grow up thinking that that's the way relationships work. is about. Power differential which your family has dad is the central. power. But that's not a healthy relationship and she doesn't know anything other than what she sees."
512.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,The only reason why I don't tell dad is because I can't scoop you up out of this House.
512.0,Patient,She know.
105.0,Provider,She knows.
512.0,Patient,Oh yeah. But.
105.0,Provider,The only reason why I do not tell a secret. Is because I cannot get you out of here right now. But you're using that secret sweetheart is an attractive.
512.0,Patient,"Right and that's The other issue is that um. When I used it to manipulate my mom I couldn't even bring myself to do it and use it against her until it was my choice or drugs. Right to it hurt me, and so it hurts me that Sophie can do that, and you know threaten her Mimi and without having that like oh God that hurts."
105.0,Provider,Your mom. that's the job it's incredibly painful to have our children reflect back to us some of the things we don't like in ourselves but that's the job.
512.0,Patient,So true.
105.0,Provider,Your mom certainly won't. She signed up for this relationship. With your father. your daughter didn't.
512.0,Patient,she's strong. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Do you have an opinion about. The net effect of leaving things just the way they are, which is something you shared earlier secrets come out eventually remember that's how you started."
512.0,Patient,"I did, because. i'm. Who has the control to bring out the secrets."
105.0,Provider,"But you do have the ability to be present, with your daughter, and say what you're doing with that. it's not okay."
512.0,Patient,yeah. yeah that's the end linking it to sugar or chocolate or let's bribe you to stay in the room and eating that unhealthy stuff just sitting there that was my other issue.
105.0,Provider,"I understand that you've said in here that you're not willing to tell the family secret because you physically cannot go get her, and these children into a home. yeah what's wrong with her, knowing that."
512.0,Patient,I guess I just didn't want to put more on her.
105.0,Provider,That I know.
512.0,Patient,I know.
105.0,Provider,How was that more.
512.0,Patient,"I didn't know because you would think it was a relief, it would be released. you're right i'm seeing it as it's. It would be a relief."
105.0,Provider,"No. I don't know whether it'll be released I think you're going to have a daughter that will miss having the power because that's how that House works I don't think you're going to hear relief from the daughter you enjoy relief. of not having to do anything, and I know that's probably not fun to hear."
512.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"But you might be protecting your own feelings, instead of. Because you know firsthand how hard it is you know hey earlier will let her know that I know how she feels but you're not doing that. and not when you let her be manipulative like that. that's not that's not meeting her there and saying I get that. Yet right it's unhealthy. There are some we can love people. We can love all the good things they do, and sometimes people. Also do unkind things they don't think it's through. yeah grandparents are in a lot of ways i'm grateful to them, but I want to get you out of here, and if it weren't for this illness, I have this injury compounded with this, and this, and this I would be having you out of here, and this secret stuff. I would be putting the kibosh on it and i'm going to be teaching you if you're living with me it's not okay someone tries to tell you a secret sorry wait wait wait wait, am I, the right person for the secret I don't want to be told anything that you're not comfortable with me telling. Someone else."
512.0,Patient,Like that I like it stated like. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"i'm just a kid. sounds like something you need to talk to another adult about. that's what will happen when you're back living with me and this thing, where you hijack me. Know it's always supposed to be. The adults have a power and authority there's respect between the two. But just one right if you can manipulate the behavior of an adult that's way too much power for title."
512.0,Patient,At 10 yeah that's. Can I can I save this conversation for face to face.
105.0,Provider,"Oh i'm not giving you advice telling you what to do, i'm trying to. Go oh."
512.0,Patient,I just want to take your little face and my hand. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah yeah, this is a big one."
512.0,Patient,It is it's been a bit.
105.0,Provider,"what's your daughter may feel inside. What you're calling relief. Maybe relief inside as in she might be relieved from feeling insane. And betraying her gut intuition, but on the outside i'm sorry to tell you that your daughter may get mad at you. And i'm sorry but you're about to take the one power she's been able to enjoy."
512.0,Patient,It was probably given to her.
105.0,Provider,which was in appropriately given. Just shoved on her. You can love someone and not like their behavior you can teach her about that.
512.0,Patient,Like that so much.
105.0,Provider,But in your family. We don't hold secrets they're toxic can lead to ugly behavior.
512.0,Patient,I like that.
105.0,Provider,"Well, this is awfully tough and you hold all of this, and so much more inside. it's very hard to resist the symbolism of how your insides are trying to come out of you. it's very hard to resist symbolism of that you have held secrets inside."
512.0,Patient,hmm.
105.0,Provider,But he wants out.
512.0,Patient,at us. It does yeah.

512.0,Patient,yeah. i'm thankful for today's session.
105.0,Provider,"You do hear how much you have your choking back you hear how much is there. There is nothing. Bad about you. Know absolutely nothing. The truth in and of itself, if you decide that this is a choice, but you could just as easily tell the truth, get rid of the secrets."
512.0,Patient,We have.
105.0,Provider,"left the ship fall where it's going to land, maybe Sophie comes and lives ovary over there. We don't know. We don't know you could just as easily do that if you wanted to to test this theory. But letting her grow up thinking that this is how the world works. Is it the value system of your family is really the central central question and what can you do within the constraints of this decision you've made wait till your body's healed."
512.0,Patient,yeah.
