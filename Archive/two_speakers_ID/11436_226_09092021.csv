ID,Role,Message
226.0,Provider,"Okay, I did actually do a video. hey how are you."
11436.0,Patient,I sincerest apologies for being late.

11436.0,Patient,"got held up another client the client showed up, just as I was. Coming out to do my therapy appointment and were to go through and do a walk through since I got her yet."
226.0,Provider,Okay. how's it how's it going I haven't seen you in about a month.
11436.0,Patient,"I know it's been pretty good just working hard and I was able to switch my group night my grip session to Wednesday 8pm which works so much better for me. Okay, I didn't know that there was. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Is that with Dr that. Is that Dr. Heller. Oh, it is a shot okay all right good."
11436.0,Patient,Think of. brooklyn accent. I think circuses maybe brooklyn accent.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. A great that's good that worked out, then so it doesn't tell us stressful i'm hoping."
11436.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay. Alright, so me and tell me what's been going on with you."
11436.0,Patient,"Well, the only thing that. The only way it's like you know troubling are affecting me emotionally, is that I have. My deposition is coming up on October eight. yeah and you know it brings it all up, so it means, at least for a few days i've got to do nothing but go through all the records again and take notes and try to memorize the date so like the worst years of my life so. i'm already feeling it, you know i've got i've got a couple weeks and i'm already feeling it."
226.0,Provider,So is your attorney can that piece that.
11436.0,Patient,will be with me yeah. Well we're gonna we're gonna get together beforehand and prep yeah.
226.0,Provider,yeah okay.
11436.0,Patient,cuz i'm going to need it.
226.0,Provider,"So depositions are. depositions tend to not be they tend to be polite. kind of softball questions. they're not trying to trip you up. um yeah it's just trying to get a lay of the land. So um you know I wouldn't stress too much about it and. You know don't try and remember every single date and time. not going to be possible, like. don't stress yourself out with that. You know just they just wanted kind of like a general overview. Of what's really going on."
11436.0,Patient,"I mean it's good because honestly definitely the last year, my short term memory was just shot like I mean it's embarrassing how much. As my mental. capabilities that were just so diminished, then my my memory, was the first thing I noticed and if something had to be wrong, but I didn't know his ptsd and all that just couldn't remember a damn thing like from minute to minute."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so you know deep breaths you know coping skills. don't don't get overwhelmed by this, you know this is this isn't something to be overwhelmed by this is your opportunity look at it this way it's your opportunity to get to tell your story. And it will be in a legal document so it's not just words like kind of out there it's actually you know, on a piece of paper. You know, asked by an attorney all of that kind of stuff so. try and put it in perspective as much as you can as as awful as that whole. So awful as it was you know if you can reframe it that might be helpful for you."
11436.0,Patient,that's good advice.
226.0,Provider,"And don't don't forget that your attorneys she's gonna prep you and help you and you know she's going to give you. should give you an idea what questions will be asked and how they're going to be asked and she's there right beside you so if they get. creepy and weird and aggressive you know she's right there just they can ship, you know, whatever that might be if that happens, you know."
11436.0,Patient,"How much time, do you think I should. devote to trying to you know go through all the documents and remember all that stuff like I was thinking several days I don't know how long I should really think about doing a."
226.0,Provider,"You know what I would honestly do is, I would ask your attorney before you even do it, what does she get back to you in a reasonable amount of time."
11436.0,Patient,"It usually takes a couple of days, but yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so I would just tell ever you do email her leave a message with her and just say hey. Where do I start how much time do I, what do I give me, what do you think tell me what I need to know like narrow this down for me there's a ton of information here, I need this narrow down, so I know exactly where I need to focus. And she'll tell you. Because good dive into it before you get an answer from her. So you like, through this whole thing, remember that your goal is to keep your anxiety as low as possible, this is not something that we want you to be re triggered again and have all of this stuff come up to the surface. So this needs to be done, like at a like at your pace okay like like the map, be very mindful. of how you're feeling internally as you're reviewing this stuff and looking through this stuff be mindful of if if and when you need to take breaks."
11436.0,Patient,"Okay it's all good advice, thank you."
226.0,Provider,Okay yeah so don't. stress on this let's reframe it. how's work are you liking it.
11436.0,Patient,"Still, like it a lot. i'm enjoying it. may take on more responsibility. and take on a lead role, even though, when I first came in I swear I. didn't want to revise anybody. But it makes sense, like they're getting there with this new manager we're getting so much work that it makes sense to have two teams. And so that you know we don't just keep running from location to location which we've been doing. And we can take on more work so that's what i'm prepping for us to be able to take you know one, two, with me. And we'll be the ones going on their on their assignments."
226.0,Provider,i'm half me working is it full time or part time.
11436.0,Patient,"full time except like today, I you know i'm only working nine to will finish champ right now so really my shift is over, for the day sometimes it's an eight hour day, and sometimes it's like a four hour day."
226.0,Provider,Right.
11436.0,Patient,I kind of. Five days a week for sure.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, but it feels manageable."
11436.0,Patient,Very much yeah yeah. Again fun.
226.0,Provider,Okay that's great. Okay how's the psychiatrist use to senior psychiatrists did they get that. Disability did he get all that paperwork in like what's going on with that okay.
11436.0,Patient,"Everything is good on that and yeah. we're supposed to have an appointment and you kind of forgot, because that now and then. But i'm thinking about. asking him to go to bi weekly appointments anyway. Because it would make just my work life easier. And I think I think we can do it and. I know that if I if I really had to reach him. If I really were desperate that I could. And he's what was welcome that, so I think we can at least try bi weekly. and try cutting the cord a little bit. So I trusted him about that."
226.0,Provider,You feel ready to do.
11436.0,Patient,"yeah as long as I, as long as I know, I could reach them if I really had to."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, and what about like medication how's all that going."
11436.0,Patient,"Good i'm still i'm taking the same amount of all that you know each medication, I take and they're fine fine I was thinking about trying to figure out if I should try cutting back on suboxone. In how what that would look like."
226.0,Provider,"I will not do that here's my suggestion on that I wouldn't do that until you have. Until your past this deposition and and you know get get through the deposition and then find out like what the next step is you know, like like find out Okay, you know. Is there going to be a court date is there going to be more depositions find out what what that is and then."
11436.0,Patient,"Just make sure i'm in a really, really safe space before I even think about it."
226.0,Provider,"yeah because you're gonna have most likely you're going to have some. it's going to feel a little bit like a detox like a runny nose. Maybe a little bit of fatigue and all of that, so you want to just make sure that you're mentally prepared that you're not going into a full blown. detox it's not going to be like you're on the floor and you can't get up. But sometimes even people that just get a runny nose start to panic and feel like they're going into a full blown detox or not, but the runny nose May last, a couple of days. So that is one of the side effects of tapering down."
11436.0,Patient,"taper it would be like. By like a quarter inch off the film like. It would be miniscule, so I think I can when i'm ready. i'm going to try it that way and see if I can do you know, a couple weeks with just the quarter inch off in the morning and then see what happens with a quarter inch off the evening ghost and go that way."
226.0,Provider,yeah well how many milligrams every like total every day.
11436.0,Patient,I take a twice a day. or twice a day. twice a day. goodbye.
226.0,Provider,"All right, so what is that, like you're on 16 milligrams or so more than that."
11436.0,Patient,yeah i'm on 16. yeah it was on 21 I started.
226.0,Provider,yeah so you have tapered a little bit sense.
11436.0,Patient,yeah I felt like. I felt like I didn't need to 20.
226.0,Provider,Right.
11436.0,Patient,"I didn't make me didn't make me feel anything in you know any particular way I just felt like something in my body decided that you know, it was a little too much. You know it didn't make me feel high or dizzy or. anything like that I just do maybe a little too much."
226.0,Provider,And how was it when you go for it off that was just okay issues.
11436.0,Patient,Totally fine yeah I didn't even notice it.
226.0,Provider,"All right, well then it might be, you know we might not have any issues you know what I mean everybody's different. But yeah you you just want to make sure, and if you're in a good space before you do it. meant. So. Okay anything like anything else that you that you want to go over any thinking."
11436.0,Patient,"I can't believe what's happening in Texas, and when my mind is kind of blown around that you know. And just keep wondering like how long this trend is going to go on."
226.0,Provider,yeah i'm still watching the handmaid's.
11436.0,Patient,"tale I haven't I read the book years and years ago. And i've been watching watching on hulu and i'm still watching it. You know there's quite a few seasons and. And it's just stuck in my head like is this where we're going like Margaret atwood predicting something here, you know."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah yeah I know there's a lot of there's a lot going on lot of. it's like trauma, you know it's it's it's traumatic it creates it creates a. response right. there's these events that happen that are. I feel insulted select trauma on people."
11436.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it is psychically harmful when you consider what. It is you know, primarily male. base is group has done to women's rights and usually the same people who say my my body, you know my rights i'm not wearing a mask it's just it's insane right."
226.0,Provider,"So also remember this could also you know it is tied to you know what was going on with you at your other job to there's a similarity here right there's a lot of. Like unfairness that's happening so be mindful of like what you're watching you know what you're listening to what you're reading, you know just be just be mindful and be mindful of how it's triggering it to. and try and use that in a positive way, you know, and you know what find your voice through it. Because I think we got some more stuff coming."
11436.0,Patient,"At you right. Thank you right, I used to be so politically active. And it's funny because I just haven't been involved in politics is so long, but my God, you know I mean there was there was a time where I lived in this, you know collective home and. It I don't remember the year, but there was this big concern that abortion was going to be outlawed federally outlawed or in California I just can't remember, but there was a huge panics. And some of the women were teaching other women, how to perform safe abortions in the House at within. Why crazy. yeah it was crazy."

11436.0,Patient,"I would love to go somewhere else but. You know I do need to be in a place where there are open minded people and there's some political safety here. And I wouldn't know how to live in Texas, right now, like well i'd have to move."
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay. All right, so remind me what days are going to be better for you, but with these are good."
11436.0,Patient,"um. So the writings are the day that I have like quietest appointment, now that I have therapy at night it's done Wednesday night. I don't have the panic about too many appointments during the days anymore, so I would say, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday are fine. And earlier generally better because at one o'clock or two o'clock there's usually some major transition and work like. I might have to be running to the dump at that time or there's always. something happening that makes it very difficult so."
