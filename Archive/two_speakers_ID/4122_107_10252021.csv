4122.0,Patient,decided just to come all down and like 40 hours.
107.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. It I know hard to argue, because you know you need it, but then it's like only if it's going to be productive and not destructive."
4122.0,Patient,"Right yeah because I think it was also so dry that. Some areas are even more susceptible for landslide because it was just so dry, you know it's just. yeah it's not soaking in right so. But anyways. So what happened since we last met before, so I ended up not not going away, it was supposed to go away last week. For a little girls trip at my friend to assist meet up with coven so. yeah so I mean she wasn't she's vaccinations too bad, but showbiz late decided not not the best, not the best thing to do to travel so ended up canceling pat."
107.0,Provider,Sorry.
4122.0,Patient,"I know yeah no worries, so it was kind of just a nice. time to be able to get away but it's I don't think i'll have that alone time for probably until next year because between now and in the holidays are coming up pretty. I did I did book myself a quarter of a day spa day for this Friday so."
107.0,Provider,There you go. and make. yeah maybe you just need to make these kind of appointments where you can just get away and have a spa day or have you know time the little retreat of some sort or just healing moments.
4122.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So. Then starting this week i'm just. going to be playing tennis or i'm taking lessons twice a week now so. Hopefully i'll be playing. yeah and then with the weekend, hopefully they'll be playing three to four times a week so. Great yeah so i'm looking forward to that. And then I still haven't heard back from the guy called I left him like another. message, like the week of the week of We talked to him it's still said he was out of office, but um. I will make my list down to another person. If he doesn't box so."
107.0,Provider,what's frustrating.
4122.0,Patient,yeah so I don't know if he's sounds like he's just solo. And then he had left two colleagues and I try those numbers and it didn't. Work so. yeah.
107.0,Provider,that's a bummer.
4122.0,Patient,yeah yeah because I was just looking forward to.
107.0,Provider,Getting it.
4122.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah and then the common method that. looks very interesting to me so. yeah yeah but i'll see if I can find another.
107.0,Provider,"I wonder if it would be you to look into the gottman institute themselves like 99% sure they have a website and if they have like a list of providers and. Maybe contact them directly and just say hey i'm i've been trying to reach out to some people locally and here's who I talked to. And do you have any suggestions or maybe just kind of reach out to them, because I, I agree with you, I think that that would be a great method for you and your husband and maybe they have some pole. or some workshops, or you know, like if you deal with them directly, maybe they have some other ways to help you."
4122.0,Patient,Right okay yeah that's actually a good suggestion just seeing who's a certified.
107.0,Provider,"yeah because. They may not. Or maybe there's an updated website or different information, maybe so. Somebody new."
4122.0,Patient,"yeah he did look into them a while ago, again I must have heard them actually I think it was a burn a brown podcast. She was actually interviewing them and then i'd look them up because i'm like oh I kind of like their philosophy yeah. But yeah they definitely do have. classes and stuff but. Pretty steep so. Maybe we'll just try to see that that's the style that we want to go with before spending $5,000 were."
107.0,Provider,"Yes, couples retreat weekend."
4122.0,Patient,Okay yeah retreated.
107.0,Provider,"Oh no well. yeah let's see, but I do know that they they've done a lot of research and they've they've worked hard for it, so you know becomes. The price kind of if I dare I say it comes to them honestly, but that that is definitely a lot of money to invest you're not even sure it's going to work so maybe you can ask them like do you have something you know, are there were interested, but you know. got a little baby intro or something. yeah sort of him was it what's the introductory level. Can we get that please."
4122.0,Patient,yeah just get a one hour class and what. it's like and then maybe an. All day thing and then they'll commit right.
107.0,Provider,Can I work. towards it yeah yeah I mean it can't hurt to ask right.
4122.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah so um. But that's that's kind of that and then nothing is really progress, I did kind of. don't know which part of my brain just kind of failed but um, so I think I was on the lexapro and last time I was talking to you and feeling. A little bit better. So it's just been so busy. That I kind of kept forgetting, so it was like every now and then i'll take it. And then. Like I don't know why, like all of last week I just remember day I was like because i've noticed like in the past. Maybe a week or latter half of the week i'm. A probably nothing I wasn't going to go on this trip and be just maybe because I forgot today take the medication i've noticed i've just been. Very irritable. very annoyed and just certain things and I don't know if it's just also him the way he's talking back to me too and it's just like i'm trying to like hey don't let this get to me but. I don't want a dog domain organism like this it's just really. frustrating and annoying so anyways. I so i'm trying to take it against, I have noticed that yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Well, consistently taking your mental health, I think, hitting a nice yellow I guess our pink ones too fuzzy ball. strongly and in a very intentional matter will also help it's just a great. Stress reliever, so I think that'll be really good and yeah I I would learn I think kind of do a little more of a deep dive on the actual gottman website because. I really do think that would be a nice combination for you guys so there's got to be some other additional resources, besides the big workshop."
4122.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"How are things going in at home in general in terms of are the kids being a little more responsible, or you just kind of letting them be more responsible house the whole kind of dynamic going you still feel like you have to sit on everybody."
4122.0,Patient,"know I think it's getting I mean my daughter's been pretty good my son's getting a little bit better I think one that one time he had. A badge. When he failed his quiz I think we. Just match, you know. A good job."
107.0,Provider,ends yeah.
4122.0,Patient,"yeah right exactly right and then actually subsequently you know email the teacher i'm like you know how can we, what can we do to support him, like what are what are his learning gaps and he actually did respond saying. As being new to seventh grade A lot of the kids didn't take this quiz seriously so actually quite a few people veiled. side I just think they didn't the kit the students weren't prepared enough. So, which was kind of relieving because then, I was not."
107.0,Provider,It wasn't just him.
4122.0,Patient,"yeah um but then since then to like i've just kind of set up more expectations to have you don't retain a great average of the boss, and you know, like i'm going to take away your screen time or you know. certain parameters so. So, but every now and then he does, just like when when they're when they're on the video games like a time suck they just completely are."
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4122.0,Patient,it's like bingeing TV or something like that.
107.0,Provider,"yeah we don't actually. have to invent time machines you just need to get in front of our computers. At times, and things just it just disappears."
4122.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah so. So yeah I think he just I don't know i've tried i've tried I haven't set like the alarm clock or something and be like if it's. yeah. we're taking a few steps there.
107.0,Provider,"So. This is going to sound like a ludicrous question, aside from the. kind of disappointments of last week, how do you feel like overall things are going to feel like it's kind of gotten a rhythm to it in a in a decent way are we in a more neutral experience or do you still feel like you're swimming against the stream."
4122.0,Patient,"I mean, I think i'm a little bit more neutral, but in terms of just and. I guess my marriage and relationship it's kind of like yeah. I mean I just yeah even know where that is."
107.0,Provider,So right now or in the last week it felt like he was kind of coming at you with some kind of anti gun antagonistic language or behaviors or.
4122.0,Patient,"yeah just as tone and attitude. Like today we. That my daughter's passport expiring um so we anyways we had a passport appointment today. And he actually has been doing it like submitted the application, he found booked an appointment and everything and. Like when he was booking he asked me like Oh, can you take her on Monday, at whatever and i'm like okay yeah so I just was under the assumption that I was just taking her. So I had a meeting kind of like 30 minutes before, so I just thought I can't be driving there right, so I thought i'd drive there early sit in my car eating before and. So I asked him for the paperwork like Oh, did you fill out the. Application for and he just likes it of course i'm like okay. I was just like great. You know, you could have just said yes, I it's all filled out here, it is, and then he's like a nice and where is it and he's like here and i'm like I don't like he has raised us and I couldn't even see i'm like. Yours where. he's like here it's here and i'm like okay well, can I have it, because i'm gonna i'm going leaving i'm meeting to go to first before the. appointment and he's like well we both need to go. To. The. level of conversation it's very like short and indirect and like I don't even know what that means so okay so, then what so. And i'm like Okay, but I have to go to a meeting so i'm going to go there and sit my car and have the meeting for she's like okay. So he gave me the paperwork, I took it and then he's like contagious little baby i'm like I like whatever I was just like left the paperwork on like if you bring all the way they're like I don't know. we've worked right I don't know why, like he insisted on it does it didn't even matter at that point, who has a neighbor workers, as long as you know, we're both going to be there, and one of us are right. that's neither here nor there, but it was just. I didn't make a comment or anything i'm just like Okay, I need to get in the car you get there, because otherwise, so I am just like and it's like I don't even want to talk to him because it's just. Really, the same thing about me."
107.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like you kind of both came from a place of assumption right. As opposed to kind of checking in with each other and that happens when you're already trying to kind of avoid any conflict so you're just trying to kind of do. not really the bare minimum, but the things that need to happen and then there's just a oh gosh there's you know, maybe it's even just an unconscious assumption that it's all just gonna. say he communicated that or whatever, and so the hardest part of this kind of going to the gottman model of is working on on not being defensive. You know, in those moments which that's. that's tough because you're you're coming from all this other stuff right and it's hard to not operate from that previous space of all of those other things, and just. Bring the wall down and just say hey just checking in with you today here's what I was thinking, I understand we're doing the past for the passport thing needs to happen and here's what I was thinking is that cool. Oh no we both have to go oh okay cool I didn't realize we both need to be there Okay, how do you want to work that because i've got a meeting. And so I was thinking I didn't realize we both had to go, so I was thinking, I was just going to go with her, you know half an hour beforehand and sit in the car and do that but. Now that we both have to go I don't think you guys want to hang out in the car with me you want me to drive over there separately like, how do you want to play it out. And, and even though it may require a lot of energy on your part, to try and keep breathing through it and just play come from a place of curiosity. At least you know you're doing your part to not contribute to it because, again, if we go back to your in your lives forever because you got these kids, if nothing else, it teaches you how to practice how to communicate with him when he's behaving in a tense frustrated manner. And I mean that's a good life skill in general it's, not to say that it's on you, but it's less stressful for you, if you manage your side of the street right. So you know I know that when we first started talking, I was like, why is this all up to me and I totally get that and, in some ways it is up to you, but it's up to you, so that your health is taken care of. So that you aren't walking around with this big gigantic ball of stress. And feeling like it's all it on some level that the family meeting to breathe in and out and take care of all their businesses up to you, learning how to let go of some of that and also figure out what is your responsibility. has been kind of the core of what we've been working on you've done a great job with that, but he is kind of the last frontier because there's such an emotional. nuclear bomb around all of it. You know, and you guys are both walking around each other and eggshells you're both kind of Dreading somebody being pissed off and. upset because you have enough history, now that that's you know of course that's where you're coming from. So they talk about in the gottman thing, though, for apocalypse you know four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and kind of the things that become a problem, and one of them is stonewalling and just. You know shutting the other partner down and just not engaging and so again, if you look at it from this isn't your responsibility to fix it. But it is your it's an opportunity for you to not engage in those behaviors so that you have a better life experience and a better. way to communicate with him, he has his own work to do, and he definitely has his contributing factors to that. But if you can kind of as you're learning about these things and working on this stuff work on your way you engage him, then that will maybe. give you something to feel like you're doing, because as to your point you're trying to get the therapists going you're trying to get this stuff happening it's like ah you're a Dewar you got to get something going here. So maybe it's about educating yourself on those tactics and learning how to engage it and. you're not going to let them get you down."
4122.0,Patient,Right.
107.0,Provider,"I mean you're it's this isn't about winning but you know, at some point there's a little bit of like you got to have. Some skin in the game you got it like what's the point well, the point is this man's going to be in your life for the for the rest of your lives, so you know how do you approach him well here's another way to approach them. And then that will result in whatever that's going to result in, but at least it's you keeping your side of the street. And then you go play tennis and you go take it out on that little yellow fuzzy creature, and it can get hit really hard and that feels very good when we're frustrated. All for it, and then you can grant."
4122.0,Patient,So you get some really good breathing in.
107.0,Provider,And ever since that Russian tennis player who's you know so pretty and just granted so grossly. Now we can all grunt grossly and it's accepted.
4122.0,Patient,it's funny how society is that certain things right.
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4122.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,"And I like half days you know take little moments, you know schedule spa times and maybe you go maybe you just. Maybe there's an opportunity to join a spa you don't always have to have services, maybe you can just go and hang out, and you know just. Take some downtime and be quiet and being that Zen space just give you that headspace where you need you know just that opportunity, I think that would be amazing."
4122.0,Patient,"yeah it was actually funny because, last Tuesday was eating when the wind rain started, and that was the end that was my last tennis lesson of. The premier series. yeah, and so it was all good, and you know the rain was can we only the rain was coming right, so it was like I call the tennis in our like. You guys still going on there, like yeah until you get you know notification from us, and so i'm like. I was texting, my friends, and like I knew i'm gonna try that all the way there and it's going to start raining so of course i'm like I don't know five minutes away and it started, but I still. wanted to wake up it's like and they just keep it open because that was like my you know my trip had already been. cancelled yeah."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
4122.0,Patient,And I was like and then my friends were like why don't you just go like drive around or like just go to target like go to on target just go somewhere where you can just have.
107.0,Provider,An hour two hours around.
4122.0,Patient,yeah I know it was just.
107.0,Provider,Like I just need that's where it's nice if they have some sort of indoor court or something or I know.
4122.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah yeah sure. That okay i'll look into more of the Batman and i'll give the guy a call again and and also see if I can find other therapists that are in the Bay area as well.
107.0,Provider,yeah I think the communication stuff and just learning more about it will really kind of resonate with you so.
4122.0,Patient,"um I had a question for you so i've been trying to get in touch with the finance. People, but there were, I noticed actually. side I think balance which I was like this is weird but then I figured out from my insurance, that the way those three times they were built it was built so apparently there's two blue cross Blue Shield. And they build the one that's at a network, not in network and anyways sorted out, but when I checked in earlier, I asked him about it and they sent me to a zoom room I guess Louis or louie. louie's and I yeah and I was on there for like 20 minutes and."
107.0,Provider,"said i'm going to include you guys both an email. Okay, and you guys can coordinate a time to meet. So we. tried to meet with you today. Not. To. Okay perfect so he's really good about that and then it's fine to even have his email, and then you guys can connect and set up a time and that will just be easier for everybody."
4122.0,Patient,"Okay, and there, because I know some of the care coordinators are not or offs like well not just or they're not."
107.0,Provider,There right.
4122.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,"There were luis's so if he's in the Philippines or not so, but they they work they typically work Pacific standard time hours for the most part, so. You guys can work something out where it'll make sense. His scheduled won't need to be like some weird nine o'clock or 6am or some crazy."
4122.0,Patient,"thing OK OK, I just want to I didn't know because I was going I was like. wait for me. i'm kind of busy and yeah yeah yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Totally so this will be easier, then you guys can just coordinate that slow begin."
4122.0,Patient,Okay alright sounds good.
107.0,Provider,Should we figure out another time to meet is there anything else to shout about before we do that.
4122.0,Patient,No i'm sorry I guess the.
107.0,Provider,yep. yep 430 is that okay.
4122.0,Patient,Yes or. No for 30 words.
