480.0,Provider,yeah. Is that table for you. To get increased depression in the fall like when the weather's changing.
4654.0,Patient,But normally it's just that whole. Everything that's been you know going on with RON. yeah and that because him and I talked here recently oh. yeah we haven't talked in a while so yeah we had a conversation on. Last week.
480.0,Provider,In person or on the phone nope in person I.
4654.0,Patient,"went over there, so needed to get my paycheck and. He just didn't seem right no it's just going there and leaving that was my plan. And I. was just going through gathering up the rest of the paperwork in the office. And you know just I don't know my gut feeling was there's just something not right, so I like a dumb dumb stayed and talk to them. which I probably shouldn't have. um. I I really don't understand him. yeah at all, and I think what kind of ticks me off is it's like it seems like nobody on his family notices really what's going on with them yeah. He was telling me he's really depressed and you know same thing he just doesn't want to do anything. yeah and I was trying to make him look at the positive of everything in his life. You know, and what it how hard he's worked for worries at you know he owns his own home, and you know he's got a good family. You know, and then I started noticed after and I was got done talk until that. I got more negative about towards myself. First outside talking he started he actually started crying and i've never seen him cry before i'm."
480.0,Provider,Waiting 17 years you've never seen him cry nope.
4654.0,Patient,"wow that's big the guy never shows much emotion at all, so we went back and I started talking with them and it felt weird because we're in the living room where everything happened, and so I went and I didn't stay in the same position, I went and sat down in the chair not standing. You know which wouldn't have been a very good escape route, but great."
480.0,Provider,Just.
4654.0,Patient,"You know just trying to. be calm and relaxed and you know push past all that you know that I looked at most notice the hole in the wall like oh great you know and and I had asked him really nicely because he's sitting on the. couch same couch. But he was sitting on the arm of it, looking at the TV and I just you know I asked him I said, you know, could you just please turn the TV off, and then we can talk and. So we started talking. And we got on the subject about that day again."
480.0,Provider,He bring it up or did you.
4654.0,Patient,"he's he brought it up. Okay he's um. Because like I told him i'm like I. I get that he's depressed and I was bringing up a lot of you know, natural things that he can do. You know I go i'm sure is low on some vitamins and you know the bees, I actually bought. De de Tu I try now. was to have good results so yeah i'm. You know, not always seems to help, and I was doing research that the two supposed to be better than D3."
480.0,Provider,um.
4654.0,Patient,"So you know it's just Brett talking to him about you know all the stuff i've been learning and you know my group, and you know just how to handle stress and you know anxiety and all of that, on. I don't know if he's still taken a xanax at night or not, because I know that can be a big factor of causing depression yeah on. His clean and my clean are two different things. You know."
480.0,Provider,xanax is okay.
4654.0,Patient,"yeah as long as he's not doing any of the hardcore pills and stuff, then you know. We we just talked about you know it's just trying to get him to look at the positive in his life that you know we're opening up a business, you know it takes a lot of courage to do on. You know just trying to point out all the good things you know and it's just like well the monitor all the monetary stuff doesn't mean anything to them. And i'm like well I go you've got your family your brother, you know and. You know, everybody around I go, I know that they love and care about you and I. Probably could have worded it better, but I know for myself, it was. I started feeling really down and. Thinking I started thinking about myself and everything because i'm not close with my mom anymore yeah. nor my brother It just seems like if something major happens at so me talk. And I found myself, you know when I was driving leaving that. I was just really. bring it up just bad things about me of. You know. That i'm not you know, like he should be grateful because his moms like you know they're all the time is beck and call me I put it like that, but um she's very involved in his life. yeah you know and she's there in person, you know I said I don't have that you know I go like your brother I go you guys are all really close family I go I don't have any of that. I kind of put it like well, you could be sitting where i'm at, and I have anything. Right, you know i'm. same thing with the kids you know it's not close to them. and Then we started talking about. So I was talking to him about in trauma, you know in my life, and when I was little different things that have happened, you know, and I go that day just really. I mean just brought a lot of shit to the surface, for me. yeah on."
480.0,Provider,What specifically did you give them examples.
4654.0,Patient,"I know you're you're saying parents. You know it's about my brother and my dad. Okay, he doesn't know the end depth about. You know exactly what happened with my dad he just knows that he did thanks to me yeah i'm. You know, as a little bit about. He doesn't know much about my mom, but it was like I told them that you know she's. And I thought about this after a price and I told him so much, but. Excuse me, but me I was like my mom being you know, an alcoholic, and I mean I grew up with a lot of abuse yeah you know I saw a lot of physical abuse with my mom and my dad and on, and so I just told him I go I go, you have no idea. really what i've been through yeah you think you do, but I go you don't know everything and how I really felt going through all that you know, and I go, it is hard for me to get close to people and I go because seems like I go something always happens and it's gone."
480.0,Provider,Exactly.
4654.0,Patient,"And I go that's kind of what happened again yeah um I go I lost your mom you know your family you I go I lost all of it yeah you know and it's like I feel like I lost, you know. You know my daughter, and my family some of my family through the whole thing i'm. Not not comparing the losses, but it's like he didn't really lose anything i'm still working for him and doing what he wants."
480.0,Provider,Right.
4654.0,Patient,"You know and it's like how it, you know I just don't see I you know. colton still lives there he still got the relationship with him, and you know I just told him I go, it seems like that's all you gave a shit about was making sure you start a relationship with colton."
480.0,Provider,Right.
4654.0,Patient,"You know, and I know you're more worried about. You know, like losing losing his guns and it was me. So. And that's kind of what I told them I go, you know how did he. Now really say a whole lot."
480.0,Provider,"of things like so there's a difference between hearing it and, like. Really hearing it do you think he, like let it sink in the gravity of what you lost."
4654.0,Patient,"I I don't know hmm because I. know we started we're talking about. That day and he still says that he did nothing basically and. She and I turned and looked at the wall and I said well. I go you left a hole in the wall from the remote is like wouldn't throw it out, and I said I never told anybody ago that you through the remote out me right. Like well i've never told anybody that you've hit do they try to hit me I said never said that you know, and I said, told the same thing to the COP you know when I read the police report and the copies, the word assaulted I never said that he assaulted me, I said that we had a like shuffling. Right entry on. You know so."
480.0,Provider,Just so you know. That is technically a salt because.
4654.0,Patient,If he put his.
480.0,Provider,"hands on you like they're not wrong and saying it was a salt, but I understand that you aren't doing that."
4654.0,Patient,it's just such as I don't know just it's a strong word I.
480.0,Provider,i'm.
4654.0,Patient,"i'm having a hard time wrapping myself around the whole thing still you know and it's just like and I looked at my said, you know what about the hole in the wall from the remote. You know, and I call you when you through that I go, how are you feeling right was kind of absurd and I said now I go, you are angry I go you're pissed. And I go the force that you through and he's like well you just told me working to be working for me, and you know. And that's when I and that's all they said I looked at my studio notebook that's Nice because I said that's, the only thing that is important is that, and I said I told you, I just broke up with you and I said that didn't matter. As long as I work for you, I said that's all you seem to give a shit about. And you know he's like well you know i'm just stressed out about all this stuff and I said you're always going to be stressed out about something in life. I don't care what it is like oh it's how you start dealing with everything yeah you know, and I go pushing me away and acting like I don't know whatever however you feel I said but I go you why can't you just tell me to my face that you do not want to be with me. I go, you can, and I did I told him I said, you have no problem telling my son that you doubt We broke up and that you're you broke up with me and you don't we're not going to see each other, but I go you can't seem to tell me to my face and I go you still can't. break and I go I don't get that, like all you've done for the last you know, seven, eight months is confused me and I go it's not fair to me at all and I go i've done nothing but be here for you as your friend and you know everything, and I said nothing seems to really much matter. Right, and you know just for me, I was just. Getting I wasn't getting mad I was just more. I don't know it just hurt. And it's like there's like no emotion in the in him, you know and it's. You know, so I just you know, finally I just said, you know I just gotta go cuz I you know went out and I started crying and you know it's like you know so just give me a hug before you go and you know I gave him a hug and. You know that was pretty much the end of the conversation and then. I are we didn't talk for a couple days I tried calling them or I texted him. And he didn't text me back for a while. and So I try try calling them or text them that I just I just see it somebody to talk to you know I couldn't get Ahold of my daughter anybody and. in bed for two days you know at that point, and you know it's like oh i'll call you back I gotta get to a job, but i'll call you before that and it's like I didn't answer the phone when he did calc so it's like. He isn't going to really talk to me, and I know that because he's off, he was going to go do a job. yeah um."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and even if you do talk to him he's not somebody that's validating for you, so you usually end up leaving the conversation more frustrated than. You start yeah."
4654.0,Patient,So I didn't didn't really um I don't think I talked to him after that. He called about some about the. Always sell one of the vehicles. I think that was our last conversation I didn't say anything I didn't bring nothing up um.
480.0,Provider,So why was he initially crying if you haven't seen him cried like what triggered. That in him.
4654.0,Patient,"I think he's struggling with not doing pills because. Those, like he felt better when he was on pills, is what he was saying Okay, and it was like I told him Michael this is going to take time. And it's a process and I go you're you know all your neuro transmitters I set up in your brain I said all that stuff's gotta you know take time to do what's repair work. Exactly and and I just told myself drinking alcohol is not going to help that no, you know I go, you were doing great there for a while I said get back into doing meditation like you're doing you know, and I go you got to start doing stuff here. i'm here i'm preaching and I should be doing the same thing to my for myself um."
480.0,Provider,But you are like that's The difference is you do have coping skills and you're in therapy and you are gradually getting better he's just. dropping.
4654.0,Patient,"and I you know. I started like I told my so I don't know what to say to them or do anymore, because it's a. there's nothing I can say. Exactly and I owe you and all he's the one I go, you have to figure out what's going to work for you and what you want, out of life. And it's. I know that i'm not part of that, and I have to get that through my thick head and just realize. and"
480.0,Provider,"Well, and I think you know that you don't even want that it's just because it's familiar and comfortable. Right yeah."
4654.0,Patient,"I think After talking with my son again last night it's. More of that reality, because you know, like my kid was saying he doesn't do anything he's really depressed he's not doing anything um. You know, and I can't take that on to be my problem because I always have done that, with him. yeah and I am the one that suffers for it yeah um. And that's, I guess, something I really noticed that was from group the teacher, how to. How to do a exercise, and you know, one of the things in, there is the I do tend to take on the person's problem. yeah and I was starting to do that that day, and I think that's what kind of set me down in my depression, because it's like i'm always wondering. Why, why did it turn out this way, what did I do wrong, and you know, and I just told him I, you know that day I go you're always you're trying to make this all out to be that it's all my fault and I go i've got pictures of all the bruises. You know, and I go what how they were days later he's like well you scratch yourself on the fence i'm like well I probably did, maybe, but I. I go there is no scratch mark on me, I was an actual bruise."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4654.0,Patient,"You know and it's like. I go and I looked at him I said, why did you get off the couch. I go you didn't even have to get off that couch. yep I go I told you, I was leaving but no, you decided in that moment, like oh that was your choice, not mine. And I. chose to get off the couch and I go you chose to come after me. I go, I made the decision before that happened and I said I was told you, I was leaving. yeah you know, but I go, you are pissed off, and I said that's the honest of the whole thing you were pissed."
480.0,Provider,"He was he acted on his emotion, which is yeah that's what he's not understanding is that he. Like he's so hell bent on avoiding responsibility and he's not seeing that part of the whole picture is his inability to cope with his own emotions right, because if he had coping skills, then. He wouldn't be as stressed out he wouldn't be as angry, he would know how to handle all of that, without it becoming a problem."
4654.0,Patient,"yeah and. I think that's kind of what i'm waking up to is he's still not dealing with. Any of it and those moms just going to keep calling them and not make them. responsible for anything yep you know he's his roof, was shot she paid for a new roof form it's like he's not responsible for anything."
480.0,Provider,Is a shot like with a done.
4654.0,Patient,Oh no the there was leaking and.
480.0,Provider,"Although okay. shot like isn't broken, I was like man i'm in shock is."
4654.0,Patient,"Very it was an old roof, and he just ignored it and let it go and let it go and then finally have her first come over, but I noticed he sent the all the estimates to his mom and. She paid for it, just like everything. You know and it's like I sat there thinking and I talked to my son last night, and I said, you know it's. Such a relief, you know in my son even brought up to for himself he's like. He goes yeah because I got arrested got hauled off to jail and the police car, you know, but he goes i'm the one that did it to myself, he goes, yes it is what it is, took the responsibility, and that was that."
480.0,Provider,You know.
4654.0,Patient,ron's not doing that.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and what's frustrating well, not even frustrating mind blowing to me is that he's dug his heels so deep into this denial that it's like you would think after almost a year, this was almost a year ago right."
4654.0,Patient,yeah yep.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so almost a year later, there would be some recognition of Okay, I did have a part in it, but he's not even there to like he can't even say that he has a small part in it he's putting. All the blame on you, which is so mind blowing to me."
4654.0,Patient,"Well he's trying to say that I came in there all irate and upset and not you know, and I go I wouldn't have mattered."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly, even if you. Did that's not permission for him to act, the way he did."
4654.0,Patient,"No, and then on the police report, it says he made a note, the only comment, he made on there was, I had two hours of sleep. And it's like okay and that's The other thing I brought up to him I go, you know I go, you yourself, they go no, you have an anger problem Michael you have your whole life. yep either back when you i'd before even met you at Ben lie go everybody said that you had an anger problem you were very difficult to work with you, and everyone told me when even build a product will get another job. wow you know and it's like. I go I don't everybody that knows me knows, I am not a confrontational person never have been and I never will be it's just never been in my nature. You know and. So I you know I I just I felt good about part of the conversation and then some of it, it was I just. I just felt like. Just depressed again, you know just though all the same old bullshit."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm wondering, because he was vulnerable and pricing, it would be natural to have expectations that Oh, maybe this time the conversation will be different. So that was probably part of it, too, is like your own expectations of oh wow he's finally giving me emotion, maybe this can be a productive conversation, and then it wasn't again."
4654.0,Patient,"yeah that. I just you know it's like I told him I go from when we are talking and December I go yeah no problem, expressing your feelings and opening up. And I go from that time to now I said it's like two different people. yeah and I go the words you've said to me, and how you express yourself, you go I go and many people i've read it too and they've all said the same thing that the impression he gave me was we were getting back together and he really wanted to work on it."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4654.0,Patient,"You know and that's I, and I told him Michael but I go here we are, like we've always been, and I go i'm the one that talks you there is sit there silent, we get nowhere in conversation you say you'll call me later we'll talk about it later, and I said we won't. exactly know and I go I know we want yeah because it's the same it's been such a routine pattern our whole life or you know or the whole time i've known you, which has been 17 years I figured it out actually yeah and i've only known as mom through that about. Five years of it."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
4654.0,Patient,yeah she never gave me much time of day. I went through.
480.0,Provider,Five years of a 17 year relationship.
4654.0,Patient,"Not like i've know i've met i've we have used to go over there for. The only holiday was a thanksgiving we're all a family would get together and then we would do a Christmas thing together. wow that's it so it was never like a one on one of you know, talking to me she's had more one on one with bronze on brother's wife."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
4654.0,Patient,"that's you know there, she is close to everybody in the family, I mean. Nobody ever comes up and says hi hey how you doing Jody and all that on. You know I just. felt like I was completely invisible. yeah um. And now it's just feel like with RON I go you don't realize how I always felt through all of that, you know."
480.0,Provider,"I feel like Even so, even if he did realize he doesn't really seem like he has the capacity to care or have empathy. Like I feel like that's the biggest thing is like we've talked about before it's. he's not even good at faking empathy."
4654.0,Patient,"I don't see you know I don't have time to figure it out anymore, you know and worry about it, you know it's like. When you're told me I have sunlight so i'm like he's just going to grab his balls and just you know figure it out."
480.0,Provider,Yes.
4654.0,Patient,"You know, and I, you know, he would be better off at least admitting some part of that he did something."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4654.0,Patient,"Exactly but he's denying everything, because I went online was researching kind of what could come up and happen what's court comes. And I told my son I go, you might get subpoenaed. You know and he's like you know, and I go abroad may subpoena you I don't know. You as well, you better not it goes on, you know, and I know my kids will be straight with them and I just told my son just be honest, I don't care what you how you feel about any of it, I said just be honest, you know the judge and whoever on."
480.0,Provider,"and remind me your son was not there right, but he saw that hole in the wall, obviously."
4654.0,Patient,"Well, he showed up at the parking lot, where I was that. Oh yeah I was at the park and. I sat there for gosh. Now, like probably a half hour before the COPs even got there. And then my son, I called my son. I just I didn't know what to do you know is like. I was just like I told RON I go I was just I was so scared you know, and I go that's all that was on my mind I go That was all I was thinking about is you know were you going to come after me what was going to happen, I said, you know it's that's what you know that fear came over."
480.0,Provider,Oh for sure that's the ptsd that's that you are literally back in time in survival mode not feeling safe.
4654.0,Patient,"yeah and it's like NUTS was trying to explain to him of I wasn't thinking about like oh wow ron's gonna get his guns all taken away or ron's gonna have to go for a ride in the police car I didn't even know any of that or think of any of that. I was just wanting to stay in my car and feels safe I didn't even want to go home that day. yep you know and it's like he just does not grasp like what he's done and I go this has been going on, I go for so long years and years, and of our relationship. You know, and I go it's many things that you've done through the years that have been upsetting but I go you don't seem to remember, think about all that."
480.0,Provider,Exactly.
4654.0,Patient,"So when you compile everything I go that i've been through I said yeah it does make sense, what happened that day yeah. And I just I said you're just making light of the whole thing I go it wasn't a light situation for me."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, it was incredibly traumatic and."
4654.0,Patient,"And I go, you know I read, one of the past text messages that he sent me in um. I think it was abuse of. see if I can pull it up."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's something a lot of men don't. Understand that emotional abuse is just as damaging as physical abuse.
4654.0,Patient,"Well i've never have. Really dawned on me about because all the. text messages and stuff like that. from the past. Because I was a member, I was gone looking for a job. And he was caught, it was trying to be like me out trying to be supportive about it. And I know that he was getting on. No Tom I would come over and help them here and there, as much as I could. I never said hey i'll come back and work. I can come over and teach that other girl what to do. That you know i've got to keep looking out for myself and my own job. I guess that's a lot of what i've never understood about them is. there's a lot of good things about him but. His mom is just. gotta let them be a frickin man."
480.0,Provider,seriously.
4654.0,Patient,"Well, he always tells me he's like oh you're always on you know colin's a mama's boy and i'm like. Not as much as what you may think yeah you know I go. i've always been there for colton but causes own person, you know it pays for all of his own stuff. He won't accept you know nothing from anybody."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4654.0,Patient,"You know, like when he got in trouble, he made sure that hey i'm going to do it and."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
4654.0,Patient,"But Rania let's say key goes and runs to his mom. It really helped me to go through a lot of the old. text messages, because it was like. He gets."
480.0,Provider,It in black and white.
4654.0,Patient,"yeah just the negativity. I didn't you know it's. i've known he sent me messages you know, in the past, but you know, like. The email he sent me was saying how much has changed and on and on, and when I read that again I was like God he really hasn't changed that much."
480.0,Provider,and wonder why he thinks he's changed so much.
4654.0,Patient,Because he stopped doing pills.
480.0,Provider,"So his behavior has changed, he hasn't changed."
4654.0,Patient,"He thinks his his behavior hasn't changed. And now it's what's funny is because he really thinks that. Daddy has changed that much i'm you know I told him I said, you know you've got to start dealing with whatever the deep down problem is."
480.0,Provider,"Right yeah you. Know i'm an addict. On accident, clearly, it was filling some need that you still have to work on, when you put down the drugs."
4654.0,Patient,"Where. i'm like I was you know, trying to explain to him is. Oh, I went the wrong way oh my God."
480.0,Provider,So looking for text.
4654.0,Patient,"It was right and that's why I explained to him that day was you know. he's got to start figuring out why and he still mad at me. You know he's still got. resentment towards me and that's when I told him I said well why. You know, as I go you got to figure this out and I it's like. I don't get it, why you have to get why you're so angry with me."
480.0,Provider,Exactly.
4654.0,Patient,"You know I said I forgive you for so much stuff that's happened through the years and it's like. Why keep that anger, because I said that's what the problem is going to be."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and I don't think he yet understands that his anger isn't hurting anyone but himself. Well it's like."
4654.0,Patient,it's like you know your mommy going to fulfill everything in your life exactly.
480.0,Provider,i'm sorry but mom can be. Your partner as well.
4654.0,Patient,"yeah i'm gonna figure that out soon. it's like there's you know nothing nicer than. Having you know, a companion that you know that's there that you can come home and tell them about your day cry on their shoulder or just get a hug from that. yeah contact."
480.0,Provider,yep.
4654.0,Patient,"And now it's just something I just told them my goal it's. You can't go run to your mom about your problem, everything your problems."
480.0,Provider,But the problem is you think. You can because mom has been encouraging that his whole life so. The only way it would change is if mom started setting boundaries which we know she's not gonna do.
4654.0,Patient,i'll never ever. she's always gonna have such a hold over him it's not even funny. And it's like i'll never compete with that woman ever.
480.0,Provider,Nobody will that's the problem he's never going to find anybody that is going to be his mom for him and like that's what I feel like he thinks a relationship should be.
4654.0,Patient,"yeah it's somebody you know it's. it's so abnormal and it's like that letter that his. mom wrote and it's like she took all the credit, you know for him come into her and she's the one that's you know done all of that and rescued RON through everything and it's like no you didn't write. it's been cold and I that's we've been the ones that have been through all the bullshit with this guy."
480.0,Provider,But.
4654.0,Patient,"You know, we don't he doesn't ever give us credit for that or say thank you or."
480.0,Provider,Of course that.
4654.0,Patient,"I think I found it. let's see not upset or irritated with you just stressed about taxes and paperwork, I thought you wanted to work, but I guess you changed your mind and want to see me suffer still until I don't have anything left. i'm hoping that you could at least get everything gathered together, so I can take all my tax crap the someone that can do it and get it done. Since you're not down to come back and work sounds like you already have a new job so won't get my hopes up. But it would be nice to know what's going on anyways hope to hear back from you and hope the washer is working good. And this is after he just bought me a new a brand new washing machine which are then asked for, I asked my son on that I wanted it to be through him and me and my son was there and RON when they had in front of colton and paid for it. I behind my son's back."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, but we have to pause and just acknowledge how awful that line was that when you said you just want to see me suffer like that is so manipulative abusive guilt trippy. Not even accurate. Oh."
4654.0,Patient,"yeah that's about thought, because I went out through like I said a lot of my. messages and trying to you know. there's another term I room apart. Then this one here because I printed off what was happening beforehand. i'm trying to figure out word brain knows. And I worry about you know him being you know a little bit just I don't know so when I wrote him that one letter I think I already read that one to. yeah and December 8. And then on December 9 is when he sent my letter to his mom same day. Because I sent it at 9:14am. On he sent it on December 9. And he sent a letter to me let's see. So I would love to be able to talk with you bed that's what they always call me. that's all I have wanted to do since August 28 that's the day that the abuse happened I miss hearing your voice amongst so many other things i'm a different person since then. I want you to know that I wish I was the person I am now when you still cared about me, you know that saying you don't know what you got till it's gone is definitely true. I really hope to hear from you soon I don't have a new number or I would call you and I did leave a message on the other, phone line a while back. I figured out you weren't using anymore I pray I can talk soon you can call me call me anytime and then I sent him back as like RON. We both have changed through the years I do miss many moments as well from the past i've never stopped caring about you when when you really care love someone you cannot shut the feelings off healing takes time. And i'm feeling hesitant to talk I don't know what to say yes, I did get a new phone and number, I feel it was the right thing to do, what do you want to talk about. and And then his next one was just want to talk with you, it would be wonderful to hear your voice to i've missed you more than you can imagine. i'm not angry or mad anymore if that's your concern, I just have some questions and want to tell you a few things. I know it's been a tough year for both you and me, I just never thought this could or whatever happened between us, given how long we were together. And everything we have been through together, I owe you some apologies and would prefer to tell you, rather than message you I know you don't I know you don't care, but I do think about you every. Every and I wish I was a better person, you were my rock and everything, and I should have shown you and told you that more often."
480.0,Provider,yeah you should have. Like that sounds that even sounds manipulative to me.
4654.0,Patient,"When I read read read it many times, after it is because then he said on the on December 10 he's like I ordered you a little something hope you like it it's being delivered today you sent me a big huge. bouquet of flowers. i'm a roses, and I really don't like roses, but. I."
480.0,Provider,Further proof that he is a narcissist and doesn't pay attention to what you need and what you're interested in.
4654.0,Patient,I you know I just.
480.0,Provider,So crazy.
4654.0,Patient,"Say that that's the kind of stuff like I was trying to explain to my goal, that is confusing. yeah how am I supposed to."
480.0,Provider,feel yeah.
4654.0,Patient,"And then, if I didn't want to rush back and work for you, then you send me that kind of a message."
480.0,Provider,yep which that's that's why. it's so. it's such. A mind Fuck to be in a relationship with a narcissist because they're so good at the love bombing and making you feel special and making you feel like they really do want to change and then as soon as they get what they want back to square one.
4654.0,Patient,"Oh yeah it's just right back to being, as you know, manipulative soft and that's. I think what struck me last night, is what. You know Coleman said now, it was. You know, it was keeping the House clean doing the dishes and stuff and rock cotton, just like yep right back to the same way, it was because i've been keeping up on all the dishes and. on getting all of that done. And RON just doesn't you know isn't been doing much of anything."
480.0,Provider,wow.
4654.0,Patient,"I know cuz. On the police report. See ronnie told me God came over to talk with him about the cell phone she was using. to eat, he said, I asked asked if he had any injuries or if any time it got physical. up a backup Mr Lyon God came over to talk with him about the cell phone she was using he continued it stated to get very verbal so she got up and left. I asked if anything else happened he stated know I asked if he had any injuries or if, at any time it got physical he stated know. ronnie said he would never put his hands on God, I told him I had already seen God and asked how she got the red marks on her he said I don't know she only got two hours of sleep. I didn't put my hands on her. gosh. See that's what I don't get that's, the only thing he can seem to have in his head is he didn't put his hands on me."
480.0,Provider,But he did.
4654.0,Patient,"So I I think in his head somewhere he thinks that by how is worded it he's going to get out of this whole thing I was like I was telling cold i'm like does he have any other charges or something because i'm I know, on the one checkbox on here. It was about some. Past something. which I didn't understand but. far as I know, the only thing as as D ways, but you know it's a total cold and I said I it's not my problem, so I cannot make what's going on with him my problem anymore. Exactly it's something that. he's just going to have to face in court and that's just how it's going to have to be."
480.0,Provider,"you're not gonna have to go to court, with him, are you."
4654.0,Patient,"I don't know I hope not. Good I think that all that some. Because the only concern, I do have is because he is still on. He still has resentment towards me yeah."
480.0,Provider,Oh for sure. Even paid me they'll see that this has consequences of his own actions he's still held them on the fact that this would have happened if you wouldn't have been angry which.
4654.0,Patient,But the funny thing is I wasn't even angry that day.
480.0,Provider,"Right, no, it was when. I remember you saying you only got annoyed because you walked in and he, like ignored you so he was still the one who his behaviors triggered you to get angry."
4654.0,Patient,"And that's what I pointed out to him I go reversal situation I go, how would you feel if I was the one laying on the couch. And you're over there, trying to have a conversation with me and I go i'm ignoring you yep and I go and I was talking for quite a while, and he still didn't turn the TV off for nothing it wasn't. That I walked in and he didn't you know respond, I was actually talking to him and kept talking and he just completely ignored me and yeah, then I started getting irritated."
480.0,Provider,Right.
4654.0,Patient,"Like it wasn't like I wasn't angry at him, it was just more annoyed like really. Right we're going through this shit again."
480.0,Provider,Sam combo puzzling like that's it.
4654.0,Patient,"that's like I was talking to my kid last night, like it was just don't get back with a mom don't do it."
480.0,Provider,"i'm so glad that he recognizes that too, because the more people you have supporting you in not being with him the less likely, you are to start going there in your head again."
4654.0,Patient,"it's getting easier, you know I know these last I think it felt better to the more that I can front and say to him, like that day when we talked and I was able to really. Say like get out about the wall, you know it's like I wanted him to know that I saw that on the wall, I know that whether it was from. Right and I wanted to confront him from what he wrote me before to why, why are you saying all these things to me if you don't really mean, though. Exactly you know, and I go all you're doing is you're just fucking with my head I go that's all you've done yeah."
480.0,Provider,"And if he genuinely cared about you, he would not do that."
4654.0,Patient,"And I listened to it a lot and grew and grew some of these men have been through a lot of shit. And, like the one guys like he's really had to focus on. You know just changing some of his behavior you can't change who you are, as a person, but he says, I work on my behavior of my actions of what I do when I feel the certain ways he goes, I have to use my coping skills yeah so I don't fall into that behavior that got me where i'm at now. And that really impressed me i'm like wow man can actually learn that. Right now yeah RON has not learned that and Mike I told his mom way back when I go he needs to be in some kind of a program. yeah that's what I was pushing for. But you know it's like she just doesn't want to see that he's got some issues going on."
480.0,Provider,"You know, we need because we're her that's gonna that's a reflection of her ability to pair it. Like that's My guess is that without knowing her just knowing about her, she takes so much pride in the fact that she mothered this man and so any shortcomings, he has are going to be a reflection of her so she doesn't want to deal with it."
4654.0,Patient,You nailed it right on the head it's exactly what it is.
480.0,Provider,So messed up so messed up.
4654.0,Patient,"I didn't realize how messed up the whole thing really is yeah you know I one thing I do like about my mom is she's pretty wanting out there, you know. You around the bush and. You know she's always trying to help all of us kids but it hasn't been to a point where it cripples us. Right, you know, and you know we all have to face or consequences of what we've done in our lives and my mom's just always made us accountable for it. Even ever since when we were little you know I got the one time she made me walk back into the store by myself. While she was you know watching in the background, but I had to do it all, on my own to return, and I think it was a candy bar or something the bow I don't know, but she made me take it back into the store and apologize to the Cork and return it by myself."
480.0,Provider,"laughing because I made my oldest do that too, I went with him, but I made him do the talking and then on the way home, I was like if you do that again, I will bring you to the police state mission. yeah and you can tell them what happened."
4654.0,Patient,"i've always remembered that yeah. yeah. she's been that way through everything you know it's like my daughter, I know the guy that she was without an $800 bill and she's calling my brother my mom and everybody to borrow money everybody told her no. Nobody would help her out even with you know the kid you know it's like well there's places, you can go and take her you know, to go get heat. yeah we're not giving you any money because we already knew because she's a drug addict or was and. We all learned our lesson and she didn't have my dad my dad didn't even help her out which shocked me because he used to help her out all the time. You know, and I told him like because I was handling his finances and I said no, you can't afford it there's no way but. yeah and that's what's sad because. This one her judy's ron's mom's one son, will you know, really. he's all on his own you know he's got his family and it's like i'm impressed, you know, is it really is just done really well for himself, he takes care of his family she's got you know, a kid that's not his but you know it took you know he treats her like it is his child. doesn't treat or any different but Judy took on her daughter no problem, but she never got to know any of my other kids. yeah so see I do feel alienated in many ways, and they don't seem to see any of that."
480.0,Provider,No one that they've got to know is.
4654.0,Patient,colton oh and brooklyn has been the star child a wall.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, of course."
4654.0,Patient,"But growth is a manipulative just like RON and her yeah. And that's why my daughter didn't want her over there anymore, because my daughter saw that. You know, but."
480.0,Provider,"So Okay, we have a couple minutes left, how are we going to get you out of bed. Or do you want to. stay for days."
4654.0,Patient,No already got out of bed.
480.0,Provider,Okay i'm.
4654.0,Patient,"talking to you right now, but I was actually stripping my bed to actually wash my sheets."
480.0,Provider,"yay Okay, and if you ever get into that position where it's been a couple days you're getting depressed you can email me, and I can just send some encouragement to."
4654.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"I know you don't have a ton of support people but i'm happy to correspond via email, especially if it's something like that I can just remind you of coping skills or I don't know give you positive affirmations or something."
4654.0,Patient,yeah I did do. My chalkboards I got about and wrote some. Positive affirmations and hung those around. My son was laughing like oh my God he goes whatever helps your mom.
480.0,Provider,I love it.
4654.0,Patient,"yeah he's pretty funny but he. actually asked me out for dinner for Wednesday and, yes, I will because i'm going to pick you up and he goes we're going out for dinner, I was like oh okay yeah. yeah he's a good kid. Oh yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your week hopefully it'll be way better than last week."
4654.0,Patient,"that's definitely better gonna be better i'm not focusing everything on like all I was doing was all the paperwork and computer stuff you know at the computer for hours and hours and. And dumb ass me wasn't keeping accurate track of it, you know so i'm sure I worked, many more hours and I got you know, but I just like you know i'm not doing that no more than just you know work my so many hours a day, and now it's just that. You know it's not my problem."
480.0,Provider,I love it you're doing so well yea.
4654.0,Patient,"Telling myself that too that's the boundaries. So yep. Perfect i'll get there it's just taken, I guess, a lot longer than I expected, but."
480.0,Provider,"Listen, it takes what it takes I didn't get good at boundaries until like two years ago and I went to school to be a therapist eight years ago I graduated. So it takes what it takes."
4654.0,Patient,yeah it's hard for longest relationship i've ever been in so I mean that's. When that's when like.
480.0,Provider,"It was easy for me to set boundaries, with new people but it's like family and friends and people that have been in my life for a while those were the really hard ones to start doing boundaries with because. you're afraid you're going to lose them, you know it's natural that's the human condition is people leave so you're scared that you're going to do something to cause them to leave."
4654.0,Patient,"yep that's so true yeah but i've realized that i'm. Now, with RON I even if I didn't call the police, we would still be sitting where we're at nothing would have changed the only. I guess the good thing that came out of it, he at least was honest with me about on why you know, he was mad because he's just got he had so much resentment towards me yeah and now it's just new resentments because I called the COPs on him so you know."
480.0,Provider,"How, you know that it would have always been some sort of resentment towards you because in his mind you're the problem, not him. So it's good that you're finally seeing that like full picture."
4654.0,Patient,"there's no and I told him that that day, too, I remember saying that because I. told him that we would you know I don't think that he would have chosen for us to have a future yeah I don't think yeah no definitely not all right, well, let me get your group, I will see you next week okay sounds good, have a good day hope you feel."
480.0,Provider,Better Thank you bye bye bye.
