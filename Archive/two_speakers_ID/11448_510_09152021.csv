11448.0,Patient,Are you.
510.0,Provider,"Excuse me i'm good i'm. I didn't get a notification that you checked in which is fine, we can still do this session, but just as a reminder, you need to check in for the virtual clinic did you do that, and they just haven't sent me anything I didn't see anything."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I said in a breakout room for like. seven minutes or I think seven minutes I don't know. Okay, for some time and then no one like retrieved me so."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. yeah no worries then i'll let them know that you're good to go, so you make sure i'll make sure you get marked as checked in okay um so I know. yesterday. Oh, my goodness, I am. Life is giving me a message that I just don't have control over things so last week, I was out completely unanticipated due to a family emergency and yesterday at. I don't want to literally I was just starting to check you all in i've lost Internet for a good 55 minutes so i'm so sorry I was able to see you there were a few I was able, I like and I was telling shauntel because she was running late, of course, murphy's. Law and so i'm so sorry and I didn't get to really see you all twice now. And I just I felt terrible did you end up staying on the session, what did you end up doing i'm so sorry I just I cannot I couldn't get back on."
11448.0,Patient,"it's Okay, I totally get it, I mean. Something like Aaron it's kind of like out of our control at that point."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, it was I know."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah um so collectively we just thought at first, maybe you're trying to like maybe got kicked out and you're trying to log back in but because you're the host. We just decided to leave meeting and then try to join again, but no one was like opening it and then, so I was on the lines with like Karen and they they were just like send me sending me back to the room and no one was there, eventually around like like the 40 minute mark or so. shauntel was there, and so I was able to kind of talk to her for like a few minutes about my medication and trying to catch her up to speed, but basically i'm lowering my dosage now just because. i've just been feeling a lot of like I think she says dissociation so she We discussed it over and i'm lowering it back to like just 10 now. Okay yeah and then um yeah I think to other people were able to like catch her at the last minute to win many games yes. But um. yeah the data is basically it."
510.0,Provider,"yeah a wild time, I know, and I missed you out and at least last week there was someone somewhat organized to make sure someone could cover me but. Yesterday was definitely not in the card so i'm really sorry i'm glad you were able to catch her. To chat about your meds i'm okay well how are you doing overall because you know I always look at your surveys and thank you for you know staying on top well actually I say that no those need to be updated. The last time you did them is an August so yeah not too far behind, but I guess a self report Anna How would you describe your Depression and anxiety, do you feel like it's pretty manageable do you feel like it's worse than a these last couple weeks how's it been."
11448.0,Patient,"This suddenly it's like creeping out of nowhere and that's why I was kind of talking to her, because it was starting to come up in my driving again the other day I had. let's see today's Wednesday so Monday I had two very close calls on the road one it was my fault, because I don't know like I was just driving and at an intersection I just assumed it's green it's weird like I think like we're just so custom to just being on autopilot despite. You know, just like a distraction so it's not like I was on my phone or listening to like you know anything crazy. So I had a very close call it was my fault I ended up. I luckily I broke in time, but I just had to do like a hard swerve. And then I, and I pulled over, and I was just thinking like. This isn't over like there's when it gets bad I know it gets kind of that um so later that was like in the noon and right afterwards. i'm selling my sister I was like I don't feel like Karma is done with me like I there's. there's gotta be something else ah she's like just you know stay put stay at home, but you know I had aaron's to do, I had to pick up. kids and. yeah like I was. Like most school pickups situations it always gets really crowded and clustered. And usually i'm pretty good at about it, but then suddenly like. The sky reverses right into me and he's like yelling knowing that it was entirely his fault and at that point, it was just like. Why am I even like Why am I even here, you know, like Why am I having to sit here, listen to this because he knows it was. His fault, he totally like what she did to me, without looking first."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness oh yeah. You weren't heard, obviously. A fender bender defeat you didn't take off or anything, are you going to have to go through insurance things like."
11448.0,Patient,"That no because I think he realized like. He was an idiot like he. I don't know like I. think I was already having a really bad day and um it wasn't like that situation, where it was at the gas station where oh like i'm already like in a bad mood and if someone pisses me off i'm going to really tell it to them. And I don't know why, in this situation, knowing that it was his fault, I was just like I didn't really I felt like so underwhelmed and I just let him yell at me, you know, and it was it was really bizarre and so I was explaining to shontelle like I just feel so detached and. I don't know if it's because of school or my expectations i'm not meeting like certain expectations i'm setting for myself."
510.0,Provider,When this.
11448.0,Patient,"Semester and. And I was explaining to her like my dreams have become like really vivid and i'm like entering like rem sleep a lot I just. I don't know if this is like an accurate side effects of the medication so she did suggest like read me researching into dope mean and if it's something of my interest then to definitely like bring it up i'm. scared of you know, taking on a new medication into the mix and. Then also. um our one on one from last time when we had someone fill in I was looking forward to it just because, like I think i've into a routine now or like I definitely look forward to it at least therapy once a week and. I just I don't know how other people felt, but it was just not a good. situation like the person that they had subbing like."
510.0,Provider,"Oh last week. yeah oh okay yeah no sharing the end feel free to be open and if I need to provide feedback I absolutely well but let's just I want you to speak freely on sorry to hear it, but let's let's talk it through."
11448.0,Patient,"it's okay. It I think she deals with her speciality was. Dealing with people with addiction and you know we've kind of been on this whole like boundary setting theme and there's just so much more to uncover. That, then, you know she was just asked it was just wasn't good I don't know I don't want to say she sucks, but I just don't think like it was a right fit. It was just did I line up with. What the group was wanting, and it was like kind of awkward because. You know, after a time we kind of build a relationship with you and comfortable as a group, sharing with you and so um. I honestly like was starting to kind of freak out like oh like look I like i'm really excited for you and you know there's new endeavors for you, but. On the flip side i'm just thinking crap like I have to go through this process again like and it's um a lot of we talked about like feature controlling like I want corrective experiences like I I don't want to. You know, get paired with like a really shitty therapist who someone who's not going to listen to me, and you know, are they gonna handle the client. handover situation from your cases like you know accurately like. I don't know how. They connected us, for instance, and I don't know if it was randomized or if there was like a specific like. intent or with like background and stuff. But I was concerned, like crap What if I get. A one on one therapist to work with and she's like that lady that you know, we had subbing in where it's just like a filler you know we're it literally like we're talking about serious things where. She was just it was just very like. Well, love laugh live or live laugh love it. i'm not gonna save toxic positivity, but it was just like yeah that must be tough haha it's like. Why do you think we're here I think we're beyond that we understand itself but. We want like some guidance and. We were, I think the group collectively like we also look forward to your screen shares and what you have like. Some, like insight and some list of things on what to be mindful of and. It helps open our perspective, and you know I I couldn't help but start to worry like okay well, of course, if i'm not happy with whoever they set me up with next I can be vocal and I could let bright heart know like hey i'm not satisfied or this therapist isn't meeting my needs. I just i'm Dreading it."
510.0,Provider,"Okay. Oh i'm so glad, though, that you're able to say it out loud. And so, one I can let you know that the person who is covered won't be your assigned therapist because I. That was my first question I when I got back, I think the woman who covered because needed coverage I chantelle needed that. um and I said, is this the person who's going to be taking my caseload just you know I just was curious and my manager told me know so I haven't been told definitively who will, but I can at least tell you it won't be her. And I didn't realize that she there are a lot of there are a lot of therapists a bright heart and what I have learned, even in my short tenure. There, a lot that our primary mental health, which I am i'm a licensed mental health counselor well different States I have different names, but basically that it was my graduate degree. There are a lot of substance abuse counselors that. have not gone to graduate school, they have been trained they do have credentials, but their focus is just that it's substance abuse, so they tend to be paired and are facilitating. Primary substance abuse, so I think she was just kind enough to fail, but it's listening to I think that that's probably why you were like this is really different because I. I I used to do substance abuse assessment and the ERS but I that was never my specialty to facilitate. Even clients on my current caseload or primary substance abuse my lens is always mental health right, and so I you know I get it, I I know what you're talking about I really like the fact. That you recognize that you absolutely can be assertive and vocalize your needs if things just are falling short I love that you are able to say that out loud, because you, you can so my hope. Is the majority of my caseload is mental health in that they will cover they will assign a therapist whose primary mental health that is. I hope so too um, but this is great feedback. Because I haven't had, believe it or not, so I was out last week. i'm looking at some of my other. there's only you're only like my second person who was here last week for group with the person and i'm seeing this week. So I have it, and the other person didn't really say a whole lot but i'm very appreciative of the feedback because I it and I want your permission, though. Can I provide the feedback I don't necessarily have to attach your name, but I can just say hey I had a client, this is the feedback, I want to share and I just want to re emphasize, whoever you're assigning really does need to be primary mental health. Because I think that's kind of what i'd like to share, would you be open to me at least sharing I don't have to attach your name but i'd like to be able to provide the feedback."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah definitely and. Time again like I understand like you know these things happen all the time, like. You know, maybe they just. These needed like someone to kind of at least guide her be there, standing down. But I think like. I don't know just didn't she didn't seem like it, it was it didn't seem like from a caring place it was just a very awkward date like that's what. yeah that's the best way I could describe it like okay. Acting and. Okay well we're not listening to what I really have to say and yeah."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I i'm sorry it it wasn't a great experience, I appreciate you being honest and it does happen, I mean there is just that reality of. Things just don't always go as plan, hence, if I could have been here I would have but yeah so but i'm thankful that you recognize it for what it is, but I know it's kind of sent a little bit of an uptick of some anxiety about Okay, then who will be and what will happen and. I have confidence that they will really try to assign an appropriate equivalent when it comes to mental health, that I, with your feedback, I can really re emphasize the need. Because that's that's really the majority my caseload and someone who feels comfortable with those topics. Now you brought up a really good question or a comment about how you were assigned to me there's no specific formula more algorithm like some other platforms, I think, do. I think you just happen to be starting bright heart when I was starting and I was primary mental health, and I was connected with shauntel, and so it just it was in alignment that I needed to build my caseload so I was lucky enough to have you assigned to me so. What will happen my guest is those that have Sean telling myself and the two groups. It will be the same therapist so, like the majority of you all who are in that group see me individually and say show and tell obviously so i'm hopeful. Though they'll assign someone who's going to manage both those groups that's My guess is absolutely it will be someone but i'm hoping it's mental health, but with your feedback, I can really re emphasize the need for that so."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah so and i'm I just wrote a quick note, so I you know if I happen to stumble across someone that just not a good match I could at least bring it up to bright heart and mentioned that i'm looking for someone specifically in primary mental health, as opposed to you know substance."
510.0,Provider,"yeah I know I mean gosh I would think the likelihood of them assigning a substance abuse to my caseload and I just it would be a head scratcher but yeah. I guess I guess it could happen, I mean I I don't have control over that at this point. But my hope is, it will be someone very similar and background, because that is really the majority of my caseload like I definitely have primary substance but. Like I said, my lens is always okay well let's talk about the mental health that kind of creates some of the behaviors around substance abuse. yeah yeah so um. I hear you I hear you and I, I, I trust, and this is why I gave so much notice and even though last week was not in the plans. This is why I gave so much notice to really make sure there was thoughtful consideration. And that was not, I mean it was about bright heart, but the primary issue is about you all right, my caseload that is who needs to be attended to first and primary. So i'm hoping giving as much time as I did, that will be addressed so but i'm going to forward on the the feedback minus your name. That way, it just sort of really re emphasizes, we need primary mental health in this role so yeah."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I appreciate it, I was really nervous about bringing up an issue because, like. I just didn't want to stress, you I didn't want to like add more to your to do list before you go. But I can't be the only one that thought that, in the group."
510.0,Provider,"And I appreciate you sharing so that way without and again i'm not going to use your name but, as I have appointments that come up and I, and I find out where you here last week for group. Yes, I was Okay, how was your experience and that just opens the door, yes, I do want to hear, I mean, obviously, that is my role and. you're you're not gonna stress me out, I want to make sure you're taking care of in fact that gives me peace of mind that i'm giving you that time and space to sail I, like you know this just didn't jive like this. was not good, but that feedback needs to be provided to bright heart too so but. i'll my takeaway to is any others that were in group last week. That, I see this week I can sort of be able to like how was your experience what did you think i'm sorry wasn't there anything you want to share and it just opens the door right they might not share anything but. You you've kind of helped me put it on my radar now like Okay, I need to make sure i'm at least you know, leaving it open ended if they want to share anything, so thank you. yay yeah how many worrying group I because that's The other thing I don't get those notes i'll be eventually be able to kind of pull up your chart and be able to see it, but I don't even know, was it a large group Do you remember, if there were."
11448.0,Patient,"It safe say, like the usual. And then maybe one or two people that were either new or. hadn't been able to show up for group in a while and."
510.0,Provider,"Okay yeah some people are in different schedules so yeah that makes sense okay well and, unfortunately, no, thankfully, I had a one on one with you, and you know about my status. Yesterday was supposed to be when I notified that group, and there were going to be some that had not so next week i'll be formally. My Internet works. I will formally be sharing that I i've been able to get most now in one on ones, but I think there's still a few that aren't my personal clients so fyi that will be happening. Pending everything goes on. Okay, but I do appreciate you sharing Anna How does it feel just to say it out loud sometimes when we are able to have some agency around and vocalization sometimes just and that act. helps reduce some of the feeling behind it, but I don't know I don't know if that how are you feeling to saying it out loud."
11448.0,Patient,"It feels great just because I do feel like PR by you sometimes you know in certain situations like you expect to hey the other person that i'm like expressing these things about is listening, but sometimes it just kind of falls on deaf ears. And i'm glad that i'm heard and. It shouldn't discourage me from you know speaking up nonetheless despite who hears me or not, but. yeah I think with this. therapy thing you know before in the past it's like how come it's not things are you know lining up or i'm not resolving anything but. I think that's just the journey itself you just have to keep pushing for it and, despite some people having it a little easier than others like I know some people that can afford. You know, great one on one care for like in the hundreds an hour and I can't and I always justified like oh it's because i'm like you know my insurance or. But in this situation that's not the case, like, I feel like i'm getting really great quality adequate you know care and advice from someone that is like open and receptive to what it is that i'm feeling."
510.0,Provider,"Good Emma and I love that you're finding your voice more and more, and I think you're finding it and feeling that power and it doesn't have to be a scary thing it might feel a little different. But you're really finding your voice and that to me that's the healing process when you feel more comfortable to speak up and then the next time it gets a little easier burn a Brown. has one of my favorite quotes so simple and i'm going to blank on it, I think she says. Just by showing up you get a little braver each time and I just think it's so true like I. Am I personalize it just just by showing up doesn't mean you have to say anything but just physically showing up you start to get a little braver and i'm just I think you know that i'm a big fan girl her stuff. And I sort of see that we have you, you know, showing up and maybe each time getting a little more comfortable little more braver. And I think you're also doing it and kind of away from therapy away from group at least some examples you've certainly given me. But how would you like, I and i'm glad we're able to process through it now I don't know if there's anything else you want to talk through I certainly want to, but I also want to. If you wanted to kind of go back and talk about these driving experiences, some of the anxiety, I want to make sure, whatever you want to address today we we give time and our last about 20 minutes."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah so some insight with like my my driving overall um it. My inability to or inability to focus on the road, usually happens when i'm like. Stress but just really avoiding it."
510.0,Provider,And it.
11448.0,Patient,"And then eventually It just shows up in ways that like I don't want it to like why can't this have happened when I was like sitting a home like well, then that would result to like a panic attack or something but. anywhere but the road and I. I know it's it's a huge indicator that it's getting bad once it's starting to affect my driving whether i'm detached with what i'm doing or I have Road rage um. there's been something that's been bothering me, and I think I mentioned this on our last one, one where for the lot for our last sessions, I was kind of hoping to. kind of like how do I deal with people in the past."
510.0,Provider,or oh yeah see that.
11448.0,Patient,"Again, like dealing with people in general but um there have been like instances where all avoid certain personalities, because i'm very familiar with. With how they function, I think you mentioned it like they're like an emotional vampire but it's. People who like. Who will bully you and and gaslight you into thinking that it's all your fault or you're the bad person and stuff, so I think sometimes when i'm driving i'm i'm like. subconsciously thinking somehow like Am I i'm always doubting myself, am I that Am I really that should be person that this person is saying about me like it's not as though i'm planting that seed to believe it. But I hate that. Those personalities are always like I don't know like gravitating towards me, and I think those people in particular they'll like. they'll try to get the attention that they want any from anyone, you know they don't have to be like a narcissist per se but it's just like attention seeking and. Then I realized in hindsight, like is it, am I getting mad just because i'm they're not doing the things that I want them to respecting me leaving me alone like giving me my space and respecting my boundaries boundaries and my wants and wishes. Or is it because. i'm just so used to in a custom to giving them what they want, you know, like um and I guess like seeking validation in that. Because the whole time I thought, like Oh, you know it's other people that are crazy, but I started to doubt myself, and in my growth and not into why am I accommodating to so many people like and it's not as though I have like abandonment issues I. I feel like I had a pretty healthy."
510.0,Provider,Childhood mm hmm.
11448.0,Patient,"But it's just something about like validation and. So when I run into certain people from the past. That I don't like. it's not as though i'm not only like are they just emotional vampires, but I just hate the person that I was when I met them to."
510.0,Provider,"mm hmm I remember you shared that like it immediately kind of almost as this triggering aspect like you immediately think of this person and. It is your past and the past ideally should not have that much power over your present right I didn't coin that term that's accurate totally. But that's part of our healing is when we recognize the past is the past and it doesn't have to have that power because you're not that person. And having that awareness is is really the first step, but can you give me i'm might be easier if there's a specific example I remember. You did bring this up, there was a woman who you recognize that you weren't sure if she recognized you. And you were already starting to have some automatic negative thoughts about the what ifs and when you do that as a reminder, a gentle reminder of course. Your body goes through a stress response and, if you remember the stress response is that hyper arousal state that tends to be where you go. Just by having that thought you kick yourself into that stress response so your body doesn't really know that you're just having a thought it immediately thinks you're under threat. So that's also why I think you can get pretty fatigued and exhausted, because when you have those thoughts. you're having a stress response, but is there, can you give me more of an example of what we could talk through um. I just want to make sure I mean I definitely think i'm hearing what you're saying."
11448.0,Patient,"hey I know I kind of went on a tangent but that's okay. So basically. A lot of it. is like having compassion for myself Okay, like, I know I ended up looking at it like i'm not that person that I was before I am actively working on myself now I can no longer make excuses or hide or. Blame other people. You know that oh it's these personalities right like well i'm kind of fed up with how like the things that i'm doing and it's not working out. So. Aside from that person that i'm oh yeah in regards to that person in my class we've just I think we both we both know that we used to be friends in like high school or something but we're just like very separate so."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, so and you just kind of do your own thing and. And let it just be right there's nothing that you have to do and that's fine it sounds like she whether she you know, has the same instinct like i'm just not going to go there Okay, so no more anxiety or worrying about it at this point. Great. Do you still have any worry."
11448.0,Patient,"So um I always like please play these scenarios in my head, where, if I am running into someone in the past. What I kind of always open my notes APP and I write down. right away or unless it'll like fester you know in. ruminate but I always like to think of like what is a phrase, I need the sentence structure to like tell them to like back off, I want to talk about it. And so. It feels good to just kind of like focus and do my own thing I."
510.0,Provider,Think.
11448.0,Patient,"You know, Anna back then I would hang out with her, because not only because yeah like we were friends and all but like she was the only person in class that would like talk to me, and so I kind of latched on. And I recognize that, like. You know this is just like a class I don't I don't need I don't have to I don't want to like make friends, you know, like, I want to just learn and that's the aim that's the objective like I don't want to stray otherwise. So with that, like i'm fine with as long as I can reassure myself like well i'm not really here to socialize you know. Man if he does happen to say something, and you tell her like. hey like I, like you said i'm not interested in talking about that stuff i'm just here to learn. yeah in that way approach that and then the other thing. Is is that say if she was a hostile person from the past, because those start it's starting to show up in my dreams to like certain people were like we've had like a falling out."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11448.0,Patient,"Because we don't agree, maybe like morally politically religiously whatever. For some reason I could just like. never stand up for myself and even though, like this person from high school like it wasn't hostile like I have something ready to say right, but if it comes to a hostile personality, I think, like that's when I really tense up and I go into the hyper arousal and. I feel like I have to just like. Tell them everything and. Also in like fight back, but because I feel like I owe it to my old self like that person that didn't that you know that did back down or did take the heat. i'm kind of like that guy that like reverse straight into me like, even though I didn't do anything he was just like yelling at me and. You know I go back to these thoughts of like whoa what like what could I have said and showing up in my dreams and where have opportunities to say something. People but I always feel like i'm having to like tell them this whole thing that I wrote in my notes APP like this letter of like how they hurt me and how they're in the wrong, and you know i've had enough. But it's, it is the past like I don't know why I just can't let go of it. mm hmm let go this image of that person I used to be, that would kind of just back down and take it no."
510.0,Provider,"mm hmm well, you had mentioned a lot earlier when you were talking about self compassion, because I think there is a component to you, learning to sort of be kind to yourself from your past like. kind of. Treating and guiding and supporting that younger Anna. And the interesting thing is this week's lesson was on self compassion. So. i'm not going to i'm going to do that lesson next week, but there is this another section that i'm going to share my screen. Okay, because I learned that I I just had way too much on the agenda, I had to cut it out, I, and so I wasn't going to be able to do this part on self compassion, but I think it'll be perfect, for you and I. For today. Because and there's another thing. You mentioned about being on autopilot and you know gosh we really could kind of go in that direction too, because when we are an autopilot. And we've we feel very detached and very disconnected because we are lost in thought we are over identified again in our thoughts. And just as a reminder, because I want to do this other thing with you, but just as I wanted to give you some feedback around that. That should be a queue of you really trying to do some self care, but also the perfect antidote is getting in the present moment when we are an autopilot we are sort of, and we all are an autopilot times. we're driving and we're like us, I don't remember really sort of drive in here, you know that's the autopilot right we we know the direction we're started getting there, but we are lost, we are somewhere else, and if that is happening or it could be medication, but my thought. Is you're lost in thought you are, you are almost and your mind so much that you aren't paying attention to what's immediately in front of you, and that is what the present moment. So I guess give me a quick update before I share my screen about sort of the meditation have you been trying to do any meditation i've been trying to do any mindfulness since we last chatted. No Okay, if you did it. Oh, you have it, but okay go ahead."
11448.0,Patient,Oh yeah because I have this like notebook now i'm i'm looking i'm like encouraged to just kind of continue filling it.
510.0,Provider,So okay.
11448.0,Patient,"um I write down like how i'm feeling that day it's become a diary because initially I was thinking Oh, this could be like a writing prompt journal or something to."
510.0,Provider,kind of.
11448.0,Patient,"challenge you know my writing style or something, but now it's become like a thought journal, and the more I look at it actually like more like. I don't know like I just went from a place of like constantly just looking out for myself with this whole like. therapy journey but then I feel like i'm slipping and I think that's normal to kind of you know backtrack a bit, but I just don't want to get caught up in it, and I think that's."
510.0,Provider,"Okay thing okay there's enough i'll i'm going to make myself a note. I think I have a i'm an article on autopilot and I, I think, just because I really want to kind of emphasize, because you use that language, and I think it's important because I think your instinct. you're recognizing that you know you're on sort of autopilot and feeling detached but i'm thinking it says you're lost and thought, but I don't I don't know for sure I mean there's never a guarantee, but what you're describing sounds like that me. So i'm going to look for that article and. And i'll email it to you it'll be it'll be coming from my bright heart, I don't usually use it because I I get so nervous because it's not technically secure. But it's just an article, so if you're okay with that i'll just send it to you to the email address on file is that work for you."
11448.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
510.0,Provider,"Okay yeah okay so i'm sharing my screen here. And like I said I had so much on my agenda for the group my my beta group, I have a group in the morning before I see you all at one o'clock. And I quickly learned oh yeah i'm gonna have to cut something and I had to cut this which it's really good but it's great for one on one discussion so. Self compassion whoo, this is a biggie right because one obviously from the months that i've worked with you, Anna you are a very compassionate person you talk about how. you treat family and friends that you care about animals, like you, are very compassionate. But a lot of times we have a really hard time doing that for ourselves, we can really provide space and support and love and empathy to others, but boy when we need to do it for ourselves or. it's it's a struggle so that's why I wanted to bring it to group but there's three. really big elements to self compassion and i'm i'll be interested to see your feedback I know we only have a few more minutes left but. If we go over a little bit The good news is my next session is not until two o'clock my time so or two like your time so So the first one is self kindness versus self judgment so part of learning and looking at this is. When we recognize that we are all imperfect we all are going to have difficulties we're going to have failings we're going to come up short I mean that truly is inevitable. So being gentle, with painful experiences, or when things happen it's going to be really, really good because that's the reality right if we fight and resist. If because I mean i'll use myself as an example, I last week, I had literally no control over what happened and I either could resist what happened, or I could accept it, and when we accept. And we allow the experience to be and we don't fight and we don't deny it, we actually help dissolve some of that intensity. Because, have you ever heard the term what you resist persists and what. Fight what you fight you strengthen so when you think about those terms, I mean that's what this is talking about because suffering ultimately comes when we resist avoid or we fight, you know we're literally trying to deny what already is right. So when we accept, and we can apply sympathy empathy kindness basically our emotional calmness really starts to happen. How we talk to ourselves if we're talking to ourselves with such judgment and such a nasty inner critic like you shouldn't be feeling this, you should have done that, and you just the excellence is right. It magnifies you know and so would and the other question is like, would you ever talk to a family member, would you ever talk to a friend who came to you looking for support, would you ever talk to them that way and most help people tell me absolutely not. I would be kind i'd be compassionate it's Okay, we all make mistakes, you know things bad things happen to good people I mean that is the reality does that make sense, about the self judgment mercy self kindness."
11448.0,Patient,"yeah I it helps this definitely helps break it down, and I think people often like overlook these things, and they just instead of really working through it with these what the explanations here. yeah we'll always assume like oh yeah like don't plant that seed, or else it'll you know you'll manifest or. These problems, and you know you're only asking for it, and I think that's the real discouraging part where you're you're almost like gas lit and told that this is what you like, as if you want this."
510.0,Provider,"You know and right right yeah I know that Okay, and at that point, I hope you recognize that's not about you when somebody has such. A huge reaction and just projecting on to you that is about them and and honestly, one of the best things to do and somebody is that, just like in a spiral. is to be calm to choose peace and to not react, because when you react and guess what you're in it, you are in the drama. And sometimes we do need to be assertive and i'm not saying be not being assertive, but you can be assertive without all that negativity and the backlash and the drama right, we can just state the facts and say hey this is, this is an Okay, but. What i'll do Anna is all i'll take a screenshot of this and i'll include it in that article i'll just make sure I do that and that way you can have these three elements of self compassion to. The second one is common humanity versus isolation, so this is really good, because we have to recognize frustration, you know is normal it's we can have things exactly the way we want them. and often what happens is we start to feel this sense of isolation like i'm the only one suffering i'm the only one this happens to and. Nobody gets a free pass in this lifetime when it comes to being human and suffering, we all every single person, whether they admit it or not, is going to suffer we can't protect everybody from not suffering it's just part of it. So the self compassion, when this comes into play is recognizing that the suffering is part of the the shared human experience. Something that we all go through, rather than being something that happens to me so that is there is a component of self compassion that kind of looking at that bigger picture so that's the second component and the third they're all three really important, but I think this is the one. That is sort of making mention of the mindfulness right when we get lost in thought. Another way or another term is called over identification so self compassion requires you really taking a net. kind of a balanced approach when it comes to the negative thoughts and emotions. So you're not completely suppressing or avoiding them but you're also not completely exaggerating them right so there's a fine line in there. And so mindfulness is a really a perfect antidote to do this because mindfulness meditation and as a reminder there's lots of different meditation, but this is the one i'm most familiar and I was trained in. It uses the non judgmental approach right, it allows you to observe your negative thoughts and allows you to observe the negative emotion, but you don't have to judge it and that's the that's why this component is talked about and self compassion, because. we're able to at least have the awareness wow I am really, really feeling frustrated in this moment, allowing it recognizing it allow it accept it. And then how can I man, you know how can I relate to this, but then the last piece is being kind to yourself, not judging and beating yourself up like I shouldn't be feeling this way or. Why is this always happening to me. yeah no it's that non judgmental and that's why mindfulness is talked about in self compassion, a lot we can't so The goal is not to ignore it completely Anna you can do both it's sort of you can do it, you can do both and be able to hold both. So it just it really requires you not to get lost in thought or over identified with the emotion. And so, because when that happens, you know, then we're off and running right and we've in it says cascade that also leads to autopilot thinking we're just we are so somewhere else right have you ever felt that i'm just so somewhere else, because i'm so lost in my thoughts. This is why journaling is another form, I think of. d centering which means you are taking a step back and you can look at wow Those are my thoughts you don't have to get super identified so i'd like that you're continuing the journaling. mindfulness would be another strategy, but i'll send you the screenshot That way, you have it, and you can continue to review, because obviously I don't want to read it. All word for word to but that those are kind of in summary. But what are your thoughts to hearing these components to self compassion."
11448.0,Patient,"i'm definitely you're right, I do resonate with the last one in particular because you know, like I said I always had this like fear of Am I this person that these. Negative hostile people in my past are making me. out as like as if I am and you know I struggle with being gaslight the whole time and. Instead of like and as i'm worrying like Oh, am I this horrible person that they say I am Am I wrong, I also have to realize that. i'm not in the wrong what is wrong, is that you know I am showing up like them where these people that are being hostile to me they themselves like judge you know themselves why."
510.0,Provider,and
11448.0,Patient,"they're very hostile towards themselves and i'm starting to mirror their actions, instead of instead of my own, and what I feel is right. And it's it's scary because i'm. I always ask my sister this to always like because we always make fun of. We shouldn't make fun of her, but she was in a really like hostile toxic friendship with this girl for like the longest time. And we always joke about her like Oh well, at least we did end up like Christina. i'm okay. I tell her I I check in like Am I becoming Christina like Am I am I, like. So lost or is my ego getting in the way or am I, too, prideful to continue asking for help, she like first of all, no one is like Christina Christina is Christina. And I will keep you in check if you act out of line. like that. Never compare yourself to that situation, because at least you're like first of all, you were like self aware, which is Christina is not and so."
510.0,Provider,"You know she has all absolutely yeah. yeah well part of the thing guessing is because that's that type of personality, I mean that's what they thrive that's what they feed on Anna. They enjoy creating chaos and that's why I was saying, I know it sounds a lot simpler, but I assure you, when you start to choose peace and you start to surround yourself. With people that don't have that that personality, that is what you will attract. And so just know that that's what they they love that they love the drama they love the chaos. And they love to externalize which means they kind of projected onto you so there once you know you're like gosh Am I like losing my mind like when you have to do that a lot with somebody. that's your warning sign you shouldn't ask me when you're having to do that a lot that is your warning sign like whoo and it's not about you, so I want you to stay the course I want you to stay your intuition is right on I think so often, you have had to question. And I think you're learning to trust your instincts more and that takes time right, so I think you're getting more comfortable like yeah I think this was my experience i'll use your group experience like. I think you started out a little hesitant and then you're like no by by the time we finished processing you're like No, this is what it was. yeah I had more of that confidence so just continue on that we need your instincts the little Anna inside the little voice inside is your inner guidance. and make sure you listen to her, and I know you haven't listened to her always and that's okay that's part of your healing as well, so I think you're right on I really do. But i'll send you that other article i'll send you the screenshot that we just review that way you have it as a reference point. And then I will see you in group next week. And then. We have. We have our last session on the 29th, but I want to give you the last word what what else any other comments questions before we wrap up."
11448.0,Patient,"No, I. I pray that the Internet thing works itself out and."
510.0,Provider,holy moly yes.
11448.0,Patient,"I I don't hold I don't hold grudges when it comes to stuff like that, because collectively like we all know how it is with like work from home situation, and you know zoom and all that stuff but. i'm really glad that we were able to you know catch up today, and despite like. Going on a tangent I think that's what happens when like you know I hadn't seen you for like two appointments um. yeah I just have a lot that's been ruminating that i've been thinking about but also i'm hoping that I. am able to find the strength of like bringing it to the table to begin with, to even discuss without without judgment, you know."
510.0,Provider,"huh yeah and I and that's the process Anna and I know that takes time and, but I think I think you're. you're starting to recognize the things that you want to be working on, and I think and that's why you are in therapy and you're doing a really good job I really. am proud of you i've been so honored to be able to witness the progress you've made in the short time that you've made it, so I look forward to see you next week last session and a couple and i'll get working on that other email so look for that later today."
