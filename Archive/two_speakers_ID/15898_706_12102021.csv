15898.0,Patient,And pretty much throughout my childhood my mom's first as members of fighter and. Then things were a little different.
706.0,Provider,"Okay yeah we don't need to get into that now that's those are things that obviously during therapy can be explored if that's you know a lot of a lot of times, people have. trauma that's you know, deep down, and then, when they start using them they figure out that that numbs that trauma and that can be kind of that that factor that kind of clinches them and then you know the addiction just takes hold so. You know, and with the ptsd you know a lot of that trauma, you know just kind of festers inside you so."
15898.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,So yeah so I mean we can slowly start to kind of process and work through that that's This is just some background information.
15898.0,Patient,um yeah that's fine.
706.0,Provider,"And then, what about in school, how did you do in school."
15898.0,Patient,"um I mean I hated it. I didn't really care for I slept through most of it, I think, new year, I did good. Because my mom asked me to. And then I was out of school for graduated went to Florida, and then I went back to school and i've been to school, probably six different times now so. Plenty of education, but nothing to show for it."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so you graduated from high school."
15898.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
15898.0,Patient,graduate from high school.

Dental hygienist. Then. Yes, I did a lot of disturbance so."
706.0,Provider,"So what is it that you were looking to obtain from all that education, did you have an underscore."
15898.0,Patient,"Well, I did at one time, like psychology was really what I wanted to focus on, and I wanted to work with kids. But like I said, like at the end there, like, I was, I was guided wrong in my in my career path so because I mean i've got enough credits technically for i've got a lot of credits they're just not in the right places, if that makes sense. You know they kind of. But they would they were writing them which classes to take, but they weren't guiding me to get the degrees that I needed to to keep my financial aid. So. Now i've got a ton of student loan debt and."
706.0,Provider,So what do you currently do for employment.
15898.0,Patient,Or why not.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long have you been doing that."

15898.0,Patient,"Yes, okay. Good so. Right now that's all that really matters."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah so. Prior to doing that what kind of work experience, do you have."
15898.0,Patient,"I was a bartender for a long time. Remembering managed a few restaurants for. mostly in the hospitality hospitality industry. that's a danger i've done everything I did carpentry I was I did I used to remodel houses, I really. I wish I can yeah."
706.0,Provider,that's awesome yeah.
15898.0,Patient,I like that the best I think I did that for about seven years.
706.0,Provider,that's really cool like you can it's really neat to be able to create something.
15898.0,Patient,You know that's why I liked it.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
15898.0,Patient,"I got I just I was kind of just a natural at it, I just kind of picked it up and. I just loved it."
706.0,Provider,that's awesome I will tell you the hospitality industry is very dangerous for somebody with a substance use disorder because.
15898.0,Patient,yeah that's why I haven't gone.
706.0,Provider,everywhere. yeah.
15898.0,Patient,From that's why i've kind of.
706.0,Provider,Everything so yeah.
15898.0,Patient,yeah that's why i've kind of stayed away from that.
706.0,Provider,So it's probably good that you've chosen a different path for your.
15898.0,Patient,employment.
706.0,Provider,At that probably would have caused you some issues.
15898.0,Patient,"Oh, I know it was."
706.0,Provider,"So through all your years of addiction and just all your years in general, did you have any legal charges do you have any."
15898.0,Patient,"legal issues with them, please, no, I mean I did back when I got into drug court. You know that was about 2000 and I don't know three, I think, or something I mean it was a long time ago, but you all know, I guess that have been 2011 maybe 10 no I don't know it's been a minute anyway, but no sense that no i've never gotten any trouble or anything."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you were in the drug courts was that dude to lake possession charges. or yeah okay so nothing with no like distribution or anything like that, but just. Know okay. OK, and then so in your free time when you're not working, what do you enjoy doing."
15898.0,Patient,We like to go kayaking camping and outdoor.
706.0,Provider,outdoor stuff okay. Do your kids know about your struggles with addiction.
15898.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm very open with my children."
706.0,Provider,"that's really good, and you know just because you do have this substance use disorder um it can be you know something that can be something they're predisposed to and so."
15898.0,Patient,yeah that's why I talked to them about it.
706.0,Provider,aware of it yeah.
15898.0,Patient,"yeah I try not to keep many secrets from them. And this is real life stuff you know, and they need to be aware of it, you know because I mean they're gonna have to call this world as well you know, like I said I was 32 when I became an addict. doesn't necessarily happen when you're a kid you know now, so you just need to be prepared, like you, I mean when I was their age, I was against it so bad like. You I remember, I was 18 I found out my girl doing cocaine knows past."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
15898.0,Patient,yeah no and then two years later i'm snorting all cocaine in the world.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so, and you know it, you have different changes that happen and and you, you figure out that you know drugs are good for numbing things you don't want to feel they're good for."
15898.0,Patient,and saying things that you.
706.0,Provider,Like to make them even better. But then when you fall into this cycle of addiction it's no longer a choice you don't just wake up one day and saying.
15898.0,Patient,Really.
706.0,Provider,"Be addicted to opioids I think i'll do some heroin like. Like you know it's not a choice, it just happens and the disease takes over your brain and then you don't have."
15898.0,Patient,It and that's where I that's where i'm at right now i'm at that you know I just know that it's no longer you know. That yes. I don't have a choice anymore.
706.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's not a choice they the addiction piece of it and and being in that cycle isn't a choice, once you once your brain becomes dependent upon that drug that's why your your pain is will be worse when you're using because it will want you to keep using it's why why. When you're using and you try and stop you'll get so sick because it wants you to keep using and so now. Recovery is a choice, so you chose to come into a recovery program and you chose to get medicated a medication assisted treatment. to plug those receptors in your brain and, while those are being plugged so you're not having the sickness and the. cravings and all of that now, you can work to figure out all of the things that pushed you towards the use, but not only that. to rebuild all of those things in your brain that have been damaged those pathways you know so they they don't all revolve around drug use every day because every day for a long time, they did now you have to figure out what comes next."
15898.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"And so that's kind of what you know medication assisted treatment, you know, like an assist you, with your treatment doesn't do the whole treatment. But it will definitely set plugs those receptors. Right so um so how old, are you now 4343 okay. On a daily basis, what would you say your stress levels are."
15898.0,Patient,Pretty high lately i've been i've been having a lot of anxiety lately. And i'm also noticing like i'm so tired all the time. all the time. And that's stressing me out. Like everything stressing me out really.
706.0,Provider,"Well, some of that is you know just early in recovery you feel very anxious, because for the longest time all of those feelings were numbed and now you're feeling everything. And you're experiencing everything without any substances and so that can create high anxiety and what Dr are you seeing here at bright heart."
15898.0,Patient,doctor so.
706.0,Provider,After salat she's great.
15898.0,Patient,"I think she she is awesome like she's she's just so much more knowledgeable than a lot of people when it comes to like fentanyl and stuff like that, like, I was really impressed with her knowledge, you know. yeah cuz like I kept saying things and nobody would listen to me and i'm like i'm telling you it's different. yeah nope you're absolutely right, it is yeah, you are absolutely right um."
706.0,Provider,"You know I worked in a methadone clinic prior to this job, and you know it's you know you learned so much dealing with an opioid population. people that are. That have a substance use disorder with opioids because that substance use disorder is so different than. yeah then any other one and."
15898.0,Patient,"Then I try to say something, and people look at me oh you're the attic you don't know what you're talking about you're just saying, whatever telling your own talking about."
706.0,Provider,"So I wanna I want to start kind of getting you into this new way of thinking. So you are a person that has an opioid use disorder. In early recovery. So you weren't an addict or you, you know or anything like that, because those are really negative that like there's a negative connotation that goes along with an addict or a junkie or anything like that. And so you're a person first so you're a person who has an opioid use disorder that disease, and you are in early recovery you're in recovery, but it's early and that is a piece of you just like you, are mental health issues are a piece of you, but they don't define you. So when people say oh you're just an addict don't even let that even enter your brain, because you are a person with a disease, the disease is not you does that make sense. yeah so people don't say that you know somebody that has cancer like well your cancer or your cancer us know you're a person diagnosed with cancer. You know that is a piece of you, it is not all of you, so when you start looking at your substance use disorder and that late it helps to lighten things and take some of that guilt and shame away because. it's not doesn't have that that negative connotation attached to it, you know it's a disease you didn't choose it just remember that you didn't choose to have this disease, just like people don't choose to have heart disease or choose to have cancer. So um it just it just lightens it a little bit when you think of it that way and and it's very true it's very true people don't wake up one morning and be like I think will become an addict today."
15898.0,Patient,Right exactly.
706.0,Provider,"You know, like you just you just don't."
15898.0,Patient,You know it's not.
706.0,Provider,"it's not a conscious choice so um so you know just keep that in mind, and you know, and when people say things when you can try and explain it to them, if you want to, otherwise you can just be like you've no clue what you're talking about and walk away because. If they don't know then they're just ignorant and if they're not willing to find out, then they're not really worth the time having that conversation with."
15898.0,Patient,Right now. um I definitely agree with that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so there's there's my little spiel I tell all my because I really I want them to be proud of their recovery and own their recovery. and focus on all of the negative, I mean because we're we're starting new you know this is new recovery is a choice it's new. You know you get committed to it, and then you look forward you don't want to forget where you came from, but you don't want to just keep looking backwards, because then you're going to run into a wall because you're going to just stop. Because you're too busy looking back and worrying about all of the things that happened, or that you did rather than all the things that you can do, and that you will do in the future."
15898.0,Patient,Now that you've chosen recovery.
706.0,Provider,So I have a very positive perspective on.
15898.0,Patient,like that.
706.0,Provider,"Because you know his recovery is going to be possibly full of relapse but that doesn't mean that you lose all your time in recovery or that you are a terrible person no it just means that the the piece of recovery, you know relapse as a part of that, and as. You learn is, if you have a relapse you just figure out Okay, this is what happened i'm not going to do that again and you keep going down that road to recovery you just don't stay in the relapse. Right so so yeah so I just I want everybody to just take a very positive perspective on recovered, it is very positive, you know it is a very positive thing and you should be very proud of yourself that you've chosen that stuff."
15898.0,Patient,yeah I like that yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Absolutely so um so you your stress levels are high you've kind of talked about everything's kind of a major stressor. yeah, how do you feel about your self esteem like, how do you feel about you."
15898.0,Patient,i'm pretty low.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's definitely something that we need to work on in therapy is getting that self esteem up there because. One of the reasons that people relapse to is because they feel like they don't deserve to have a better life than what they already did. So then they'll be like they'll get really low and they'll be like oh I don't deserve any better, I made all these mistakes blah blah blah, so we have to get all of that negativity out and replace it with positive things and then that's going to increase your self esteem."
15898.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,So um so we're done with the bps do you have any questions.
15898.0,Patient,No.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
15898.0,Patient,"I think you're pretty awesome, though."
706.0,Provider,"Thank you so um so we'll meet twice a month and we'll do therapy and you can set that up through the virtual clinics i'll set that up for you and yeah we'll start just chipping away at things you know we'll set some little goals and will and we'll just try and work towards them. You know, and I take it one day at a time."
15898.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
706.0,Provider,"All right, you take care, you have a good weekend."
15898.0,Patient,You too bye bye.
706.0,Provider,bye bye.
