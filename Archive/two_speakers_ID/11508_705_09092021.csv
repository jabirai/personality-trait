11508.0,Patient,"Oh, that is yeah. I did ended and I haven't. doesn't talk to me so. I have been only thinking about it a little bit."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"And it's just like i'm glad she's out of my life because of these reasons, and she hasn't contacted me so."
705.0,Provider,And even more confident in your decision was the right one for.
11508.0,Patient,All hands down.
705.0,Provider,yeah okay. that's good then. that's a healthy boundary where you're like okay i'm not gonna invite this in my life anymore. Okay. Oh good.
11508.0,Patient,"But other than that i'm nothing else been really going on, it says playing video games and. I started taking my pills at a different time because I took him yesterday at like. 4pm because that's when I woke up."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"So that was kind of mess with it a little bit on the system, but not too much they still works fine."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, but as far as with your medication you feel like it's at therapeutic levels."
11508.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm basically depending on them now.
705.0,Provider,What do you mean by that.
11508.0,Patient,"Well, because, like. I feel like whenever like today will take an example. When I woke up I just didn't want to deal with the traffic and I was taking my friend to work. And I like ranted about dumb shit that's just in my mind, then. She always does this thing, where she retards with well it's like and then she would try to do like a positive side."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
11508.0,Patient,"And like it kind of annoys me. So, like if there's something that I don't like and I just want to rant about it, like. like this, this this Nintendo switch this is someone else's switch that was found in the street. and So instead of like you know, putting it off, we decided to bring it in we'll find out who owns it by the serial number on the bottom here and then we'll give it back to them, but then I noticed that there. This controller right here. Was busted. And was useless I haven't actually right here in this little bag. So I had an extra one, so I was like i'll just slap that on there, and like clean it up and stuff like that, like clean this up and make it actually look. not destroyed. And then I like tested and made all last year, work and I was like man they're their screen protector, they need a new one. And then, because I was like this is ass the way that it looks and then she goes well, what a fig this kid got it for Christmas, and it was like oh here you go and then had to put that on I was like you could just do it at best buy. For like eight bucks she's like they probably didn't have enough money to do that it's like. They have, like so many games on here. Like obviously they can afford it $8. Like the best buy job of putting on a screen protector."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"hey what it's not even Christmas like, why are we, why did you decide to bring up like what, if this is the only President they got for Christmas."
705.0,Provider,"Ah, is that because there's hesitant then to still look for the owner or it's still intend to look for the owner, it was just a conversation she brought up a point."
11508.0,Patient,"I I honestly don't I think it might have just been a point. Oh, she always. But it's always ends up being something like that, like if I get like annoyed with something should be like well you got to understand that. Like if I just want to rant about something I don't need to hear well, you should consider this. I think that's toxic or a toxic. positivity I think. Because it bugs the shit out of me it's basically someone trying to start an argue with me aren't an argument. But i'm not trying to argue, I just want to say, like oh I don't like the freeways and shit like the freeway stress me out well you got to understand that people have to go places so it's not really like I just don't like the fucking freeway."
705.0,Provider,What it fall more in the category to donovan of like unsolicited suggestions or feedback.
11508.0,Patient,"Possibly I just want to rant. And she's like well you're ranting to me so it's like you're yelling at me it's not what that's about i'm not yelling at you i'm yelling at the situation that I don't like. If I was to yell at you, I would look you dead in the face. and be like molly. This is like no I don't do that, obviously, she seen me i've never yelled at her once. So if I want to rant about something people don't let me rant anymore and that's what fucking pisses me off, I can't read because they're like, why are you yelling. Because i'm fucking annoyed with something like right now i'm fighting with verizon these people Fries is the worst fucking company on the fucking planet basically. They I poured my number, I still have a balance that I plan on paying off and stuff like that. And so I poured my number two the new service, which was at amp T that's all said and done, and they're like Okay, so I see that you have this other person on your on your verizon list so we'll just go ahead and just spam them with messages for you need to pay us. Like that's great so he tells me about it and he's my friend, so he tells me about it, I I try to call verizon they're like do you have your verizon number, I was like yeah. So I type it in there, like we don't know that number, do you have a social security yeah type that in we don't have that either. Then, how am I going to pay you guys. Like every time and they're like oh go online and try, so I tried online. This account does not exist. But then people tell me, you have to pay it you'll have to pay it they'll they'll come after you they'll start taking they'll start taking family members, you have to pay them it's like i'm. Trying to Pam all right i'm trying, I want to give them a stupid absurd money i'm trying."
705.0,Provider,But every hearing is you are trying you're calling them every.
11508.0,Patient,"Every end i'm trying to use. It just gets. stops and people are like, why are you mad, this is why i'm. Like. So it's shit like that I just want to rant about dumb shit that I hate this fucking country decided to say hey you still have $6,000 in a claim benefit. But we decided to just get rid of that for you have fun with your $600 don't like to talk to us ever again. What about the virus that's still going on. Now my problem like what like mother fuckers the delta variant is just as bad as coven when it first started, we have hospitals filling up once again. we're probably due for another lockdown. But that's Okay, because we have a vaccine. It doesn't work for the delta varian from what I heard right now, you have to get a booster shot, so you have to add on. something to the virus, but don't worry that's not that's not the country's problems so let's not worry about that anymore yeah just deal with it go to work don't give a shit what you do, but just go to work, and you know just make us money, even though. I don't think the economy was attacked during coven people were getting unemployment buying things cars this that sure we had shortages sure, but that was an influx of buying things and also selfish reasons, like that, but. If money ran this country, which they say they do. Then why take away the unemployment benefits if we're just going to put it back into. The economy, I don't understand. they're just basically say like we're just tired of Americans living so just go ahead and get the virus and just die somewhere. that's all I see it as. And that's just great. So."
705.0,Provider,It feels like donovan and here you have with horizon where you're doing your best and there's a dead end.
11508.0,Patient,"I just want to pay people my bills. Like maybe show ran up your credit card, I had to run out my credit card."
705.0,Provider,"And that was one of your goals last week, even was to manage your family finances, so you know what you met the mark you're you're doing what you said you would do."
11508.0,Patient,"You know, but that's the problem it's my fault. There we go that's what anyone says less your fault. it's your fault and that's what i'm sick of hearing too that's also what i've been struggling with all week is the fact that if someone says me. it's your fault."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"I i'm done talking for the day i'm so sick of hearing it's your fault, this is your fault, you, the reason why you're like this is your fault. And i've heard that my entire life from other people other sources close ones far away one stuff like that, and I am driven to the point. Where if everything I have done is my fault. Why am I still here. Basically, if I just someone who just makes a bunch of mistakes and then. gets told that's your fault that's your the problem. I see the only reason is an out. And i'm so sick of it. And like it does not put me in a good headspace sure I haven't had my beds, today I haven't because I had to wake up at like 11 and to take my roommate to work, and that was. But. I feel like taking my message is not really that useful because i'm about to once we get done with therapy for the day i'm just gonna go sleep on the couch with dogs and sleep. So taking my pills would be useless because i'll get like an hour out of them and then i'll just. So there's no point. But like. Hearing the fact that it's my fault it's my fault it's my it's my fault, then why the Fuck can't I kill myself. hmm. that's called Problem Solving isn't it."
705.0,Provider,"it's with donovan the core beliefs, that we had just talked about in group is having that core belief, where enough people say it's your fault, where sometimes you may doubt it and think that. And now, is where you get to dispute it and being like wait a minute this isn't my fault I refused to take ownership of that."
11508.0,Patient,"And that people would be like well, you should because that's your problem that you created it's like that's not what I want to hear right now so yeah I think i'll just i'll just take stage left and just. Like I am. i'm bugs the shit out of me. Because again i've heard that from close and far people that i'm close to."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"So what i'm not the problem when i'm just helping everybody else, but their problems and then, when I have a problem now it's it's your you're the problem that's the reason. Things one sided to me. really seems one sided. it's a double standard to because everyone will be like Can you help me with this."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that's What matters, Jonathan is your your core belief, you know yourself that you're one of the most caring persons, you know you you do things for people you're always putting yourself out there."
11508.0,Patient,"And then I get some some form of self sabotage by accident, because i'm so focused on everybody else and i'm not really taking care of myself and then I get told you started this problem it's your fault."
705.0,Provider,"I know, none other than it feels like Okay, you know where to even start but part of it is you just saying that in identifying that that's the piece it's all my fault and now starting to just continue to dispute it. were even more so you're evil when you're engaging in conversation to be like look, I will I will take responsibility for what's mine, however, this is not mine like your example of calling horizon you call them, please note it in my account, I did what I was responsible for. and any minute. yeah and then it's up to them it's like stuff like that you're doing everything you can donovan."
11508.0,Patient,"I am I am but it's not enough for anybody. And they're like Have you taken your meds today now let some people know that i'm on beds it's like. Maybe it depends on the time but. Like I think your pills are making you manic no i'm just fucking sick of it it's basically me taken off the mask i'm fucking sick of it it's not manic. I don't think. it's just me being fucking annoyed and done and listening to people's just bullshit. Like it makes me now afraid that, when my roommates out in the kitchen that I did something wrong and they're to come in and scream at me."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"Like I have that fear for no reason. And i'm just. Over it i'm sick of being afraid that someone's in the kitchen. i'm sick of being afraid that someone's gonna fucking. Like come into my room and yell and evil, I never happens."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm but you're already going there.
11508.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's almost like a destitute of because you've been told it's your fault that you're almost like self fulfilling prophecy where it becomes and you're even having that worry about it. Do you remember in group where others donovan were talking about how they're challenging those thoughts those core beliefs. I don't Okay, you know a lot of people were talking about how their rewire rewriting that script that script that you tell yourself or others may tell you where it's just like no, you know it is not my fault and to each day be able to just focus on that and then keep building. keep saying, every day, this is not my fault."
11508.0,Patient,"But then someone else will be like it is your fault they'll basically take the script that i'm writing rip it up for it in the trash and say that is your fault, do better, and then just walk away. that's what I feel like it's going to happen. Every time."
705.0,Provider,"And in the event that that happens. there's also you know coming from an understanding, where remember the circle of control where you don't have control over what they may receive a response."
11508.0,Patient,"That is true, and then that ends up being projection."
705.0,Provider,"But of what they're going through nothing to do with you you're just the person that's in front of them that's an easy like i'll blame you, because then it makes me feel better."
11508.0,Patient,yeah i'm basically everyone's fucking bullet shield.
705.0,Provider,"And i'm wondering what would happen if you start it even more so because I know you're assertive even more so, like you know. Having those conversations where here's how I feel like afraid to go to the kitchen because because i'm going to blame for something I said I don't want to I don't want to feel like that, what can we do as a household."
11508.0,Patient,"But then they'll just say, did you do something like I don't know that's the problem. I don't know if I did something wrong."
705.0,Provider,"Right, so if you did something wrong, because we all make mistakes that's how we learn and grow, how would you like them to handle it."
11508.0,Patient,By not giving me attitude.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"And not not just like and I do like when people tell me like right away when things are but I don't need it, when someone opens door and be like so do you just like not want to clean this thing anymore, do you know that you left addition there. it's a dish I got left with every with R amp problem up in marysville because my roommates were like no, we have to go down to anaheim right now, even though they didn't and they left me with the amp problem. And they're like I was like how am I gonna take care of the ends well someone's going to come by on this day. Like or I could just go get some fucking and traps now get them get our and problem solved for you much or taken care of for right now. But if I gave us a chance oh my God it would be a whole other fucking level. And I need like a whole other level people screaming overreacting over a fuckin ants. Like maybe if you didn't use so much sugar your goddamn coffee what the Fuck does that have to do with anything I close the fucking sugar thing we never thought about that, but people do go me if my sugar, yes, that is true, I do you let me stop that."
705.0,Provider,"it's where some of it is you know if it does apply then you're like okay i'm gonna i'm going to check this out okay So yes, i'm using too much sugar, thank you for reminding me."
11508.0,Patient,"That was 100% true I use a lot of sugar. I like it's not necessary to like I don't need to have that much sugar like it burns my throat, and I will link it. up with that."
705.0,Provider,"So is it an in between, where the people that are coming at you some time out of caring they're sharing stuff but sometimes it sounds like an attitude and there's more. And you wish that that was. more balanced and not like. US shouting at you."
11508.0,Patient,I don't need someone to over. freak out about something small.
705.0,Provider,Like I love my best friend to death.
11508.0,Patient,"But she has so many fucking double standards that just pisses me the Fuck off so basically I see her relationship with her husband as a. he's responsible for many things in this House. doing any project that she gives him. taking care of the dogs like making them dinner and stuff and then dealing with whatever she needs. Like if she's like Oh, I have to pick up my car at 6:45pm let's just say that Alec, we need to go there, and you have to drive me there, I mean it's just like okay i'll do it. And then she's like you to build those shells when you get home. Are you going to feed the dogs before you go to bed. And what is her contribute she sits in the office and plays fucking overwatch. and her, she basically was like well I paid for this House. So you guys need to put in the effort. Is that all is that is that all. So I guess buying a house means you don't have to do shit anymore. Like that pisses me off and she's always done, even years before even getting this House she'd be staying there be like Alec can you give me a soda even though she could get up and get one. Like it's not hard."
705.0,Provider,"A lot of history, but."
11508.0,Patient,"Yes, i've seen this shit. or like when she'll throw her wallet inside of a grocery bag. And then she's like where's my wallet and we're like I don't know just leaving the grocery bag she finds it and she and we're like you know we might actually throw away your wallet if you keep leaving them in there, she goes well, then maybe you should check the bags. You see your fucking wallets great. fucking wallet I have to check for your fucking wallet. What if I lose my wallet I would just get. Oh no are you leave it."
705.0,Provider,"Do you think donovan that than others have a different level of responsibility, what i'm hearing is she chooses to blame, instead of taking promptly like responsibility that i'm the one that shouldn't be losing losing my wallet and putting it in a bag and becomes your issue. So I wonder if you started to gently. Share back where you know sorry you lost your wallet but. i'm going to put the responsibility back on you to not place it there."
11508.0,Patient,And then should just be like i'm putting the responsibility on you didn't check the fucking bags and then she would walk away and then slam the door or something.
705.0,Provider,"Well, what do you feel like that you know you."
11508.0,Patient,"don't want to stab are in the fucking face that's what I feel like her double stairs piss me off, she tells me that. We need to eat the food we have at home and then text me later be like you want Mexican food how about we eat the food that you just yelled at us at costco about."
705.0,Provider,"Now, so not literally stabber in the face, just an."
11508.0,Patient,"expression much in the back of the head of law my force yeah. it's just her double standards pissed me off, and she knows, she has a controlling attitude. And she stopped working on it. She does this thing where if she's in a crisis of anything she stacks jobs for herself like college. As figuring out, whatever else comes her way. And then stacks all that stuff up and then something will happen like I don't know there's the dishes in the sink fucking explosion. And she gets it from her mother her mother was a fucking trash ass human being and I fucking hate her and i'm glad she's fucking dead 100% I want to spit on her fucking grave if I could she got cremated and somewhere else I can't but I fucking hate her. All she did was create inconveniences for Nikki and now. Nikki has to become this person and I hate it like fucking hate it."
705.0,Provider,"Even though you understand it where it came from, but it's. Real easy being you living in the household, especially when there's other other people there. So there's three of you. Okay."
11508.0,Patient,"Well, for title, if you include me and then the three. But it's just. I have things that piss me off about people. But I can't I can't vent them here, because then i'll just turn to a screen mash and then she'll just send me to the fucking street. I know she will because i've seen that happen. or she'll slam the door and then just leave somewhere for hours and then come back and slam more doors."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,But since i'm very forgetful with my ADHD if I forget something that she tells me. Back to that are slamming doors or maybe you should stop maybe you should start remembering or listening more. Like I have ADHD I have a hard time remembering things like their therapy sessions I don't remember here like i'm pretty sure I don't remember the last therapy session man I don't recall anything from it.
705.0,Provider,"And sometimes you know donovan until I bet if I started bringing things up, such as we talked about finances last time. You know, and things like that that you would begin to you know, think about it, this is not like you get out of session, and then you continue on and talk about it with someone else and writing it down."
11508.0,Patient,"yeah and then like three days later i'll forget or even that same day i'll forget. You know, it depends on if it's lackluster you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know a lot of frustration and unfortunately the household right now that you're living in is feeding into that core belief of it's all my fault, because you have someone that's not willing to take responsibility. And so, how, how do you keep yourself were trying to create this balance and somewhat of chaos."
11508.0,Patient,it's not going to there's going to be no balance because she's just going to argue and argue and argue and she's going to use her big words and our college degrees and she's just going to be like it should her psychology degree. But she can't figure out that she's already created double standards for Fuck itself. just going to use those big words confused the shit out of me because I graduated high school and that's it. And then she's just gonna be like i'm right you're wrong deal with it or get the Fuck out.
705.0,Provider,"With with all this, you know with the whole thread i'm deal with those are, what do you feel like you do have control over."
11508.0,Patient,Making sure the animals are alive and that i'm still alive.
705.0,Provider,"yeah making sure the animals are alive and cared for I know they love you they're all right there with you, making sure that you're alive and well cared for and i'm glad that you are taking this opportunity to vent and to share with me the frustration. This is a place to let it let it go. And, to see if that's helpful to within when you're coming back to interacting with your roommate."
11508.0,Patient,"But in the end it's like yeah I can rant and rave to you all day and then like but like if nothing gets fixed because I she has a controlling attitude. I feel like nothing's going to change and she's already come up and said, like, I know I have a controlling attitude i'm trying to work on it that would fucking south, by the way, there was no now."
705.0,Provider,It is tricky and that's where being more assertive and knowing to when.
11508.0,Patient,"Possible I can't I can't risk an argument I have an employment just took me told me to go Fuck myself, like, I have no. I have, maybe $400 to my name. And i've applied to jobs and stuff i've been doing that and keeping up on that."
705.0,Provider,yeah that's good. sense of what you do have control over.
11508.0,Patient,yeah I have control over trying to get a fucking job.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, it is, and you, you know before Kobe you were employed, you were working, this has been more challenging."
11508.0,Patient,"It is. Because I hate trying to find a job. Because, then I feel like i'm not providing enough now I am here all the time, not doing enough because i'll be sitting there playing video games and they'll be like you could be applying for jobs and my brain is like. I could be yeah and like, no one has said anything it's just the fact that I don't have a job and unemployment funny so nice security and stability is just gone."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I can see where that would happen, where then also have this relationship that maybe some weeks you're better at letting it kind of go, you know just you're kind of ringing it out, but right now you're going through your own stuff which makes it a lot harder. To not let it soak in."
11508.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and it's really hard, because I can't also can't stand when Nikki and molly are in the car together, I cannot stand it. it's, not because they like sit there and be like this is that's why you're late there's nothing like that I just get annoyed. With because I don't also don't pay attention much to like. what's going on in their lives, because I don't I don't care for theatre I don't care for art that much. And Nikki knows this. And molly I think she knows this. And like they have so many things that they go back and forth and just talk about and stuff like that, and like me feeling out of it, because I feel like i'm just there. that's it like i'm just a space and like if I don't want to be like I don't want to deal with it like I don't want to listen to it, I just I just don't want to. But then that's rude. Like i'm allowed I should be allowed to not want to hear something. If I don't fucking want to hear it."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely.
11508.0,Patient,"If they want to talk about art and stuff that's great i'm glad that they all love and respect what they love and respect all that shit. And then, and then there'll be other times, where i'll be minding my own business with everyone and then all of a sudden all here Oh, did you hear about the person who got shot in the fucking face back in I don't know like. cold cold Colorado or something and it's like I don't want to hear about that I have been having a nice time I understand that news is news, but I don't want to hear about there's nothing I can do. So, like I don't want to hear about that negativity shit but then again i'm dealing with negativity shit. it's just I just don't want to hear about it or presidency stuff, even though I talked about unemployment."
705.0,Provider,But you're right that you have permission. To.
11508.0,Patient,"If I just don't want to fucking hear it, I don't want to fucking hear it. Right, but other people are like that's really rude and like this is why I just want to like shut my door and just not deal with people we haven't seen you in like three weeks, I still want to deal with people right now."

705.0,Provider,"Okay, in the event, and I know we did your safety plan and so it's like okay that that helps with coping but in the car, if you have that fleeting thought. Because that's a pretty you know serious thought that comes in, where you want to go into on valley traffic well, what is your coping skills, where you don't do that."
11508.0,Patient,it's just the simple shit people being sad and it's an inconvenience and it's why it's the same reason why I stopped my friend from blowing his brains out with a shotgun it's simple stuff it's like that.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm so you're able to at that time distract where it's more bigger than you it's like. Yes, you're thinking that it will solve everything but really it creates just bigger, not only for yourself but for other people, and what they're going to have to go through to."
11508.0,Patient,It might someone's gonna have to feed torn and Lillian. that's it.
705.0,Provider,"I know. donovan your your friends, even though, at times, you might feel like you're butting heads, but i'm hearing to even in your conversation earlier that they still care about you. They don't eat the sugar, we want here around longer."

But that is true, I didn't you stop that and that's a healthy one. Unlike the fucking because I had chocolate milk that night that I was that I was scared the someone's gonna yell at me I had chocolate, milk and I cleaned my cup and stuff and I put it in the draft and I put in the Rack everything was fine. But then I hear the fucking thing going was like. Like I heard a door shut the someone was in the kitchen, I was like. Am I gonna get in trouble for something."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
11508.0,Patient,"And that's what I have to worry about as an adult. Am I gonna get in trouble. Oh Fuck, the only thing that I should be worried about getting in trouble is is there's a cop, at my door asking for me to get in the car or something. Like that's what that's what I should be focusing on but I don't because I have to worry about living here that's don't."
705.0,Provider,"And if for right now, it is living there, what is your plan for this week to make it work where you're able to release a little bit of that negative energy sometimes that you fell."
11508.0,Patient,"i'm. not sure. You keep going to therapy, obviously. yeah but. i'm just finding things to distract myself with. Like the fucking verizon thing that's kind of a distraction, but not really okay just feels into my like in rage, because then I jump off a riser then jump on dealership."
705.0,Provider,"you're you're going to be the thorn in their side, where you're like every time, please note this in my chart I."

11508.0,Patient,Good I was gonna say if you did drop them like a hot box of rocks Fuck them they're the worst possible they charge you been under deliver that's what they do. My bill today I got from at amp T was like 136. verizon was 223. I got my new phone. 400 almost $500 when I get from at amp T it was like under 200.
705.0,Provider,"Right now, and that's where, as a consumer, though, you have the right to change and it's like. Why am I do 200 and something not have hidden charges when I find at amp T and there you know if you view them with more transparent."
11508.0,Patient,"yeah I always thought he was a garbage company and then because my mom always had them, so I always assume that everything my mom does is garbage. Wait they're not a bad company at amp T bryson's fucking worse. On God."
705.0,Provider,"With all this and you know and we're talking about learning how to dispute that core belief like that core belief that it's your fault, when something comes at you this week what's the donovan spin that you can put on it."
11508.0,Patient,"To start depends on the situation. Okay, it really does um. let's see a situation that could prevent itself. could possibly be. Well, do the unemployment one because I kind of came up as it's your fault. um. They did tell me on the fourth of September that unemployment benefits we're going to end. And I didn't fully understand what they meant by it's going in am I going to keep the claim balance that they promised us 28 weeks that there was promised. Obviously that can be just shoved under the rock to under the rug and use whatever they want to, because obviously it wasn't so I assumed that I, since I had a claim balance, I would still be on unemployment. And so I pay my bills I. I do all the things that I need to. And then I look up, I was like oh no I need a certify again and they're like oh on the fifth and I was like oh cool I get certified in the faith and I can get some bills going and stuff like that don't look at the claim balance. I get the $600 and that's it no date and so i'm like oh okay Fuck so I let my roommates know and then Nikki was like I told you to start looking for jobs. But you didn't do it so that's your problem. And that's on you like that the Government promised me 28 weeks of unemployment shafted them at about 22 and told me to go Fuck myself that's my fault now like."
705.0,Provider,"You know that other part, though donovan and you looked at it and you were seeing that you're going to certify."
11508.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"what's the healthier then instead of it's just your fault, and you should have looked sooner sounds like you didn't feel like you needed to because the finances were there at that time."
11508.0,Patient,They still had a number.
705.0,Provider,"So you didn't know what you didn't know. Now, now, you know."
11508.0,Patient,What they told you. It was in the document that they sent you.
705.0,Provider,And can I am I allowed to have. Where I make a mistake and I misinterpret something.
11508.0,Patient,"No, because then that's mistakes on you and you'd have to fix that. And then he burden others with your mistakes."
705.0,Provider,And where do you want to turn that.
11508.0,Patient,not sure. I want to turn it into a ball of something and throw through a window. But prizes window. Now show.
705.0,Provider,"it's horizons fault, maybe, instead of you saying it's not my fault it's."
11508.0,Patient,I can't I can't I can't. I can't do that. Because people were like you can make excuses for yourself.
705.0,Provider,"And that's where it's finding it's not an excuse this was last minute with my unemployment, I didn't understand it. So my. My fault if any is not understanding which is i'm okay with that, I mean I learned something new every every day I make mistakes, all the time it's how we learn and grow and we have experienced, because now if you're on unemployment in the future in this similar."
11508.0,Patient,You know experience this comes up like I don't trust the government i'm going back to work.
705.0,Provider,"Right, but before that don't have any you didn't have any experience with this situation right."
11508.0,Patient,I didn't it did give me a great. Great knowledge. As turns out that I was still right don't trust the fucking government. Because I do something like this probably would have happened. And it did. But no one wants to listen to me no could I have fought my own morning. Oh that's all of my alarm for me to take my meds hold on.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
11508.0,Patient,There we go. So yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And and with with that and is being able to instead of it's my fault. I learned lessons every day or I learned a lesson from this, what is the opportunity where instead of internalizing and being so like beating yourself up for it. it's just like look it's not that you're willing to take responsibility i'm going to take responsibility, but i'm going to be healthy about it."
11508.0,Patient,"I would love to. But. Who knows someone's going to scream and be like you don't know what's healthy for you, because all you do is make lucky fucking mistakes so trying to find a healthy I don't think you know what the Fuck That means, and then I then I end up but I don't know what that means."
705.0,Provider,"And, just like you just told me you don't know you're working on it it's okay I just being real."
11508.0,Patient,"I don't know what the Fuck i'm working on, I guess, I am going to therapy and trying all Actually, I do have to cancel my paid therapy which. I don't have the fucking means. Thanks unemployment. and that's gonna be heartbreaking. But now i'm going to therapy I got meds like i'm taking meds and shit I don't like I like I like taking my beds. quit like my meds don't stop unemployment from fucking me in the ass my meds don't stop me from verizon being complete cut holes and not let me pay him my pills don't stop me from you know. Being yelled at because. You know I left a dish on the sink or some dumb shit like that."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11508.0,Patient,"Like yeah that's not What, therefore."
705.0,Provider,"i'm gonna rewind to when you use the word that the projection on so being able to focus this week's on. What is something that I want to look at and explore and then, if it doesn't apply let it fly. If there's something like the sugar when in doubt check it out, but it is more of if it's someone else's projection as being able okay and and let them do their thing and being like all right, I will not allow this to absorb for me and be like oh i'm going to take ownership of that. Back to you it's, just like the teflon or the plexiglass."
11508.0,Patient,"Oh, just like walk away."
705.0,Provider,"You could share that you need a break, people do that all the time, I need a healthy break i'm feeling frustrated or I don't want to yell I need a break, or you just say I need a minute."
11508.0,Patient,I feel like I need longer than a minute I think I need like weeks.
705.0,Provider,"Take yourself a week I mean look i'm gonna have to processes, I need to marinate it and it might take me a week but i'll get back to you."
