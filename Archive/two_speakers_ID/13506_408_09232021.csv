408.0,Provider,"Could you use your video, please. Okay, great."
13506.0,Patient,There we go.
408.0,Provider,"There you go, how are you. Alright, so where we need to get started today um What I would really with your whole services so so far, what services have you been looking for from bright heart health."
13506.0,Patient,ADHD medicine. To 20 hours a day Ritalin.
408.0,Provider,So that's the short acting format.
13506.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like to try that see if that helps better."
408.0,Provider,Because you think it would be longer lasting. yeah well there is a longer lasting format for Ritalin as well it's called concert. At.
13506.0,Patient,With mark.
408.0,Provider,i'm sorry.
13506.0,Patient,I tried having for it didn't work with my other doctor.
408.0,Provider,"I say Okay, so you have tried concert and you've tried to short acting Ritalin. yeah what worked for you as a as a child in school."
13506.0,Patient,yeah you're right on.
408.0,Provider,The short acting that's what you've always had it when you were in school and what do you remember about. Your functioning when you were treated for your ADHD in school with Ritalin.
13506.0,Patient,Fine It just seems like it just drops me off of the tired. Like to maybe tues not enough a day.
408.0,Provider,You don't recall what dosage you had.
13506.0,Patient,I was on a high dosage in the morning. And I believe it was 20 and a 10 at night.
408.0,Provider,"yeah the 10 at night, probably would help you get to sleep."
13506.0,Patient,Probably yeah just.
408.0,Provider,Remember that.
13506.0,Patient,yeah my mind doesn't stop that's for sure.
408.0,Provider,"So tell me how you did in school, when you were treated for ADHD."
13506.0,Patient,I got good grades I graduated with an 88.5.
408.0,Provider,graduated high school.
13506.0,Patient,yeah it's tough getting in trouble.
408.0,Provider,"Good good, so it helped with your impulsivity and hyperactivity as well."
13506.0,Patient,counselors have noticed a big difference in my behavior we're at metro treatment Center. But other than that i'm doing good.
408.0,Provider,terrific.
13506.0,Patient,Other than I think it just drops me off.
408.0,Provider,"Tell me more about that, when you when do you feel."
13506.0,Patient,In the morning when I get up at five o'clock it seems like it's like three four hours into it and then it's like i'm 50 on fatigue.
408.0,Provider,"Well, the short as a dose you're taking now it only lasts for hours."
13506.0,Patient,"And then the effects would be. Good Maybe I should say, like if there was another one, I can take a nap noon every girl okay probably."
408.0,Provider,"Why you're selling your to 20 milligrams but you're taking them only together in the morning, when you wake up you."
13506.0,Patient,want to take. Taking one in the morning.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so you are taking one in the afternoon and you're taking so one way, you can maximize the effect i'm depending on your work schedule right where you need to be sharp where you need to be paying attention and focus."
13506.0,Patient,I don't work i'm just saying i'm just saying.
408.0,Provider,That you have things you need to do. Where you where you need to be focused right.
13506.0,Patient,most definitely.
408.0,Provider,"So that's what i'm talking about so whether it's a paid job or whether it's other tasks that you need to do, you need when you need your focus. Think about your current morning took 20 milligram dose is going to last for about four hours and it's going to be at its most strength about halfway through that cycle, about two hours. So if you want to get the most out of it think about at that to our point when do you need to be most focused and you can time your morning dose accordingly."
13506.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"Because it sounds like your experience and perception of fatigue is occurring when there's no longer any. treatment available for your ADHD and other words when the meditation is no longer affecting your brain, which would be around the four hour point it's completely gone out of your system."
13506.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,You see what I mean.
13506.0,Patient,yeah i'm listening.
408.0,Provider,So it's you I mean you said you wake up at five I don't know if you take it at five but let's just pretend if you took it right at five.
13506.0,Patient,five and seven.
408.0,Provider,"yeah so let's say, for example, you took it at five so four hours later, is nine, it would be gone completely gone. And it would be at its peak its peak affected 7am in that example."
13506.0,Patient,you're.
408.0,Provider,Okay right so that may help you to think about how you need to tweak the most benefit.
13506.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,When do you normally take your afternoon dose.
13506.0,Patient,Usually around one or two.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so then let's say you take it to right so then it's going to be completely gone by six o'clock. And it would have the most effect around four o'clock. Now what I hear. yeah so and it sounds like in the past, it also benefited you to have a low dose right at bedtime to help you get to sleep so that your hyperactivity and racing thoughts work keeping you awake."
13506.0,Patient,yeah cuz I do I think all the time at nighttime.
408.0,Provider,"yeah, and that makes sense i've worked with lots of folks adults with ADHD and even children with ADHD that have a much better sleep pattern if they have a very small dose quite before bedtime. Sometimes prescribers are reluctant to do that because they worried that it will actually. give you insomnia, but, most people with particularly with moderate to severe ADHD don't don't experience that they actually experienced improved sleep from a small dose in the later evening."
13506.0,Patient,"Okay, I just as long as laying down on the bed will be for. You before it's time to contact you."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, sir."
13506.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"So. You can certainly. coordinate with your prescriber around getting a possible late evening bedtime dose to benefit your sleep and then also because you're experiencing these. This kind of. disjointed response with the short acting it sounds reasonable that you would like to give a try to a longer acting like adderall since concerted is longer acting but did not you say you don't remember it working for you, that well. So that you'd have a little more stable. period of time without the short of it it's gone and then you feel down and fatigued. So that makes sense. So, have you made an appointment with the prescriber to discuss these."
13506.0,Patient,words here Tuesday.
408.0,Provider,Excellent.
13506.0,Patient,So talk to her about that.
408.0,Provider,yeah and then just let me know at our future therapy sessions when you've if you've gotten a change in your medication and will start to monitor the effects of that.
13506.0,Patient,"Other than that, just been stressed, because car keeps breaking down and stuff and. Then what whatnot I wash and wax it today and on the way home friggin the power steering pump broke and caught on fire and everything else."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. yeah that's pretty severe."
13506.0,Patient,So I get if I stand down order the power steering pump for me another serpentine belt.
408.0,Provider,Good.
13506.0,Patient,So that's where i'm at with that.
408.0,Provider,"Well, at least, you have a plan you know you got a plan to get it fixed."
13506.0,Patient,For now.
408.0,Provider,"For now, right. But one day at a time."
13506.0,Patient,that's all I tried to do. That holds me up quite a bit I don't think methadone is the right choice for me as well. Okay i'm almost up to 300 pounds and my back bothers me every day if he has like i'm working a ton of bricks because I get impacted desk and herniated disc in my back.
408.0,Provider,Right.
13506.0,Patient,"I wish my Doc and never taking me off by pain medication records friggin the governor mean they just stopped everything i've had every account every test test everything and all of a sudden, they just rip rip you off everything legos Tom yeah the darker you know they mean."
408.0,Provider,yeah that makes it tough.
13506.0,Patient,"And now the one is high, the House is trash because I don't have my back hurts. And you can hold a nap too, because that my neck bothers me because it's my shoulders hurt. But nothing I can do about it let's see if I can find someone that's willing to help."
408.0,Provider,"Well, I mean there are some pain management strategies that are non medication techniques. If you're interested in reviewing some of those I know one thing you had been doing for yourself is going out to a park being out in nature, although I know you have a social social anxiety being around people right."
13506.0,Patient,yeah now it's cold up here in maine so now everybody's locking down.
408.0,Provider,So you haven't been able to get that that stress stress reducer.
13506.0,Patient,yeah pretty much and it's just hard to walk cuz my.
408.0,Provider,What. Right what interest to you haven't maybe exploring some of the non medication pain producers.
13506.0,Patient,I can tell you what I was on that didn't help I was on three Viking in 10 milligrams a day.
408.0,Provider,Talking about non medication. So there are behavioral strategies that can reduce gun.
13506.0,Patient,i've done. chiropractor physical therapy i've done. yeah I paid a lot of money in Korean chiropractor holy shit.
408.0,Provider,"No that's not really what I meant, I mean there are some breath and and muscle relaxation strategies that can help to reduce pain."
13506.0,Patient,Like What do you mean.
408.0,Provider,"So. I can show you a few of them, if you want to give them a try."
13506.0,Patient,Because why.
408.0,Provider,yeah that that that actually Jacks up the pain perception.
13506.0,Patient,that's why they got me on a steep that machine because I still hold my breath at nighttime when i'm sleeping.
408.0,Provider,"Sure well the sleep apnea yes, that will definitely be a problem in terms of yours sleep quality i'm So do you use your see pat machine. Do good good Okay, so the other. behavioral pain reduction strategies. That are not the physical kinds of things you've talked about um, although some of them are somewhat similar probably to what you experienced with physical therapy, but they're not so much movement. Right, except for stretching and flexibility, but they are more about breath control. Are you interested in hearing more about those I can explain how they were."
13506.0,Patient,down for anything.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so. yeah I know it's hard to focus, you know when you're in pain that's why i'm checking in with you."
13506.0,Patient,"Just like cramps say, for some reason okay great too much know."
408.0,Provider,that'll do it.
13506.0,Patient,oreo cookies and milk i'm guilty.
408.0,Provider,Well oreo cookies are certainly comfort food and they do go along with milk.
13506.0,Patient,I am. guilty as charged.
408.0,Provider,"So in addition to comfort foods right that can decrease pain, because it increases your pleasure receptors in the brain right your reward receptors."
13506.0,Patient,Go fat.
408.0,Provider,"yeah well that's part of it, yes, and part of it is just being sedentary not moving as much because of the pain."
13506.0,Patient,as much.
408.0,Provider,"Right so here's how pain can be understood, so there is often a physical source for the pain of like you said a herniated disc, for example. However. The research has shown that there are groups of people who have a certain injury who don't experience as much pain and there are groups that do experience more pain and there are a couple of things that seem to make the. difference and it's not the cause. it's not the physical injury or the cause the differences in the way the pain pathways have developed to signal the brain. That to perceive pain and to perceive thresholds of pain, so your brain can actually become over sensitized to perceiving pain levels. And there are some breath strategies and some relaxation strategies that have been found to retrain the brain that has become circuits to become over sensitized."
13506.0,Patient,Without talking about it show me.
408.0,Provider,"But there are lots of them if one doesn't work then another might Okay, but it's important to understand how they work. there's one more piece to it that I do need to share with you, before we start."
13506.0,Patient,"showing you on that path, oh."
408.0,Provider,"No. When people experience pain their first reaction is to tense up and hold their breath. And that triggers the brain to feel emotional distress and sometimes to disaster eyes and those emotions fuel, one of the co pathways through which pain signals travel to the brain. So that's part of how these strategies work also is by decreasing the thoughts and emotional perceptions that lead to the breath holding and the muscle tightening. That then escalates the pain. All right, so here's one demonstration. ready. yeah okay so we're going to out i'll describe it to you first and then we'll do it you'll breathe in to account for. you'll hold your breath for a Count of seven. Then you will exhale to the count of eight making a sound or pushing sound, as you slowly exhale so you're exhaling through an open mouth. And the open of the nose exhale through the open now with the pushing sounds so breathe in 1234 hold 234567 blow out through your mouth wishing 2345678 to breathe in 234 hold your breath 2345678 breathe out through the mouth 345678 breathe in 234 now i'm just going to count. To 1234567123 on here the washing. So when you're exhaling with the writer. Do it very slowly and gradually so you're making your. whooshing sound, you can also do it through pursed lips. As though you're blowing out a candle but you're doing it very, very. Slowly through. The open mouth, then that leads to taking a beggar in. Right. completely."
13506.0,Patient,yeah most definitely did.
408.0,Provider,"Good. All right, let's keep on doing. A couple of more cycles. You want to count for yourself, or would you continue."
13506.0,Patient,To want me just.
408.0,Provider,to count out loud.
13506.0,Patient,here.
408.0,Provider,"You are let's start with a few more cycles three then 234 hold 1234567 push 1-234-567-8123 412-345-6712 345-678-1234 fold 1-234-567-1234 5678. All right, about three cycles there. Were you able to slow down the exhale a little bit each time. yeah good. Good. Now, dear, how do you shoulder steel, are they looser. Any other."
13506.0,Patient,"One biceps on my shoulder and. torn rotator cuff, and everything."
408.0,Provider,"that's okay we're just talking about the muscles being a little more smooth and long, even if they're injured muscles just. How you broke up a little bit there."
13506.0,Patient,I still have to find a trophy.
408.0,Provider,"Okay let's try another one, this is progressive muscle relaxation that. Specifically, is drawing your attention. To the contraction and loosening of each muscle group. Are you up for. yup we're trying to."
13506.0,Patient,Well sure.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're starting at the feet and toes and working our way up to the head. we're progressively tightening and. Relaxing each much muscle group and i'll guide you through this was starting with the toes. toes curl your toes in tight and then let them go. Let them be fully extended and relaxed and notice the difference between the contraction. And the letting go of the contraction. Now put your heels on the ground and point your toes up toward the sky or ceiling, so your feet are prorated at the ankles. yeah and now let them go since the seed or flat on the surface, the floor, or the ground. And notice the difference between the contraction of the ankles the top of the foot and the sole of the foot and now the release of those muscles, as they are relaxed on to the ground. Moving to the lower legs. Focusing on the kneecaps the calves and the shins tighten those muscles just took the lower leg. And now let go and let those muscles resume a long smooth status."
13506.0,Patient,Listen to.
408.0,Provider,say again.
13506.0,Patient,"here and try to get us to stand up. Do this you can do this exercise sitting standing or lying in bed. All right, so. What am I doing my cash."
408.0,Provider,"So now you're yeah we did the calves are right now you're going to move to the upper layer and the buttocks the glue to muscles. tighten the boys. Nice influences that you're getting ready to stand up out of the Chair if you're still sitting. And now, relax the. glucose and the thigh muscles. And notice. notice the difference in the sensations. Now, moving to the. pelvic region and abdomen and lower back. Just gently tighten the abdominal muscles, as though your navel is reaching back to touch your spine. And then let go of those muscles."
13506.0,Patient,back.
408.0,Provider,whoops.
13506.0,Patient,that's another thing that popped.
408.0,Provider,"yeah I said works, so do what you need to be to do to take care of yourself."
13506.0,Patient,So that's lunch.
408.0,Provider,"Now, are you ready to move on, I was giving you time to yourself okay. Moving up to the chest, and the upper back. move your shoulders back. As though you're opening your heart to the sky opening your chest, to the sky. And let go let your shoulders drop down away from your ears. And notice the difference in the contraction of the chest and back muscles and now they're becoming smooth and."
13506.0,Patient,Law.
408.0,Provider,When you release that. Excuse me.
13506.0,Patient,A few snaps and POPs out of that one too.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so moving your attention now to the shoulders just raise your shoulders gently and slowly towards your ears gently and slowly and then release them gently and slowly down away from your ears. And allow yourself to become more tuned in to the difference when they muscles are contracted and when they're released in the top of your shoulders. Now, moving down to. Your upper arms and elbows. Contract your. biceps without pain don't be uncomfortable but just slightly contract your biceps and then let them go and rest down let the arms rest down on. My your sides are on your lap."
13506.0,Patient,So that's where I started struggling right there.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, just try to tune in to the sensation of those muscles becoming moore's law and more relaxed as as you sink down or allow the arms to be released. And now moving to the lower arms and hands and fingers. curl your fingers into loose fists. And tight look for arms forearms and then released and open the hands and fingers, naturally. And notice the forearm muscles. Being longer smoother as they're released."
13506.0,Patient,"Okay, that a lot I have for lunch."
408.0,Provider,"Okay now take your attention to the hands the backs of the hands the palms of the hands, let them be released and relaxed, but all those small muscles be long and smooth. And now taking your attention to your 10 fingers focus on each finger and thumb one, at a time, one by one. And just notice the sensations of them being loose and open. And resting naturally by your side, or in your lap wherever they are."
13506.0,Patient,On top of the car.
408.0,Provider,"Now, moving your attention up to your neck. and your jobs. And mouth. Stress stretch the corners of your mouth wide. As though you're getting ready to perhaps by to corn on the cob it's a big big piece of corn you're stretching each corner of the mouth and the lips. And as as you do so you're tightening your jobs. And the neck will necessarily titan along with it. Release your jobs, let your mouth open, naturally. Let your mouth just fall open. And notice the difference in sensation. Between the contraction and the release."
13506.0,Patient,I usually end up drawing.
408.0,Provider,"Fine. saliva. Now, moving your attention up to your eyes and your forehead and the muscles around your ears. scrunch your eyes closed as tightly as you can and then release them but keep the lids closed naturally over the eye sockets allowing the eyebrows to rest naturally above the eyes, allowing the ears to drop down and the forehead muscles to be smooth and long. And they'll give you attention to the top of your head. And the back of your head and imagine that there's an invisible string at the top of your head, that is pulling gently up toward the sky or ceiling, so that you're sitting up a little bit and you're raising your head and back away from the shoulders. Allowing your spine to be long. And straight. And now bring your attention progressively again to each muscle group. From the toes back up to the top of the head. And you're just observing any remaining contraction or tightness. aggressively at each muscle group working your way up the body. And as you observe any remaining tension. simply let let it go allow the muscles to be long and smooth and release them. And when you finished your scan of your muscle groups just take a deep cleansing breath in through the nose and out through the nose. alright. So tell me tell me a little bit about your experience with progressive muscle relaxation. yeah what else."
13506.0,Patient,Something listen.
408.0,Provider,Okay. Were you able to be aware. Of what was loosening.
13506.0,Patient,My lower back. again.
408.0,Provider,"well remember. These strategies are always available to you, and they are free to you, you don't have to leave the House you don't have to get transportation, you can do the 478 breathing and progressive muscle relaxation wherever you are. And whenever you are okay. So how about giving these to a tribe, between now and. Then we'll review and give you a couple of additional tools. To try."
13506.0,Patient,My dad's.
408.0,Provider,o'clock four o'clock.
13506.0,Patient,Four o'clock.
408.0,Provider,"All right, and you can get. Your zoom APP with you and we can make this a brief session since you, with your dad. Are you going to your groups also. Good and what are you learning what are you dealing with. you're going to review your speech."
13506.0,Patient,And she picks the topic and we. reflect on a topic that she talks about.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, great that's great alright, I will see you at four o'clock on October the ninth and we can make that a shorter session so you have more time with your dad did you like."
13506.0,Patient,It Thank you.
408.0,Provider,"All right, Sir good work."
