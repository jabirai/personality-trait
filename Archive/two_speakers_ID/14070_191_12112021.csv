191.0,Provider,Are you taking your medicine. Are you taking your medicine every day.
14070.0,Patient,Is a day.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's see and we have so you've been you've we've got three urine drug screens. And they're all positive. For the buprenorphine a log song. And so far, let me see here so uds on 12 to 2021 positive for bupa alumnus confirm this look here. is positive for buprenorphine. crystal meth. mdma. And marijuana. Okay, so a lot of that is actually in the medication all right is in the marijuana and often when you smoke the crystal meth they combine everything also. So your urine drug screen on 1029 is positive for bupa. crystal meth. mdma and marijuana so that's the same thing right. let's go back here let's look at your Mare urine drug screen. On our 920 2021 is positive for beauty. And crystal meth. So, since you've been with us you've been using crystal meth daily. and We have three urine drug screens, but you start with us in August September, October August August, let me see let's see if there's any in person labs done. We don't have any in person laps."
14070.0,Patient,what's your impression live.
191.0,Provider,"Will you go to the lab. and get it done so in the intake layups no intake laps. Okay, so when I look here, Mr john let's see are you seeing your therapist. So charges in the rain."
14070.0,Patient,"No, I don't really get into my therapy and. My provider was as a and I only got to seeing him one time, and that was like the very first initial intake of me coming to write heart health. Everything because he was always done. is always been like he's they said he's out of town or some family and this and."
191.0,Provider,"that's why I was covering and so i've been there since October and i've been open to definitely try to see patients, so it looks like you have seen as therapists. You later therapy appointment."
14070.0,Patient,"Of yes, so I missed a lot of group therapy because of my work okay. And what Virginia that there's only one group so they can't give me a different group schedule a different town so is what I can only do about."
191.0,Provider,yeah I mean I pay it i've been able to try to see people doing Ohio times.
14070.0,Patient,"I don't like your job I have worked for Western Union Pavan, which is a payment company some either on the interstate or a two lane road and I can't just stop and go. Talk and because our on the paper there's only one person was favorite that can't stop and do i'm going to go take a break, yes, and every every Wednesday. And then, sometimes, the reason why I got missed appointments without no notice, because I don't have cell phone signal, so I can't call it will let you know. As Western union is a very rural area."
191.0,Provider,"Right understand what you're saying definitely. Definitely, I see what you're saying."
14070.0,Patient,"makes it look bad like I miss him I pointless, but I there's nothing I can."
191.0,Provider,write well.
14070.0,Patient,"I do everything I can to. Make it not look as bad on me, but it is what it is, I can do better."
191.0,Provider,"Right, no, I see exactly what you're saying I definitely see what you're saying yeah. i'm greatly concerned about the long term use of the crystal meth. daily use definitely with the marijuana the limited group attendance I understand you're missing groups y'all had due to work. yeah and I see, because this is this is quite a dilemma. And then the other thing that i'm really concerned about too is that. You have had a urine drug screen. In December October September so you've been here August August, let me see August September, October November, December so you've been with us, basically, five months I know we you know present five months. And we've gotten through urine drug screens yeah so you're going into your. you're going into your fifth month with us and we still see in the daily crystal meth use usually in cases like this, I recommend a higher level of care where you're going to be followed more closely. They can meet with you regulate because the thing is i'm really concerned about the risk of overdose risk of overdose even with the crystal meth and the other drugs this part is combination mdma is just really so unsafe."
14070.0,Patient,I don't like have even heard of a one overdosing on methamphetamine besides their heart exploding.
191.0,Provider,"exploding, but when they mix it with the opioids and i'm always thinking to what else could. Do patients off the mix, because your urine drug screens are not every month, so I look at it realistically and say you know. There are many in between days, so we have to be really, really careful, so I see what we have here, but I have to look at the in between days and think about safety awesome so Now I hear what you're saying to Mr."
14070.0,Patient,"Chad, I don't do anything else if I did I tell you. Just like to joke strange guy saying I mean a lot of people can fake a mountain and do whatever they want to, but you know there, I mean, as you can see my my results you know saying you see what the results are right john I had done. Actually i've actually decrease. My intake on methamphetamines, but I just haven't got to completely. Completely quit which I honestly have I haven't really even try to because. i'm kind of using it right now whether I know it's probably not going to get thing the sector it's not the right thing to do whatever but that's what i'm doing."
191.0,Provider,"No, no, I appreciate your honesty I value that greatly. And even though I value your honesty in the fact that you kept this appointment, I still greatly concerned about safety. yeah where you see it's really tricky it's like nobody wants you to be hurt or harm and the fact that you're being honest and you work in we. We really value that but it's such a tricky situation because we've got you know, several missed appointments, I understand the work several abnormal urine drug screens and daily. Customer few so yeah definitely continue with the buprenorphine at this point in time, but my recommendation in terms of what safest for you, I still believe it's a higher level of care. At least until things are better and stable for you, and so what i'm going to do in this situation with you is definitely. we're gonna hold on to increase dose of view, then, I want to definitely talk with. alexa Okay, and I want to talk with Dr shadow okay and and see what's the best way to move forward okay and see if we can get buy in from you when when will be the next time we can see, you will you be able to attend your group, this week coming up. Do you think you'll be able to."
14070.0,Patient,I don't know let's test Center I told that they wish to Kelly dammit come kind of come off as like oh.
191.0,Provider,"Well, what group can your team. Because I have groups using that thing six."
14070.0,Patient,They haven't set a record to be. An 8pm.
191.0,Provider,"OK OK. So I have a group Thursday I must see if you can attend a group let's see if we can get you in a group, Thursday, at 7pm."
14070.0,Patient,Thursday 7pm.
191.0,Provider,"it's an Ohio group, and let me go ahead, give you the link all right. And the reason i'm saying that let's get you into the group I definitely want to meet and talk with Dr shorter boy to. And I want to talk with alexa to pull them in on the conversation. And let's see the best way that we can work together to keep you safe, even if we are all in agreement for higher level of care. The best way to do that, so that you're safe during that transition okay definitely, then I know go ahead, sir."
14070.0,Patient,Is there any way we can get. suboxone figured out.
191.0,Provider,Oh yeah. No arena refill. yeah go ahead and get your refill. Definitely that's not a problem.
14070.0,Patient,"i've been having to do it every week, besides what I was getting on my therapy days, because they got it written up wrong."
191.0,Provider,"Well, this is the thing, let me send a group to you and i'll confirm about that okay that's a group information to you okay so group ID sent. All right there, so I don't I do not send your medications okay. um alright, so I am actually the emergency physician for West Virginia doing that emergency coverage Okay, but I don't have a West Virginia license which you know at this point in time, this allows me to see you. So Ashley Dr shadow will be the one to send in your medications and those medications are sent the Emperor the refill recommendations Okay, so if I look at your refill. It looks like the last time you so let's so let's last time you took us a box on because i'm looking here your last rx was on 11 2021. And it was a number eight with one refill."
14070.0,Patient,yeah. yeah maybe. Before then I had the I had several other refills that I didn't even know about mm hmm and that's what I that's what i've had used to get me to this point here.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, was not aware of power refill so when's the last time you took your suboxone."
14070.0,Patient,today.
191.0,Provider,Do you have more suboxone.
14070.0,Patient,"I have, I think, maybe two or three."
191.0,Provider,"two to three films remain okay. Well, we often do not do refills on weekend okay i'll i'll pull me to our alert our team our refill team about this many times we don't have people here to do refills on the weekend okay um so. So, usually you. Know refocus on."
14070.0,Patient,"So why is it written up like it for like wow look. What once every once every per se it's just take that one film twice daily so it's basically two films today right. Okay, there are seven days in a week right."
191.0,Provider,"We do eight days and I tell you why one you can do, four days, plus one refill so you're given a person are. A little over week I like having that extra day let's say if you meet a person every week during a group if something ever happens they can't make that group they've got a buffer they've got that extra day. That you can send that medicine, so I see it as a way of looking out for our patients."
14070.0,Patient,"Well, I understand that, as far as the eight day thing, but why not just like gang just give me 16 that way I don't have to get to the pharmacy twice and get a refill."
191.0,Provider,"Well, this is the thing any place you go Mr Trevor you're not going to get usually a two week supply medicines until. We know that you are safe, for example, getting regular urine drug screen seeing a therapist regularly attending your groups and that's just not Bihar have miss travis pretty much anywhere you go. yeah so so that's why that's why."
14070.0,Patient,I gotcha yeah.
191.0,Provider,yeah so if we were to all be an agreement of a higher level of care where would you go.
14070.0,Patient,What is it.
191.0,Provider,"Where would you go you've gone other places in person, do you have other options of higher level of care close to you."
14070.0,Patient,"Honestly, I basically just need a provider some some boxing provider, whether I have to buy it off the street or get it from a doctor that's all really neat I don't um. I understand your your level of care that's what you're forced to use make sure your patients are safe, I get that I understand."
191.0,Provider,"Now therapy therapy so important to miss Chapman. yeah so we want you to get though we want you to get all of it because really what they're finding is. The value in therapy with overcome and even with the crystal meth because it can have a really strong hope, especially with the gift how high it increases your dope me level the reward the energy. It can be a struggle, but i'll be honest with you, Mr Trevor i've seen people come off of it with the with the right medications and therapy and support so that's what we want for you too okay."
14070.0,Patient,mm hmm.
191.0,Provider,yeah.
14070.0,Patient,"Very, to the point to. You give that up right yeah."
191.0,Provider,"So okay. And i'm and I, you know I value your honesty and it's true what you're saying to me when I see the chronic use of the crystal meth many times, most people don't tell you they're not ready to give it up, but like you said, I agree with you, I think you're very straightforward about things. yeah. I hope you change your mind. Because it's so dangerous."
14070.0,Patient,"If you don't take it as you say i'm a smart ass or and or like it, because i'm i'm really not trying to be."
191.0,Provider,"I don't think you're trying to be I just thank you being real and I yeah I can sell it and you know, even when you disagree, you still work towards a common goal, which is keeping you safe keeping you from having a heart attack or or having a kidney failure we just want you to be safe. Right and we want to do it in a way that you heal on multiple levels, not just a medicine, but also that you're healing internally and externally."
14070.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"And if you're not ready for that you know that it sounds like the higher level of care where you can be in person. where you can talk with someone because you do talk it's easy to talk to, and you talk very straightforward and to find where you can you know you can be somewhere and hopefully that mindset can slowly evolve. Do you have any children significant other supporting you on this."
14070.0,Patient,yeah I have a four year old and a two year old.
191.0,Provider,Fresh just boys girls a combo.
14070.0,Patient,"models is a boy, and the youngest girl."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have a lot of reasons to keep that heart healthy and those kidneys healthy. yeah so does the math give you the energy to work, what what is the benefit, even though you know how dangerous city is what is the benefit for using it for you and your mindset."
14070.0,Patient,"I mean. I don't know really what you consider a heavy user. I think I may have came off. And seemed like a pretty heavy user, but I don't i'm normally not are also have user because that really is actually slacked off a lot from what once was."
191.0,Provider,But good.
14070.0,Patient,"I can't say yes, I don't smoke a half a gram every day or so, but I mean. I don't know I just it's just I guess it is just to have. My cell my life and. it's want to say, less dangerous things that i've done and I know i'm not saying that method is not dangerous, by any means it's not what i'm saying, but as far as."
191.0,Provider,"I hear you saying sounds like it's all relative it's like yeah, this is not, this is not safe but I done things a whole lot more unsafe and you decrease to do that. The amount."
14070.0,Patient,"Okay i'm just in the process right thing you know i'm saying myself, without being in a corner pastel or something yeah."
191.0,Provider,"No, I see what you're saying, I just want to understand because. The child is having to understand that helps me to your anesthetic."
14070.0,Patient,I can go to work and do what I gotta do. Okay.
191.0,Provider,I hear what you're saying.
14070.0,Patient,Without getting tweaked out and trip and then paranoid them just just back to normal not really getting good definitely okay.
