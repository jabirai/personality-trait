Your cholesterol is high to 25 so you already know your results."
12432.0,Patient,"and kind of all, I knew my cholesterol was high, not the number."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're a one C is 9.0 and your previous one, was 9.6 so you're going down but not fast enough. and your your regular glucose is 330 which is your daily is going up higher so you're seeing a regular doctor has he recommended. Any medication to you for that are you taking metformin or anything."

298.0,Provider,"Okay, so cl."
12432.0,Patient,yeah and taking two different kinds of this one for daily. injections and nightly okay.

12432.0,Patient,yeah it's time.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to put in like a 2.5 milligrams tab on it and i'm wondering if you need some well this the gap of penton if we went up on that one and you could take an extra one at bedtime it's possibility that it would hope to sleep. And you still have room you're only how often are you taking the gabba penton."
12432.0,Patient,Ticket three times a day.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you took. An extra if you took it four times a day and then did two tablets that said time that might be enough to calm your brain down and not have to do abilify does that make sense."
12432.0,Patient,yeah be nice.
298.0,Provider,"What I like about gabba penton is one of the only medications that we know of that. Is. That can help people with their Stage Three and stage for sleep at keeping people asleep so that that's that's an amazing medication, because no other medications can do that all the other ones they help people get to sleep, but they don't keep them asleep."
12432.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"And so i'm giving you a two milligram tablet of. abilify and the plan is to go you're going to cut your tablet and half right now and go to five milligrams. And then the next week, I want you to go to two milligrams and you can either stop it at that point, or you can cut the two milligrams have any tasks and take. Just a half a tablet of one milligram and then stop it completely. and Hopefully that will do the job, do you have my email to let me know if that's working for you."
