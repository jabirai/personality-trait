The last meeting that I miss because I actually thought that it was at a different time, which is why I missed our last appointment. yeah that's why I missed our last appointment I just like us the time timing wishes wrong but around that time. I forgot what had happened, I think I don't know, but my anxiety which is really bad around that time and I think it has something to do like my relationship. But it's fine now yeah it's just a lot of me and overthinking things and not like actually talking it through with my boyfriend. yeah yeah. But yeah today's today's a better day."
252.0,Provider,love it. Love those better oh.
10103.0,Patient,Eight definitely.
252.0,Provider,"Definitely, how long you been there."
10103.0,Patient,I think it's been almost four weeks now. or three weeks something like that. um. yeah we I don't know it's and I had my up and down since the last time we spoke. But I don't think there's anything right now that I necessarily need to talk about. I can't really think of anything right now yeah.
252.0,Provider,that's pretty amazing you know.
10103.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,Have you been able to get out. Any job prospects that you found.
10103.0,Patient,"I have like a few interviews, the one I might the first interview it like wasn't selected and then the second one. I did another interview, and they said they'll get back to me within a couple weeks I should I should probably follow up with them, but I don't know, I have a. feeling I might not get that one just because I wasn't someone that they were looking for I just had like. Two little experience so or I have like no experience, basically, and they needed someone to experience, but then they were understanding with the fact that, like I gotta start somewhere, so I mean that's a good sign yeah but I don't know yeah. there's that and then. My housemates had their wedding. Like three weeks ago. So that was fun yeah we went to we went to indiana for their wedding. Because that's where they're from and then. yeah I think that was around the time when I start I didn't when I started to have like my anxiety, I think, was just because, like, I was just in a new vironment like literally I like met everyone for the first time, so it was a lot, it was very overwhelming. yeah in. A different. way that's been happening. Oh definitely. was so desperate I was like I literally felt like I was in a movie like one of their friends owns a strip club and i'm just like. Where am I, who am I wit right now. yeah. yeah it's all it feels totally different. But it was fun yeah we were there two days before the wedding, and so we just like hung around like because they're the groom's. We stayed at the groom's house basically at his parents home data extra extra guest room so so like yeah we didn't spend much money, thankfully, like our hotel. been very, very grateful for them. yeah and then the weekend was fine we did oh sorry, excuse me that a lot we flew out of Chicago or la to Chicago. And one of the Chicago airport so before we flew back to Houston we like explore Chicago just for a little bit would love to go again it was so nice there, I, like you know I just saw the Nice side of Chicago, but it was beautiful. I see well. I think i'm getting better at communicating with my boyfriend and also telling him how i've been feeling in a moment's. which has definitely helped yeah he gives he gives me like. He makes he gives. A sense of. Where like it's okay to tell him things which is nice we've been watching the show called. mesh it's often but it's it's there's only three of those are right now but it's like it's just I don't know I would recommend you washing washing back because it's just like. it's such a like scenes from a marriage it's like a very emotional like provoking show like it's it's literally just like this couple, and then we just see them go through their life and, like the emotions feel so real. And it's just like it's very thought provoking as well. But it's really good it's slow and yeah it's it's not like no action, ie or anything like that it's really in a way it's kind of mundane but I mean that's just dumb going through our lives. But yeah."
252.0,Provider,And when.
10103.0,Patient,sorry about that. HBO.
252.0,Provider,i'm going to look it up.
10103.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I would recommend it's pretty good um yeah there's something like this, I like talking about shows like after I watched them so. A lot of the things that we like we sometimes we see ourselves in these two people that are they're portraying and. yeah I don't know if you ever get the chance to actually watch it you, you will understand what I mean when like the actual the actors, they just get so into their emotions like apparently they. They were they got sold in their careers, they had issues with their like real life relationships. And then. yesterday. yeah that's how it like deep into their hair today. that's reasonable. Yesterday I was feeling a little off, but that was just like the morning, and then I had like a reality check like midway through the day. But the morning I like woke up feeling off like just I think I was just feeling like homesick a little and then also just like formal from like seeing my friends go out. But you know, I think. i'm getting better at just accepting that instead of routing over it. So that's thinking like that has helped me a lot better as well. Especially because I had a reality check yesterday that like just. Sometimes the little things that i'm feeling Sure enough, they do matter, but in the overall, general like big world universe type of thing. it's not that big of an issue."
252.0,Provider,"yeah my. Right, we can create something small and you feeling like it's the world on our shoulders, you know."
10103.0,Patient,"yeah definitely but yeah like yeah went through a little went through something for first time a little dramatic so. it's fine. yeah and yeah I honestly I probably should start writing down when I start feeling a certain way, but like you know again a whole man don't really feel like doing that yeah. But there have been times when I just like it was just it's it was about day and then, but the good the nice thing is, is that my boyfriend does he does notice it when i'm having. An off day you don't To be honest, I was like I try not to show it just comes like I don't want to bother him when I told him that I was like, is it really noticeable whenever. i'm feeling off and he was like I just know you basically he was like I just know you like really well now to the point where I can tell when you're off. But and yeah he reassured me that, like i'm not bothering him like he's never said that before so you know that's just me. Not wanting to bother even though i'm not."
252.0,Provider,I know we've had several conversations about that.
10103.0,Patient,You know where you didn't want to tell I know.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean and the reality of it is. You can be right there you get to really see and take a look and be a part of what is reality and what you can talk to him about what you can you know. it's pretty now. That it's not there it's.
10103.0,Patient,"yeah it is he he's patient with me and then. He knows that, like. I should tell him just not like just thinking in your head like just be putting on substance on why he's feeling glass, what I do a lot like oh I don't want to do is kosta and you'll feel bad if you like, you said that like i'm like you right. But yeah he's he's been good for me. he sees the same for me, or vice versa, too, so it's nice to know that it's not just me like."
252.0,Provider,One sided.
10103.0,Patient,"getting bigger through our relationship yeah yeah definitely which is really nice. To have vr yesterday, when I was feeling like homesick and like football, I was thinking about like how. Just like how I guess. i've gotten I like drifted from my friends have been. Ever since I got into a relationship, but it's like it's it's hard to balance when you're in the beginning of your relationship, and now that i'm in Texas is even harder. But I talked to I talked to Chris about that, and like he also felt he felt the same way with his friends too so it's nice to know that i'm not alone."
252.0,Provider,"party growing up is you know is that part of it is you know each and every one of you guys are going in different direction and doing different things and there's nothing wrong with that, but it feels like yeah oh there they drift away."
10103.0,Patient,"But. Those moments I mean, I still talk to them right yeah."
252.0,Provider,You know. That we awesome you know. Those moments that you get back together.
10103.0,Patient,"You know it's been with them yeah. yeah. I do, I found me i'm like at this point, I think i'm like the beginning, if I because I have my flight already for going back home, but then we've been thinking about. delaying it just because we want to go to a concert and I don't want to like my my sister was able to bring her baby home from dq. Last week, so there's a baby, a new baby at home so. If I go to this concert then i'm going to delay my flight by like at least two weeks, just so I know that, like letting catch anything I don't want to bring anything home. But like I miss my family I don't really want to miss thanksgiving with them by then I know my boyfriend wants me to stay at least until thanksgiving oh see I don't know. We don't even know we can treat my flight."
252.0,Provider,"I think it's awesome you know that you're there and that you've been there, as long as what you have and that you're exploring and you're going to interviews, you know you just never know."
10103.0,Patient,"what's going to pop up and what's that. yeah I mean there's I don't know if I if I told you, but like I did i've been studying for something new. So i've been studying, so it designed it's like the design path doesn't work out. Then i'm going to be, or I have been studying for like basic it stuff. Now so right now i've been studying like for yeah for the past couple weeks i've been studying for like this it certification. And then hopefully like I can take the test by like next month, or something, because there is a deadline for the test which is like I think January. And if there's like two parts of the test to so I need time to study for the other part, as well, but I think i've been on good track, but yeah so it does it doesn't work out, I have been studying to try to get into it, I guess it's not really something that I wanted to do, but like. it's a new path that I can be taking at this point is just like I rather be making money now, if this is the way for me to make money and then i'll do it. yeah there's that that that's been happening for the past couple weeks i've been studying a lot and still like i'm balancing like studying and also still applying to jobs. yeah that's that's been happening and it's actually cuts like. i'm like exam because, like you got to pay for the issue, much like I would feel down my boyfriend said he'll like he'll pay the expenses for the test. I just feel bad because, like if I don't pass and i'm just disappointing you and everybody, you told that I was taking this test. But I know I shouldn't be that way, like, I want to say that I will pass, but I don't know it's just it's hard stepping into something that you just you have no prior knowledge of. Anything and also like no interest in. Like going from like a creative feud not experimental design wasn't even that much creative you don't have that much creative. not allowed that much creativity in the design world actually, but it was something that I was like into. Even though, like it doesn't pay much and also it's just hardest to get into right now, but at least like what it like be been hiring so we shall see."
252.0,Provider,Many doorways.
10103.0,Patient,"let's see what's one opens yeah yeah. Like a part of me is a part of me does hope that. Like hope that I do get a job in design, but another part of me is like man i'm like i'm starting to not want to do this, I. Have all my friends or not all my friends, but. Two of my friends they've. got one of them for sure House like switched out of design it's just you just realize it just wasn't for her anymore, and then our friend. She isn't debating she's deciding right now, if, like. If she wants to leave design and do something else I always like interior design and do a different different type of design work. yeah like. Oh no like whenever I like like either job interviews beginning and they tell me like what are the tasks and stuff that I would have to do i'm like and. I really don't want to do that, you know I also know i'm talking about this, I think it's really just because I haven't been working for a very long time, so just the idea of having to work again. In general, is. is something um so yeah I don't yeah I think yeah it's probably just that."
252.0,Provider,"yeah there's some fear around it, when you when you haven't been working you know, and then you get back into the market and you're realizing you know that these jobs are tough. You know it's like it's not anything easy, and we think that it's going to be one way and it always turns out to be something different, you know. Just kind of the way it is you know, but I believe that the right door is going to open for you and you're going to walk right through it."
10103.0,Patient,"that's why i'm trying to believe, as well. Definitely change yeah."
252.0,Provider,"When you have those feelings know that they're not facts okay. Buildings are facts. they're just feelings right and it was really funny that you know we started talking, you know, and you were telling me about how you were feeling. And I read something to you really fast."
10103.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I was just reading it before you came in. And I thought it was pretty is pretty fitting okay. You put up a fuss aid facade that matrix the outside world, but inside you feel hopeless you continually tell yourself i'm Okay, I can manage. I can adjust I just need to get this done first I can handle whatever comes my way. What if this isn't true what if your life isn't what you want it to be, what if you're scared and you don't know what to do. What if your feelings are meant to be felt and not pushed away I get it, I do this, all the time, I want to see seem as strong incompatible capable not a week helpless version of myself, so I put up a fuss a I can't say that word to say. In hopes that others will see confidence my facade may trick the outside world, but the core but, at the core I feel helpless I feel weak, I doubt my abilities inside I don't feel confident at all. I feel insecure and intentionally chose the word field, I did not say I am. My identity is not determined by my feelings, I often let it be the case, but that is me giving power away to my feelings my feelings are in control, I am not in this case. I don't want to live this way, though I feel alone tired and overwhelmed I am stuck when I do this step in survival mode that isn't the way I want to live my life. Yet I questioned can things really change here's the truth change is possible, but in order for that to happen i'm a stop tricking myself. I must get real with my feelings, I must admit, how I truly feel how i'm truly feeling recognizing the reality that I have not what I feel. And also that my feelings won't destroy me at the core, this is the belief that keeps me stuck telling me telling my feelings to control me. So I challenge you now be honest with yourself how you truly feel in this moment speak the truth, if you need some help you know here's a prompt I feel also tell yourself this I feel blank, but I am not. That like I feel. worthless, but I am not worthless right I recognize that this is way easier said than done that's why this ladies here to help but it's um. it's about realizing that we're not our feelings, you know that what people see us when people see us they see us through different lenses and they see things about us that we are not even aware of. yeah and so, knowing that your feelings aren't facts it's going to work out exactly how it's supposed to and have faith in yourself that you have the ability to get the job that you want. you're perfectly capable and competent very much so. And that's what you remember."
10103.0,Patient,"Something I have to try to remember as well, but I think i've been better at it um. yeah I think i've been better at like switching my thoughts. So i'm like i'm Sure enough, like i'll still have like bad thoughts, but I think like give it some time and then I just I realized that that's not it."
252.0,Provider,"yeah so not true, you know they're just a loop that we've been stuck in for so long. just got to get out of that feeling and realize that feelings aren't facts, I say that to people sometimes and they look at me like i'm crazy like What do you mean they're not facts I feel them, you know, but the reality of it is is we're going to fill 100,000 different feelings a day."
10103.0,Patient,"hmm and the feelings are real, but they're not they're not what you. What describes you."
252.0,Provider,know there no.
10103.0,Patient,No.
252.0,Provider,"Not at all and it's great to see a smile on your face and it just see that hope to see you, you know really looking forward, instead of being trying to go forward and fear. You know that is a big difference that I see today from the last time we saw each other, I want to."
10103.0,Patient,"Thank thanks well you didn't catch me when I was. feeling pretty down like a week ago, or two weeks ago, whatever was our last. Appointment that I hadn't missed I was a mess, then I am better now which that's all that matters because we're in a present now."
252.0,Provider,"Right that's right and again, you know when you start filling those those negative thoughts just remember feeling but they're not true they're not facts it's not that doesn't define who you are. he's gotta remember that."
10103.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"And i'm grateful that your boyfriend is supported and that you know he is there, I think that makes a huge difference."
