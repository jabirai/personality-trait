431.0,Provider,See like.
7043.0,Patient,"I said I work third shift to so it's hard for me to keep up with that, like i'm constantly away so I feel like I take my medication fast, or sometimes."
431.0,Provider,Oh okay well looking at your records it actually looks like you're pretty hold on.
7043.0,Patient,hold on boys.
431.0,Provider,Are you driving.
7043.0,Patient,You know i'm part.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, good, I just want to be sure to make sure you're safe. yeah just looking at your kind of the. records that you know the State collects we're all controlled substances. You haven't been picking up too early, so that's Okay, because otherwise it does raise the flag with the pharmacy anyways so what happened today are you just not able to make it."
7043.0,Patient,"No, no, it was a Tuesday, that I had my group."
431.0,Provider,me sorry what happened on Tuesday yeah.
7043.0,Patient,"My kids they've been sick and I had to take them to a doctor's appointment or school, and that was the only available time they had."
431.0,Provider,got it sorry to hear that hope they're feeling better they seem to be getting more energy back.
7043.0,Patient,on and off we did a coven swab they didn't have Kobe but they they keep having sore throat coughing and sneezing a lot so.
431.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, I can definitely get the medication called in, for you, let me just double check that a couple other things. So you usually get you you're taking the buprenorphine naloxone eight dash to film. Yes, how do you take it."
7043.0,Patient,By mouth.
431.0,Provider,"got it is it under your tongue. yeah Okay, and how often how many times a day."
7043.0,Patient,"I usually rip it and half. Okay, because I heard that if I put the whole strip of my mouth that it it doesn't like I don't get the full benefits of it, because you swallow, most of it."
431.0,Provider,"um wait, so you take it so it's it's written twice a day, right now, but you take it twice a day, and then you just rip it in half and."
7043.0,Patient,"yeah well, I have two phones a day, but I split them in half, and I take them."
431.0,Provider,Four times a day.
7043.0,Patient,For hours yeah.
431.0,Provider,"got it okay. that's fine so to answer your question, taking all the whole film at one time doesn't impact how well it gets absorbed if, as long as you put the film underneath your tongue and just. You know close your mouth don't talk or smoke or drink anything during. The meditation after he gets absorbed underneath your tongue and that's where the whole thing will be absorbed. The thing about swallowing is important, in a sense, where I don't know people are aware, like if you know, while it's in your mouth your mouth is still making saliva. don't swallow that because that can actually make people sick. Because of medication works when absorbed, but when you swallow it it just gives you all the side effects and you're right, then you don't get the full benefit so. What I tell people is to put under your tongue close your mouth, you know, for five to 10 minutes. Some people really don't like the taste, but I mean if you can stand it for five minutes at least most medication will be what will happen absorbed already, then I tell him to actually split everything out so don't swallow, while it's in your mouth, including the residual film. Okay yeah so that can I don't so I mean it's up to you, if you want to do a four times a day, I know, sometimes for some people it's helpful that way. But the way the medication works, even if you take a two times a day, it will also be in your system does that make sense. Okay, so up to you. So, and then I see that it usually goes to. The discount drug Mart on breath strive in Ontario. Yes, okay great i'm."
7043.0,Patient,Sorry.
431.0,Provider,"No worries I do see that there is a notification for me that, because of. You know the how many appointments happen miss and you haven't seen any therapist for a bps appointment and. as well. Now."

431.0,Provider,"Okay, I yeah you're right if there is one scheduled for next Monday, so definitely keep that in your usual groups on Tuesday right."
7043.0,Patient,"yeah and then. The last guy I talked to said, I have to do, in addition to group on Wednesday."
431.0,Provider,"Oh, I see okay that they schedule you for that."
7043.0,Patient,"Maybe it hasn't gone in yet, I guess, he said that I needed to do it, I see that I need to do what every Tuesday and every Wednesday."

You know. them again and then he said that I didn't take my urine drug screen when I did, and he kept telling me I didn't and i'm like Sir, yes, I did, and then I guess."
