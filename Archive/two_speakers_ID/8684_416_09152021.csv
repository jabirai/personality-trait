8684.0,Patient,hey how's it going.
416.0,Provider,You saying.
8684.0,Patient,Oh plugging along get to go on another vacation tomorrow so that's Nice.
416.0,Provider,Wait you just got back from one.
8684.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly that's the point, no i'm. going to Vegas for four days for life is beautiful it's like a big. Music festival. So. that'll be fun and then I gotta stop taking vacations for a little bit I just looked at my vacation allotment it worked for the first time in months and, like as a little lower than it normally is so. I guess i'll have to cut back on vacations for a little bit. But. No it's going i'm got some pretty crappy news probably about three days after we last talked. My good friend, with brain cancer has taken a really bad turn. So I don't really know exactly what's going on cuz apparently happened as I would he's all his original tumor was in his brain, obviously. And it was in a portion that affected movement on the left, half of his body and so ever since he had that removed he's always had issues with like walk he walks with a limp and he he doesn't really have super good control over his left arm. But apparently right when I was getting back. He works with me actually at my office and he went on, he went on to full this ability and he's lost all feeling in his the left side of his arm. And so I don't know what happened, other than that he was supposed to have or will he did have a whole bunch of doctors appointments last week and I just kind of text them love know hey i'm here, let me, let me know if you need anything type of deal. And then we were supposed to and then he actually said he wanted to do dinner today or no yesterday and then he texts me early yesterday morning saying he could make dinner so. I know something's not good is going on, I just don't know how bad I don't know cuz up here medical is pretty shitty um so I don't I have a suspicion that he is back down at ucsf because that's where all of his main doctors are at. And i'm also he we've been best friends, since high school um and so we're good family, friends, my mom knows them and I haven't told my mom yet. And I don't really want to, but i'm going to have to um so i've been kind of like trying to figure out when do I tell her because it's like i've kind of given her enough to worry about recently um. So that's that's been real fun."
416.0,Provider,Is there another way for you to kind of get any answers about where.
8684.0,Patient,"There is um sometimes my mom will call his mom. and talk because they're like good family friend like we're good family, friends will go over to his parents house for dinner type stuff um but I haven't mentioned it to my mom yet. And I don't know how much they're gonna want to talk about it because I have a feeling that's pretty bad um because I know. That originally when he found out his cancer was back in which was may of 2020 which is kind of when I started originally having a bunch of problems and then shit really hit the fan. He had two tumors come back and. One apparently really shrank with chemo but then the other one wouldn't didn't change, and then the last I heard is him losing. Like all the feeling and the left side of his arm or in his left arm and then he hasn't we've been texting but he's not a texter. um so the fact that he's not calling said something in general. um. So."
416.0,Provider,As far as your mom cuz. To what tell me what your biggest worry is.
8684.0,Patient,"I just don't want to have her worry about any more stuff than she already is worrying about with me and what she already knows is wrong with him so. Because it's like she's having major asthma issues right now I don't know i'm hoping it's because the smoke, because our weather up here is not to real great but it's like I don't want to add any health issues potential health issues, on top of what she already has."
416.0,Provider,"yeah can I present the other side of that set okay. yeah I mean I don't know your mom but it most of the time when people know of a tragedy, or something like this, they want to be a big part of what our own healing is is being helpful. And you know not giving her the opportunity to know about it and potentially comfort her friend are bringing some dinner over or whatever it is that your mom would choose to do to be connected and helpful during this time might make it even harder for her in the long run."
8684.0,Patient,"yeah well, I was planning what I was going to do is I was going to tell her when I get back from Vegas. um cuz i'm going over to her house for dinner tonight cuz i'm flying out first thing in the morning. And I don't really want to tell her tonight, because then I know we're both going to be an emotional mess yeah and that's not really how I want my last night right before I head out to Vegas to be. um. yeah so that was kind because I kept on thinking about, because obviously this point i've. known for let's see I found out Friday of not not last Friday, but the Friday before so September 5 or six something like that. um. So that was kind of my plan was to tell her when I got back, but. that's just kind of a shit show mess and then I also know that he doesn't tell. He. I know he tells me and then I think. there's one other close friend that he kind of lets know, but there are a couple other really close friends that he doesn't tell and it's kind of puts me in a shit position because he doesn't really want me telling them but they're kind of like his best friends to. um. So just that gets frustrating, because the last like so how's Chad doing and i'll be like well you know he doing all right, you kind of just try and give a very vague."
416.0,Provider,"Answer yeah. yeah yeah. Or, or you could just say something like yeah he's pretty private maybe you could ask him."
8684.0,Patient,"More that's what I say I tell him, you know I I tell him like you know I don't really have a very good idea, he doesn't tell me a whole lot. yeah but, for the most part is true, which is also scares me the fact that he's telling me so much here lately, because he normally never does yeah."
416.0,Provider,Sorry.
8684.0,Patient,that's crappy.
416.0,Provider,yeah how are you managing with alpha.
8684.0,Patient,"Not super great hi kind of just think about all the worst case scenarios. Like all even run through because i'm probably his second best friend and his very best friend is super introverted super quiet like. So it's like I even think like what the hell, am I gonna say at his funeral because. At the end of the day, I know his parents are going to ask me to say something, because the other person's not going to say anything. And so it's like, then, I mean I started thinking about that, I mean that's just really crappy thing to think about."
416.0,Provider,yeah that that train goes down fast right.
8684.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,So what's a counter statement when you start thinking about that stuff what's a counter statement you could make in your mind to help you stop that train from going any further.
8684.0,Patient,"I try and start thinking about other stuff. And, or at least like try and think about like the fun stuff we've done. um but yeah I really just try and somehow get off that topic. it's not very fun topic to be in because it's like no matter if i'm just thinking about him somehow it's working back to like the inevitable path we're heading down."
416.0,Provider,"yeah another option for a counter statement is and he's here now he's still here now i'm going to enjoy him, while I have him."
8684.0,Patient,"And that's true that's true that I have actually the past the I guess the summer actually we've been making it more of a. Priority to hang out because we were we've been best friends, for a long time, but probably about the last five years, he gotten a serious relationship and it's gotten married and. Lives a way more relaxed lifestyle than I do, so we don't go out and do as many activities together, just because there's not as many common interest, but the past few months we've been making sure to like. go out and have dinner on a regular basis or go out have a beer on a regular basis, so we have been doing that, but."
416.0,Provider,Okay okay yeah so focusing on yeah i'm gonna i'm going to just soak it up as much as I can. hold on one second. I need to get in my office it's driving me nuts. So sorry about that.
8684.0,Patient,No that's.
416.0,Provider,"Actually it's really distracting. And then either corner my eyes, just like spider crawling down."
8684.0,Patient,"The closest window, I have to wear my desk currently is doesn't have a screen on it and I used to open that until I started realizing hey there's a lot of bugs coming in."
416.0,Provider,friends that are not.
8684.0,Patient,"invited yeah but. So I guess that's that situation. And then i'm. One of my really good friends, who I was having problems with it was maintaining the relationship with my ex and former best friend. it's his birthday on like 925 maybe it's the week it's the Friday after I get back from Vegas and he called me and he talked to me, which is he did, which was really cool he did give me the benefit, but he was like hey so obviously it's my birthday and or we have some issues. And I was like yeah and he's like well, I want to do two things I want to charter a fishing boat for the day and then us all go to dinner. waiter in the evening and so he's like I was thinking you let me know which one you want to go to and i'll invite him to the other."
416.0,Provider,yeah. Okay did did that and headed back over I mean is that the plan settle down or.
8684.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm going out to dinner um but it's just still you just like even when I think about it, I think about like if he does go what happens when he shows up at dinner anyway. i'll probably just leave I think i'll have to leave I don't think there's any way to handle it other than me leaving. I mean the last thing I want to do is see that person in front of a bunch of my friends when everybody's trying to have a good time. Is."
416.0,Provider,not make your time very fun.
8684.0,Patient,"Well yeah, and I mean most there's a good chance it wouldn't be very fun either. But yeah so i've been thinking about that a lot. just trying to. Because I didn't think about it as much as I did, but it's like that I constantly keep thinking about like Okay, what are the chances that he's going to show up for the dinner. Because I I mean."
416.0,Provider,"I spending a lot of your your energy on this. Yes, what is."
8684.0,Patient,"I here, yes i'm great at doing that."
416.0,Provider,yeah it's definitely contributing to your anxiety.
8684.0,Patient,And i'm because it's like I know there'll be drinking. While they're fishing and it's like it's all of a sudden very easy to say oh yeah just come to dinner when you're drunk. So.
416.0,Provider,"So um. So what you plan for if that happens you'll leave right you'll just quietly just be like okay sorry this isn't what I signed up for ml. So how can you save your mental energy before then, because there's nothing you can do to change that."
8684.0,Patient,yeah that's what. i'd want to do I want it cuz i've been thinking about it a lot between that and my friend it's like that's what. You said in my free time is occupied with.
416.0,Provider,"yeah So how can you how can you pause those thoughts, a little bit. What are some ideas."
8684.0,Patient,"I have no clue I try not think about it, but it's like it just always comes back around unless i'm unless i'm staying really busy."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, what happens is when that pops up in your head and you start worrying about it and. And you start worrying about it, what happens if you say to yourself listen chain I got this I already have a plan I don't need to worry about it, I know I can't control anything more than I already have. All I can do is sleep, so instead of worrying about it but spend my energy on something else. Like What if you actually have that conversation with yourself, when you start noticing yourself going down that road."
8684.0,Patient,I guess I haven't done that yet so I could try that.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it's it's really just about I honestly shane I have to do this with myself to sometimes where i'm just like there's no point in me obsessing over this right now, whatever it is i'm not saying you're accessing that I do i'm. Julie stop obsessing over this you've already controlled everything about it, you can control and you have a plan. So time to move on. Okay."
8684.0,Patient,"yeah no I don't all actually I actually will try, that on a side note, I have been sleeping really good the past couple weeks so without benadryl because normally I take benadryl like probably four days a week. um."
416.0,Provider,"Do you know about the. rebound effect, I don't."
8684.0,Patient,know what is it.
416.0,Provider,"So when you take anti histamines or any any kind of medication like that, but particularly benadryl and you take it for something if you take it for long enough. and often enough you end up with a rebound effect which basically means that when you stop taking it out, first of all it's less effective over time, but when you stop taking it your symptoms your original symptoms are much worse than they worked."
8684.0,Patient,"For me, that was back on."
416.0,Provider,lovely yeah.
8684.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, I i've cut back on it so."
416.0,Provider,Good I. Think great.
8684.0,Patient,I love baby rhinos most real thing ever.
416.0,Provider,"Things that we're gonna be talking about today, that was not what I was expecting your mouth, but I love it go ahead."
8684.0,Patient,And so I like just think about baby rhinos before I go to sleep. Let me fall asleep so.
416.0,Provider,I love that so much what is it with baby rhinos.
8684.0,Patient,I don't know because they're like. they're big and goofy and have like these big floppy ears and if you'd like see them running around it's just hilarious.
416.0,Provider,that's like the cutest thing. Now I need to look at pictures of baby rhino.
8684.0,Patient,yeah that's what because I have I love rhinos so uh but I follow a bunch of different like rhino pages on instagram and they'll have like different baby rhinos running around or like one of my gotta get it there's a shirt and it says save the chubby unicorns.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. See the chubby unicorns. Okay, I love. rhinos are so much better baby rhinos are so much better than a trial So yes. so good."
8684.0,Patient,"But it's a good. yeah and then I about two thirds of the way through that power of a positive notebook. And that's pretty good I haven't had to use anything yet well, I guess, I kind of did um last week my boss wanted me to magically get a bunch of work done or like broke into my schedule. And I told her you know cuz she just she's like well can't you just work overtime and i'm like well, I will work overtime, but then I pulled one job out of my schedule. And I said but take a look at this job here's what i'm allotted for here's what it is entailed it's going to take probably two to three times what I have allotted for it my overtime, is going to try and keep my current schedule on schedule. and So she kind of wasn't thrilled but knew I was correct. So."
416.0,Provider,What do you think were like the very specific skills that he is in that conversation.
8684.0,Patient,"sounds good, well, I guess, actually directly from that book um. It was because they say yes, no yes so like you're saying yes to yourself about something so it's like no i'm not gonna stress out over trying to get this done and then no I can't do it and here's why because I showed her I didn't just tell her no i'm not gonna do it, I showed her. Why and that's what i'm good at with work now when I tell them no I give them a reason a logical reason behind. It and that seems to let me say no pretty easy cuz i'm 99% of the time not saying no to just be an answer, because I don't want to do it it's normally a pretty legit reason of why I can't do it."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, absolutely. I love it."
8684.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8684.0,Patient,"But that's like this story of my life, the last two weeks, and then hopefully Vegas will be, it should be nice and fun so."
416.0,Provider,So who are you going to Vegas.
8684.0,Patient,"A couple of my colleagues, friends and a bunch of their friends there's like 10 or 12 of us, I think."
416.0,Provider,"Are these the same guys that you went on that last year, but."
8684.0,Patient,"One of them is. earth one of them is one was supposed to go on our last trip but cancelled and then a whole bunch of their friends so. it'll it'll be fun, hopefully, I don't get my phone pick pocketing."
416.0,Provider,yeah keep that phone on yeah.
8684.0,Patient,And then.
416.0,Provider,Where was it when it actually got pickpocket it was like in your back pocket or something.
8684.0,Patient,"No, it was in my front pocket um but I was wearing I was wearing joggers so not like protect these kids, I guess, I mean kind of shallow pockets."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8684.0,Patient,yeah but i'm definitely easier to get into and then in jeans and so that's what this time i'm just gonna wear jeans.
416.0,Provider,yeah where you're skinny jeans. I mean for real there you're gonna feel bound coming out of those pockets right.
8684.0,Patient,But yeah no i'll i'll wear my skinny jeans I don't fit and skinny jeans.
416.0,Provider,Men have such strong opinions on skinny jeans.
8684.0,Patient,will die because regular jeans kind of fit like skinny jeans for me.
416.0,Provider,"i'm going to say so we're already scheduled for the 29th. And so, in the next in the next couple of weeks and aside from having the best time ever in Vegas and definitely if you can try to try to work on finding some counter statements to those thoughts right so that you're you're not spending quite as much time."
8684.0,Patient,"yeah well that's, all I can definitely try. For my friend's birthday i'm the whole i've done everything I can do there's no point in wasting time on it."
416.0,Provider,And you're prepared.
8684.0,Patient,The. Other issue will be more. interesting and especially because i'm pretty sure that it's just getting worse in a really bad way very quickly. So that one's gonna be a lot harder to deal with.
416.0,Provider,"Sorry that's tough. there's sort of no way around that yeah that situation there's no it's grief, it is what it is."
8684.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Oh, my goodness well. Sorry, and if you know if anything comes up around that or anything else just reach out before the 29th if something happens."
8684.0,Patient,"All right, oh that my plan is to once I get back from Vegas reach out to them again and try and get in touch with them to see exactly what was going on cuz I was trying to give them space last week, because I know he had a whole bunch of doctors appointments. And it, since he never cancels anything um and then also since he did did it by text and then call me is very strange because I realistically, I suspect that he had his wife text me from his phone is kind of what i'm suspecting has happened."
416.0,Provider,yeah i'm really sorry. that's a tough situation. Let me know if I can do for us discuss on. Okay. Alright chain well i'm.
8684.0,Patient,Nearly perfect us the song said two days. No Tom green yeah today is my last day at work so.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, one go have a great time don't get back at it. I will see you i'll see you when you get back."
8684.0,Patient,"Alright sounds good, thank you."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, take a shame."
