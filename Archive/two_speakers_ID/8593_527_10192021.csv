8593.0,Patient,"She works for. vacaville and that displays to walk up the stairs That was a big problem too, because my sidekick in my back is so bad because I have advanced just to generate disease, so I have a back of an eight year old from my one down. I have to have a major surgery there to just surgery to me oh my God did not do a thing and then guess what happened to me. The lady left North Bay I wonder woman, because my surgery didn't do one thing didn't help me with anything and then she leaves the company, so I can even talk to her."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
8593.0,Patient,"So, and then i'm facing a big big back surgery come up okay. i'm in January, they have to because my back is so bad. They saw me the MRI and there's like literally a spur coming out of my back. Facing upwards, like a devil warm. And then I have no Christian in between my bones, all the way my lower back. Okay, so yes to put mesh and he's got to go through, so it because my back is literally blot. It doesn't have the curve that everybody. know. You know, he says, I can blame it on smoking or this or that but I can't lie to you it's about hereditary it's already in my grandpa the same thing as where I got everything that they have so I have like hemorrhoid problem also."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
8593.0,Patient,"Which is very uncomfortable. Okay, I had endometriosis so I wasn't able to have kids so they took out all of that he got everything and then I had SIS the size of a walnut walnut on my left ovary. So they took that and they only left or right one. Okay, and I think they might be going through the change. Okay, something that actually possible to."
527.0,Provider,la la.
8593.0,Patient,"sure you know, they had they have db trail, so they put me on lupron, which is the worst thing they could have done, to me, without studying it longer first because it causes osteoporosis. It cause it. All right, it makes you go through the change of life fake so I was like 35 going through the change of life. It was. horrible then they took me off that and said we're going to put you back on birth control, so your body thinks it goes from being old to young again. yeah it was just the most horrible thing to face that I wasn't gonna have kids and I wasn't going to go get knocked up by anybody. yeah that's just how I am."
527.0,Provider,So her sure that's.
8593.0,Patient,Really deep rooted to.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. You know, so it sounds like you've been in therapy, often on for a while, then tanya."
8593.0,Patient,yeah. No i've been steadily for like five years.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
8593.0,Patient,I was just see the most growth with cydia but she put me with. Jordan mcclellan you know I guess i'm just. i'm not the type person it's easy for me to say I don't because I haven't found anyone else yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Okay sure sure, so are you going to continue, so I guess my thought is because we do have some of our clients that see outside providers and they come to bright heart for the medication piece. yeah but then they see their primary therapist outside of here versus. Running seeing me."
8593.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And then, and then you do your group session so so basically we do our assessment and then, and then we just make sure we have a release of information on file for Jordan and then you continue to see her for therapy."
8593.0,Patient,What if I don't or if I want to see consent continue seeing you.
527.0,Provider,"So then, so that's fine, then you would just probably resolve your therapy with her then. yeah and then we can schedule. Our sessions."
8593.0,Patient,"Because I used to go once a week with her and now i've got it down to once every two weeks. I don't know, I think it. I can't explain it was like i'm when i'm talking or i'm just talking to my friend Laura it's almost the same."
527.0,Provider,"Page oh sure yeah. Maybe. yeah definitely so so probably what we'll do is, we can do a follow up will schedule a follow up appointment, when do you see Jordan again or talk to her again. scheduled with her."
8593.0,Patient,Monday this coming.
527.0,Provider,"Sunday. Okay, and so did she know you were coming to bright heart to."
8593.0,Patient,"She knows that, yes, you know. Okay, doing that, but she isn't like I mean the way that. Sorry, the way that i'm. shanteau described it was that if i'm not in compliance. You know, then I can't be going there. And I wasn't trying not to be in compliance, I was just trying to find a psychologist like I just helped me get."
527.0,Provider,"Out of it yeah so that so really what happens is you know will will need to make sure that you're attending your group sessions and and meetings with chantel you're keeping up on your surveys and so as long as those things are all you're doing all of that, for our Program. yeah then it's it's not an issue to see an outside therapist. But if we see you know you're missing appointments with us or things like that or survey. growers."
8593.0,Patient,Old or who turns you guys and for me twice. So yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so we definitely you know, want to see because therapy is a big piece of this, I know that with with yeah."
8593.0,Patient,"You can just take a magic pill I think it's all. Exactly, especially when you know, this goes back to long ways my parents getting divorced, when I was seven and just the things I have to go through and yeah yeah so it's like I really. kind of wanted to deal with my childhood.

Right and, of course, his mom wanted to blame it on me well, she does go from the shower to a room with a towel on. showers right here are the bedrooms right there. Right, so of course that. And then, right now, right now, it's not seeing me. Because i'm not backseat. Okay, then I know everyone says she would you or whatever, but. it's nothing to do with politics or anything else, it has to do with the fact that i've added to be traces in my body so.
