3335.0,Patient,hi Rebecca.
252.0,Provider,"Nor, yet."
3335.0,Patient,me on the corner of the moment.
252.0,Provider,and
3335.0,Patient,"Often, that happens."
252.0,Provider,"that's good. We saved her those moments sometimes when, am I going to crap you know. Whatever so we saved her those moments when we're going through crap."
3335.0,Patient,"it's just not the what i'm doing is not nothing amazing that i'm like i'm you know i've been in this like haze of like trying to figure out my. job and all the crap going on. And i'm continually either actually under attack or think I might be under attack by some hackers right this, this has been going on for years now. So I I kind of got on a roll like. Like organizing all the files that are scattered everywhere in my computer. Not in my like previous life I was a really like meticulous. Like organized person there's like a place for everything, and there was never any message the newer. um. And so i'm like rediscovering the joy. Hidden you back to."
252.0,Provider,rediscovering the joy.
3335.0,Patient,"Well it's a little joy, but. it's like i've downloaded. In my meandering research about what I want you know this business and security and hacks and everything I see where's my I haven't in a couple different places, actually, but it's like a lot of data. And then I watch, so this is stuff that i've written about the project so that's 135 megabytes it's probably not all really writing but it's like kind of a lot. And then stuff i've downloaded. 1.5 gigabytes. So yeah it's just been like total chaos on it's like i'll make chaos out of. I have a lot of computers I don't know if you picked up on that. In, but I have like this little chromebook and i'll decide now this thing screwed up, and so I kind of leave it in this half working state and move on to another computer and then do the same thing to that computer move on to another computer. There have been weeks, where like I don't have a computer I have like eight computers and none of them work on after call you guys on zoom. that's when I call you on the iPad because that's like the only thing. So I mean I gotta stop doing this case like. And I got therapies are important. I mean. I don't know how. Actually, my memory is that. I think I went to the cave. And then I came back and then really kind of broke up with me, shortly after we got back, but I didn't talk to you, I like I went into this like blackout I don't remember anything. But I had an appointment with you, which I missed, and then I had a group the next day, which is. And then, so I didn't see you until all the entire group the following week. Right and I dropped that bomb on on you. So i'm definitely doing better than I was. Those first couple days I feel pretty. Pretty normal like I slept I slept. I mean sleeping every night. So that's a pretty good chain. i'm taking my medication. or trying to, but I was married I gave me like these little doses in it's kind of annoying because it's. Whatever it is what it is, but doesn't give me enough for a week and then she leaves work on Tuesday, so I you know."
252.0,Provider,"There should be a refill on the bottle, though."
3335.0,Patient,"No is there, I doubt it. I don't think you can do that with these men. hey look at that. never even crossed my mind. There is one where you feel. When I. Get that."
252.0,Provider,"that's what it is, is. Right prescription with a refill you know."
3335.0,Patient,What is it like a million degrees in. Wherever you are.
252.0,Provider,I don't have been outside yet today. I woke I started working.
3335.0,Patient,Can you tell by how the how hard the AC.
252.0,Provider,"I thought I turned that off because it was starting to get cold, you know. i'm in Reno this week so it's 75 degrees here."
3335.0,Patient,What are you doing in Reno.
252.0,Provider,I have family that lives here. I go for all the time.
3335.0,Patient,You never mentioned that did you know I used to live in. My weird. there's a handful of places where you bring it like when they come up i'm like hey you still in there and.
252.0,Provider,How long do you live in Reno.
3335.0,Patient,"I have a funny lot of funny story JEREMY. um Do you remember the tech crisis, the first tech. bubble burst and to that, like the year 2000 I think. that's under it. And I just prior to the bubble bursting. Had sort of quit this job on it really if he terms, so it's kind of like I would have been fired but I got to say I didn't get fired and then mason and I got together and started our first project that we did, which was a an APP for the MAC. And we worked really hard on you well we're kind of our style really hard on it, but we ended up shipping it to like a year and a half, almost two years later. And that's one of the ways that I spent all my inheritance money that like abby badass with and I just sort of like I didn't live. super lavishly but I, you know. Live just like i'm living now on the money, I made from from from. So anyway mason and I are like we could be doing this from anywhere, what are we thinking like you know living in the beautiful Bay area let's reading. So we went to Reno and, together with a third friend we rented one of the houses up on university Ridge. yeah those. giant condit giant like it's the biggest house i've ever lived in is. Like spacious three car garage and view of the whole valley and everything. i'm keep trying to figure out how to unplugging this longer so I can go in the other. room. Are you still with me."
252.0,Provider,"yeah did you gamble a lot, while you were in Reno."
3335.0,Patient,"I went through phases of being like. not interested. And then being like you know, showing signs of it being a problem problem gambler. uh huh but then I came out just being on interested like if I go to Vegas or Reno today. i'll sort of force myself to do it, but i'm. i'm not really into. force myself to do it if Lillian wants to do it, or whatever. But I certainly lost my share, and you can see here."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, you did."
3335.0,Patient,"I mean. it's not that much if you do it once right if you keep doing it then it's this huge amount of money, but I I went in like once or maybe twice I lost like five grand."
252.0,Provider,wow.
3335.0,Patient,"that's it. And then I got one. Well it's funny because prior to that I was so puzzled about. gamblers and that's like a stupid because I think logically. me and even watch my first year of college is the math class that I took was about the statistics of casino gambling, so I know i've learned. What the likelihood is, or at least what it was back in the 90s. So it's just like throwing your money away."
252.0,Provider,pretty much that's why they have all the pawn shops around the casinos because.
3335.0,Patient,You know they always just kind of some.
252.0,Provider,You know.
3335.0,Patient,"Then i've also been on the other side, where i'm like i'm. You know, they say that people who end up being lifelong problem gamblers most of them. Had a big win in the early gambling careers. yeah that's what they they got this shot, and so they got addicted to. And so I had. I had some not huge wins, but some pretty like. Pretty fun times gambling for sure."
252.0,Provider,Like what's the most everyone.
3335.0,Patient,"One not one night I was a blackjack table, and I was just I wasn't counting cards or doing any any trickery tricky stuff but I I I would guess if I think i'm going to get a blackjack i'll bet $100 and if I don't feel like i'm gonna get a blackjack i'll bet. $10 or whatever the table minimum was and I did that for like three hours and I never guessed wrong. So I walked out of that place was like yeah 5000 more dollars or something it was crazy just kept going I kept getting it and not in this I got it exactly right, so it felt like I was like I had this magic power that was fun."
252.0,Provider,That would be fun.
3335.0,Patient,"Then there's the other story, which is the company that I. would have gotten fired from when the bubble burst. mean it was like the hardest is the highest valued company startup ever at that point, and maybe to this day. And I got hired on to this team like somehow got in touch with the right guy and I got hired on to this elite team, where we like had no bosses and no nothing you know we could do whatever we wanted. We were supposed to be closing these big deals by going, you know working our magic and. He finding our way into the executive team at other companies and stuff, but I would just go off and do whatever and now i'm. Sorry company was in Vegas for what, for a series of conferences, so I went down there, and when it myself an apartment I was just like basically in the blackout time and um. And during one of those blackout, I came out of the blackout, like, I was in the little crappy lounge chair in front of a slot machine."
252.0,Provider,me.
3335.0,Patient,"And I was slumped down, and I was like it's both. This bowl of like off of very from the from the Buffet at the casino and i'm like there's all these people standing around me and the machines going ding ding ding ding ding. And i'm like totally bewildered i'm like what. um. And then, this guy walks up to me and I have to like you know, like food, and I have to like get rid of this bill they start counting out hundred dollar bills for whatever I wanted to. whoa wow mushy and then I went back into the blackout know, and I remember anything after that. But I didn't have $100 in my pocket when I. sort of. said, you know came out of it a couple days later. I know how much I wanted because they send it, you know they tax you if you went over a certain amount, so I had one like $4,000 on this on this. slot machine which is exciting enough to like snapped me out of my. My blackout for about three minutes."
252.0,Provider,that's amazing.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good, you know, and you get on a roll it's a drinking story. For New Orleans they call them the the getting thrown in jail stories, because in New Orleans like everyone's been thrown in jail it's like no big deal."
252.0,Provider,no big deal.
3335.0,Patient,yeah it's.
252.0,Provider,"funny. So how has this week, been for you you're sleeping are you eating, are you getting."
3335.0,Patient,"started eating at me. And just started, leaving the apartment. Well it's not totally true but I, what I do is when I feel hungry I order a smoothie but that seems to be every other day. So I have been eating hardly nothing. i'm. lily I came over at one point. And I was excited to see her. um so you know I went to bed The night before and I just I slept in and slept right through the I guess she came like sort of before her work or something I just slept right through it, so I never saw. yeah I started taking a shower I don't think for like since she left so it's like a month now. But I did share one. I might snow i'm not sure."
252.0,Provider,So when are you planning on showering.
3335.0,Patient,"supposed to see my mom this afternoon, she came back from back East so that'll probably be a moment to get in the shower."
252.0,Provider,Like. yeah you and your emotions how they've been.
3335.0,Patient,"i've been in more pain today i'm in this goofy smiling mood, which is. With us because liliya send me an email yesterday and they gave me some relief. But um. I think I tried to rescue the story group, but I had a panic attack that was like the real deal. In fact i'm still not convinced it was a panic attack. Right um. I was walking like a paraplegic I started drilling and like I couldn't my lack of coordination to put a tissue on my nose I had like like drool coming off of me. It was like when I walked myself downstairs to the ambulance guys, it was like a barely kind of thing that I could coordinate my legs to like. To go down the stairs, and this is after i'd waited like half an hour or more, because I didn't didn't want to waste anyone's time. hey um. So um. They they said they did admit. You know they listened to my store stories i'm like crying and out of control and sobbing and i'm out of control of my face and all the muscles in my body so i'm like twitching spasm and like um but not for like a minute for like hours and i'm. and I tried to get the story out about like how my life has kind of been going downhill since coated been trying so hard to pull together, but I keep losing everything my wife just left and like. You know that the whole night like two people listen to that much amino and they kind of pat me on the shoulder and say sorry man sounds like you're having a hard time. And so they just wait until I like fell asleep basically what's happening at you know long hours and hours later. So that was that was incredible because it was funny I tried to tell the guy at the in the ambulance like. I was like this is finding that i'm like twitching and like you know it's. So I don't know if he understood my son's in here that I was like I was trying to explain that i'm in this sort of recovery group and they read this book about anxiety. mood had just read in the past couple of weeks about how you can have extreme anxiety attacks, you always know the difference between a real anxiety attack and stroke. But i'm like confused about how that can be true because it felt exactly like the way that the stroke is always. explained to me. And my I have a friend who's a. neurologist right. she's a practicing neurologist research scientist and has done rotations in the emergency room and she tells me the story she's like yeah. it's not all that common, but when when catch. A. stroke at the right time, you like knows the phone number to call the guy that I tell you about this. Ah yeah so even the doctors. can't like certain deed do magic brain surgery on you right away to try to save your brain if you have, if you have like a Claudia rain. mean that is a really specialized thing that there's only a couple people, and you know any given place family, you know hundred thousand in the country, or something like that, so these guys can look at an MRI and they take their drill and their special drill bits. And they kind of eyeball it and, like drill into your brain to try to knock the. The clock out of the way. and xander is gone through this a couple times working in the emergency room and it's and she's like that's awesome and then they wake up in the later that day or whenever and they're in pain, but they can walk and talk and do all this stuff that they probably couldn't have done. um. If."
252.0,Provider,wow.
3335.0,Patient,"If we can so she knows like she is like the doctor has the as the vet the whole thing and look at the scans and know to call Mr drill right and he Mr girl weights around at home, for you know every couple days, he gets called the. yeah so maybe I have too much information for a lay person, but that's that's our."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, remember that earlier in the chapter what is said was is that you can tell the difference with a heart attack, based on what is hurting in your chest."
3335.0,Patient,"Okay, maybe I misunderstood it."
252.0,Provider,"wasn't a stroke, it was a heart attack."
3335.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I had I got to study it again, because you can check out some of these symptoms absolute Bot, or almost absolute loss of control of my ways this like buzzing and buzzing throbbing sensation and, all in all my extremities. numb feeling across my face loss of control my face. I mean it was I. It want to be a level headed person right, I try to be a level headed person, but. um I couldn't. Like the book was like or maybe I should be read that as well, but I thought it was saying is. You can maybe it's a saying you can develop the the. The sense of whether or not you're at you know they're having a panic attack or something more serious. Because what I had was really serious in terms of like. Go ahead, he. said in terms of every sensation and I had you know, in the length of that lasted you know, I was I could calm myself down but it didn't stop the. Already felt like I was calm as possible, and I think you mine but it didn't make any difference to the whatever is going on in my body."
252.0,Provider,Have you talked to your primary doctor.
3335.0,Patient,"No i've kind of never talked to my primary doctor, which is a bummer like I had this really close to 1520 year relationship with my primary doctor until I had this question shows and we're yeah now i'm like I met her once on a video call I don't even know what she looks like."
252.0,Provider,I would. call your primary doctor and rule out any medical issues.
3335.0,Patient,"gotten to that point. With. The usual or I don't know you had your experience with your toe like I haven't had any experience like that in a long time it's never something simple. Like I I want it to be something simple or something straightforward right like oh that's a bad sign, you should do this and that no I haven't haven't I mean like. I mean the closest thing was the the. chiari malformation. But even that is a disease with like unclear symptoms and unclear outcome if you get the surgery so like well. I don't know. If he heard it or."
252.0,Provider,"With my toe, even if the first doctor that I saw. send me to a podiatrist because he thought that. There was something in there and I actually have. A picture of the X Ray where you can see something little around in my toe he thought that that's what it was, and that I needed to have a cut out."
3335.0,Patient,What it was a blood clot but he didn't catch that her.
252.0,Provider,"No, it was. What it actually was was my arteries we're closing up."
3335.0,Patient,"yeah well so it's like I think it's maybe the same thing it's like a. yeah like a blood clot Is this something gets in your bloodstream goes into a narrow enough vein that it's there's no room and it stops the blood flow right that's essentially I mean maybe you're slowly built up and it became bar that's kind of the same idea. yeah you know, they should be able to see somehow there's like blood here and there's not blood there so."
252.0,Provider,"You just took an x Ray he walked into the room looked at my toe and said yep trauma like I hit it and it came back in, and I said I didn't hit my toe."
3335.0,Patient,yep.
252.0,Provider,"And it was actually the appetite podiatrist that he sent me to That said, go to the the regular hospital. If it wasn't for that I probably wouldn't have a duo. done, you know what I mean I wouldn't."
3335.0,Patient,"you're right, so you know I had one other time in my life and i'm pretty sure I had a stroke."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3335.0,Patient,"But um and I talked to some doctors about this, and none of them will say oh yeah totally are. Like based on all the very detailed recollection of it, the time period and everything that was going, are you know doing eating at the time and drinking to murder everything they said yeah that's totally awesome. What another thing that can happen is you get a blood clot and then you. As long as you keep moving around and your heart is your heart rate is like not totally. Low, then you have enough blood pressure that and stuff sorry shaking around you can knock the the blood clot through it wherever it's stuck in your brain. and blood clot yourself. um it's not a thing that they recommend. Like if you think you have a blood clot do jumping Jacks or."
252.0,Provider,hey.
3335.0,Patient,Right um.
252.0,Provider,it's either going to break away or is going to go go where it shouldn't be going. Right.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know yeah I don't know I don't know what the possible. negative effects are. But so for panic risk patients they tell us. you're okay you don't have to go to the hospital right and for stroke risk patients they tell you rushed to the hospital of you as soon as you feel this this or that right. um and so. But you're right the to the getting a second opinion thing. I mean not on these major issues but on minor issues already a couple times in my life, the second opinion thing is has paid off so. So you. should call my primary care."
252.0,Provider,"that's exactly what I would do rule out any medical before you just blame it on you know, a panic attack. But let's see if there's something going on with you physically and I know that will work going through a lot of stress right. yeah going through a lot of stress I get it, you know there's a lot of things that look like there could be something physical because not only are going through, something mentally emotionally but you're also going through something physical right. So things change I get it, you get sick easier, you get you know other things that have laid dormant pop up. Because you compromise in that time. So i'm always get a medical rollout first. seeds."
3335.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,Right.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah and to tell you the truth that after Kara thing from the hospital they actually sent me to the crisis Center like I think one of the doctors caught enough of what i've been through that they're like you know correctly they're questioning like can this guy take care of himself. You know, sitting alone in his house. So they gave me this thing. Ironically, the crisis care Center is the thing that my uncle like ended up running in Massachusetts. I think every state has you know. yeah one or two of these things. And it's just were like you're alone and you're not exactly in need of like a hospital care, but you can't quite hack It is because of some major incident right which is kind of what happened to me. And, but, as you can probably tell i'm like. and One I think i'm sort of. Coming waking back up or something."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, waking back up, I totally get it, but I also know that, through this whole process you're going to have good days and good weeks and bad days and bad weeks. yeah it's a process it's not something that can just. rectified self in the day."
3335.0,Patient,"So. I figured out how I can save my old phone number, and then I can start answering the phone again. which will be big because, like last time you and I talked to your like you should go to detox. And then you had somebody try to find one for me and they may have called me but I wouldn't know because I don't answer the phone or my the number that everybody has I abandoned long ago and. The number that I have gets a constant stream of like spam calls, so I basically unless I recognize the number, you have to call it, leave a message and then wait until I get things to check my messages and so it's like a little hard. Yes, no not easy to get a hold of me. i'm. didn't want to like a. tell you like right off the BAT there's like. There is no medical detox but so like I wanted, as I explained to marry. i've been taking more benz's than she prescribed Barrett and i'm at this level, where, if I stop i'm going to. At the very least. Have like psychotic kind of response to it, I know from experience. and have horrible headaches, but also quite likely have seizures and other bad things happening um so I just. So, because it seems like Mary understandably because I wrote all those nasty emails and stuff Mary just didn't have much to say about it, so it kind of leaves me in this position, like. Well, I could do this thing that mary's telling me to do, which seems like really literally a recipe for disaster or I could kind of keep stick with the status quo, in which case Mary said she's going to kick me out of the Program. which I don't want like I I I don't care, the Director and want to get off of all of it, and I wanted to I know for a fact that it's possible for a doctor to do a controlled. You know thing, and I feel like I have the will to follow those orders, right now, you know if there were something I believe that work yeah but I don't have the will to do like. But. For me. So I didn't realize that I have refilling that prescription so i'll take those refill the refill and then i'll go to group and i'll say yeah I took them and regional the refill but I needed more than one a day I needed like. Three or four like I was telling you. that's, the only thing I can think of right."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Again, or you can go to there's gotta be some kind of medical detox for ben's owes."
3335.0,Patient,"my sister is like a. ninja when it comes to like finding public services, she runs a high school for kids with special needs and i'm not bad at it i'm good at finding things on the Internet. And our family last time I was in this position spent like three days non stop trying to find what you're talking describing is that what I need is like. kind of constant monitoring and attention from a doctor, but I don't necessarily have to be I mean i'm not want to ruling it out, but you know I don't necessarily need an expensive. facility or i'm locked up, you know kind of like um. Because it's going to take a think it'll take months or it'll take you know, two months."
252.0,Provider,"You know, residential residential doctors. They detox you right off of it within seven days they detox you offer the benzo some maybe 14. But they give you. Other mega region."
3335.0,Patient,Right now.
252.0,Provider,But.
3335.0,Patient,"I do know that there's a on yelp I found a guy who's like mobile Dr SF or something is just the guys on yelp and he listened on yelp one of his specialties as addiction and anxiety. And he costs two or $300 a visit and if you call them, I feel just come over to your House. So that's the that's the kind of thing that I think. could work, you know I don't think my insurance is likely to pay anything for it, and if you came every day, or you know, then it would start to add up, but if you came once a week for like you know, and he could tell that i'm following directions. That might work."
252.0,Provider,That my work.
3335.0,Patient,"i'm sad that. I have my part in a totally that like I have heard mary's get into this, but because of our communication breakdown. um. that's not happening."
252.0,Provider,"Well, and to get somebody that is. That can monitor you closer."
3335.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean is definitely going to help in the long run and. detox or the the process getting through it faster. Rather than months and months and months and months.
3335.0,Patient,"I OK, I have a minimum information about this, but I do have a little bit. So my buddy Andre was on six milligrams of. Really legitimately strong remember these. Drugs that he had were very strong and real and he was on like six milligrams a day, which is a pretty you know it's not biased that anyone's ever heard of but it's a fairly high. dose and he went to. He went to a fancy like a bourgeois. You know, one of these like whole whole body health. it's like one medical you heard one medical. know when medicals like a lot of people will go to the doctor in San Francisco like tech worker types it's like you know, the new doctor's office and it's like they were just ahead of the curve on doing everything online and it's a little more convenient and it's easier to you know. And they try to skirt start meetings on time and so it's sort of like a mock you know the modern doctor's office, so my friend found. In serving even more probably expensive version of one medical where he went and had his breakdown and told them what was going on and they hadn't got a team of doctors. And came up with this plan for him and that's the plan that lasted months literally months, but he thought he was he was sincere and he wasn't what you know screwing around and he followed the directions and he told me that he went from that crazy level to zero, and he was. almost perfect you know pretty much comfortable the whole time. um and then the only other hard information that I have is what whatever you just told me two weeks and I have my own experience of. doing it abruptly with where I know that it took it takes two weeks to if you just do it abruptly, it takes two weeks, for your body to adjust. um. Remember, I was going I was going from one milligram a day of clonazepam which by the way, of all of the. Different bands, as it has one of the worst. This associative problems when you detox off of it. it's like the you know what I mean by disassociate you know. yeah you stop remembering that you're you are believing it or something it's really creepy how horrible feeling. So I was going from one milligram to a third of them in order you know to say dropping by two thirds of the military and. i'm. And I was suffering all those crazy. And that's actually unique to apparently to learn as a fan like if you detox directly off of. um. what's the one that i'm."
252.0,Provider,Dan.
3335.0,Patient,"Dan excellent it's it's still it's still like you know, a living nightmare but it's not as bad as. As the. Since I barely take that stuff that's another thing i'm like is that really the smartest thing for me to do that."
252.0,Provider,well.
3335.0,Patient,"So I question anybody that's like I can get you from here to zero and two weeks and you're going to eat fine. But you know i'm not I don't know. I think I know as much as your average doctor about it, if not more, and then there, but there are these spent you know, a handful of specialists out there and I don't know how to find them or convince them to treat me. Anyway, i'll just keep playing along and. Trying to come up with the best possible plan here's. My mom probably have ideas today. Now what my mom might have some ideas, today, I mean this is nothing i've been in this position. Like Nick said it yeah five times, or something like that. i'm sorry yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Andy mendenhall. i'm. He runs this the he now runs this place. and wait for that go. and These are in hazleton. See. Maybe he does now he. Okay, so he is md doctor. that's how I he used to work in it, this is him right here, he used to work in a residential treatment facility for a very short time that I worked at as the Doc chief medical officer of a place called central city concern which is really a detox in a treatment Center. For people."
3335.0,Patient,"right but tell me his name, again I can't see it, you have to scroll the left or something oh."
252.0,Provider,And or Andy mitten mendenhall.
3335.0,Patient,Little further Twitter you. See Michelle Baker. I thought this is Twitter and linkedin Andy and you know.
252.0,Provider,"His name is Andy mendenhall and. This is just linkedin but. yeah so he runs this place. Oregon health and science university DC central city concerns what he runs now. Well, that really didn't give me anything it's a nonprofit organization for detox but what I know. I know about him. And this guy is amazing, I mean he is one of the first ones that I ever heard of using suboxone for pain management. So he specializes in in addiction pain management right."
3335.0,Patient,"And so kind of what I have in a way, so. hmm it's one way to look at what i'm."
252.0,Provider,Being able to get a zoom meeting with him to find out what course of action would be the best. um.
3335.0,Patient,So here's a. You also recommended that I get a primary care.
252.0,Provider,yeah.
3335.0,Patient,"Go to your primary care. i'm gonna lay out the story to her as well. She did offer to sort of take on my. she's like, if you want to take your Benz of thing and move it to ucsf that's something we can talk about. um but she didn't know the whole truth about it. Right she just saw my one milligram. Now. So um. But maybe she could do it, you know if I explained to her or somebody she knows, she knows at ucsf that'd be great."
252.0,Provider,that's a great idea.
3335.0,Patient,"it's funny there's two doctors one's a neurologist and the other is the guy that does the botox in my neck. And they both know they understand my problem, but neither one wants to take it on as their thing, so they keep the hot potato in me back and forth. Because. It is to I understand they probably see a bunch of people like me, and you know they. You know bleeding heart doctors want to help so that they give you this prescription that before you know it, that you're back you know cheating on your so I understand not wanting to get involved, but. It also sucks when you want when you're really ready, you know I will promise i'll follow the directions, but i'm."
252.0,Provider,So your primary care.
3335.0,Patient,"You see the name is called breaking news yeah. You want to see what it's like trying to get an appointment and. let's see. I have the best. That the awesome. should find it. Actually kind of took a lot of time to make it. Is you know those um if you dig and dig you'll get the life, the actual terms of your insurance. yeah i'm. Good which is like 30 pages long document that says very in a whole lot of detail, like. This and this and this and you get stuck in a foreign hospital what's the limit it actually shows you how much the insurance is willing to pony up and that. That iteration yeah so I did that, for the plan and i'm on. And it's like. it's just crazy because it's a standard plan spelled out the way they normally are except for the How much are the how much the patient. has to pay column is always zero in the how much did that they'll pay is always like off it's off the charts it's crazy it's like seriously I have presidential healthcare and every other homeless person in San Francisco. um. So they're going to do that I was going to go to ucsf actually just for fun, let me see if I can find that. T. shirt. SF quiet. or coverage church. Member. they've been calling me to like I hope it doesn't cancel itself, because I don't answer my phone i'm. coverage. wanted to make sure I kept this around. Because anybody's ever asked with insurance would be like oh my God, really, this is what most people get. document. me like one more minute on this. Basically I just remember as a PDF. Unless the. sheer. citation. After that all calls. Are all go on the online scheduling good I bet i'll go on and it'll be like your next available appointment is like 45 days for."
252.0,Provider,"Any call, can you put in a request for. me an urgent."
3335.0,Patient,"I think the best thing on this case is like the other trick you mentioned once, which is just go there. Because it's so funny when you finally make it to ucsf after waiting six months there's like. it's so chill there's nobody there there's like nope you know huge you know. waiting room full of people are like. I haven't Member handbook for them that's that's a bummer it's like. Oh, I get like an evernote I forgot. let's forget about evernote or like actually everything. I think I made this. I sort of edited the document down so it's easier to look at because I wanted to tease mason with it. He is he has Ms and he's in Japan, where they have like free you know insurance. And pretty much world class, you know. So much of your time doing have it's the perfect time. Rebecca. But how much of your time do I have. Are we out of time."
252.0,Provider,We got about six minutes good. You find it.
3335.0,Patient,"Did but it's totally not. The thing. But now it seems like we bet it's it's it's called php or like. started kind of. One thing i'll tell you in Miami a couple of minutes. You know I started this project. Because liliya had just sort of dumped me and left and then I went into the blackout came out of it and I couldn't remember why was why did we break what happens, you know. I mean I knew kind of vaguely but said, I decided to make a journal, of all the major events in our relationship and then after working on that for two days I realized oh I should make. This into like a cool website and put pictures on it and publish it on liliya wtf which I I already have so that's this point. lily has promised to look at, though I didn't tell her even that it was a website, but she said, whatever you're creating over a little thing. that's The other thing i'm working on."
252.0,Provider,And she's going to read it yeah.
3335.0,Patient,So I. don't I can't find you that exciting thing I will show you the in my last minute. edit.
252.0,Provider,"Now is she reading it, as you go along or she reading it after the fact."
3335.0,Patient,"Well, what i'm going to do is make this really long wizard in the site and it's going to explain it the beginning and kind of what it is and it's going to tell it's going to be authenticated so you're going to see it if you're familiar. it's going to say if you're ever read anything that makes you angry stop. and relax for a day and come back. And then, if you read something that you think you want to add to or it's incorrect, then, just like leave a little note on that on that slide right. Because I want it to the whole point of it is I want it to be the not the. feelings about to the marriage, but like the facts of the marriage. um, I think, no matter what liliya will squirm around, though, because if you look at the facts of the marriage she looks terrible. And so she's going to try to throw all this so but I hope she sticks what she said she would do. servicing protocol wise i'm sorry because I opened up all this big these banking statements. you're eating really a timeline on it doesn't exist somewhere else. This is what happens when I like move everything around, which is what I was doing prior to you. or call. You really a timeline. And I have to go all over the place to figure out what the Fuck happened, like some events in you know emails from its in text messages, a lot of it's in my credit card statement. All right now I can share. So. This is it or this is sort of half of it, this is the part that i've put exact dates on put in a spreadsheet and sorted by date. um. And it goes, all the way back to 2011, this is a daily net. It goes for."
252.0,Provider,Your whole marriage.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah so I mean this, I have another document which is longer than this, which a bunch of those things even have dates, but I just haven't like added them to this sheet that's gonna be like 50 slides or something. Each big blow up where like I run off or she runs off, and we have some problem i'm going to try to sort of explain what you know what happened for my purse. and not in too much detail, but you know this happened, but then i'll be able to say, like because she she throws things at me like our marriage was. You know, we had a good year at the beginning and it's been terrible ever since, and this is total bs right i'll be able to say, like, I was sober for like X percentage of the time that we're together or you know. i'm. or know your first affair was blah blah blah, or you know I don't want to necessarily that's focusing on the negative there's the positive to which is that I remember just great until about a year and a half ago. You know. In her mind what she's done is she's extended out that year and a half to be like practically the whole marriage so she doesn't feel guilty about what bailing out on me."
252.0,Provider,i'm.
3335.0,Patient,"PC see this, you can see therapist does not know how to help others marital problems. And knows how important really is, and the therapist is a big fan of lily's because she sees how happy happy ethan makes liliya and because lily is doing so much Now you can take care of themselves. And therapists recommends couples therapy ethan approaches liliya who answers simply know, and this is after like up above, I explain how during her early years when she was sensitive and she needed a couples therapy, I like taker couples therapy. So hopefully it'll tell story."
252.0,Provider,So did you guys go to a couple therapy with us.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah when she needed it we did when I needed every not known to. Only show it all you see it before I showed her we guys. It will probably make her look not so great, but I think it'll also be as honest and as straightforward as. It is non demeaning you know it's not an attack, I just want to lay out the facts, you know."
252.0,Provider,Try to figure out what part.
3335.0,Patient,"Where it happened then. yeah where, could I have done better and where did I really I started doing this thing, where she was the most important and that are you always shoot yourself in the foot when you do that from to on right yeah so and I kind of know when that happened and i'm. Center."
252.0,Provider,"The I heard it in young. Definitely, and it makes it tough because you're fighting for you know, a part of your life that you want to save you know."
3335.0,Patient,That I would.
252.0,Provider,"You fighting for a party your life, you want to save. You know well."
3335.0,Patient,"that's true but, hopefully, if I do this right that's not what this is this is just the facts. I might even present there's you know you can skew things either way i'm going to like it's going to be a timeline that you view right. And I think there's going to be different icons for like. ethan remembers and lily or remembers right and we can each put our own separate thing and that's fine if it's like we remember things differently."
252.0,Provider,"So let me ask you a question. Besides, trying to figure out exactly where it went wrong what other what else, are you trying to get out of creating this word you guys."
3335.0,Patient,"It started as a way to explain why I don't want to. um. Just before she left she took our she took $26,000 out of our joint checking and paid off alone that had to do with her, her business. And I think that was inappropriate and I think he has enough if we take our joint checking account split it in half, and then she pays her. Business loan off she still has like you know. Not 100,000 but she still has 10s multiple 10s of thousands of dollars, you know. But I kept explained to her over and over. and I don't want to pay that if you're just about to leave me, I will feel like such a sucker forever if I pay this money for. This is like the money left over from you going with another man and starting a restaurant, that was a disaster and leave them leaving me like who would feel right about paying that right right um. But she doesn't see it that way she sees it like we decided together to pay for it, so it doesn't matter if you have to bear. That was the original motivator but, honestly I don't care that much about that the lie is that the checking account is half hers and if that's what she wants after after reading my thing. If she goes, all the way through it and i'll be able to tell. And then see there's going to be a little thing it says, like you know, do you think it's fair to. You know, whatever that ethan pay half of this yes or no, she says yes oh i'll pay. That was my promise to her. You know what I mean."
252.0,Provider,"Do you have any any hope that reconciliation, at this point."
3335.0,Patient,"I want to see the email she sent me yesterday. Where she's saying. She sent me this email that was like because I I tried to excessively send things to her, but I definitely messaged her more often than she does me and I always say I miss you and I wish we could fix things and i'm so she sent me this email, but I think she just recently rented an apartment. Which. kills me because probably see renting an apartment with a guy i'm guessing. Because either that or she rented a shit all apartment that she could afford which isn't like her, you know. She won't tell me. doesn't answer the phone doesn't respond to my messages I mean she will admit you know sort of like six to 24 hours later she'll she'll respond if I send her a message. So. She sent me this, but then I was crazy because. Second, sending all these messages about how sad, it is that I gave 10 years of my life and, like, I feel like I you know, I was about to have a family and so it feels like I you know i'm one of those guys that had a family died or like. You know these horrible sad things and she finally responds and says it's really sad it's true, and you know and i'm sorry to see you in so much pain, but you know if you completely sober up, then you know, maybe there's a possibility that we can get back together again. um, and so I responded to that and I said, you know. I was really, really nice every single sentence, I said, you know, thank you for sending that i'm happy you sent it, but if all you're saying is. you plan to do whatever you want for an indefinite amount of time not telling me who you're with or where you are. And maybe someday in the future, we might get back together it's not like a huge motivator for me. it's not. But you know. So I sent her an email back and is basically saying is that really was that your intention and he hasn't responded."
252.0,Provider,wow.
3335.0,Patient,yeah. that's My guess is he has this guy that she likes he's willing to come back to me and have kids with me but doesn't want to hang around while i'm like. Putting my life back together and kind of go either way right so that so she sends me this like really vague carrot on a stick thing which is like sort of trying to help but it's also sort of so vague and non committal that it's like what do you even. What do you do with. This doesn't mean anything.
252.0,Provider,"yeah What do you do with that, how do you how do you find encouragement or."
3335.0,Patient,"i'm like i'm in pain, right now, because you won't answer that not care about me you frankly you don't. I was talking to her when I was having that attack and I said, I think I need the hospital and then I tried to send her a text another text message which came out like just a total garbage because I couldn't control my phone. In my hands and she just sort of tuned out, you know if he's not calling 911 or two just. Not. You know, worried about it. Not she doesn't care. So I have to accept that, where that's where she's at, and you know."
252.0,Provider,"that's a tough place to be. Especially when you want something different, you know."
3335.0,Patient,"It seems. You know she's so slippery and slick and everything, but so she'll never let any of this stuff get like blamed on her which is. I mean if things really go south of US i'll just make the whole website public anybody that wants to read the whole true story just go read what happened, you know and then um. You know there's like four people in the world that care or whatever, but that's like. The truth is that i've been I got halfway better you know, and I came to be a change and I never got all the way, better, but a big part of that was because she was torturing me by like. beans sort of half of the wife and I couldn't figure out what was what was going on and I don't blame all that, on her, but that was definitely part of it. I was kind of stuck in place, because she was the only thing left in the world that I cared about so important and then keep she kept dropping all these signs that like you know the the marriage is over, like you know what do you expect me to do of course i'm going to. fall deeper deeper into this hole of. You know, being this pathetic guy that you know and so vicious cycle."
252.0,Provider,And then I want to have a baby.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah and then so so that's the timeline already because one time, I was so disgusted she she's like. marinas having a baby bottle I just had a baby blah blah just everybody's having babies and like Do you realize that every woman in the world wants a baby but it's so hard that like you know, half of them aren't having him and it's like a big heartbreaking situation but. that's only matters it's like the ends justify the means and so i'm gonna get a baby. To be too bad for all those other half of the women that or it didn't work out but or however many. I can make it happen. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"yeah when you told me, I thought, a baby, as he I think I do to make this situation better."
3335.0,Patient,"Right and then I also put in there, that a year before she she was swearing her like undying loyalty to me, and she was saying, she thinks it's unlikely that we're going to have a baby. This is during the period when we're spending your responsibility right and I kept on saying like i'm kind of worried that we're spending so much because we're not saving for a house if we ever wanted to have a family. So that she would say, well, I feel like I want new boobs and like blah blah blah so she was into the like this lifestyle that we were living. and fully enjoying it and you know, encouraging you to me make out to make all these sort of bad decisions, but then, when the day then suddenly I want a baby and like. So all that kind of goes out the window it's like she says doesn't want to take any ownership of that thing that we did together. um I actually like takes $26,000 at the last minute to pay off for like last affair thing. it's to me it's crazy it's crazy I think i'm in it, so I can't tell, but I think any outside person looking at it would say like this woman is crazy."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
3335.0,Patient,"But. it's also true. That like the side of her that you saw the taking care of ethan forever and being the thing that lights of his face and she did that for like a year, or a year and a half of like just utter. pain, when I was just in the worst shape, you can imagine that's a long time to be have a dreary home life but that's not enough time to like break your vows of marriage anything. To me."
252.0,Provider,well. wow.
3335.0,Patient,Care whose fault it is. A totally uninteresting to me.
252.0,Provider,"Just remember, I want you to keep one thing in mind that you publish which I know you know this. can be used to use against your board along."
3335.0,Patient,"Well yeah but if the person who. thinks they want to use something against me in the car de la like has the right to go in and Edit it or the ability to go in and easily edit it and had been you know, had that ability for months prior to me. publishing it, I mean that's the last. case scenario that I would ever do that, but if I did it I would make it so the private parts are hidden. So it's like. Okay judge live, so if he sees me for libel, you know she wouldn't answer the phone, so I made this interactive website to try to communicate whether and allowed her to hide anything that she didn't want. um. You know publicly visible. So I don't feel responsible for anyone. i'm. sure her being upset about it, sorry."
252.0,Provider,You might feel different and a couple months.
3335.0,Patient,"that's another thing is that I noticed that the longer that nothing happens like feelings. You know, anger goes away and things become more steady and stuff it's but i'm sure it's like coming steady with you know boyfriend number eight or whatever she's on at this point. that's what's happening to her so that's not to my advantage of me, but I don't exactly want her back, I definitely don't want the like the cheating and lying back I want like the old William back so if."
252.0,Provider,"You don't want that back, but if she came to the door right now in the vulnerable state that you're in."
3335.0,Patient,"I keep saying I don't know how to heal us I don't know what it would take I don't know what you could do. After you look with check this whole story out because, basically, what happened is she started being dishonest about two years before she left me. Right I don't know how I don't know I don't know what I don't know, but I do know that she was dishonest back then, and then obviously was sort of like losing interest in me, but she was going through the motions and taking care of which I needed and I loved so I held on to it. So should she have stuck around for those of years and do that you know, so if he's coming home and whispering sweet enough, you know i'll be with you forever don't worry everything will be fine like up until the last day. And then she's gone. I think she did more damage than she did good probably."
252.0,Provider,"yep but not telling you the truth, by playing this game, but there's another piece of it that says it's the reason why she probably didn't ethan is it sounds like there was financial gain in it for her."
3335.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Well, you know, and you wind of it. With you were catching wind of it."
3335.0,Patient,"You know that's on the timeline. You know it's crazy like the week that she paid that $26,000. Yes, the same week. where she was pregnant and considering being with the guy. Who is the father of the baby. Which means she was sleeping with him. Right she later convinced told me that she had slept with him like five times, or something like that, so there isn't that much window of time where she could have possibly slept with him five times. In between, like getting pregnant and having I think she had an abortion i'm not even positive that, like I haven't seen her since she left and so she. did some elaborate stuff to fake the urn, what do you have to be that elaborate she totally could have stayed pregnant, the whole time and be like this pregnant, I know. i'm um. Anyway, yeah so she left on like September not six that's let's say no October six on September 26 she paid the $26,000 which is right in the middle of the time when she was like sleeping with this guy. So that's exactly what I kept telling her that's that's what I can't stand is like being like this sucker that's paying all this money out of his personal account to pay off your last sort of like. project with some guide and like when you're right about to leave for the next guy and i'm like that that's not cool that's like that's not the same thing as we're going through it together right. Right right. But it is for her, and it makes a big difference to your bottom line."
252.0,Provider,"well. It sucks when you feel like you've been played it, for we love somebody you know."
3335.0,Patient,"Right so fine she if she tells me, you were playing before then great. that's the end of the story. But I just wanted to put the cart you know she it's like there's so many weird little secrets that only like basically sheer I know you know you know, all I can think of. Like nobody knows my parent mom doesn't know a lot of it, none of my friends know so there's nobody in i'm going insane right or she's telling me i'm going and saying. i'm So how do you fucking find out. So that."
252.0,Provider,I would say you take a vacation to a nice spa you detox from your lenses and you come back you get some clarity in your mind and look at things from a different perspective.
3335.0,Patient,"yeah that's. Basically, you can tell i'm I think it's so unlikely i'm going to find a doctor. My best plan is to just do it myself."
252.0,Provider,I think before.
3335.0,Patient,And I say that.
252.0,Provider,Before you do it. Talk to PCP.
3335.0,Patient,Oh yeah and i'm gonna talk to my PCP.
252.0,Provider,"All right, talk to you about it before you make any decisions because she's going to have the best resources, you would help on how to do it might be able to do it herself."
3335.0,Patient,yeah but she works at ucsf and they're even more they're really conservative based on on that spectrum of like prescribe anything to don't prescribe any their way over in the don't prescribe anything calling so it's not. The kind of the style of thing that they would typically take on.
252.0,Provider,well.
3335.0,Patient,"Like the neurologist and the botox guy you know, one of them either of them could take it on and they're like no way. So. No, they say, is go find an addiction specialist and. My God it's crazy man because. This is a big problem to the people's addictions with these drugs they're really cheap they're easy to find everywhere. Every doctors there a lot of doctors to prescribe them and people don't mean you know, like take more on the side or whatever. And it is. It makes like kicking heroin like a joke or picking cigarettes 10 100 times easier."
252.0,Provider,that's why I think that's what part of the reason why I recommended in patient to get.
3335.0,Patient,"To get through it. My buddy didn't need that the the buddy that what he did was he had to take water solutions where they were dropping it by like micro amounts right over months and that works that's known to work you just have to I mean, so I couldn't figure out how to do that."
252.0,Provider,They do it for suboxone to. No time no time for that is.
3335.0,Patient,Even suboxone I think you could you could go faster than just based on my experience with opiates you can go faster than.
252.0,Provider,"You can with other things. Generally bezos to. alleviate the detox from it, I mean that's been you know what i've witnessed in my career. Right, you said I gotta go I got some."
3335.0,Patient,Initial appointment really hope.
252.0,Provider,"Listen i'm going to see in the next couple days and we're going to stay closely in touch all right. Okay, anyway. feeling like okay you got to stop sharing. So I can better my."
3335.0,Patient,"Next Sunday. No, no okay. Do you have any extra slots, do you have any extra slots, I can call and try to get an extra appointments and you go go."
252.0,Provider,yeah quit sharing this so I can go to my.
