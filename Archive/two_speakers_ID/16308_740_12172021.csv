740.0,Provider,"Good afternoon or Good morning, where you are."
16308.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,There you. Go.
16308.0,Patient,same as usual.
740.0,Provider,And what that.
16308.0,Patient,Just just fine I guess nothing really. happening.
740.0,Provider,"Nothing at all nothing new, since the last time we spoke."
16308.0,Patient,You.
740.0,Provider,know. anxiety and depression.
16308.0,Patient,it's. it's always. outside my room. outside my comfort zone and really. Really. nervous and stuff but as long as i'm in my room no it's fine.
740.0,Provider,So were you ever able to follow with your nutrition.
16308.0,Patient,"yeah actually. Like the day after, I think."
740.0,Provider,That.
16308.0,Patient,"that's pretty good. She said. After we talked to her, she said something in the mail for us."
740.0,Provider,So what do you think.
16308.0,Patient,"it's pretty good mom she said, my mom's already on the right. The right, the right idea, she seems to change a few things up. because she feeds me I don't really feed myself."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm. You mean she could see you.
16308.0,Patient,yeah she does.
740.0,Provider,yeah i'm sure she's not spoon feeding you.
16308.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
740.0,Provider,i'm sure you can pick up your own sandwich you need. yoga. So she's waiting on the right path and to decide to tweak a few things so that's the. The overall how did you feel like the appointment when.
16308.0,Patient,is more helpful and I thought it would be.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm. Did he kind of. Did he kind of brain at. Any confidence at all like i'm heading in the right direction i'm doing something right.
16308.0,Patient,"Well yeah because. I was aware that my mom was. doing a little bit, but she I didn't realize how much she was doing differently. Like she was really conscious about everything, like. What she's been feeding me and. How much she's been beating I didn't really take notice of that but. You know I saw that she's been on it."
740.0,Provider,that's amazing i'm so happy hey so um. How has the extra thousand one have you been able to go for a walk. So i'm just wondering that was just. i'm just going down your list of goals so. So what's something you want to target for today.
16308.0,Patient,"well. i'm amen sister been complaining they're. Coming out of my room like that all pass colleagues. Look, for even for little things like. That because, like. A couple weeks ago we made like a we had a meeting with me my mom and my sister, and we were saying things that needed to be changed, like my sister needed to be more on the dog food refilling. And one of mine was, I have to come out at least once a day. So I don't know. i've just been really reclusive we really. I guess."
740.0,Provider,So do you have a restroom or you're in your room.
16308.0,Patient,"No, I I go to the bathroom but they mean more than that, like. Like. or. hey you know all around making dinner. For pointer sisters."
740.0,Provider,"So. i'ma tell you something. Right. it's the truth. But it's. Maybe a little hard truths just a lovely. But in order for this to get better. You got to challenge yourself to do some different. Because just because they made the suggestion of course you don't have the Bible, because you didn't come up with just. You only or bad bad things you come up with yourself, because that means you hold their be you can add them to hold you accountable to make sure that you are doing the things that you came up with yourself. Does that make sense yeah so I felt as though they if they you need to form your own challenges that you that you are actually willing to do right because change can come unless you do something. Playing game is mad change. Playing game gives you permission to stay where you are. Does that make sense yeah so you have the summer, with the challenges of where you feel like you need to do differently, because one of the best ways to shake depression is that you have to do it anyway. is easy to sit down. is easy to play the game is easy to talk to the people on the game system and all that kind of stuff and I have to talk to your parents and I have to do it that's as easy as saying you're wrong but that's not gonna bring the change that you want does that make sense. So you have to challenge yourself to do it because the more you saying you're wrong, the more depressed you get. done don't you see the about you see the right. yeah yeah."
16308.0,Patient,"I wasn't. i've just been. Any years have been like this and as. it's been more intense over the years, like more I. stayed in my room The more I want to stay in my room."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, because that's where your company is but see the thing about it is change is uncomfortable you supposed to be uncomfortable. Because if you're not uncomfortable image you're not changing. Does that make sense. And that's what that's what you want right that's the reason why you kind of get their fee right. So. This thing. And I tell patients with all the time and i'm gonna tell you the same thing right. In therapy. A lot of times i'm going to tell you stuff that you don't want to hear. i'm not gonna say oh Jonathan is OK, you can sit there another week or two. You know just kind of sit there and sing kumbaya and you know put your hands together and just kind of thing for me like no no don't say that because you've been doing this for a year. And the more the more you sit there, the more comfortable you get and you're more and more comfortable now to the point to where now you don't want to do anything different outside of your comfort. Does that make sense. So change is supposed to be uncomfortable Jonathan. is going to be uncomfortable but is necessary. But one of the things I would encourage you to do for your homework. Is that I would encourage you to challenge yourself to do something outside of your room. If that means the walk outside to go to the kitchen to pick up your own place to visit your mama don't have the vendor to do. Then do that."
16308.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Let me you gotta sit in the living room and and and cackle why why they taught me because you know you got to start doing you know small things small things first right. So that means okay well i'm gonna challenge myself they every time I make my food i'ma go pick it up, instead of harboring the semi don't. do that. that's that's phase one."
16308.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Do you think you can do that. yeah are you sure. Because the next time I see you i'm going to ask you how many times you went to eat your food. Because if you eat three times a day. Only a lot that means you gotta walk three times to go get your food. Every day, but it's quite why because I do a lot everyone, I see a room but guess what it is a small effort right. I think building in the living room why she's cooking that can be that can be too too much too fast. But then, without a doubt it down a bit right because you used to go into your room and so basically what this is is is that OK i'm going to go do this task and, at the end my reward for doing this task is that I still good to go back to my room does that make sense. So, so I do a task, but my reward is I go back to my room does that make sense. All right, so then me so there's something there so it's kind of like it's kind of like work and reward does that make sense, so me working as a result of me working you i'm saying as a reward I get paid I get benefits I get vacation so forth, and so on, does that make sense. yeah so part of your reward after your work once you go pick up your food and come back you come back to Roman God and guess what that means you get to stay in your room and to get a meal is ready. And then you got to get up and do it all over again."
16308.0,Patient,Now.
740.0,Provider,"This is a you're not going to do it every day. However. Because we got this lower Member i'm not gonna push you to faith you don't have to do it every day. However. There are seven days in a week. So bonnie told us when we were little. Seven days in a week. So to start out like. I would say, at least. every other day. So at least three days in a week. So if the week starts out on Sunday. You can do Sunday. You can do Monday. You can do. Whenever dissolve the three days in a week between Sunday and Saturday, whatever days you go there's your choice i'm not going to take you for young logistical for yourself. But at least three days for all three meals. Yes. Including MAC so better and just making one a meal, so you got to go back. monkey go ahead, take my segue off I go I gotta go maybe get this man. So listen we're going to start out with three. Each week and go a one more we're going to add another day. Sound fair. Any objection. Okay. We thought I liked it. yeah. So we do three. And then, after you do the three I won't say each week we're mo but each time you see me we're add another day. Does that make sense. yeah okay so administrate each week i'm going to say you send you somewhere, as of today, I mean you will add another day to the week so that means so so for two weeks, you do three days. And then, for the new up Maggie and then for those two weeks, you do for day, every day, and so forth, and so on. and say what are. You gonna be every Monday. down the road, so if you want them now. But I think this kind of get you jumped on it. Because I know you won't change if you didn't want change you wouldn't be here. Definitely would be worth your time with me. Right, so we can be very but i'm also say what you don't want to hear. We can be readable. But i'm gonna tell you what you don't want to hear you. Okay, so we're going to start out like that. So this starts make week Sunday. So. Starting on the 19th. So the week of the 19th and then the week of whatever the last we get a Monday. You do three times I mean three days. In a row, three days, three times now, this is what I want you to do right, and this is just to help you out if you feel anxious, which you are i'm going to tell you now you're going to feel anxious or you're not going to want to do it. Okay, one of the things I would say is this, I want you to tell your mother. mama my therapist had me doing in the family, so you substances that my favorite has me doing an assignment there three days a week, I have to get up and go give my meal. advocates. For each meal that you make for me. So do not bring the muscle on these days. So that means if you don't get it you ain't gonna eat. You won't be. In a room. Get legal get up. And down you got it you got to tell you guys, have you run. You run. i'll go okay. So you got it then say so for the three days. I don't want you to bring them apple just leave it in the kitchen. So guarantee just go make you get it. Good you got me on. But see if it helps because it because they hold you accountable. Right you don't want to be in a I don't finish the thing you don't want to be enabled while you're trying to progress. yeah right so when we get when we get off the stations, I call you mom Thank you mom as a system or tell your mom or your sister they're starting on Sunday. So, because before we leave here you're going to tell me the day before we leave because once once you decide today, then will you talk to your mom will you say her those days and say on these days, do not bring me my meal for breakfast lunch or for dinner or mathematics. just leave it in the kitchen and i'm a competitive. i'm telling Jonathan this stuff works right i'm telling you work i'm not lying to you I wouldn't tell you to do something I wouldn't do, but one thing I do know about depression is that in order for you get out of it, you got to make an effort. Because the longer you see. The longer you stay stuck. And I would hate for you to be an old man this doesn't y'all. It every day I say it. up a little horrible. You really wrote a year decade and now you're 55 and six, the seo plan and a keyboard player talking to people saga young for playing games they're like oh man. So they're just looking for, but no seriously, it is one of those things you always want to take your life and take it really low, so I think this will be good for you, what do you think."
16308.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And he laid movement just a little bit. So, then, we meet again I want you to tell me how you felt I want you to try to keep a log. Of those three days tell me how you fail tell me about your anxious moments which about the where how you they were to overtake me how you able to overcome those thoughts and those feelings and did you go get your play. What you think what do you think it. You."
16308.0,Patient,Understand figure out what days.
740.0,Provider,"Right do I want to do in consecutive weeks I get him over with. Okay let's figure it out. So, whether you think."
16308.0,Patient,Maybe Tuesday. there's then. Every Sunday.
740.0,Provider,"So Sunday Tuesday Thursday. w days. Okay, so let me start miss on a on a 19 even will pick up your food for each meal. That you get a break, you get a concierge service on Monday. And then Tuesday you do it all over again. And then you have your coffee or tea and always be. There, if you do it all over you and then, of course, you get concierge on Friday and Saturday. I think that's a good day. So tell your mom on Sunday Tuesday and Thursday for the next two weeks. You have to pick up your own plate. From the kitchen just leave it in there even compete with yourself. Do. You alright cool. So. Show you something. Then we often do you battle with native thought. we're going to do we're going to do a scenario. How to challenge those negative thoughts. Okay, so. It says the depression for says the same in anxiety, often the result of irrational name this dog. So depression forces of pain and anxiety right. Are. They play hand in as. Someone who regularly receive positive feedback and work my feel that they are horrible at their job because of one criticism they're irrational thought a bad job and form which would dictate how they feel about themselves challenging irrational thoughts can help us change them. So we're going to talk about how to chairman's done. So, give me a give me a negative thought that you struggle with the most."
16308.0,Patient,Like. Nothing. burger.
740.0,Provider,"OK button here, though. So you know, we should get nice white on this thing with that, but I can't anyway. So nothing but a burn. Alright, so the first question is is there, substantial evidence for your thoughts of you, being a bird. what's the evidence that you will burn."
16308.0,Patient,My mom always does everything for me i'm. Not. Against. help me but. I just said.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. Well there's there's not really any. i'm still waiting for everybody. Everyone, so you can do humanitarian you said, because your mom does have you, but she never says, did you have the burden."
16308.0,Patient,before she did.
740.0,Provider,She did she did that.
16308.0,Patient,"couple months ago we got. where she was like. I can't do this and she's like. Listen, you will have your dad she was like. There was. A flood. she's apologize for it, since."
740.0,Provider,"She apologized for it, as you said it against me."
16308.0,Patient,Really. don't like oh my team was one turn.
740.0,Provider,"Okay next question is is there evidence, contrary to your thoughts So is there evidence that opposite of what you think in regards to you, being a burden."
16308.0,Patient,To not being a Virgin.
740.0,Provider,yeah like is there evidence opposite of it like Do you see any evidence that you are not what you think you are.
16308.0,Patient,Oh. No my disability I get to pay rent and. For some food. And I give them all money which you want what you wanted.
740.0,Provider,"that's good. let's go to the next 1am I attempting to interpret this situation with that all the evidence. So, are you basically so me."
16308.0,Patient,I don't know.
740.0,Provider,"What that all the avenues, what do you think."
16308.0,Patient,"not sure. For me, it seems pretty clear but. No."
740.0,Provider,"Let me say, Sam yeah."
16308.0,Patient,"I don't know it's just. You know the fact that I am exists, I mean. everyone's are all before I was on by air. mom and grandma all is that the drive me to appointments and. They talk to the phone people, because I was too uncomfortable to talk to people on the phone."
740.0,Provider,"let's go let's keep going what would a freelance think about this, think about this situation. So. say is if. You have a friend. Who knows about your situation. You know what, let me just. say this can be friends, so what would you think your sister What would you what would your sister would, what do you feel like Is this what we think about the situation, do you think she would say that is true."
16308.0,Patient,depends because. I. feel like a giver pretty good friendship and. Maybe a little beneficial towards her but.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. So, if you look at this situation in a positive way. How, how is it different if you look at it positively instead of negatively. So you looked at a positive way, it feels like my mom visiting with that she loves me um. You know she. You know I help out, I give her money for bills, I give her you know, money that she can have you know just to show my appreciation. You know she was my meals, for me, because of the fact that, of course, you know I came cool and then secondly because of the fact that she cares about my health she cares about my well being she appreciates me not shoot, yes, you appreciate appreciates me being here with her survive it. So that's been able to hire a negative situation positive. So when you look at it that way can you feel the sense of being a burden."
16308.0,Patient,"Yes, but a little less so, I guess."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so a little less okay so. happy with with looking at it in a positive light happy you feel to you said, being a burden."
16308.0,Patient,But I don't feel like it's enough. To make up for everything. or make it even I guess.
740.0,Provider,You say you don't feel like it's not because of what.
16308.0,Patient,I just don't feel like. The positives and negatives.
740.0,Provider,Tell me tell us up.
16308.0,Patient,"A lot for me. helps me a lot with problems I have. and She gets me water all the time. also feel like. I make a lot of mess like when I take a shower there's always water all over the place, or. don't know it's just some noise breaking furniture. Not on purpose, but just."
740.0,Provider,Like.
16308.0,Patient,"Like. my grandparents they paid to get the whole House. New floors that wanted. You know this tile and they put it was in my room too and and in my room the tile is really. messed up. it's just like. Really damaged because of um. I don't know why it is it's really bad in my room, but I don't know exactly why it is an invoice. At my bed, I am. Whole my walls by my bed because. When I when I tossing turning at night, my body versus against the wall leaves. damages it. I just feel like Oh, when I die or something never have to worry about Oh, the gutter remodel fix the room up because I messed it up so much. I don't know if my grandfather knows about all the damage in here but. very upset. My lived with my grandparents and Sunday will. My my dad's parents. Before my grandpa died, I remember he had. He had noticed, something that. I had cause and he was like. He had a breakdown, he was like. he's he saw and he's like. Oh you're breaking our own This is something that you're supposed to leave behind for for people and family and its main destroying stuff. And you said because that's all you have to give to the family. blotter things like the toilet in our House that. Are the chair the couches and more broken because they don't have enough support in the middle that. I guess that's a lot of these, and I also stay home and my room occurs early destructive nervous."
740.0,Provider,"My lesson I was going to fail, that okay that makes sense by you saying you're wrong but it just like you said it's something that you have to remember you're not doing this on purpose. You know i'm saying like and the thing about it is, of course, some of the stuff that he's saying amanda statuses his investment or whatever, like a but. it's not like you're doing it on purpose and i'm sure that is you could pump inside him, you will. But at the end of the day, to patch up a wall is really cheap at home depot. Just a flat and they got they got some little patches the little patch while the kids were like $10. know in paint is richie. i'm I got two days of pain I got some prime and sometimes less than 20 books, so if you could even say like if end of the day, it's not like you're doing it on purpose. You know, and the thing about it is a leaf, and this is something that you have to give yourself credit for and least at least. you're doing something about it, you changing your diet your way you're getting healthier you talk to the nutritionist other kind of stuff. it'll be different if you weren't trying to make any effort but you're doing something about it so at the end of the day, give yourself credit for at least what you're trying to do. And you have to look into like thing and then, once you get to the place, you want to be, then you can see for yourself. Before but for now yeah i'm saying you're doing something about it so give yourself credit. Every different if you're not trying to do anything it'll be different if you weren't trying to erase that you weren't trying to do right and things like that, but you are. And at the end of the day, once you achieve what you're trying to achieve you're gonna come out much better. And then you can fix you on eBay you can fix as well. But for right now. we're going to just focus on you getting better."
16308.0,Patient,Like can do those things.
740.0,Provider,"that's it that's all you can do. And it's all right you're not moving no time zone anyway, so they liking, all these leaves with my wife."
16308.0,Patient,"Well, when I first moved in. My grandfather he didn't really know my situation um and he was like oh it's not a permanent thing that if he moves over here, and then, when I didn't move over here, he was like. He is he told my mom that he doesn't see me leaving that it's all right, I could stay. nervous around him like. My mom always said that when she was little he abused her like it was really physically abusive and. The use of drugs. And stuff and when I was younger like. Probably less than a teenager maybe like 12 or something. He pushed me off the deck one time and. And my mom stop talking him for like a year to. Just. I just feel like whenever i'm in the room, with them or whenever he comes in front of them I always feel like he's like. Oh, this point what was his grandson and just. they're sitting there. The other day, because a certain foods, I will make maybe like a burrito or something she wants me to oh you come out and put things inside that you want to eat in it. mm hmm and she called me out to do it, and my grandfather wasn't done with his or was like thinking to myself why did she call me oh it's not even like he's still out here thinking to myself and. They were all they could, I guess, they could tell I was uncomfortable. And they were like oh I don't buy. Just always like i'm afraid to stand too close to him or something because he's maybe he's like Oh, he stinks or. something you know I just really. I just feel like the more I avoid him, the more the longer I could stay here, because the front and farm and so much, then you spin it come to the conclusion, I need to go or something."
740.0,Provider,I can become.
16308.0,Patient,"Some of the times that I do come outside my room or did come on summer. i'm almost always rushing to get me back into my room link. Let you can't stand me sometimes it's like it's like one of those things it's like. When i'm not in front of her face she. look like really wants. she thinks it's a good idea, but and then, when it comes to a cheese like. Over a real fast like okay go back to room like I just. Like when I lived with my grandparents I didn't see her often because she lived to see or two away and. shows you just I want to see you so much, all this stuff like I want you down for Christmas and in in stuff and then she. When I. Actually down here it's like. When I went down. Like I bought her."
740.0,Provider,um.
16308.0,Patient,I just feel like.
740.0,Provider,"Well, maybe that's something you should talk. About in a."
16308.0,Patient,"I guess when I am. Because I guess. Even while I was in school my coping mechanism or way to try to fit in as. Being the class clown or something. everyone likes a lot for sometimes I take it too far. Just that's usually, when I do, I have noticed with me something myself that i'm when I do get nervous and they get a really a lot of anxiety when i'm in front of people. um i'll start acting more. i'll say stupid things."
740.0,Provider,"You know. I mean that's just part of. The Defense mechanism, I mean sometimes you could just be so anxious. And so uncomfortable because one of your treatment goals was to be more social into work on your communication skills and there's some will definitely work on. However, you know I gotta get we gotta take a step by step, because there's no point in working on communication and being a social, you can come much a room. So um so yeah that she is i'm images part of. Part of a Defense being uncomfortable and being anxious. Some people are really goofy or they get like socially awkward and things like that, because they will uncomfortable. yeah that's already but we'll work on it, however. Despite what's going on in regards to one thing I will say Valley, you may do want to talk to your mom and see how she feels a bit, you can have an actual understanding, despite all of that stuff at the end of the day, you still have a challenge to complete. Okay, video Sunday through Thursday. And then I will definitely I will follow back up with you. During our next session which. will probably be in January because i'm booked."
16308.0,Patient,For the rest of the month.
740.0,Provider,"But I was singing group. And i'll definitely check up on, you know. If you need anything, between now and don't don't hesitate to reach out i'll try to please you we have somewhere. Right okay. yeah okay yeah fine you Joe."
16308.0,Patient,"yeah just a lot of. Oh, I get when i'm not playing games just overthinking wrongdoings."
740.0,Provider,"don't do it stay away from that's a dangerous place. Now, the thing you need to think about is how you gonna beat whoever that is on the game, and then, when Sunday, can you go into the peak of your meal. don't over exaggerate don't overanalyze though overtake there is nothing to overtake about now, the thing about it is now, we just need to do we need to put forth some action to those folks okay. Well i'm an it, I want you to have a fantastic weekend I can't wait to hear about your new journey of getting up. and getting your stuff from the kitchen.
