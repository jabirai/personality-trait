14775.0,Patient,"Anything that I don't know if you can see, I get the little butterfly."
298.0,Provider,around me.
14775.0,Patient,"Because I have my shins I get these weird I have dry skin really bad. You know, and I just keep treating everything topically and then what I found is that you know my one doctor will just give me a pill for everything, but I found that like. The key thing over the last year's been nutrition and what I put in my body like to try and avoid gluten sugar is just my enemy, I have horrible like cravings for sugar, but then, if I eat. Too much sugar on Dun Dun. da."
298.0,Provider,"Another thing i'd like to recommend. Because i'm right there with you is probiotics are huge when we're looking at immune system, and this face stuff, and all this."
14775.0,Patient,yeah I. tried to force myself to drink temperature i'm still my doctors like you moved it. cemented foods. like an era era Vedic diet type of thing and i'm like. I can't handle anything hot or spicy i'm like. i'm a when you know.
298.0,Provider,Vice I can't do the Arab beta I know what you're talking about.
14775.0,Patient,"You know I struggle with that one. i'm like i've never done eating foods, but in fermented foods and just pickled stuff when. i've never tried kimchi and I. still have a hard time like sauerkraut don't ever ever taste good i'm worried, but like sweets, I crave sweets and that's what gets me in trouble. it's like this vicious dysfunctional cycle. And the know what's funny is like I had the childhood trauma, but my mom was like a cheerleader and a hairdresser and her. remedies. For everything was sweet. That was our go to for self soothing and so. I don't know them are all linked, or what but there's a correlation for sure."
298.0,Provider,"Everything I have read there is. A direct I once had my blood looked at under a microscope. This is interesting, I had so much candida in my body yet i've never had a yeast infection in my life."
14775.0,Patient,I used to get them all the time. You know.
298.0,Provider,"And that there's a direct relation between candida your immune system, all the all the skin problems. It was all directly related in any sugar just in. flamed chronic fatigue, everything was related to."
14775.0,Patient,My skin's irritated I can feel it in like my face and like sinus pressure and then. my stomach and gut health email like you said. And when I take my probiotics and prebiotics are doing the campus gen stuff like. I do feel better.
298.0,Provider,I feel like computers so expensive that I don't I don't drink it as much as I love it but i'm such a cheap person.
14775.0,Patient,"In portland and they. They try to think that the the new San Francisco very. got lots of temperature, we have a lot of farmers markets that i've just tried, a lot of different ones. Have you found one that you like. um well, we have Dr brew here, which is okay and but there's one I don't know the name of it but it's just this local girl that makes it and I think she's originally from fresno and she loved her stuff. But it's expensive like four cans of it, because she can not a bottle. it's like 12 bucks you know for for. Like i'll drink like. One every couple of days at the most."
298.0,Provider,"I do cook the data. But I just don't like the flavor as much as some of the other ones, and then I look at the sugar content and it confuses me because you need sugar to grow Kampuchea but. At the same time, why would compete at put a like they advertise the lemon one is is has like you know the least amount of grams of all of them, the lemon ginger one and so anyway. yeah if I cut out sugar I lose my midsection which is really nice."
14775.0,Patient,"That is where my weight is is all in my stomach. Normal sugar offering and lots of my problem, and so I self medicate I think when I I get triggered. or I get upset I have this tendency to just want to eat something that's bad. For me, or like mcdonald's or something like I just lose my."
298.0,Provider,My baby shower.
14775.0,Patient,tip yeah. it's just. I get the basically what I call the effort attitude. And as it's. Like oh my gosh stop you know.
298.0,Provider,could be kindred sisters.
14775.0,Patient,"In that mood it's just like all reasoning goes out the window. is like. Some people have told me when i'm triggered that they're like it's almost like your eyes change i'm like oh my God she's going don't say things like that. But yesterday I had a meltdown, you know when I found out my family's. coven positive. For my. eight year old. And he's at and everybody was building on this wedding and they weren't catering and doing the cake and. And then I just was having a kind of a meltdown like oh my gosh and you know my boyfriend's like, why do you feel like you need to fix this this isn't your problem. And I said i'm a fixer and then I can't fix this and then it poured down rain I get to the gas station, and I said double rainbow and it was just kind of like a reminder that it's like i'm in control of the weather. And life at night and everybody's going to be okay. you're not super women and I don't know."
298.0,Provider,What.
14775.0,Patient,"you're gonna do, but that mindset of just spiraling a little bit so. i'm just double rainbow I was. Like Okay, let it go good."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so I need to tell you what my psychiatrist said I my next. Patients here and I could talk okay. um so what he said was Yes, he had to look it up himself on the cymbalta and the liver, because he wasn't aware of that and he was like Okay, at this point just choose an ssri take her off that ssri put her on another ssri So where are you out milligram wise on cymbalta."
14775.0,Patient,"On 121 doctor said, is a lot."
298.0,Provider,It is it's the top dose and.
14775.0,Patient,"stuff like maybe tried it, because when you're in a better mind frame reduce it."
298.0,Provider,"yeah now 50 is not that bad for your AMT I mean it's a little high, but it's not going to be like. it's not that high But what if we were after the wedding talk about doing a MED change and going start the decrease down I we don't have to go completely off of the MED we just have. To start decreasing it down and now so that I don't create what's called serotonin syndrome."
14775.0,Patient,Like. Well i've had that before off long yeah.
298.0,Provider,"It is, and if you've had it before it makes you even more susceptible to getting it. And so i'm i'm."
14775.0,Patient,"yeah i've had that when I was on lexapro and then my insurance changed, and they wanted me on select so which are relatively kind of the same. But yeah that. syndrome. And then I had been wellbutrin and same thing kind of. So, but some doctors worked really good for me."
298.0,Provider,Long term.
14775.0,Patient,yeah I figured i'd give up my liver for for. yeah yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Okay um. let's not make any changes today let's talk not this weekend group the following weekend group and i'll pull you out into a. You know, into a breakout room to talk during. And we'll. we'll figure out. Which one to go with to give you coverage for we might do something like vibrated. Something."
14775.0,Patient,That I don't know if.
298.0,Provider,it's an expensive new drug newer not new it's newer if you've tried other SS eyes and cymbalta is not doing its job we may want to look at vibrant it's a next level of importance of.
14775.0,Patient,OK OK.
298.0,Provider,"OK, but i'll do i'll ask my boss again if fibroids a good choice for you all right take care care."
