705.0,Provider,Good how are you.
7466.0,Patient,i'm good Thank you.
705.0,Provider,Good so what's going on this week.
7466.0,Patient,"I don't know there's a lot my feelings are all over the place, actually."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, what emotions are coming up."
7466.0,Patient,"Oh, my God there's so many I actually had a breakdown yesterday. Because I don't even know if it's because of a small thing or it's because, like a lot of feel it get it was like because of a lot of feelings that I had and just not eventually but. I don't know if you know, but like I mean, I think I told you, but it's just me my dad and my sister, and I personally feel like. I have a lot of responsibilities around. Like I work. I go to school, I mean I haven't been working for the past three weeks because of the schedule, but. Like I work I go to school, I clean the House and take care of my sister at her school and, like all of that and. I think, as a 20 year old and ever since I was really young i've been having all these responsibilities anyway, I was just tired of it, and I remember. I told my dad Oh, and I I i'm really sensitive when it comes to dirt and things being messed up around the House i'm really, really sensitive about that and. I remember, I told them hey when you take our dog to the dog park I wasn't home, so I was I can't do you mind taking her to the shower as well because. she's gonna be covered in mud and dirt and I don't want her walking around the House, especially because I just clean the House, two days ago. And they were like yeah and I came home and then I saw that note it didn't take her to the shower and it's been hours already. And she's been walking around the House laying on the couch and it was like I literally told you guys and you know, like the now it's two days ago, and you know i'm already tired from school and everything that i'm doing. All I asked for is for you guys to take her to the show that's it, and then they were like, why are you being so sensitive. Music i'm not being sensitive it's something I don't like and I already told you guys and you're already agreed with it, and so I expected when I walk home that it's been done, but it hasn't been done. And then I got mad because I was talking to him and he was on his phone as if he doesn't even care what i'm saying which. Again, really sensitive about and he knows that, as if he was doing everything that he knows I don't like at the same time. So, then, I just snapped and it was like i've been cleaning the House you guys just throw things on the floor what am I do I work here or am I a Member of this family, I was like i'm tired. i'm not, what do you guys think I am I can just clean up after you guys at least he could have done is take her to the shower and you guys feel it that and always just like. yelling and I was just over it, and then my dad was like oh my God I don't feel like talking to you right now and that got me even more offended."
705.0,Provider,"I can't imagine, and it feels like this just built up built up and then again just that was that was like the use expression that the straw that broke the camel's back. yeah not."
7466.0,Patient,"over it, and then he was like i'm just gonna leave the House, I was like you know what i'm going to leave the House because I just don't want to be in this House, right now, so I left. It just wants it to my car drove somewhere and just start crying and I actually got a panic attack in the car, because I was crying so much that he couldn't breathe. And then. I don't know yeah I just got over, and then I went home, and I saw him vacuuming the floor mopping the floor and taking the docs in the shower, so why couldn't you do this earlier when I asked like, why does it have to get to that point. But I honestly. didn't even say thank you, I just wanted my room and."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so you haven't been able to have that conversation like you brought up a good point is, why does it have to get to this point i'm being pressured, this is a lot of responsibility. let's have this understanding of how we're going to help one another out because you're helping him and you expect. In return."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah I mean they do help around the House I just cooking, but I feel like i'm doing so much freaking more like. As a 21 year old that I have responsibility with school i'm already stressed out about that and I don't think it's fair to me. Especially because, ever since I was a young, I was never I never experienced being a child, and I was always an adult around that. And i'm tired of that and, like why can't you guys take care of me, for once, i'm doing everything i'm asking you for one thing and that's for when I clean for you guys to at least keep the House clean for a week. And you guys can do that I literally fold the laundry and five minutes later, they just throw their clothes on the floor and i'm like. Excuse me. And then, when I get angry they're like, why are you so sensitive. Like i'm not it's disrespectful."
705.0,Provider,Is there any open like dialogue where you have family meetings.
7466.0,Patient,"They don't that's the thing that's my problem, every time I try to talk to him, he looks at his phone and completely ignores me and tells me. I don't feel like talking to you right now you're being weird right now, you just says that and I hate that because that's when what my mom used to do that's what my expertise to do. And i'm super sensitive whenever I talk tried to talk to my mom she was drunk. She was on the couch and she was always staring at a corner in the room, and I always wondered what the hell is not corner there you keep staring at it. It was really annoying because every time I tried to talk to her, she wouldn't listen and then she would always use this thing where i'm trying to talk to her and she would be like. Okay, you got your rate i'm a bad mom and, like, I never said that that's not even my point i'm trying to get you to understand me when did I say you're a bad mom. And then she would just. victimized herself and start crying be like yeah i'm about my mom horrible mom i'm just gonna go kill myself as you would actually do it it's not like. She would just say like she would actually threaten me then I had to be like Okay, and I had to calm her down instead of her calming me down. With my ex. It was the same thing and be like hey this made me upset and he would just stare at me. i'm like did you hear me I said this, he said, like do you want to have a conversation about it, and he would just literally stare at me. Or is there in the corner of the room again and I already told him don't do that I hate it because my mom did that and I hated it please don't do that to me. And then he would get angry and be like your show controlling, why do you are controlling me if I don't want to talk to you I don't want to talk to you. But this was the case every day and i'm like okay you don't want to talk today, what about tomorrow, eventually, you need to talk about this."
705.0,Provider,"Right and when you were a child, you suppressed it all, because you didn't have that opportunity to know, to use your voice and as an adult you're using your voice and it's just like Come on, if we're going to be in this relationship. effective communication."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah and he would get angry at me and then I had to be like i'm sorry that I even I remember, he will break up with me and I would literally I would literally say the sentence that i'm so sorry, please let's like stay together next time i'm not going to talk about my feelings. And now, when I think about thing that I feel so sad i'm like, why was I saying that that's so disrespectful to myself. Because i'm literally asking someone to stay with me and i'm not going to talk about my feelings and I told him. If I ever feel upset i'm just going to go be by myself until I calm down and then, when i'm with you we're just going to be happy, I was literally sacrificing just be with him."
705.0,Provider,"Right so important for you to remember that. You know, shadow when you go into that next relationship is I don't deserve to be treated like that what I deserve is to be an equal partner. One that I can share how i'm feeling and i'm glad that you have now that self awareness that that wasn't fair to you that that relationship was unhealthy. And he didn't deserve to have that relationship, if you could not even express how you were feeling you're human you're supposed to have feelings and be able to share and that's how we navigate through the world and that's how we connect with one another. is being open and honest and i'm really sorry that he wasn't there. To be able to give you that, but you know now that you deserve more than that and not going to settle."
7466.0,Patient,"And it makes me angry because there's so many feelings that I still have, and I wish we could sit down and talk about it, like with him, specifically because. such as the one thing that has been always with me and it's so like it affects me even to this day, is this thing that he said to his friend. So we were going through a time where I had zero trust in him and that's my whole relationship with him, I had zero trust in him, because he proved that I can trust them. And I text with his friend and I saw a message that his friend sent at this completely naked lady, and this lady was in like an adult movie star anything was just a normal person, and I was like Why is his friend sending naked pictures to a friend, that is, in a relationship. that's disrespectful and automatically I thought that wouldn't be okay, if my girlfriend sent a picture of a guy completely naked. When i'm in a relationship, even when i'm on a relationship that's really weird. But when i'm in a relationship that's disrespectful and, for me, not to say anything it's even more disrespectful allowing it is more disrespectful and he allowed it. And it was in one picture was multiple pictures which is like thing going on, so go more curious and I started swiping even more up through the text and. There was this conversation between them that his friend was like don't you ever get tired of being with data for the past few years, like doesn't it get boring, and he says, oh trust me dude it's better to masturbate."
705.0,Provider,"And you know shade a shoe remember these things and it's just even more so, of putting together what you deserve and what you look to have in your next relationship and making that healthy and a safe place for you."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah and no, but it still affects me."
705.0,Provider,Because.
7466.0,Patient,"He was my first boyfriend and he was the. First person that I ever even kissed and him saying that it was like so I might that bad like Am I that that that you rather do that, instead, and you embarrass me in front of your friends, saying that. Why are you with me if that's better if doing that is better than being with me."
705.0,Provider,"And those things hurt and then, when they hurt you it's like the opportunity to talk about it that you're left where you don't even understand where he was coming from."
7466.0,Patient,"And then it because he never told me, we never had the conversation when I brought it up, he got mad at me. for seeing that text and I apologize, but the conversation was never brought up. And every time I called him crazy."
705.0,Provider,"And it's unfortunate that the way that you're describing I don't you know correct me if i'm wrong, but I don't see where he's gonna sit down and be able to give you what you're asking for to explain these things."
7466.0,Patient,yeah no he never did.
705.0,Provider,"Have you too, and I think we talked about it before is writing that letter."
7466.0,Patient,I know yeah I never finished it.
705.0,Provider,"that's okay that's okay that's what this is is a process, though, and as these things come up it's really good because you're remembering all these things and write it. And when you're ready, then, is being able to release that and I know we talked about a couple of different ways that you could release it. Because if he's not going to give you what you need and being able to talk about it it's like then you're going to take control and you're doing what you can. To have closure on it."
7466.0,Patient,"And I just it's like so hard for me to think that I will ever have closure because there's so many things it's not like one or two it's hundreds of things. That we never talked about, we never dress and it was just me feeling them and, eventually, towards the end of the relationship, I believe that i'm crazy because of the amount of times, he called me crazy, so I was actually acting crazy I was. I I literally acted crazy throughout the towards the end of the relationship. Like no one ever told me that i'm crazy as much as he did like he kept out every time I was feeling something he was like you're crazy. and half of those things that I was concerned about turned out to be true, once we broke up."
705.0,Provider,"you've probably heard the term to, and I know, several people have used it this week and session of gaslighting and and the gas linings where a person makes you feel like doubt yourself. And those things that come up and by calling you words like crazy and it's just real with that is write it down and start disputing it all. start where you know look, I mean at that time, like you said you were at your wit's end you didn't know what else to do, and so you did things that were not normal for you, out of fear, out of her out of anger that makes sense to me. be happy to come from the embarrassing like I just."
7466.0,Patient,"Remember myself acting weird and i'm like, why was acting like that."
705.0,Provider,"shade ahead you, you had share this was your first basically love this was your first experience, so you had no other experience to draw on. So, giving yourself a break that this is all new to you, and when it comes to you know the heart and feeling hurt and angry and all those things, and then you couldn't even express it I could see where it would come out in all different ways. And there's a difference where you can take a look at that and be like Okay, you know I wish I would have maybe. responded in a different way, but you didn't know anything else you didn't know what was happening now, you can reflect back where, then you can be able to take that into you know your next relationships are just all your relationships."
7466.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7466.0,Patient,I don't want more practice.
705.0,Provider,You will get there it's a process and you were with him for how long.
7466.0,Patient,i'm here.
705.0,Provider,"Five years there's a lot of crud in there for five years of what he was feeding you and you became where you doubt it yourself, and when we doubt ourselves. It comes out in all different ways, because you're not feeling good about who you are now you're taking that back and going wait a minute no I didn't deserve that. And now i'm going to continue to heal from it."
7466.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm and you've already started that process.
7466.0,Patient,"And I just kept going back and forth. I don't know, I think."
705.0,Provider,"that's to me that's being real. It sometimes gets to be too much and when that time comes, do just like you're doing you put it away. When you feel that you're having more of a day, where you can handle you know a little bit more, because your plate is full you're already taking on the extra responsibility at home with work. there's no time limit. If you feel like you want to right right and then put it away."
7466.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And right on there, this was my first experience. I tried my best. You are willing to go against your values and against your own feelings and to stuff those in order to appease him to be with him. And even that didn't work, so it shares with you. From an outsider looking in. He needed more work that he he's not he's not even thinking about hey I need to make some changes he's not even there."
7466.0,Patient,"No he used to tell me, this is what I am if you don't like it, and I would be like that that that doesn't show that you want to be with me, it says if i'm just here like it's like if you really wanted to be with someone that's not something you would say. I remember like one time in our relationship, I found out he downloaded tinder when we were together."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7466.0,Patient,"And I was looking at him and I was like, why did you have tinder when you were with me and then at first, he was like what I don't know what you're talking about blah blah blah and I mentioned, he was like Oh, we I remember, and I was like yeah and then he was like. I had 10 days, because me and my friends were doing this prank and you downloaded it as a girl to make fun or prank guys and I was like what are you five. And for me it was like really like it's it was hard for me to believe that that's what he even did, but I was like okay fine I believe you. But why didn't you tell me if that's the reason why you should I feel like tell your girlfriend that you're going to download a beating up. Like I feel like that's something I was like first you shouldn't second you should tell me third what are you fired for doing that, like that's so mature. And it was like okay fine What did you do what picture, did you use and then he told me oh I use a picture of my friend's girlfriend I was like did you tell her that you used her picture and he was like no. I was like you could have ruined their relationship, because what if someone saw the girl on tinder one day new she's in a relationship, you could have broken them up. A he was a gap, but it doesn't matter I was like that's selfish, for your own entertainment, you could have ruined someone's relationship and why did you even choose her picture. And he says, oh she's a type of girl that guys like to look at and I found that really disrespectful and I was like well, thank you because I. am not. And then I became really insecure and then he started saying see you have no sense of humor that's what i'm not telling you all your friends, no, you have no sense of humor you super sensitive and he started going off on me. And I remember I started crying I was in his house and I get a panic attack and then use like get the Fuck out of my house and it was I can't drive I can't breathe, it was like I don't care get out of my house. And I was like what like. you're the one who did something wrong. you're going off on me I cry and you're kicking me out like I don't understand how this works and I went home. And I was crying and then three days after he shows up to my house with a flower and then he apologizes and i'm so insecure at that point. And that that's the thing I hate it flowers, when I was with him, because everything something went wrong, he would kick me out you would break up with me, he would disappear for a whole week and then he would bring me a bouquet of roses. and eventually I started hating those roses."
705.0,Provider,"yeah Oh, and you also caught on to your being disrespected he has no boundaries, he didn't keep you safe you're saying you can't drive in this condition, but yet he just shut you out, I mean all these things is just like. yeah. Not okay."
7466.0,Patient,"Now I remember one time, I was struggling to breathe again and my muscles were all 10 stuff and I was in my room upstairs and he was with me he just gets up. leaves closes my door and leaves my house and I can't breathe, I need my inhaler I need something for me when I have an attack. And he already knew that I was like I need someone to hold my hand and tell me that something's going to be okay I don't want someone to tell me. Why can't you breathe just breathe just breathe, why are you not breathing because I was like I know I know that I can just read, but the problem is I can't. And I absolutely hate it when I can't breathe and someone tells me why don't you just read like brief. or slow down breathe what's wrong with you, why are you crying it's not a big deal it just makes me not bring even more. Because I start overthinking it i'm like oh my God they're right and I told him that was like just hold my hand just hug me. I was like just just be there with me, it helps me and instead he gets up leaves and he I I got angry, the next day, I was like thank you for doing that. The least you could have done, if you couldn't handle me is go downstairs and tell my sister or my mother that i'm struggling upstairs instead you close the doors, no one can even hear me struggle and you leave the House. And then he was like I don't know it was overwhelming I was like I understand that it's overwhelming, but if it overwhelms you, you were worried and welcome to leave with you go to tell someone that I need help. Because you knew that I need how many new it's hard and it's painful because my muscles were 10 stuff I needed water and you did an inhaler I need someone to be there."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7466.0,Patient,"So you were with me for three four years you know more than anything, I need an EU you must be."
705.0,Provider,And that's what you deserve as a partner is to have that unconditional love and that support and to feel safe when you're going through something like that.
7466.0,Patient,"He used to eventually start grabbing my head and throwing me around. When I couldn't breathe and then he would told me just shut up. As if I could control it, and what he grabbed my hand so hard that I got a bruise. And then the next day, my hand was bruised and he was like oh my God you're just faking it, I was like What do you mean that I put makeup on my head to like take a bruise what but what do you how, how can you make a bruise. Or did I go in a fistfight with someone that's why I got Bruce I was at home, you were the only one here."
705.0,Provider,And that's where it crosses the line because it goes from unhealthy relationship to abusive relationship where then emotionally mentally abusive and then it got physically abusive.
7466.0,Patient,"yeah but, according to him, it was Okay, because I was overwhelming him with my probe."
705.0,Provider,"And now that you can step back from that sheyda, what do you think about it."
7466.0,Patient,"I just think everything was messed up, but sometimes I blame myself because i'm like what if I caused it, what if. I didn't deserve effective or I don't know he used to tell me that so now, I know that I didn't but then, at the same time, I hear him say telling me things like i'm crazy or. If it wasn't because of you, or he would say I was never like this before I was with you and ever since i'm with you this is how I am but that's because of how you are. So now, I hear him his voice and i'm like yeah but maybe if I was better he wouldn't have done this way if it was with another girl he wouldn't have done this, maybe it's me. But then, at the same time, I know it's not right, but I just go through these emotions and I don't know how to control it, and the worst thing is the love that I still have for him that's The worst thing that I hate the Why do I still love."
705.0,Provider,"And that's part of abuse is this this whole cycle and part of the abuser is that they're really good at manipulating and making you feel like it is your fault. And that they wouldn't have to do this if only you said this, or I wouldn't have had to do this had you not done that, and guess what. There is no satisfying there is no meeting their expectations, it will always be something else. Because it's more about him and how he feels about himself and what he's projecting there's there's probably shade a whole lot of things that he's not willing to take a look at, but his behavior is abusive and his behavior, especially with you and your relationship. You got out of that cycle, even though you're still I mean this is trauma so from that trauma is you're still having to process and go through it and i'm glad that you're seeing that. Why am I still though you know because there's part of you that probably does still love him because that was your first relationship. And you had the love because. Maybe at first, he was charming and then he told you all those things that you needed to hear and you felt safe and secure. And that could have been along the way, that change. But you did have that so to me, it makes sense of why you would feel that way, and why this is confusing."
7466.0,Patient,"And another thing that confused me is that I still have like a small relationship with his mom because she was like my mother like again my mom was absent um and so she kind of replaced my mom and. For me, like one of the hardest parts of the breakup with me losing his mother as well, so I still I talked to her once a month on the phone. And I called her to see how she's doing because she also had a surgery and. She was telling me how she was like I don't know why you guys broke up. But like you deserve the world you, you are amazing you can find someone so much better than him and blah blah blah, and it was like but he's your son he shouldn't say that about like him. And then he's like yeah but you're like my daughter, and I know you can find someone so much better. And stuff like that, and she was like but I mean you never know you might get back to him and I was like I don't think so we have many differences. And then she was telling me how he always says that i'm the best person he's ever met in his life and that kind of confused me because I was like. Am I because when I was with him that's not what he was saying, so I was confused, I was like was mom lying, and he never said that, and she just said, telling me this did he say that and he also texted me a huge paragraph for my birthday. That also confused me."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that push pull push push away pull you back in push away pull you back in. yeah there's part of maybe when he have some like self awareness and he's he's willing to get real that there's probably some guilt there and that he feels guilty for some of the things that he said I don't know you know that for a fact, but in his behavior that would match up of why. He would try to reach out on your birthday and try to make things like be at peace for him."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah it was like a each paragraph of hearts and i'm telling me no one deserves the best more than I do, and that I have the strongest in the. I don't know, like the kindest person he's ever met, he was just saying that and, for me, I expected a happy birthday text but does a happy birthday would have done like I didn't expect a whole paragraph from him. saying these things, because that just confused me. Because the way he texted me is as if we were really close and we haven't spoken for a year, so it was just weird."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah. it's really.
7466.0,Patient,Oh sorry go ahead.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I was just going to say it's really hard when you don't you think you're almost getting you know a little bit of closure you're starting that chapter only when they throw the door back open and say you know, like you said a little text would have done now, you have a huge paragraph."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah and then the other day I was just on whatsapp, which is a texting APP and. I was just there and and I saw his name, because he recently texted me so His name was up there, and I saw him typing and it was like 1am. And I was like what the heck and I started freaking out so much I start crying just seeing him type because I was like what is he going to type what's going on what's going to happen, what am I gonna say. And he was typing and and he stopped and then you start typing again and he stopped and he never ended up saying anything. So all of these are just confusing me because i'm like what was he trying to say it's his mom being honest with me about what he saying to his mom about me. Is this hex he said just for him or does he actually feel guilty are also part of me wants him to feel guilty I don't know if it's messed up, but I want him to regret it at the same time."
705.0,Provider,To hurt like you hurt.
7466.0,Patient,"Basically I don't want him to be in the same pain that I was because I was horrible, but I want him to to be aware how messed up he was."
705.0,Provider,"No reaction yeah that's a you know, a reaction that comes up and some of the things that you're sharing like about the what's up APP and and his connection to his mom is, as you move along as starting to revisit some of these different things to see. Do you want to have this in your life, do you want to invite this in your life, such as on the whatsapp APP is is that someone that you want to keep in your contacts, or is this a reminder. And you're at the time in place where you're like you know what I don't want to invite this in my life anymore, then it could take a while you know, like I said there's no time limit on all this. But you may one day just be like you know what I don't know if the connection to his mom where we had that relationship, I still care about her. Is it too confusing where I wish not to have this or I just leave it, how it is right now."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean he was blocked for a whole year, I recently just unblock him because I thought that I don't care much anymore, and with his mom I mean we went from talking a few times a week to once a month, sometimes even less than that. And so I feel like I don't know I just feel like she did so much good for me that I can just not have her in my life, if you like, it's comforting knowing that she's in my life. And like this is the first time we ever he she ever brought him up. And I don't know why that was but. She wasn't like pushing me to go back with him because she kept saying you're going to find, so much so much better than him she kept saying that."
705.0,Provider,"Then, that in itself, then as maybe healing for you, where you're still inviting her in your life because you feel like that it is healthy. On that it is healing to hear that even. His mother is saying you'll find someone that you deserve you know, to have a good relationship a healthy relationship."
7466.0,Patient,"which was really weird like I normally would think your ex's mom would be on their side and be like like screw you you're not going to find someone so much better than my son, but I was like so like confused, I was like what like and I kept telling her, I was like he's. Like he's not that bad and then she's like I know, but like you're amazing and I was like yeah, but I have my share of mistakes do and and he was like yeah but those don't even count because you're so amazing."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that tells you a lot, though. yeah mm hmm."
7466.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"So if you take them that his own mother is sharing that you didn't deserve that those times that you feel like questioning yourself, and you have that doubt. It even as mom is telling you he didn't deserve that."
7466.0,Patient,"That was she don't know what's going on in our relationship. But at the same time, I feel like she knows how her son is."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7466.0,Patient,"Like not with me, obviously, because she wasn't in a relationship when we didn't really talk about our relationship with her. But I mean the way he treated her Sometimes I feel like she knows that he was very selfish. Like, for example, we would be in his room talking and his mom. was very lonely will come in and be like hey can I join you guys and he would just be like yell and be like get out of my room and I will always just look at him be like let her stay what's wrong with you. So he would have those moments."
705.0,Provider,He said that to his mother to get out.
7466.0,Patient,"yeah like oh my God just get out already. And I would just look at him and be like that's messed up Why are you doing this is your mother and he will be like apple she she's annoying and I was like. Have you have you met an annoying whether I was like have you met my mom I was like be. be thankful that you have a mom like this, my mom didn't even hear my mom doesn't even call me he doesn't care about me she was drawn she she attempted suicide. And didn't even care about me when she did it and she was cheating on my dad and she just didn't care, I was like what Why is she annoying because she's talking about her like Is that what you referred to as annoying."
705.0,Provider,"yeah It shows you a lot to sheyda that that's the way he treated his own mother and so boundaries are not something he has and when he can treat us his mom that way, it encourages him and all his relationships, he feels like that's okay."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah all right, he would she would make her him something he would be like oh my God I don't like this, and I would look at him and be like. then go make something you like yourself and the gap, but like i'm busy and blah blah blah, I was like dude my mom isn't even here to make me food, I wish, she would make me as something as like easy as bread and cheese basically. But your mom prepared this whole food and the least she expects rates for you to be hug her and say thank you. and I so many things annoy me. He would tell me you're just different and like yeah because I in my culture and it's funny because we're both versions, that we have the same culture, I was like but, in my mind. None of the things you're doing is OK, for example, one time in front of his friends, he randomly we brought a waterpark I don't know why he chose to say this, but out of nowhere, he says. shadows parents do not know how to raise your child and I just looked at him, and it was like are you saying i'm not well raised. Is that what you mean it was like no i'm just saying your parents don't know how to do that um so you disrespected my parents you disrespected your girlfriend in front of your friends for no reason, out of nowhere. And I was overreacting for my reaction when I got angry, obviously."
705.0,Provider,"So it's safe to say to you know shaded that, even though it hurts, and even though you're still in a lot of emotional pain is that this was not a person that was adding to this wasn't a person that was making your life life, you know filling your cup with joy and happiness."
7466.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know I think it's just part of me, the reason why I may be missing is because I miss. not miss I was gonna say I miss feeling loved but that wasn't the case with my relationship, but I miss. cuddles like the warm and some of the moments like the good times we had again because I don't have a mom and my family. my sister gets out a lot, but I don't my dad doesn't show that much affection to me and I brought it up and then he was like Oh, because you're grown up. And I was like yeah, but when I was a kid you never did that you weren't even there you were in Iran, I barely saw you like I would see you two months per year. and use a camp with your sister has it so much harder because her mom is in Iraq, I was like yeah that wasn't your concern when I was a kid though I was struggling with an alcoholic mom when I was 11 and you weren't even there. I was like yeah What about me, though, and he was like yeah just get over like and like that's the thing I don't get affection from people even from my sister I barely got it she's 11 but. All she does is bring me down she's just like oh my God you look so ugly today, and I know that's what teenagers do but deep down and hurts because I miss compliments I missed someone hugging me and if someone is pretending that they love me oh is me. keeping an eye on everyone it's always me protecting my sister. My mom attempted suicide I didn't even tell my dad about it because he wasn't me RON and. I didn't want to stress them out, I didn't tell my sister about it, and I remember oh my God it was such a horrible day. I literally was in a room with my boyfriend and I get knocks on the door and it's police officers and they're like Oh, we heard someone wants to. attempt suicide in this House and i'm like what know and I go to the room, and I see my mom is in there and then my Hydra code on pill, which is completely forward completely empty. And she was also drinking so her alcohol was completely empty and then she comes home very drunk alcohols very high they take her to the hospital, so I told my boyfriend to protect my sister because I don't want to see any of these so he takes my sister home to his house. And it's just me at the hospital by myself, seeing my mom just vomiting and everything and. i'm just crying there, I have a panic attack, but my boyfriend isn't there my dad isn't there, and my sister isn't there no one knows about it but me and my boyfriend and then. A social worker comes to me and says, we have to visit your home there's a possibility that we might have to take your sister away. And then i'm like i'm 18 and the legal legal I take care of her and I start even freaking out even more and then someone's like Oh, we have to. Take your mom to the mental hospital and I started freaking out even alone. And no one's there to protect me and i'm they're protecting everyone and protecting my sister from not seeing anything i'm protecting my dad for not getting stressed out about this, by not even informing him. i'm protecting my boyfriend and protecting everyone and protecting my own mom by visiting her feeding bringing her food and everything. Was. Protecting you. yeah and. The thing is, my gut tells me. Your sister has such a hard life because her mom isn't around i'm like he never said that about me, what about me. And I miss, something I just want someone to be there for me and I missed that feeling and I think the only time I had That was when I was with him, and that was only once a year, but. I don't know I just missed that feeling."
705.0,Provider,yeah I thought it's natural.
7466.0,Patient,I feel like i'm never going to find that.
705.0,Provider,"I can imagine sheyda that on some days you feel like that, and especially when your family and what you asked for that they don't seem to be able. To give you just like that hug and things like that, so I think it's natural that you would want to be in a relationship, and you know to be able to be held and feel secure and get those things that you never got as a child. That sense of insecurity, when you have a parent that's impaired. You didn't get that you know sense of security, because your mom couldn't provide that for you. And it sounds like in your dad a lot of times it wasn't there. To protect you and to have you be secure."
7466.0,Patient,"And he's a great dad like he he shows a lot of affection to my sister, but I wish he showed some to me."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7466.0,Patient,And what about him he does it in front of me and I get really jealous I admit I get jealous and and i'm if I tell him he's like you're 21 get over it.
705.0,Provider,"What would happen i'm wondering if you just said, I feel like a hug today can I get a hug today."
7466.0,Patient,I want him to want to hug hug me like I like go up to him and how many hugs me but.
705.0,Provider,"If you started, though the pattern. And you got your needs met at least for that connection with that and someone that you love and then helping him to to build on that, where I get what you're saying, where yeah I want him to to to want to love love and to come to me first. Is if you you're not comfortable sharing that with him is starting to be like you know what i'm going to get the hugs that I need. i've even had people that start off with self hugs and they'll say hold yourself for five minutes and I know at first it's like what the heck, but it is that sense of security that we need it's that feeling that we need of that embrace of that you know gesture."
7466.0,Patient,i'll try that.
705.0,Provider,You can try that but also to with your little sister you get think yes she's going through the teenage years but also. Having her like hey. I don't even want to talk about all that other stuff just give me a five second hug. This is. This is how we're changing in this House we're gonna we're gonna hug it out.
7466.0,Patient,i'll try that Thank you.
705.0,Provider,You might create a pattern where you're like I didn't think this would happen. Is when you ask for what you feel like you need. Like okay.
7466.0,Patient,"Now, the thing is they don't listen to what I need okay."
705.0,Provider,"Could this be a starting a spark you know, a starting spot to explore different things."
7466.0,Patient,i'll try and see how it goes.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and then let's talk about it again and see you know if there was no response, or if there may be was a response. Even, even if, at first, because this will be different behavior for you, even at first, if they're like what. Even if they give you a three second hug when."
7466.0,Patient,Then.
705.0,Provider,"you're getting it out there and it might not be everything that you're asking for and wanting. just yet, but you're building on that. and, more importantly, is loving yourself and having some self compassion and part of that is each day start writing a list of. You know, to build that self esteem backup of why you like yourself what are the qualities like that you can put you're strong you're responsible you're kind you have values. All of those things you have courage. Your creative."
7466.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Start writing that list because I call them ants we have automatic negative thoughts, not those other answer around right now, but we have automatic negative thoughts and the way then to counter those is automatic neutralizing thoughts. So if you can start where you go, you know all those messages you've heard life experience and it's more leaning on that irrational side to start to neutralize it where I am worthy of love. I deserve to one day have the relationship that I hope and dream about. Just for today. i'm going to do my best and i'm going to be okay with that."
7466.0,Patient,"I will try it out i've been telling myself that that's how I want to start Monday, but."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7466.0,Patient,I don't know I just can't.
705.0,Provider,"it's okay this takes practice and so now that you're aware of it. And sometimes you know, like I have different things around my house, it says seize the day or just for today and it reminds me bring it back to the day. It may be that you can write it on your phone, you can leave yourself a voice message I mean all these are different, because we all learn different. into get it where you feel comfortable that it's in your words just like I have different books that have affirmations and so sometimes I just turned point my finger. And you know mine landed on I sincerely appreciate the support I received from others so sometimes it gives me what I need. Every day, I appreciate my life, more than ever. there's if you Google it it's like rolls and rolls of affirmation that may speak to you on that day, that give you a little bit of a lift. we're not looking at like. You know this isn't like let's erase everything let's fix everything it's like. we're looking how to take your power back."
7466.0,Patient,"No, thank you for the advice I will definitely try doing that tomorrow. Maybe today."
705.0,Provider,"Just when you're thinking about it you're already spiraling and you're already thinking like Okay, maybe there's that glimmer of hope. feeling more empowered about it and it's like yeah not right, what happened not on any level. Not with your childhood, not with your relationship."
7466.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Part of it has made you who you are today and you're independent and you're strong and your willingness and your compassion all of those things.
7466.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I do think about that sometimes, but then again like i'm all over the place, so it keeps going back and forth i'm like yeah i'm positive I don't need anyone I. I love myself and then i'm like I hate myself, I just want to sleep and do nothing else, so it goes back and forth a lot."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and, and that is if we're being honest with ourselves. That is how it happens is that we catch ourselves and and that we do go back and forth, and we can be having a good day and then one thing comes along and we're like oh just for just for in my day. If you start to recognize, you can start and we're not saying every day has to be like 100% I have the happiness enjoy. learning to neutralize it where i'm not happy with what happened i'm not going to let it ruin my day but i'm going to take a moment to feel sad mourn the loss of whatever it may be. And then i'm going to manage and pick up what's next."
7466.0,Patient,I would definitely try that Thank you.
705.0,Provider,Cry were you able to schedule next session or do you want me to look.
7466.0,Patient,If you don't mind I didn't I didn't schedule it.
705.0,Provider,Okay let's then get my calendar open here let's see it's about to open.
7466.0,Patient,"I was also going to say i've been so freaking tired and I don't know why, for the past two weeks i've been sleeping the whole day and I it's not like I did anything but. Is there, like a reason behind it, you think like, for example, today, my friends are going out of town to Santa Barbara and as much as I want to go and honestly part of it is because I don't want to miss every time I don't go somewhere, I feel like i'm missing out. I don't know if it's right for me to just stay home and rest, or if the best thing to do is go out and not miss out because i'm like if I stay home i'm going to miss out i'm going to regret it, but if I go and let me still tired i'm not going to enjoy it."
705.0,Provider,"Right, and I would you know shade it if if you're feeling like maybe you are coming down with something if you have your primary care, I would even talk to your primary care to to rule out it's not physical. mentally to it can take a toll on you and you can feel exhausted if you're feeling depressed and sadness and things like that it can definitely exhaust you. Also too you're working you know you're working you're cleaning the House your responsibilities are like. Your plate is really full Could it be that you're exhausted from the week because you've been running at 180 and would it be more healing for you to take this weekend to rejuvenate and reset."
7466.0,Patient,"And do no I haven't been working for the past three weeks, but I am doing other things, but it's not like. That my whole day is full either it's just that I just want to sleep but that's the thing for me my personality is like, if I ever turned down something. i'm like what if it's so fun and i'm missing out by just doing nothing at home by myself, but I don't know which one is healthier for me. To go out with friends and have fun, maybe I don't know how what they're going to do, or just rest and have immediate I don't know which one i'm supposed to have today, especially. Like I can make the decision and ever since last night I couldn't sleep, because I was thinking about what should I do tomorrow, like should I go or, should I not."
705.0,Provider,What if you wait until tomorrow and see how you fill in the morning.
7466.0,Patient,"Well it's actually today and, like 30 minutes. Oh okay that's why I couldn't I couldn't sleep, the whole night yesterday because I couldn't decide I couldn't come up with a decision and hang out because I don't know what to do."
705.0,Provider,"Today, do you feel like that you have that much energy."
7466.0,Patient,"I don't that's the thing I just want to sleep, but I like what if they have fun and then I missed out on that that's my confusion right now i'm like what do I do."
705.0,Provider,Would there be another day that you could have fun like Is this the only only fun time that you may have because there's probably gonna be a lot of opportunities right.
7466.0,Patient,"Now it's just that they're like not every day they might go to Santa Barbara and I have this mentality, where i'm like what if I don't wake up tomorrow you never know what's gonna happen tomorrow."
705.0,Provider,well.
7466.0,Patient,it's so bad I can't do.
705.0,Provider,"It sounds like that you're leaning a little bit more towards going because let's say you go and you are tired, can you take a rest."
7466.0,Patient,No cuz we're just going to be in the card is nowhere for me to raise.
705.0,Provider,If you're in the car you can't take a little cat down.
7466.0,Patient,Or maybe yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah I think you weigh out the decisions your pros and the cons of it and then your gut feeling will tell you where you're leaning and could it be that may be an escape from everything to Santa Barbara is where you're leaning more towards doing that maybe show. You know.
7466.0,Patient,"thing is my friends are my friends, I don't know if that's the right word, but they do bring me down a lot to day it's like they find entertainment and bringing me down somehow like about what I eat about what I wear about what I do they always make fun of it."
705.0,Provider,"So put that on your list and. I want you to do if you can have pros and cons and you'll probably have to do it rather quickly and and just see see where you can get a really honest, is this a good way to evaluate it. And then on this end, you can let me know what you decide it and then i'm seeing on October 1, which is a Friday again at 9am would you like to meet them."
7466.0,Patient,yeah sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so Friday, the first at 9am let's meet again, you can fill me in on some of the things that we talked about, and I think this is a good tool today to tip the scale to see pros and cons of it and then you're going to make that decision."
7466.0,Patient,Oh yeah if it was that easy i'm really indecisive it's always like I want someone to make the decision for me it's. so hard.
705.0,Provider,"I have faith in you sheyda they. will do what's right for you, so no matter what your decision is it was your decision."
7466.0,Patient,yeah but as it's like sleeping in is not a right or wrong thing right.
705.0,Provider,"sleeping in sometimes is good it's what your body needs in order to reset and so, if that's what your body's telling you is maybe pay attention to it and be like you know what I just need a timeout I need to physically rest. And then, if it's not anything medical because if you're having doubts that may be something medical then go go get it checked out because you never know there might be a cold there might be something else going on."
7466.0,Patient,i'll do that Thank you so much for today.
705.0,Provider,Oh absolutely great to see you and i'll see you on the first at nine o'clock.
7466.0,Patient,"All right, thank you have a good day."
705.0,Provider,You too. bye bye bye.
