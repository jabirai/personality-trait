16847.0,Patient,"um I don't I don't want to drink alcohol anymore actually I. Ever since I started the medication have only had one drink and it was because I went out with my friends and everybody was drinking and they offer me to buy me one, and that was the only one, I had. No Tobacco either I just. I just don't like how they make me feel anymore when they were more like you know, like sometimes I will just like drink and have fun with my friends and stuff or I would definitely smoke cigarettes, when I had like when I was really stressed out or when I was going through like. When I was going with through the breakup I was definitely smoking, you know find myself wrongly on my work break, something that I would never in my life do. Not anymore I don't have cigarettes for myself, I don't smoke cigarettes and. yeah not even no, no, no, so nothing I haven't smoked since I started the medications and like I said drink was only one."

498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16847.0,Patient,"I haven't done it and, like i've worked I usually buy I buy like one or two snacks and I snack them throughout the day like chocolate and snacks and stuff. i'm not doing that anymore I just bring my bottle of water, I. eat before work I bring my bottle of water and I just go through my water to the day, instead of eating snacks which has been really positive for me, because no snacks mean no acne no breakouts know gaining way, which are also things that you know got me really preoccupied all my life."
498.0,Provider,Any thoughts about farming or though no.
16847.0,Patient,"No, they they have stopped to with the medication um yeah."
498.0,Provider,I mean.
16847.0,Patient,"i'm sleeping well um you prescribe me. I don't know the name so i'm sorry. Yes, dress i'm taking half a pill every night and. yeah i'm sleeping really good I usually don't not even wake up is I take it, and about an hour after I take it exactly like you said I get sleepy and really relax and then I just fall asleep, I do not wake up in the middle of the night unless i'm really have to use the bathroom. But other than that I do not wake up until I wake up in the morning and I wake up in a good mood it's been really it's crazy it's been really the change has been just insane. I forgot to take it one day. Because I thought I took it and I forgot it I caught it in half left it on my table and forgot that I took it that I didn't take it sorry. And that night I slept back, I was worried because I thought that I created a tolerance really fast, and I was like well, I guess, this is not working anymore. i'm gonna have to call the doctor because I really thought that I took it and I woke up a lot just the same thing that I was happening before it's like my body just doesn't allow itself like i'm asleep, and it brings me back in Burton it just doesn't, let me just fall into a deep sleep. i'm constantly kind of like half awake and. kind of like sleep paralysis like when you get sleep paralysis that you are kind of like not not asleep, but not awake. mm hmm That was one night, it was the only night that I stopped the medication and. Other than that i've been taking it i've been taking it every day in the morning and the other one at nighttime and it's only been improving so far, for me, I mean like. Little little things that I. Even my ability to communicate before I feel that I couldn't even communicate stuff without just burst into tears or or. or just laughing hysterically about it just not to cry hysterically about it. And i'm a little bit you know i'm able to communicate stuff better I don't know I just think that it's been really helpful for me yeah."
498.0,Provider,And how are you on medication supply right now.
16847.0,Patient,"Let me see I might have like 123456 I have seven left of the transit on. Okay, and like I see you I cut them in half, and the supply for the further lexapro. yeah I have 10 left you see 1-234-567-8910 1112 13 left."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and you see me on in group on Wednesday correct."
16847.0,Patient,yeah yeah is that weekly or monthly.
498.0,Provider,"it's let me check. One second I. apologize, I have to go on like a different system in order to. Okay, so it looks like your group attendance is monthly, but it should be twice a month."
16847.0,Patient,yoga.
498.0,Provider,Can you do group twice a month.
16847.0,Patient,I think so.
498.0,Provider,Okay okay um. And the only reason I would like you to attend group twice a month is because group allows you to see me without having a one to one appointment with me they.
16847.0,Patient,weren't the one.
498.0,Provider,"yeah So if you have to wait another four weeks to see me in an appointment like this and then you need me for something you'll know that okay i'll see her in a group appointment, you know, in a week or two talks. I just like for you to be able to check in with me more often. So you have seven tabs of the transit dawn left and you're breaking those in half, so you have. You have. 10 days left on the lexapro so when you see me in a guru. When you see me and, at the next group i'll go ahead and refill it okay. Okay. refill them both. Because. Since the transit on is working so great there's no reason for us to take it it's still a really low dosage and you're still at basically introductory dose of the lexapro and it's working exactly how I want it to work, improving your mood."
16847.0,Patient,"Everything that's been happening was exactly what you described me it was going to be. With the trouser don't like you said one time I didn't want I didn't go to bed right an hour after. And I did get like a like a dizzy and I got like nauseous but then I went to bed fall asleep immediately. But other than that. Like you said i'm asleep, by the time that happened, so I don't really feel anything about it, that was the only night that it happened. Every everything else, honestly, the change has been like. overwhelming not overwhelming because overwhelming sounds negative and it's been nothing but positive I feel like i've been you know, like written liner no electricity and everything I don't know, I was like really, really bad. Okay."
498.0,Provider,"i'll take that anything else, if you have any concerns with regard to your medications at this time we'll continue on what we're doing i'm going to make sure that you can come to group twice a month, so that I can. See you in between your appointments. And then that way you can make you can schedule an appointment on an appointment out for weeks from now, but plan to see me in group. Next week okay."
16847.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,Okay okay any other any other concerns.
