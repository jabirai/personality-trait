148.0,Provider,go there.
12944.0,Patient,"In my in my push myself I push myself through like to stretch. because every time I stretch it alleviates a little bit of pain, I did have a couple of meditation not that one was kind of deep in classic. about an. hour and 15 minutes. And one was a like a shallower what I was able 4443 minutes to to be. Like I don't know if you know, called the meditative State feels. Like it does it feels like you're completely aware of everything that is going on. Just the little the elevate it to like it comes with the little euphoria. So when I was morning pain, I will not, I will not settle my thoughts, because it was all the time. Taking me back to the thing, and I cannot override it now it's it's getting is getting a little bit better. yeah and running The thing is, I I couldn't say sit around the House anymore that was another thing because I I kind of feel that. I mean i'm not paranoid I I know the CDS and good. Human but, again, for two years, living with her. And initially initially I supposed to be with her only for like a couple of months, but then that. That when they offered me attempts to live in them last winter and she said no, so now she's going to some other truck you know things because the restaurant. The business is not that great your son. I mean. The the pot is legal, but she doesn't understand, like the one you want, and all and she's very good mom she has talks with him all the time with me every every. Like family that he finds around the House, he spends on on thought so I don't feel comfortable talking in like around the House because I get I know the Chiefs War II that you know child protective services or whatever, and the thing is that right now. magnuson dad works at the restaurant tool, so I don't think that I mean I know the good both you know the manual see smoking and really key fields much older than you know, and I tried to gather thought. Helen is a 16 almost is almost she. Is the worst stage, right now, because you can only be their friend, you can really push them through the foreigner I just I can't experience, I had a very bad experience with my son, who truly God, you know. have put him back from the right bed, but he was on last boy, and now I can you know I am just thank God devotees of day. is wonderful guy. Wonderful father."
148.0,Provider,Good. yeah that's great.
12944.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I, hopefully in a couple of months. I supposed to have this, I have the case pending still. Just deciding. Like what. How much I am disabled and I tell them just helped me get through them, the thing I don't mind driving. I don't mind driving really because I love that's why you know I decided to drive trucks it's a long haul and sometimes that will not come on you know get a gin down from the truck, for you know, three or four ones, because I like to drive. And i'm really good really responsible driver that's why I could not, I cannot dress and I was just still ability on the road. yeah because when you're tired. And you're constantly tired and constantly in pain and your head is falling and I do want to take any medication because that's old so you know what if something happens because every medication tells you to look up great evolutionary if you're on it. Right so. suboxone also i'm i'm kinda I because he kind of operates in the four hours for me three to four hours so. Now, it should mostly think it is 12 so I had I had time and I don't feel fuzzy so I was thinking to go get water and the bananas, who go home take another one as well. And then I rest and then in the evening around six o'clock I picked another one, and then I go for a walk and I come back as a shower exercises again, and then I take I take one at 12 midnight and then i'm done. For the day that that so my my daily work, I don't have any. social life arose. From kind of hiding because i'm throwing their account against like I have to walk with the brace with the brace on and i'm walking with a Walker. well."

Because seeing the work so wash and then she cannot do anything I can do anything because I I sweep the floor sweep and MOP the floor, like in the kitchen and after that three days i'm article mission I can't get up because I think that repetition gets like inflammation going. Not in my muscles."
148.0,Provider,"Too much right if we're moving. we're sitting for too long, it could really have the same effect stoked about finding. A balance."
12944.0,Patient,"yeah yeah sometimes I yeah I mean the thing is like after 10 minutes of shooting or you have to lay down for a while. And I know. Because, sometimes I have to lift my my feet up. and wait and feel because right now I devil, like the burning sensation in my toes in life, like the soul my feet that you know drives me crazy, but I know that there's nothing else that I can do.
