383.0,Provider,"you're getting. Better you seem like you are, but you tell me."
10747.0,Patient,"is little bit better we could go a week and a half ago, but. For a week has been just hard. So they can do, but. In terms of. behavior thing is just. sure. I mean. With medication I don't feel like doing anything and stuff without medication I just. hated to annoy to confuse. Other stuff so i'm not sure how can I say. Which direction is better than the other."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh. well. When you're taking the medication, do you feel Do you still feel somewhat annoyed and irritated and confused, even with the medication."
10747.0,Patient,"No actually. About. It have. You know, God What helps it's not that it doesn't help but. Just too tired and. Do. sort of. Have drowsy manson stuff so. we're kind of like. don't respond to stuff pretty much. So that kind of help from that side I get I get irritated but I don't sort of react to it that quiet. Okay, so."
383.0,Provider,Would you consider. Reducing your medication and trying to deal with your irritability just. By you know doing some of the things that we've talked about like deep breathing and kind of positive thinking and trying to. Work on your you know inner. skills.
10747.0,Patient,"Mina I tried to do it, but, for you know, two weeks I have not have before that I tried and did not side, I tried not to do it because I, it seems like it my irritability turns into anger and kind of like gets mad that mad so quickly. I I. become. sort of aggressive, so I just try not to."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I."
10747.0,Patient,"can't handle I can't handle you know anything, causing irritation like nor is so many even like thinking i'm not. i'm. not able to sort of control it."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. I just i'm wondering if. Do you feel like you. could improve, in your capacity to control your irritability like that's something that you could. get better at or do you feel like it's not really possible to get better I."
10747.0,Patient,"know I think i've tried it, otherwise I mean I feel like i'm drugged up, and you know. And when you asked me what I do, I mean this I can do anything because i'm drugged up. And when I tried to not do it, then the other part, is. My mental condition gets bad really bad. I have to. You know struggle to keep myself under control, but which does not happen, because of the thinking going on, you know irritation, and all that stuff."
383.0,Provider,"Right right well do you want to talk about this as as like what can you do, and in terms of. Do you feel like this is a problem you want to tackle or or or not, because. What, what do you feel like you want to tackle in terms of your mental health."
10747.0,Patient,"related night. I. not sure. What to. do about it, I mean, of course I don't want. go on like that. In order to. At the same time, the physical condition. is extremely challenging."
383.0,Provider,and
10747.0,Patient,"I am not. Doing I am just kind of like. First, starting to. hate myself hate what. Are on here. i'm not taking medication because. i'm not lovable much. Right right yeah."
383.0,Provider,"well. i'm sorry about my dog and. The fact that you are recognizing these patterns, is a good thing I don't think you were in a state of really recognizing her so much. For for, or at least you weren't talking about it see now you're talking about this you're talking about her these are tendencies towards anger these tendencies are it's having a difficulty managing. or irritability and these feelings of the self hatred you're talking about it, which you have not done prior, so I think this is very this is good progress. And you can continue with the medications as is because you're finding them helpful and you can also start to. Practice some ways to calm yourself down when you notice that you're becoming irritable because essentially you know our our irritability. Our anger is our responsibility to manage you know it's not other people's responsibility to be quiet, so that so that it doesn't bother us, you know it's our responsibility to manage our own responses. So, once you start to kind of. Take some tools and use them to try to manage your own mood you know you're heading in the right direction, but the first part of what you're doing now, which is just saying out loud. I have irritability I have anger, I feel some self hatred, this is really a great step. Because you are acknowledging that this is. This is what's. going on for you. So. You know, we do the mindfulness and the group's. I do, that teach you guys. That there's ways of pausing to and call to calm your nervous system down or at least taking a step back you know the STOP skill pause. take a step back. do some self observation do some form of mindfulness. And then step forward into your life according to how you want to respond. You know if you don't want to respond in an. angry irritable way. You can make that choice. Now I know that your situation you know is very. You know it's it's upsetting to you. that's another piece of like how are you going to self sooth. With the stressors of you know your physical limitations and your pain and so forth. But how does that sound to you what my what i've been what I just said."
10747.0,Patient,"i'm. not sure. respond. Because. i'm and i'm I I try, but then I give up because I don't when I don't see any in changing. When i'm not sure how long Should I be trying. You know. Should I how long I should be able to control. myself."
383.0,Provider,"well. What you just said about you try, but then you give up. The part of you that's trying is the part you want to support you know, and you, you want to celebrate you are trying. That is good it's like you're exercising a muscle and you're trying, you know, to respond, maybe more calmly or to not you know to manage your emotions so, but the giving up part is what we want to work on, because. You know, when we give up, we just. that's that's sort of giving into the hopelessness, of the situation, rather than the fact that you can do this. And that you will do this you're going to get out of this, this is not going to be your life, you know. For forever is this just a period and you're going to get out of this and and determining that to yourself and reminding yourself, you know, this is, I will get out of this predicament, you know. i'm going to try my my darndest you know every every day, every every hour. And, and to not go into that giving up mode."
10747.0,Patient,"When you say i'm at least trying to. You know, look back and say Oh, you know nothing happened for five hours, I was okay. And then things started to go downhill, then I realized What was it me not able to react was me not do it, or was it my medication patrol."
383.0,Provider,"You know at this point I wouldn't. I wouldn't worry too much or I wouldn't get too. wrapped up in that question is it's the medication, or is this me, you know. It just is what it is you're taking medication to support you, as you build some behavioral. Skills some ability to manage your emotions along the way, and if you had five good hours I wouldn't discredit yourself and say oh that must have been maybe just due to the medication and not due to my efforts. I don't know if you're doing that, but perhaps you are, and if. I would just take your medication as prescribed and then just set to setting goals for yourself like you know i'm going this morning i'm going to. Practice some mindfulness and I am going to notice when i'm getting irritable and i'm going to encourage myself to relax and take it easy and. and not be reactive not go into that irritability and anger and going to appreciate what I have you know different different approaches. But I wouldn't like I said I wouldn't discredit don't discredit your efforts, vice trying to evaluate was that the medication or was that me trying to do better just. it's all working toward the same aim, you know. You look better ronnie you you're you look more clear I don't know how to describe you know you look healthier and you look more. focused and. The something different, I don't know quite what it is, but you do seem like you, are better. Now I that's just my observation. But you're reporting that you're some better some of the time. From from what you've told me."
10747.0,Patient,"Because. not sure I mean. And as you, you know you have said, you haven't told me before, not to analyze you know right I don't analyze my but at the same time. i'm taking this medication i'm taking that medication i'm under the influence of medication, the whole time. When I am not under the influence of the megaphone a modified I charge a fee table, even though somebody is not there, somebody wants a there's no sound I but I, my physical situation just I you know sort of move. On you know, on the bed or something even if I don't move, I still get no, you know. pain and that kind of remind me back my situation that brings the whole picture back and I tried to get out about this, it becomes hard to. ignore it and. Then you know, think of this. As a temporary thing. But then again my I try to figure out what is temporary i've been already. In the situation. And the situation has gotten worse in forward is almost I don't know. I know most two to. two and two over two years."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
10747.0,Patient,But you know.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and if you're getting better slowly, that means you're getting better whether it takes two years or two and a half years. The progress is still may be slow, but it still steady it's still there still present progress is present, so that is where you know that is good. You know, progress is present its you are moving forward just it can be small steps it's fine that it's small steps. Right and maybe sometimes we need it to be small steps. And that's okay. I wanted to ask you did you find another primary care doctor. Well, I. Thought something you're going to work on as finding another primary care doctor to."
10747.0,Patient,"yeah i've called the office from the previous one, and I know try to message I haven't heard anything."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well then you can call your insurance provider and just tell them look my my doctor passed away they're not responding to my phone calls, can you give me a list of you know of. Doctors that are taking new patients."
10747.0,Patient,yeah like probably will call them again and then after that call.
383.0,Provider,Okay. um have you been able to get outside and get some fresh air and sunshine from time to time.
10747.0,Patient,"downstairs. But then it was cloudy so try to go for 15 1015 minutes, and this. came upstairs. Because it seems I get. I get my anxiety kicks in my heart starts beating fast and stuff sort of. Going outside. i'm not sure if it's from plans to what is it. I feel. very anxious and I don't want to go. Medicated because it makes me drowsy and stuff and I. already have it shook managing balance. So I mean. That was the only thing."
383.0,Provider,"Well, do you think that. That anxiety is is so bad that you can to get outside."
10747.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's it's just I feel like. I feel like I need to take my medication of something, but then again try not to go and overdo what is prescribed. Because. I get a lot of you knows the most prone and stuff we get a lot of sort of tingling and sensation and stuff like that. My. site sort of arms and stuff. I tried to go at the point where you know I didn't feel. That drowsy or you know I feel like I can might be able to you know, control and. Go downstairs. it's just. New. If you go outside and you know you know I run into a neighbor and then a person neighbor is going to ask how are you feeling how's things going so one thing is to try to get out of the situation and then kind of like remind people remind you of that I have i'm in this situation."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I still think it's a really good thing for you to get fresh air. If you can open the window and get some sunshine and."
10747.0,Patient,"I do, I mean I you know before, where I was situated right under my AC unit there's a will there's a window that census Chilean stuff so kind of relocated by the wall. So I do have window. That I see through outside and I get air coming in. I mean it does feel better in that situation, but. Again I just don't know how to. Define better I mean in a situation, because I am medicated I am not responding to things. I."
383.0,Provider,"You know, all you can do is the best you can do, and I think you're you're trying to do that. ronnie I think you're trying to do your best, and I see some improvement that's that's what I can tell you from my end but you know of course you're the one living your life, so I want you to feel better you know I want you to feel that improvement. So I wanted to ask you um. I think that we had, I think there was you had a complaint. So there's a satisfaction survey that we need to go over with you. So i'd like to take a minute to address that. I think that. You are said you would like to. you're having some difficulty understanding your conditions and you. You just this was a complaint that you submitted back and and August."
10747.0,Patient,thought we talked about it and I. kind of it was from both. From. i'm not sure what they told you.
383.0,Provider,Are you still having these complaints or do you still feel kind of like there's something that we could do better with bright heart health.
10747.0,Patient,"One I don't have any from playing the other than you know the the i'm not sure those surveys once a month is fine i'm not sure how a week what the situation would change. How much you can so once a month surveys or find those surveys on weekly basis is just extremely stressful and I kinda. I have an alarm set up and I have tried to do it, one I set up alarm on Thursday morning, so I can do it, but then. I figured out I kind of procrastinate I am not able to do it, so I set up another alarm on Wednesday that did not work, I said no, another alarm on Tuesday and i'm still not able to do because it becomes it's a it's it says, like a stressful activity and then."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
10747.0,Patient,"Because then you're asking what's wrong with you and i'm trying to look at myself but no, this is wrong with me. This is wrong with me i'm gathering all the the laundry list and then eventually it stinks. You know, pretty much, then I feel like Oh, I have so many things wrong with."
383.0,Provider,You okay.
10747.0,Patient,So I think that as as. You can say patient as a as a client is just. It brings. It refreshes the memory it kind of stresses out things.
383.0,Provider,"that's that's really good feedback ronnie i'm going to submit this. I want you to see that I feel that there's progress being made and you're with you. I feel you're much more attuned to some of the things you're working on than you were when you first came you're much more clear about. Some of the the behavioral problems that you're struggling with and you're talking about them more freely and more openly and that's very, very good, so I just want to reinforce that so you don't feel like Oh, I have all this laundry list of problems."
10747.0,Patient,"Well, one of the situation that I know Doug would as being."
383.0,Provider,"Okay well. Thank you for oh. Let me just. finish up here just noting some of the things that you said. All right, well i'm. So let's see here. let's go ahead and look at your schedule that sound like a plan. Okay. So I think that you're scheduled to. i'm going to take a day some time off in November. So I think that day one of those days. you're scheduled to be seen. me see here yeah on the eighth so."
10747.0,Patient,If you want Rican job that i'm not sure if it's a. Regular gonna have only one meeting a month is that what it is.
383.0,Provider,"um, no, no, I mean, I want to see you twice a month. you're scheduled for the eighth and the 22nd. So I could see you on. The 15th on the 29th. But I wouldn't see you individually until the 15th, which is in would be in like three weeks as that you feel like that's kind of a long time."
10747.0,Patient,No.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so the 15th and then the 29th then at 11. November 15 and 29."
10747.0,Patient,"Okay, I have to take a look at my calendar with our market so next thing is 15 so. And then two weeks after that. Okay, so we continue the pattern of two weeks from 15."
383.0,Provider,"yeah at 11am. yeah so let's just say let's, what do you think would be a good goal for you to. to work on in the next since until I see you next."
10747.0,Patient,Week try to control my feelings. not sure how you want me to experiment that.
383.0,Provider,"So I was talking about the STOP skill, which is. to pause and just take some breaths and kind of withdraw from the situation and take a few cup a couple of deep breaths and then and also make a positive statement like. i'm calming down and i'm taking a moment to just take to call myself in this moment and then i'll respond when i'm a little bit calmer. and take those deep breaths do you think that's something that you could work on. And and try not to criticize yourself and analyze Is this the medication, or is this me or you know just take the medicine and and then work on your reactive and your irritability. Are you having any thoughts of self harm ronnie do you feel like you want to end your life or anything like that."
10747.0,Patient,say it again sorry.
383.0,Provider,I have any suicidal thoughts.
10747.0,Patient,"and think i'm trying to. recover i'm trying to recover, but then i'm. I. mean. I want to get better. But then I mean. i'm not i'm not trying to make my situation worse. So I guess with that. yeah."
383.0,Provider,And when that when that voice POPs in for you to give up that's when you want to say no i'm not giving up.
10747.0,Patient,"And what is sorry, what do you mean. When we're gearing up for."
383.0,Provider,"There are times when you describe to me that there are times when you feel like you just you give up when when it's hard for you to control your emotions you just kind of give up. You mentioned that. So that's when you want to just. Tell yourself on your end that you're not giving up. You think you can do that. Okay. Okay, so the appointments for November are the 15th and the 29th at 11. Okay. Okay ronnie well i'm you take care and i'll See you in group okay."
