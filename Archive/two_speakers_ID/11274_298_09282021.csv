I have a very flexible job like we are flexible so. In the future we will be less flexible, so if there was a time now would be."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
11274.0,Patient,"or soon would be it anyway. yeah I had a really hard. weekend emotionally I, we had a yelling match and Ikea."

298.0,Provider,The high.
11274.0,Patient,know it was like full on terrible behavior in Ikea.
298.0,Provider,Just can't see you doing that.
11274.0,Patient,"pain Okay, so you know what hold on i'll show you. So I have this skin condition, where you can go out in the sun right. uh huh to go outside. I have to put on. To. Double glove on each hand right. wow which. And I think I realized what the problem was not with the sun, but with my behavior Okay, so he and I are we got a reply from our House. And we're finally getting the bathroom fixed it's it's fantastic right we're using three five for all the responsible things. We had to go out and we went. We have to buy a tub, we have to buy. tile, we have to buy an F so everything right."
298.0,Provider,Right.
11274.0,Patient,"it's a lot and we went to this place. it's a big sunshiny warehouse, and so the whole time I had to wear two gloves. On each hand. where's my face."
298.0,Provider,wow.
11274.0,Patient,"Okay. Now highs. And the lows and this, but this leaves my eyes exposed."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
11274.0,Patient,So I have to wear this.
298.0,Provider,Right so.
11274.0,Patient,"Cover my eyes and I still get swelling and a reaction, but just here. And so I spent. Three hours. ish in this, which is excruciating it's like it pushes on my ears."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
11274.0,Patient,So I can't feel. I can hardly hear. I can't use it's like the only thing I have is my only somewhat unexciting unobstructed sense.
298.0,Provider,This is my.
11274.0,Patient,"But I end up getting really intense. claustrophobia it feels like. Like I didn't know claustrophobia felt like I think until. I felt the stress and I thought this pressure and I felt the stress and then I felt was pressure, and then we left from that place which means. Sun exposure to the car which is pain driving in the car which is sun exposure, which is paying to the next place out of the car more sun exposure pain and then into Ikea. Because we needed to look at a couple more things right. So I. had been stewing in my own face moisture for hours. It gets really sweaty here on the mask. which a lot of people deal with, but they don't really deal with it smashed on to their face like you know."
298.0,Provider,Right right.
11274.0,Patient,All I wanted was a cold drink because i've been really frickin hot for a really long time and even when I have a water bottle. I mean drinking with this thing on.
298.0,Provider,It.
11274.0,Patient,"So I was, I was hurting oh also. I had the first half of getting a bridge done two weeks ago. haha so I had exposed nerves and everything under a temporary. So I had constant. dull and sharp job pain for two weeks. And being in that. And I couldn't take it anymore. And so we. My partner, has also been on great. In the he's dealing with a lot of anger and grief over a family situation and it's. toward and so he what he does is he goes into a cocoon and himself and I start feeling real. lonely. yeah and then um so yeah we were going to go up to Ikea to the thing to get a drink and then I thought there were fountain drinks upstairs and then. He didn't want to wait in the line. And he wanted to go sit at a table and I, and I told him I said, all I want to do is get this gear off my head and then we can talk. He says, I didn't say that."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
11274.0,Patient,"Lately that's happening a lot I don't think he's trying to gaslight me so just not how he is but it feels gas lady and I can't tell if the thought that I think really loud comes out of my face. uh huh you know and. Anyway, I felt like he was stopping me from getting unencumbered. Because going from all of that to just a regular facemask is. Over huge relief, you know. trying to pull this stuff off of me doing the slowest we're district he's accused ever seen. And i'm like. just trying to take it off and get a drink and he was just trying to ask me this thing and it turned into this full fight, I mean it was very short. But it was not great, and so it was. The pain, with the sun pain, with the tooth pain, with the ptsd with. Like I just couldn't cope, and I feel like I am becoming more aware of like. weird sensory issues. haha like i'm. Like if we're watching a show, and he tries to talk to me it's like I gotta pause the show because I can't hear and process and respond when the tv's on. You know or music it's like I become very like it's an auditory overwhelm."
298.0,Provider,tunnel in a tunnel process yeah an auditory processing problem.
11274.0,Patient,This something is really bad for a mental health.
298.0,Provider,"Tell me again why you have this, what is it what medication is. Doing."
11274.0,Patient,A dermatologist is because i'm fat.
298.0,Provider,i'm fat.
11274.0,Patient,"Are you 241 pounds fat. No, well then you're hardly trying or."
298.0,Provider,I don't know but i'm 200 that so it's not that far off.
11274.0,Patient,Amateur. i'm kidding.
298.0,Provider,"I hope it's cute. But really that's not a reason, what is the reason."
11274.0,Patient,I don't know.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
11274.0,Patient,They say it could be hormonal shift. They say it could be an autoimmune condition. But. I need to try to figure it out.
298.0,Provider,Are you getting the vaccine.
11274.0,Patient,Am I getting it. I have hopefully.
298.0,Provider,"So be really careful if you have an auto immune disease with that, like they're saying things."
11274.0,Patient,"I don't know if I have one, nobody will diagnose me, nobody will test me I don't know how to do that stuff. Like yesterday I was at the dentist getting the bridge finished and oh my God my life is instantly better. swelling is finally come down it's it's only like at a five pain, but after two weeks of eight and higher."
298.0,Provider,she'll take it.
11274.0,Patient,"lowers better. um it started June June 20 last year. The something June 19 I was with friends outside all day swimming and stuff I mean I had my normal strawberry blonde white person sun issues but not vampire. And so, and then it was fine, I was in the shade, most of the day it was cool and then the next day. I mean, I was the day before it was like every other day of my life, the next day, I took the dog to the dog park and within a few minutes, I was, I was wearing a tank top of shorts. And within a couple minutes like I was feeling a stinging poking. Burning all over my body wherever it was exposed and I was like what's going on, and then I was like no just kidding targeting was like just somebody was turning up the volume until it was like in, and I was like oh my God what the hell is happening my body. I had no idea and, though I went I went home, and I was in a lot of pain and I took a benadryl which helped a little bit. But. I went out the next day, thinking that was a weird fluke happened again. I went out the next day for like two minutes and it happened. I went up the next day and I stuck one finger out in the sun and it happened."
298.0,Provider,wow.
11274.0,Patient,So i've been experimenting on myself.
298.0,Provider,uh huh. Do you fit the criteria for any autoimmune disease Steve this have you found anything that.
11274.0,Patient,"No, because I don't want to do my own medical research, about a doctor. Because people say doctor say my medical degree is better than you're googling I make great, then I won't diagnose."
298.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm wondering if. i'm i'm really sorry to say this i'm wondering if you could do better than me like if you could get a person who could you know do better. Sorry i'm thinking that if there's something deeper going on, I don't know what it is."
11274.0,Patient,deeper in what way.
298.0,Provider,i'm.
11274.0,Patient,Like physiologically.
298.0,Provider,"yeah. So there was this thing. So there was this patient. That when I was in school, I was. shadowing a psychiatrist and she came in and said she was having 30 seizures a day and i'm sitting there going what how are you Stephen you know i'm just totally."
11274.0,Patient,i'm shocked at this time.
298.0,Provider,"and She had been to emergency room after emergency room and none of her seizures were rating on whatever machines she didn't. They weren't showing up. As I explained this she was having seizures but they weren't neurological seizures like there was nothing changing fizzle physiologically, but if you looked at her you thought you she was having a seizure and. She had collateral her mother came in said yep she's having them and we're just I was blown away and the doctor said this happens to some people and. I was like how am I ever going to be able to diagnose what's real what's not real when stuff like that happens, so I guess what i'm trying to say is maybe a psychiatrist would have better insight than I do."
11274.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,just throwing that out.
11274.0,Patient,Do you have any on staff.
298.0,Provider,"No. Not that. I can get access to I would have to refer you to. You know, as somebody who could do heavier stuff. heavier diagnosis says. Oh kind of thing."
11274.0,Patient,i'll do anything.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. I am. Anyway, um let's talk. About not changing your meds until we get like a second opinion of what's going on."
11274.0,Patient,That reasonable.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
11274.0,Patient,We don't want to start moving parts around if.
298.0,Provider,"If if we could use a second opinion that were that I just something I don't know and then whatever that opinion is it then. yeah. Okay, so that's what i'm going to start working on from my end is getting you into a psychiatrist for a referral and look at i'm not just charging you, I just want you to go there and get evaluation and see if we can get some more insight."
11274.0,Patient,"Do you know how because yesterday, when I was at the dentist. um so my brother has been diagnosed with this messed up degenerative job bone disease. which has rendered like half of his. teeth in viable."
298.0,Provider,Really.
11274.0,Patient,there's not enough jobs to support them.
298.0,Provider,hmm okay.
11274.0,Patient,And it's it's like a horror movie right.
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
11274.0,Patient,"I was like well how do I. i'm okay well i'm at the dentist and she's digging around down there i'm like how do I know if i'm at risk for this my brother, has it because oh we'll just get a genetic test like that's the easiest thing in the world, how do you do that, like, I have, like several different conditions. That are genetic I have people in my family who have multiple genetic weird anomalous conditions. And I don't know how to."
298.0,Provider,"Get the test to even start the process to find out. Right, and so you know i'll put in a request to see if you can see a geneticist and I don't know what we can do to help you but i'll start to pull some information."
11274.0,Patient,"That would be enough because there's that talking to my mom had or not she's probably still alive, but my mom has a condition called castle. which you know, has all this cloudy liquid around your brain."
298.0,Provider,Like oh great.
11274.0,Patient,And all kinds of. crazy symptoms and i'm.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
11274.0,Patient,Great for my mental health to know if i'm a ticking physical time bomb.
298.0,Provider,right and it might give insight to something else.
11274.0,Patient,"And, especially since i'm applying for law schools it's like if my brains only got 10 good years. i'd like to have that data, before I make this commitment."
298.0,Provider,Right so true. Okay. Somebody will get back in touch with you on referrals that i'm going to start asking for.
11274.0,Patient,Thank you so yeah I. don't know if you can see. I failed and i'm no completely bald. On my lashes I don't know if you can tell.
298.0,Provider,"yeah, I can tell they're gone."
11274.0,Patient,"I lost the battle. So i'm in the second phase of the cycle, which is. Pulling for baldness every time they get any kind of stumble in there. I usually have two rounds of that before I grow in fall until it starts again, which is usually about a year and a half to two years."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness. And i've been doing that, since I was seven. wow i'm so sorry I just that just it sounds horrible to have to have so many months of having to go through phases like that."
11274.0,Patient,yeah it sucks.
298.0,Provider,I just.
11274.0,Patient,"My dad used to make me collect all the eyelashes that I pulled out, it in an envelope, so that he could beat me every night to punish me for doing it so it's like it's like a medical condition that has like a crap load of trauma around it."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah. well. Alright susie um it's good to see you let's keep in touch and i'll work on my end what I can do for you.
11274.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,All right. Thank you.
