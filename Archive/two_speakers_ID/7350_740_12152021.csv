So i'm I go to that. But I did actually have a phone number for somebody that's a potential sponsor and just procrastinating."
740.0,Provider,"yoga extra bye baby, you have a phone thing."
7350.0,Patient,yeah so I need to call her I just I keep putting it off putting it off.
740.0,Provider,"So i'm going to say a little bit about me right that you know i've specialized in substance abuse in an acknowledgement for almost seven years, seven years and everywhere that's all I know. All I know so from abuse All I know is drugs and alcohol this all my fault is being asked started out with Juba now that fairies and then I went to adult from adult impatient residential treatment to adult drug courts to felony probation are they kind of stuff so. that's all I know, right, and so the thing about it is the you need a phone. yeah so. By the next time we meet. I need you to be talking to you."
7350.0,Patient,i'll try to call her and I.
740.0,Provider,Know don't try. Okay that's all.
7350.0,Patient,My dear to.
740.0,Provider,"So. You need a sponsor because you need somebody to hold you accountable you can't do it by yourself, you tried so many times and you failed you keep hitting the flow of me that's why you should get tired of having a book that knows. You get above the value that means you need somebody to hold you accountable as part of their because manager you can't see me out of time, you can see me everyday. Things like that I can't go to work I can't go to the best wishes, but it's also do much better than I can, and so the thing about it is, is that you have to talk to your sponsor so from what i'm hearing you have one."
7350.0,Patient,"yeah well, I have a phone number of a woman, that I want to be my sponsor i'm. hoping it was about a week ago she was in. want me to call her I haven't called her the more time that goes by, the more i'm like embarrassing I called her. And I really, really liked her and I don't know how do you think I should approach it in a week or mine I haven't followed through."
740.0,Provider,"So this is how it goes, so how it goes with you. Okay, so how it goes is this right. You have to make the decision that you actually want this. There is no sponsor that's going to waste their time with somebody who don't really want sobriety. That just p. Is your decision right and it's one of those things, and then you have to sign it, and then, when she finally gets to the point to where you actually do want to program and so you actually do want the variety you i'm saying thank you both for her, and you can find her like a grown woman. And you say hey I apologize, I know I should have called you a while ago, you know, however, I was reluctant because I wasn't really sure if I really wanted this tonight you gotta be honest, if the honors Program. doesn't make sense if the Program. Is Eve what it is because trust and believe in my mind there's no sponsor is going to sit there and try to force feed somebody who don't want to eat yeah. Social decision I would encourage you, that you need to get a small, because your longest period of providers on a four month that's only 120 days. Yes, that's not enough. I mean that's only for astronomy and stuff right, I mean that's not enough yeah so you haven't had enough clean time to do by yourself. So you need a phone and so you need to calculate if you have the latest numbers, but she but, but let me say this i'm not gonna say what you need to do, I would encourage you to do it, but you have to make a decision on your own if you want to. measure decision because the reason why you haven't caught that lady is."
7350.0,Patient,A reason why the colors because I want to ask her do my sponsor and I have a lot apprehensions about I feel like i'm a pain pain and nuisance and I just. I need to pass my pride and notice main thing.
740.0,Provider,"I want to say, but that's the whole point of sponsorship and they I mean it's yeah it's Okay, but you're paying in a nuisance, because that means you realize that you need somebody. So basically you're giving yourself every reason not to have a fossil. Right, there was no I. I mean that's the thing I mean anybody to say early recovery, the pain and a nuisance How long have you been clean or have you been drinking. Okay, to do congratulations I think that's amazing. So anybody that's the early recovery, the pain and and and you know, the only one. But it's just the bad it's about how badly you on. The challenge is the goal is to be able to reach further than you've ever reached before, and the first is that you've reached us on for months. yeah so The goal is longevity. In order for that to happen, you need a song. You know, even for Nokia city everybody meet somebody sometimes. There, so if you want the body, if you want to be clean. You can do by yourself. Well, let me get back to this. So. um Have you had any other treatment beside us, I know you know, right now, you present with the with the same thing you reside in a rehabilitation just steadily.

Okay, but we are going to work on this stuff just because we don't go over the treatment plan, but we're all going to work on things that are connected to your goals okay. and the first thing we're going to work on is you getting a sponsor. Yes, in mind you like, I say i'm not trying to force you, because it is a big decision it's a big decision to be able to be it's a big decision to be accountable to someone and and to do what they say. yeah right."
7350.0,Patient,No matter which I mean i'm haven't gotten that feeling from another moment that i've learned through my sponsor before in the past.

7350.0,Patient,Back on them.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so how you can you okay."

7350.0,Patient,Pro panel and.
740.0,Provider,"propane Allah Allah. Okay, so, while we went on that, let me ask this have you been dealing with any cravings very early design is my bed, how you doing with those."
7350.0,Patient,So pretty good I really have to make room so.
740.0,Provider,me editor you there anything like that.
7350.0,Patient,"I mean it crosses my mind, sometimes."
740.0,Provider,With normal.
7350.0,Patient,"yeah but nothing is living out of them. they're not evil, the first. i'm hoping that that's not going to end when I get out of here. Right sure."
740.0,Provider,"I mean I am the best like a boss necessary because we can because definitely get 10 patients hacking, the most is when you don't have anybody accountable oh you don't have somebody to be accountable to. Right and so we're real rehabilitation facilities, mind you, you know you can have with everybody right you can't miss something you can't screw up. And I know, but the thing about it is is they once you're out, you know i'm saying to your back end society and you're back in your environment things that complete the food. thing is a completely different and so that's why, having a sponsor and fear going to your meetings are very, very imperative. Because you're still in early recovery which means at any point in it anytime anything can seem to or you could buy any kind of excuse for you, does that make sense. Ideas send her the message and I shot the contact her but she's probably be right there with the with the client, so if she does give me a response, back then, I can either send it to your email or she can follow up with you. Okay, and so I did ask her in regards to the program law. That we went to the pharmacy they had no record of it. we'll definitely try to get back to you, if I don't give it to you, she will. um other than that is there anything else you'd like to talk about today or anything I know you're on a time and then you gotta you on a time schedule with the computer and stuff like that so. yeah um but I appreciate you for showing up today. Is whenever you have availability, you can, if you want to make your next appointment that. Yes. um. Hello. Hello."
