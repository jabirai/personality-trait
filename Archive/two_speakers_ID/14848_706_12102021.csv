706.0,Provider,Hello. I can't hear you. There we go.
14848.0,Patient,"I didn't see that you are already, how are you today."
706.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you."
14848.0,Patient,"i'm doing pretty good. I just went up to delete I literally just walked back in the door to get my labs done for you guys and then I did the drug screen, since I did not do the November, one I got that all caught up for you guys. yeah I felt so bad cuz so we had group on Tuesday. Had a doctor's appointment with Dr cell at 630 and then they canceled on me last minute at during group, because I guess my insurance can't have two appointments and then. We rescheduled for one in the morning and then I was up almost all night with my son and I missed the appointment, I called in at 920 and it was already too late, by then, after the check in process. So I got so worried because I must, so the appointment was so important because i'm running out of well i'm not running out i'm out of to have my medication that I take daily and. My anxiety kicked in, and I was too scared to call you guys and let you guys know so i'm feeling a little bit better today so i'm going to let because I felt bad since I missed the appointment with Dr Salah just. uh huh I just felt so bad, but i've been worried about that because i'm to medications I don't want to start feeling problems from it."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well and you don't want to just stop any kind of segments, either because it can. cause physical issues as well, as you know, obviously mental health issues so um how has everything been going so far."
14848.0,Patient,"it's been a little weird because it seems like things with Tony have been going good. And seems like. I had a talk with them about him yelling and having his attitude and don't get me wrong this talk has been said plenty of times before, though. And here lately, he has not been he's been really great is actually like going over and beyond it seems like and, if anything, he seems like he's like Karen about me more it's really throwing me for a loop because. he's he's done a lot of things that have hurt me really bad and I don't know if i'm holding on to grudges or that I secretly know that me and him are just talking about for each other. But it's like I really wish, he was I want him to be the one, but I just think there's a lot of damage that has happened. between me and him."
706.0,Provider,So the last time that we talked we had talked about all of your confusion around kind of his sexuality and like what what does he want you know and did you have that conversation with him like about did you kind of let him know that you know he can be honest with you and. how you feel about everything.
14848.0,Patient,"I haven't I feel like it's i've made it clear to him that he can be honest with me, but I have not been honest with him it's like this walls in front of me i'm just like too scared to bring it up that. I just I don't i'm scared because I don't want our humans and I don't want fighting. me feeling a certain type of way I just. I don't know there's just so many problems with this and I, I have a hard time communicating my my needs like. I wrote down my non negotiable. Okay, and. it's like a fake list because all of these are really negotiable, for me, I am not firm in the things that I want i'm willing to like. dismiss myself to make someone else happy."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
14848.0,Patient,Well that's.
706.0,Provider,"A good thing that you can recognize that. Right. You know, and in some cases it's okay to be you know, I guess, a little negotiable. But I mean there's one thing that you really have to stand by and say if this wasn't if this doesn't happen in this relationship or this does happen in this relationship. It can't be anymore, because there's got to those, like those those very firm boundaries, because otherwise you're going to find that you round your corners, a little bit here round your corners, a little bit."
14848.0,Patient,there.
706.0,Provider,So you don't know yourself anymore. Depending what situation you're in.
14848.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,So let's talk about what you wrote down and then let's talk about you know how you feel about each one.
14848.0,Patient,"Okay, so I wrote down honesty i'm we've definitely gotten to a point of honesty here lately but it's taken years to get to that point."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
14848.0,Patient,"respect and see this is where it's been hard to because there's been so much disrespect so much disrespect it's like Am I still. supposed to hold grudges on that or keep that in the back of my mind, of how he has treated me in the past or but here lately, it seems like he's been respected me I don't know it kind of seems like after he had that talk with me, maybe he feels better that's what it seems like. And i'm happy for him that he's comfortable it's just. I do, I have a lot of questions about it and it's all new to me i've never been with someone who had this type of sexuality ever and um and then. You know I don't know, like the whole it's called monogamy right."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
14848.0,Patient,"Like I don't know what see i'm just so confused I that's my take on, it is that a man and a woman would love each other and be with each other and but it's just everything is changed, nowadays, people are just trying to be so open. You know, I have a 10 year old daughter, who told me that she thinks she's by. And I asked her what."
706.0,Provider,Like your 10.
14848.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like well, what do you think that means, and she was like well, I think it means that I just I like girls and I like guys and I was like and what kind of way because I reminded her you know there shouldn't she shouldn't be feeling. stuck sexual attractions, and I said that word for her age she's too young as when I told her but. She thought At first it just meant like liking, girls and guys I kind of like a friend type deal, but I didn't really know because I would think she felt a little bit more at that age, possibly with the way these kids talk nowadays, but home, you know after that she just. I don't know she's into the whole rainbow flags and stuff like that and I haven't really tackled it to heart, because I don't know. You know she's having a lot of issues with her real Jan and stuff like that, but will come to find out all of these kids are going around near her, like some of her friends and some of my friends kids and stuff are all thinking they're bisexual these days. yeah and i'm like my goodness, so it's like a thing it's like a fad or."
706.0,Provider,Is it a fad it's a fad like yeah. To be bisexual or to be. To like to be. nonspecific or what they call.
14848.0,Patient,For yeah so their gender pronouns.
706.0,Provider,"yep like the days and the times, or to be sexually through it like you don't really like girls you don't really like guys. Do you like, and who, like the person is. Nice or gender, oh yeah that's a huge fan yeah my son's in middle school and he comes home and he'll talk about all of these people that are that are that are their email or their this or that I."
14848.0,Patient,know the life.
706.0,Provider,i'm just like okay.
14848.0,Patient,"I know and their way different from when we were young. You do and it's just I I don't know which way is right wrong, it seems like. You know yeah I was raised a certain way to have certain beliefs and it's just like. Things are changing so much I don't want to hurt no one's feelings or nothing like that, but then, in the midst of that I feel like i'm losing myself kinda like Am I just is it called lowering your standards by having someone who likes all them options or as a wrong."
706.0,Provider,"I mean I don't think it's it's lowering your standards, but I think it's something like that's why we were talking about the negotiable non negotiable."
14848.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"Are you okay with him being attracted to men, would you be okay, if he said, honey, I want to have a threesome with another guy you know all of these things could come up in the future."
14848.0,Patient,"Right. And they have come off yeah. So he says there his fantasies know how do we target fantasies know what if this fantasy he does want to actually performing reality and stuff like that and. I don't know if i'd have the heart to tell him that. It would make me feel uncomfortable. And I don't like again and I don't want to hurt his feelings, this is how i've kind of put myself off to the side. So it's just it's been really confusing, but I wrote, I wrote commitment on this non negotiable and. I wrote a question under I was like do I thrive on monogamy is that, like my thing and I just wrote it as a question because I really I don't know I mean that's how i've always been. i've always thought it was gonna be. too, but. At my age, I think, what I want while we're talking about this is basically I want someone to grow old with and I don't want. I don't want all these extra people to come playing a part in our lives and then ruin the foundation that we have because someone can easily fall in love with someone else I feel like if you're doing those things with them, but."
706.0,Provider,You know it's it's hard it's complicated.
14848.0,Patient,And I.
706.0,Provider,"And I will, and I will tell you, before you before you make a decision like where you're going to explore that kind of a lifestyle because that's what it is it's a lifestyle. Right couples make decisions to be with like other couples or other guys or girls, or whatever within within their marriage within their relationship, whatever it is, I think that you have to be. You have to ask yourself would. You be okay, I mean because you would be there. And you're participating with these. Two other individuals, you know your your partner and then somebody else or whatever it may be, would you be able to do that, would you be able to."
14848.0,Patient,"Do when you explain it like that. yeah like I can already see myself being super jealous. yeah and I think every trait to have it really is, but I could see myself. Being super jealous and I don't know I don't think that I could ever like hold myself shut, to the point where I could just sit there and watch."
706.0,Provider,"Well, you wouldn't sit there and watch you'd be participating, probably in your own way, but you would still see him like being."
14848.0,Patient,"intimate with someone else. Even though you were also being intimate with him or with your partner or whatever you know, like whatever."
706.0,Provider,"You shouldn't it's still going to be there in front of you. and your data, and can you do that, and can you be okay with that and is your relationship strong enough."
14848.0,Patient,"That you can. be the big thing is a good question, too, is it strong enough to be able to do that and I don't think. How i'm feeling obviously that no we're not strong enough and there's a lot of issues still in a lot of hurt."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so in and that's the thing so like I mean I took I took a human sexuality class and it talked a lot about. Like my style and stuff like that, because that's a big thing now like a mess, but because there's all these fantasies and desires these couples go out together. And they together so it's like almost one person, but it's two people as one. And then. You know they choose, whoever they want to you know be with. But come back to each other, like they recommit to each other, after it's all over and, but you have to have a strong foundation, you have to have trust you have to have commitment you have. All of those things and just look at it almost sounds like it's a game that you go play, and then you go back home, you know kind of. And so, because if you don't have that foundation what you find is then you have like the jealousy or the mixed feelings or all of that kind of stuff. Right that's why I say you know how do you feel if this was happening in front of you, because that's really what you have to think about because you're thinking about well, maybe I could just round my corners. and make Tony. but can you round those corners okay so that's why I brought that up because you."
14848.0,Patient,know these are all good points.
706.0,Provider,"Like your non negotiable are kind of negotiable, but is it, but is it really negotiable, I know you want to make people happy with that's kind of a trait that you have is you'll put yourself last to make other people happy, you know."
14848.0,Patient,But.
706.0,Provider,"You know kind of like we talked about like you know you just want to help people all the time. You know. You just want to help people all the time it's like you have this like thing like you have to help people, which is a good trait to have but, but why do you always want to help people and put yourself last. Great you know."
14848.0,Patient,And those are things i'm still trying to figure out to.
706.0,Provider,"yep and that's why and that's what therapies for is just to talk through it and just and look at it and I look at it. The reason I think that it's important that you have that talk with Tony is that if you said to him Tony I understand you have these urges. But I can't act those out within our relationship, if we're going to be married we're married to each other i'm like some women can can share their partners i'm not I don't think i'm one of those women, so if that's what you need, then I love you but i'm not what you need. You know, because and that's true because otherwise there's going to be resentment on his side. Because he's missing whatever it is, he thinks he needs there's going to be resentment on your side because you're going to constantly be thinking he wants something that you can give them and it's just it's not going to work."
14848.0,Patient,"See, and my thing is, I feel like the resentment would come and then he would completely shut down. And let's and then say oh i'll change or let's say whatever, but now these doors have already been opened, we know there's no changing, but I could see him trying to take it back and shut down and. Like say that he didn't want to lose me or something like that I guess that's where some of the confusion as to I guess when all this came about i'm like did you ever really care about me type deal and. Yet, or is this something that you actually want are you really buy or are you gay and trying to cover it up all these crazy questions it's just so confusing."
706.0,Provider,"It is it's confusing because you get this like bomb dropped on you and you're like okay so has our whole relationship and a lie, like."
14848.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,Now there's just been like this facade to cover up like what you're really wanting.
14848.0,Patient,"Right and I have asked him that, actually, and he said know that he's still really, really attracted a women that he loves me he was telling me how much he's in love with me, he is. And it's like. I want to believe it, but sometimes i'm so scared since all these secrets were kept for so long that. You know what does he really is gay and he just scared to be gay because he told me. That it would actually have to be out of town, if you ever had a relationship because he's scared of what his kids would say, of what his parents would say to me that's all just scared to come out and be who you are. yeah people."
706.0,Provider,"It could be to that he really is attracted to men and women, it happens. You know, there are people that have. relationship with the same sex and then turn around and get married and have awesome marriages and. yeah you don't you don't really it's not that the attraction to either a male or female it's actually that it's a person it's there you know. You, for instance, some people that have been married and get divorced, and then they meet somebody at the same sex. And they feel this like weird attraction."
14848.0,Patient,Right I.
706.0,Provider,"don't know why because it's they've never been attracted but it's it's not so much like their sex, as it is the person that they are. Right, you know and i'm saying."
14848.0,Patient,"that's what a lot of people are saying, who they are not their sex."
706.0,Provider,"You know yeah like you, you fall for somebody because of the person that they are not necessarily because of how they look."
14848.0,Patient,Where they.
706.0,Provider,"Are or a woman, which can be confusing to people, especially if you've been in a monogamous you know straight relationship for so many years and then always have like feelings towards the same sex they're like that's weird you know. Like and I think that it happens more now because it's more accepted now than it was 1520 years ago. He may have always had these urges and just never felt comfortable with anybody."
14848.0,Patient,"He told me. He was raised by his grandpa when he was seven years old and so that's where a lot of this comes into play as well. As him kind of trying to seek out as abuser again and me and him have had these deep conversations about this too and and I obviously I feel I kind of felt bad for a second that I said that out loud, but I know this is between me and you. and Because i've just never told nobody either about that and. I don't know if I."
706.0,Provider,"help with that, like is he gone to therapy."
14848.0,Patient,"I don't think so, I know that his therapist was she was a lesbian, so I don't know for sure if he's ever brought that up he might have felt comfortable to talk to her about it but she's never told me that he's talked to anybody about it that basically i'm the only one."
706.0,Provider,and see if he has been just keeping it in five keeping an inside. that's not healthy.
14848.0,Patient,"it's not healthy and it's not healthy for me to not know like I feel like he's still scared to tell his entire truth but, again, like we talked about maybe he really is by but. You know there's things that have been talked about like you know you know him like saying Oh, if I did date somebody of the opposite sex it have to be out of town, but that still doesn't tell me if we just seriously just wants to commit to us. or not, so it just. So I can he was raised. by his grandpa I his on his mother's side. That when. His mom. His mom does know about it and it's been something that's been pushed onto the rock it's really, really sad because. A lot of times, like me and him have anybody to talk about sexual abuse, but mine was never my grandpa doing that to me, you know that's some real and it's intense, no matter what sexual abuse. But it makes me shake it's just so sad and scary like to think of your child going through that, let alone, you know for the mother to find out her dad's doing that the dad probably did it to her to who knows. You know it's just yeah there's some shit that happened to him and I don't know if he has ever gotten help for it. yeah and."
706.0,Provider,"That could be a big issue, too, is that you know he has. All of these mixed feelings about his sexuality, because he feels like it was partially chosen for him at a young age, like he didn't get to choose to be with a man or do I want to be with."
14848.0,Patient,"Oh exactly. I mean if you know and it's sick because it's human nature to like that kind of it just so sick when it comes to something like that sexual abuse. uh huh it's just so sick and I do, I have a really, really good understanding on it so and it just my heart breaks for him too, and like So what are your thoughts on that."
706.0,Provider,"So I I mean, I think it comes down to communication and and I think that you have to you have to be able to sit down and talk to them and say. I know that you have these feelings towards mine but I need to know like can you commit to us and not and and still know that you're attracted to men, but be married to me have a life with me and be okay with that and not want to go explore other things because i'm just not that person. And you just. have to just have that open communication. You know it's just it's just it's a lot of communication. And just you know just be open and honest, because if you don't say how you feel and you just kind of keep going along like this, because things are good you don't want to rock the boat. You know you're going to be married and then, what if you didn't ask all those questions and now they're all coming to light and you're like oh I probably should have asked this you know, three years ago, or whatever. And you don't always wonder either."
14848.0,Patient,"Right and I, I honestly when these conversations started coming up, I quit wearing my brain it's been weeks now, weeks and he hasn't even noticed. And I feel like he has but maybe you just see there's a lot of assumptions going on i'm assuming a lot thinking, he should know or say something I don't know."
706.0,Provider,"Things that you should say to him. You know, be like I haven't worn my ring in four weeks, and you haven't even noticed or said anything, do you not."
14848.0,Patient,know is that something that is like he should have noticed you think in a relationship.
706.0,Provider,"I mean it depends on the person like you know. hi how are you know observant they are, but I think it's okay to ask that question."
14848.0,Patient,Right okay.
706.0,Provider,I think it's anything that you feel.
14848.0,Patient,Any questions.
706.0,Provider,"You have, I think it's okay to express."
14848.0,Patient,"As long as they I used to be like that. yeah and now i'm walking on eggshells, because in the past, he sat there started throwing me around beat know me hitting holes in the wall, just because. i've asked simple questions like you know he's finally come out and told me how he feels about certain things and was honest with me about the men thing but. Before that I was asking them, you know why is there gay porn in your phone it sounds like some gay stuff going on, like that's what I would say to him. And he would get all pissed and start slamming should around and saying i'm not gay and i'm like i'm not calling you gay but it sounds like some stuff going on i'm asking you about all the gay decks and your damn like. just throwing me for a loop but."
706.0,Provider,"Because he felt angry at himself, he had resentment towards them this."
14848.0,Patient,"Is what I feel bad. Like I know i'm hurting in so many ways, but how would it feel to go your entire life and I brought this up to him to you know how would you feel going your entire life, not being able to do what you wanted to do or. You know, maybe like what you like, and again he just kept saying well i'm not I like i'm by two i'm. That paper our jail, but."
706.0,Provider,So um you know the make your your connection your intimacy has that changed.
14848.0,Patient,"See and I i'm a person that when people tell me to do certain things I will do it and. I am up or doing anything in the bedroom but it's just now he is. broaden my toys in the bedroom and which is a fine thing, but now he wants them used on him and. to the point where it's like sometimes. it's just a kind of grosses me out away. mm hmm sometimes and. And I pretend that it doesn't. um. Sometimes I don't know how to feel afterwards. Because I feel like now i'm the one fucking mind mm. I don't know. I don't know how I feel about that, like I my body starts tensing up, I want to start crying. When. I can admit to myself how I feel about it."
706.0,Provider,"So. In those situations when when he asked you to do those things, if you would tell him that you're not comfortable with that, what are you afraid of."
14848.0,Patient,i'm scared of him yelling and. screaming punching thing okay.
706.0,Provider,"So remember when we talked before last time about I said tell me the good things about Tony and you're like oh he's a good provider he's a good Father so on and so forth. And then you, and then I told you to Tommy has negative behaviors and you told me, and I said so does that really make him a good Father does that really make provider, so the fact that you're scared of your partner. tells me that this is not a healthy relationship you shouldn't be scared of your partner, you should never be scared to say how you."
14848.0,Patient,feel like i've forgotten all these things. it's been so long.
706.0,Provider,I think it's because you want it so badly.
14848.0,Patient,"I think so, too, I. don't want to try with someone else I don't want to."
706.0,Provider,"Get and I don't even know if it's so much you want it so badly with Tony but you want to be with this person that you. worked hard to build this life with you don't want to start over. right but. You know, you could take Tony. and move him out of his position and put a guy in his position that treat you like a queen that. You would. You know, like if you come up with just start right here."
14848.0,Patient,And you can just.
706.0,Provider,pick this perfect guy in there and and and push Tony out it wouldn't bother you necessarily that Tony was gone I don't think as long as they were somebody there that treated you nicely that made you feel love that made you feel secure.
14848.0,Patient,"thing, and I think that's it too, and within the last year I started, so I never knew what codependency was and is that could quote about codependency when you."
706.0,Provider,"Little a little bit. Maybe because you're allowing yourself to be traumatized you're allowing yourself to be in kind of a tactic type relationship where you are abused. In order to stay with one because you don't want to be by yourself, you don't want to start over. Right and so, then the questions need to be asked and we're running at a time, and we can definitely you know, like I said, you can you can call in and get you know scheduled weekly for therapy, you know because."
14848.0,Patient,You need.
706.0,Provider,"You know the question needs to be asked is. Why do you why do you feel you have to be with someone, what are you so. afraid you know."
14848.0,Patient,"What I need to figure out. yeah it does like even before Tony I was into relationships, before that, and it just they were horrible just so touched it so toxic."
706.0,Provider,"yeah, so why are you seeking out these relationships. Is it because you feel you don't deserve any better."
14848.0,Patient,Is it because I think so.
706.0,Provider,"You want to save them and change them because you have this like saving thing about you you're like I need to help people so maybe you see them and you see Oh well, there's these issues, but I can fix them my love will fix them."
14848.0,Patient,"I think, because, like when I got in trouble and got that felony and stuff too, I really felt like I was like worth nothing and then nobody was gonna want me that i'm just a fellow about."
706.0,Provider,"yeah we are. Falling yeah you're. not lose it talks about. That you're a felon that you're a junkie that you. You know kind of worthless in society. ready to throw all that away so my assignment for you, for the next time we meet is whenever you have negative thoughts about yourself, I want you to write them down on a piece of paper, and then I want you to crumble them up and throw them away. And then I want you to write down on another piece of paper three positive things that are great about you and I want you to keep that with you. you're going to throw away all the negative and you're going to keep this list of positive and then, when we meet in two weeks we're going to go over that list of positive things. And all those negative things we're. going to have thrown away we're going to talk about them because you're gonna you're just going to keep them like in a box. just going to throw away and we'll talk about them. And we'll talk about those thoughts, because I think it's important that we identify those and and why you're having them. Right, we need to literally seal them up and take them away and replace them with these positive things is that's, the only way you're going to build yourself back up. And the one thing I want to leave you with is nobody deserves to be threatened nobody deserves to be to feel like they have to walk on eggshells, nobody should feel frightened of the person that they are supposed to build their life with and be in love with. No one should. have their kids screamed at by a partner. That that just is not a relationship, and I think that, throughout your life you've had so many of those relationships and you see that as normal it's not normal it's not normal."
14848.0,Patient,Thank you for reminding me that.
706.0,Provider,"Yes, that's not normal it's not like you go to a friend's House and you see over all like happy happy and then you leave and all of a sudden. You know they have a toxic relationship some do, but some don't some have like open communication and love and understanding and compromise. And they work relationship is hard work marriages is hard work and will always be hard work, you just don't put a ring on the finger and be like okay we're perfect. Where you. work at it, because you will always be changing as people. But you can't start that marriage without the fear of harm you shouldn't start. So I want to just leave you with that I want to leave you like, I said with that assignment to the positive and the negative, because I think right now what your goal is is to figure out who you are again.
