235.0,Provider,Does that mean you get a move.
4356.0,Patient,"Know i've been looking at other pharmacies around town, and the reason why is I went through all this hard work to get my technicians license. yeah and. Two things happened one my boss. sent an email to HR to get me my correct pay and to get my job title change to technician and to give me the correct pay. And the second. email back, stating that it wasn't part of my job description to get the technicians license so therefore they're refusing to one give me a title and to pay. Oh yeah."
235.0,Provider,"gotta move on from there, then. You got the education you got the title that probably is five $5 plus more an hour or something should probably get. yeah yeah."
4356.0,Patient,It starts out at my work it starts at $20 an hour.
235.0,Provider,Is the technician job or is that what you're getting paid right now.
4356.0,Patient,No that's for technicians job. raise her. Actual like working in the pharmacy being a technician because right now i'm just a shift me on the sales floor i'm not in the parks.

4356.0,Patient,"Right now, I get good 1747."
235.0,Provider,Okay we'll still that's good that's a lot.
4356.0,Patient,And i'm not trying to be greedy or anything but. mother's birthday.
235.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely you know you, you did your education and that's that's the pay rate that you. should get it. And i'm sure there's other places that you just you know that'd be happy they'd be excited to have you on board, you know."
4356.0,Patient,"And the second reason why I was looking to go to another pharmacy is my boss she wanted me to get that certification and the licensing because she wants me to move into store manager role. And at first, I was okay with that, like that was something I thought I want, but now, since i've actually worked in a pharmacy and I did all the hard work and dedication, I like to work in the pharmacy and she doesn't want me back there."
235.0,Provider,"No. No that's a big problem right there. cuz you do managerial type of thing and then you're going to be taken away from your trade that you've worked you've worked to and your specialized in, and now you got to deal with."
4356.0,Patient,People and.
235.0,Provider,"You know that can be a big headache. become salary then it's like you know they could dump a lot of hours on you, you know you know situation."
4356.0,Patient,"Like I said at first, I was. I was, I was okay with that because I had came from that same position, so I knew what I was getting myself into but now that this other door has opened for me, I want to explore that I want to go into that."
235.0,Provider,"What radius what would. You know where, are you willing to travel to. what's. Your what's your options available to you."
4356.0,Patient,"there's a couple other stores, and in my town or CVs and rite aid so safeway there's quite a few places and it's just whether or not."
235.0,Provider,"Hopefully the hospital to probably wouldn't hurt to put it, you know something to hospital. If you want to be at the hospital. No, no, not me. Again, you know people go into pharmacy they're all a lot of them are sick anyhow, they need to get their meds or. Whatever but okay good so you got a lot of opportunities in your in crescent city."
4356.0,Patient,yeah.
235.0,Provider,So that's quite a bit there I didn't know you guys how large population you guys have there.
4356.0,Patient,"it's it's a small town, but it's a big town Center we have quite a bit of people. How hundreds of thousands."
235.0,Provider,really have I heard the properties really expensive was a you that's moving that the 1500 dollars for rent.
4356.0,Patient,um no it's not mean with me but yeah it's expensive it was one of the other girls in the group. I was just looking at three bedroom today they want 1800 dollars for three bedroom.
235.0,Provider,well. yeah you have again.
4356.0,Patient,"Well, I have borne by I also take care of my nephew so technically by."
235.0,Provider,"Right, so you got yeah you need every one of those bedrooms and stuff. But your your husband or."
4356.0,Patient,My husband.
235.0,Provider,"your husband does so he's working too, so that you know the two of you can. Still. need to put be put into a rant and not."
4356.0,Patient,"So right now he's not working, because of the baby. The baby was getting unemployment, but his employment ran out, he was on the pandemic unemployment. Right yeah and it ran out but it's eventually shortly he's going to be going back to work."
235.0,Provider,"Well that's good but he's getting some like you're getting. relief for him stay at home dad to to watch maybe there's you're you're you're taking advantage of that resource right. paternal I guess preterm do. Well that's cool which which what's your thought so you have you ever thought about a I think I mentioned it in group, but maybe mobile home park."
4356.0,Patient,"um so we've been there we've done that. First, now, when we first moved the crescent city and my parents were the ones that brought that up We live in a at the time we only had two kids. Realism like a 32 foot fifth will, and it was really big it's kind of Nice and we lived there for about a year before we got into a four bedroom house that I shared with my sister. And then. my sister decided she didn't want to pay rent anymore, if we can afford it even both of us working and I ended up getting pregnant with my daughter yeah so we ended up. Leaving that house that we move into the apartment that we live in now. And we've been here since my daughter went to zero."
235.0,Provider,And that's like a two bedroom apartment that you're in.
4356.0,Patient,it's a three bedroom but it's a three bedroom flat so it's kind of small. And it's as they thought and older and now that we have two more kids it's real small.
235.0,Provider,"yeah I would imagine. Oh well, I guess you guys have looked at all your options and that's the best you come up with right now."
4356.0,Patient,"yeah and we're we're Okay, with it, I mean we've been here for 11 years you know and our rent is cheap because it goes by our income, and right now, our grants only 550 bucks."
235.0,Provider,"me okay well you get you get getting subsidize so that's. that's that's good. it's kind of crazy, the more you make, the more you gotta pay so it's like all that you know to me."
4356.0,Patient,"Before I went on maternity leave, we had a recertification for the performance here, and both of us were working at that time and they told us that we made too much money in their various to move out and. She told us, she would give us a year to move out and then I was like well i'm going on maternity leave. And my husband probably going to be ended up quitting his job to stay home with the baby and she's like okay well well we'll squash that, for now, but in the future, once he starts working again we'll lose our House. So that's."
235.0,Provider,"Your options and you'll get you'll get some help as far as the rent goes there they'll figure out the numbers and how many children, and all that well that's good you know that's one good thing about being a big family I guess that."
4356.0,Patient,"Well, I want, though, is the more money you make the list help you get so like. that the two months that we had reported all of our stuff we lost our food stamps we lost our medical and we've lost our housing. With too much."
235.0,Provider,"What about the kid kids do they lose their. Medical wallets usually it's not a big thing with the children less there's pre existing but well it's always a big thing but but for you guys to lose your your medical that's a big deal, I always thought it's it's really weird I mean the States it's a blessing, because of the you know. That there's you know that you could fall back on the State to help you out or the Fed. To help you out when you're really in dire needs, but if you're in a certain spot where you making certain amount of money you're between a rock and a hard spot when one guy was talking about that in our last group, and she was just totally bummed out and it's like. they're just making that amount of money they can't afford anything because going to rent or other stuff so."
4356.0,Patient,yeah government says that you make too much money to be to get any help. it's it's not right.
235.0,Provider,"yeah she couldn't get her food stamps or anything like that and she's wondering where, am I going to go to get food and I, you know I told her maybe check with united way or. Catholic charities or something like that, let them know your situation because she was you know really distraught I can understand that you know got a bunch of mouths to feed, and then they say no, you don't you know. So even."
4356.0,Patient,"I know that person, if I have that person. All they gotta do is, let me know, and I will get them to lead me."
235.0,Provider,"amen I mean that's what we have a food pantry our church, we got a food pantry closed pantry every Friday, you know they can people come and it's packed I mean a lot of people come over and. And it's it's a great ministry, but you know a lot of times, people are it's quiet they don't let other people know and people are willing to help out when they know you're in trouble, you know."
4356.0,Patient,"yeah yeah all the way, oh."
235.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm in a sense, i'm kind of glad with it with your kids they're all kind of locked into live in there and the beautiful. You know if you guys were to move away from there that'd be a culture shock for him."
