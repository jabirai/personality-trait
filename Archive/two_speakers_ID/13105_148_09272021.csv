13105.0,Patient,hi.
148.0,Provider,Sally how are you.
13105.0,Patient,so good.
148.0,Provider,what's going on.
13105.0,Patient,My best friend. 40 I don't know she's 10 years since I was two she's 57 she's 10 years older than me my best friend mother sister. She had a stroke. She went in for an operation and. not good. try not to cry cry all the time.
148.0,Provider,"Okay it's important to get it out, so how she doing."
13105.0,Patient,"You know I don't know, for some reason she is very agitated she's had to be strapped down for days, because she's just thrashing around and she pulled out three ivy's and then they put a PIC line enter pulled that out. With her hands stripes you did it with her foot."
148.0,Provider,Oh wow.
13105.0,Patient,"yeah and she's just thrashing about just. I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do it out or it's killing me I just I want to go down there, which is riverside. California. But. I mean she's as close to me as a mother or sister in best friend is real blood, I mean that's how close we are and. I want to go down there but she's got a lot of visitors right now and in the hospital. A camp I there's a lot of people and I don't want to be like fighting to get in so I figured that i'd wait to go down there until she goes to the rehab. But God only knows when that is. mm hmm so um I just got an update a second ago and. we're excited because we thought she was calming down and then her husband's sent out an update saying we've taken a couple steps back you know she's just. agitated just. i'm not used to not having her i've always had it or since I was two years old."
148.0,Provider,yeah so hard i'm sorry family.
13105.0,Patient,"it's like beyond heart it's like. I just wish there was something I can do, I can't even send flowers because she's in a room that doesn't really. It it'd be kind of a waste because she wouldn't even know they're there you know it's like I can't do anything I can't. I talked to her husband a few times i've known him the same amount of time he's been they've been married for 32 years but i'm. I don't know what to do with myself."
148.0,Provider,"Will. Talk to her husband how's that. How is it for you, when you talk to her husband."
13105.0,Patient,"Oh God it's so so hard. it's so hard it is so hard I like. I tried to stay strong, but he knows how close we are, I mean we were like so close like we'll have five our conversations a couple times a week I mean that's like. and He told me, so I don't. hate treated like a little kid I just yesterday was my birthday and still treats me like gum you know that little kid growing up he's all because I talked to him. day before yesterday, I believe, and she was doing better she was calming down. And we are hopeful. yeah and then. It just turns again and I guess that um he said that he just text me all this, he said that's the update I don't like you can see. yeah but he said they're putting her in a new room with a full time sitter. So I guess they're moving her to somebody who can be there because she pulled her catheter out so she's wetting the bed. and nurses are probably very sick of that. To be quite frank. talking to him. it's hard, because I want to. crying. Because I can't stop crying you know. He told me when she was doing well, that goes back to the day before yesterday i'm sorry um. I said Oh, this is great, you know I said it, I go, are we ever going to really have her back you know, and he looked at, or he didn't look at me he said to me, he said SLA don't get your hopes up don't don't get you know. He doesn't want me to think because there's one good thing that. it's all good because it's not you know I mean. And now, this new room I didn't even know they had rooms, with people who is he talking about like around the clock nursing right that's what he's talking about. yeah. because she keeps she needs to get our meds and she needs to get nutrients and how do you do that without by V. And they have to stop her down thing and even hear that, like. shit you know. hmm."
148.0,Provider,it's really hard to hear. Oh yeah someone you love and care so deeply for.
13105.0,Patient,"I haven't been this scared since my dad passed away and that was. 19 years ago and. That feeling is just. i'll tell you the good thing, though, one good thing when I talked to her, I he I told her I wanted, I told him I wanted to say hi.

148.0,Provider,"It situations like this that are so out of our control and so painful that are so so difficult. But so you know ways to get through feeling, this is stay in your present moment try not to think of worst case scenarios because that's where mine usually wants to go i'm."
13105.0,Patient,i'm writing this down. stay in the present moment.
148.0,Provider,"In your present moment yeah don't let your mind wander off to you know what if, for what could you know happen because. it'll."
13105.0,Patient,Right.
148.0,Provider,"yeah no just cause you so much anxiety and stress, as if you're already going through you. That will literally put your body through the stress of going through the worst case scenario, when it hasn't happened yet right we don't know what's going to happen and just keep bringing yourself back to this moment remember what you do have control over prayer right. yeah they're."
13105.0,Patient,"So mad at God right now. Her husband, I said he goes he knows he told me, may I interrupt you, for one second. For what he told me is what's the date today twice. I write it down for our sessions and. he's so mad he goes, the first time I talked to him, he said. I said he goes, and you know what I am so. God damn sick of people saying I wish you well and praying for you he's all what the Fuck is God done for me to put or to my life for my wife to be in you know he's all i'm tired of hearing it I said okay okay okay you don't that's okay. i'm not going to be saying i'm praying for you anymore, I was saying it before.

148.0,Provider,scared here here yeah absolutely.
13105.0,Patient,What else can I do stay in the present moment unless you're right.
148.0,Provider,"Yes, remember what you do have control over what you have control over right now it's really taking care of yourself so again going back to praying you know doing some meditating. Staying positive right staying hopeful that things will turn off the best instead of letting yourself get go to that negativity where it's like oh my God what could happen right. yeah a letter there."
13105.0,Patient,"And just yeah here, you know. Like I wonder, do time to me like you're able to talk to me like well."
148.0,Provider,"And it's okay to feel the feelings that you know are coming up for you, you know don't don't try to push them aside or push them down definitely keep talking about it and. Just taking it one day at a time right now."
