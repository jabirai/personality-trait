17257.0,Patient,Yes.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so what is your understanding expectation of today's session, just to make sure we're on the same page before we get started started."
17257.0,Patient,um they're supposed to be an assessment. I don't know what that means. But yeah.
107.0,Provider,"that's fair, are you in a space where you can speak freely you don't need to worry about other people barging in or hearing your business."
17257.0,Patient,um I think so.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have headphones by any chance, it will help with any potential ECHO or weirdness. Of the device might."
17257.0,Patient,Do they are somewhere. downstairs and they put them downstairs.
107.0,Provider,"Okay well we'll work with what we've got. And then, if it becomes squatting or things become weird will take a little break and you'll get your headphones. how's that."
17257.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
107.0,Provider,"Alright perfect, so I had a chance to review the surveys, the information that you completed as a part of working with our admissions department, thank you for that. So your pH Q nine, which is a measurement of depression or sadness, was an 11 so that's like on the low end of moderate and for your anxiety, it was a two, which is almost nothing So what does that kind of go with your experience, do you feel like your depression is. kind of pronounced versus your anxiety is not as bad."
17257.0,Patient,"yeah I say my anxiety is a bit more pronounced these days cuz i'm. for whatever reason, my brain has started unlocking things that I had kept locked up."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
17257.0,Patient,And so it just it kind of randomly hits me.
107.0,Provider,James.
17257.0,Patient,"So. Okay. yeah I mean there aren't like pleasant memories, but still like. I surprising stuff. yeah I have to lock up for some like when do we get to the fat stuff."
107.0,Provider,huh do you have a therapist or somebody that you're working with on a regular basis by any.
17257.0,Patient,No that's what the assessment was for.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yeah. Okay, so. Somebody is getting home, they will not be in my space, but my. dog still need to tell me that they're in our general vicinity, so I. apologize for the dog. So do you know if you have any kind of clinical. Community or clinic or anything in nearby."
17257.0,Patient,um I don't. Think there's one in scotts Valley. But i've heard of the Lotus collected. in Santa Cruz.
107.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, because it sounds like if you've got some stuff kind of coming up for you, that we're going to need to make sure, at the very least you start talking to a therapist sooner rather than later, so you have a place for that stuff to land. But i'll make a note of that for right now and we'll keep going back to let's go kind of big picture to. Where. When I was looking at your survey I didn't see any kind of obvious behaviors so i'm just going to kind of run through some stuff with you and and you can tell me if that fits or doesn't fit. Okay, do you spend most of the day, or all of the day, thinking about food meaning if you need to eat anything, are you allowed to eat something, what are you going to eat. anything like that does that resonate with you."
17257.0,Patient,Yes.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, do you spend most of the time restricting or do you feel like you kind of go back and forth from restricting so not eating anything to. Maybe eating I don't know if we you would call it a binge eating more than you would identify as comfortable for you, or more than you would in a setting where you aren't necessarily super hungry and all of a sudden you're just consuming a lot of food."
17257.0,Patient,um I mean part of the challenge is that i'm dealing with some unexplained gastroenteritis.
107.0,Provider,hmm and so.
17257.0,Patient,That makes it hard for me to eat normally.
107.0,Provider,But at.
17257.0,Patient,"The same time I can't really tell when i'm like. I can't really tell it where the gastro and. And, and the eating disorder begins like i'm. Fair I practiced earlier today and i'm I couldn't finish it was very, very like and I was so hungry afterwards, but I couldn't really tell if my brain was telling. me like i'm full or is it that if I. eat more i'll be in pain. I couldn't really tell the difference between all those different signals."
107.0,Provider,Okay. Do you are you working with. A specialist to kind of understand what triggers your. symptoms.
17257.0,Patient,um. Do you mean like for the cash and tried to stop yes or ED stuff.
107.0,Provider,don't know for the medical piece.
17257.0,Patient,"Is I have been working with the nutritionist I had not been able to see a specialist. Right, the stomach stuff. Oh."
107.0,Provider,"I think I think you need to make sure that's on the list that you see a specialist for your stomach stuff and that you work through some. testing and get some official work ups done so that you can know what's potentially triggering that and what is making you know what makes it worse, and what makes it better."
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Because that's definitely a legitimate concern and that's really hard to tease out when you're already struggling with other behaviors to then have a medical issue on top of that is that's tough. Okay, and how long have you been working with a nutritionist."
17257.0,Patient,"Since I believe September or August. Of this year, not like sometimes. And how I was running with another."
107.0,Provider,Sorry go ahead.
17257.0,Patient,"um Okay, so I was getting receiving treatment for my eating disorder seeing a nutritionist and therapists through my old. Friends for about a year. And then my insurance. ended because they turned 26. And then, so I. didn't see a new nutritionist, and so I think it was end of August early September, so I had like a two for you want to pause."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and because your insurance ended, are you not able to go back to the old team."
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,I see okay. that's too bad that's frustrating when you make it. What did you feel like it was helpful were you making progress with that team.
17257.0,Patient,"yeah um I was starting to slide a bit near the end. Like. I know I wasn't eating, as well as I. don't want to say should be like yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and. How long have you been dealing with the medical condition."
17257.0,Patient,And the cash right it started around September.
107.0,Provider,Of this year.
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so it's not necessarily what caused the eating."
17257.0,Patient,disorder stuff. that's associated with I think there was a lot of. trauma related to food scarcity that kind of triggered full thing.
107.0,Provider,When do you remember first starting having thoughts or issues or concerns about food.
17257.0,Patient,"Well, I mean. When it became a full blown eating disorder let's see. Talking about this stuff. I was supposed to 20 2017 um. yeah. Specifically, it was when I got back from Boise Idaho. After. yeah. let's just say. September. For July 2017."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and when did you start noticing thoughts or ideas of it, since you've already done this work I don't want to get you know I want to be respectful of your sensitivity to it, I totally get it at the same time, just to give me an overarching history if you don't mind."
17257.0,Patient,"Okay, that would probably be I think it was around. 2020. I was it the year before. I could look on my Google calendars and see."
107.0,Provider,So. 2017 is when you feel like it started to really take form. So when was it before that that you started having thoughts and feelings about your body and concerns about food.
17257.0,Patient,let's say. um. i'd want to say around is either 2020 or 2019.
107.0,Provider,"So 2017 is when you. start having ideas, but that 2020 2019 is when things really took off."
17257.0,Patient,"that's all I realized, I had a problem. Okay, what I would do like my way would be in like the danger zone and like i'd wake up feeling like I was about to pass out or whatever they'd be like oh crap I need to eat more so, like. i'd really focus on eating more and then, when I was out the immediate danger zone House like out i'm fine and then I would stop eating as much, and then I would drop again, and then you go back up. So I can't. and, eventually, I read. books and stuff like that to be like huh my lines of reasoning are kind of like a lot of people with eating disorders so maybe I have one of those. And I got diagnosed and. Eventually, began, I guess, you could say."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. Have you ever done any impatient or residential treatment or personal programs anything like that. No Okay, and so, how much weight, how much weight, did you lose when this all kind of started or have you. Where were you at versus how low did you go. it's easier to speak retargeting. Size you can speak in clothing."
17257.0,Patient,Okay well i'm. talking like before the Castro stuff or like before.
107.0,Provider,"He saw. Well, like 2017 where were you at kind of in your weight. And then. What when did things get to their lowest. Like when you were waking up and feeling like you were going to pass out."
17257.0,Patient,"Ah, I was i'd say I was always under 100 my eating before that honestly like. That wasn't great either, to be honest, so I stayed between like. to live in the House. But get that all started around. September. Was it Sep tember 2014 when I had to go back from South Korea, due to a back injury. And I realized that while I was saying there I had lost. Now it's just never able to gain those hundred pounds back. All right, so."
107.0,Provider,This has been. with you for. Almost 10 years.
17257.0,Patient,"Oh yeah, I guess, I mean I didn't really consider that the eating disorder time is more like I just wasn't well. or not to go to the fridge and get something mm hmm so I just did it."
107.0,Provider,mm hmm. So. How would you describe your. behaviors now can you kind of walk me through a typical day for you.
17257.0,Patient,"Okay well i'm. Right now it's complicated because I have this medication that i'm telling you the stomach pain and I can't eat two hours before or an hour after I take it. So basically I wake up. Take the medicine pass out for another hour wake up, try to eat something within the next hour or so, but sometimes it ends up being like two hours hours, which is not great. And then, and that is like. Usually it's ensure plus um. Sometimes it's like pasta, or whatever just whatever I can keep down. And then. Do you have an alarm set up on my phone for when i'm supposed to eat I don't necessarily eat at the alarm off the top."
107.0,Provider,Okay um.
17257.0,Patient,So yeah then i'll usually have something at around noon. And then something around three something around six or seven and then I try to have something around Cape there's usually to enter pluses and it really kind of depends on. kind of how my stomach is feeling. For how I think my. topic is feeling I guess.
107.0,Provider,Are you able to keep the ensure pluses down.
17257.0,Patient,yeah that's I can keep down fine.
107.0,Provider,"So you have anywhere from two to three ensure plus this throughout the day. one to two. Okay, and then you're eating pasta, what other kinds of things are you eating."
17257.0,Patient,"i'm like base. That has female milk cheese steaks. um. Let me see what else do I. eat sometimes I try to eat. Bring. keys and green beans and stuff and. They also have. These gluten free waffles and vehicles that I will eat like some peanut butter and jam and. yeah i'm on a low fiber diet, to help manage the symptoms and it seems to be healthy so."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So if you had to give me kind of a guesstimate and I recognize this might be triggering but unfortunately I have to ask, could you give me kind of an estimate range of how many calories you take in. On a daily basis."
17257.0,Patient,Oh i'd say around 900 1200.
107.0,Provider,And if it was a low day what would a low day look like.
17257.0,Patient,"Oh, it would definitely be in the 900 range."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so you think nine Hello. Sorry yeah. And what was the highlight."
17257.0,Patient,Those would be 1500.
107.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and you are five six. Okay. And do you know what your current latest."
17257.0,Patient,"um last time, the doctor said it was. Down four pounds from 123."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. How, how are you doing on exercise, are you exercising what kind of what are you doing in terms of."
17257.0,Patient,"And exercise that a pretty solid zero except for on sometimes i'll have to want to take the stairs and every so often, I will. Like do at like three minutes of strength exercises. So it's not as a priority for you."
107.0,Provider,"And, and how how much sleep, are you getting."
17257.0,Patient,um. I want to say nine to 11 hours to sleep i've been a lot more fatigued lately.
107.0,Provider,"you're feeling kind of run down, and that would make sense. Okay. So do you ever purge your food, do you ever throw up or use laxatives or diuretics anything like that. sound like, with your gastric stuff that you would do that, but just checking. What about chewing your food and."
17257.0,Patient,spitting it up. No.
107.0,Provider,Okay.
17257.0,Patient,What are you gonna say to my pseudo loss.
107.0,Provider,So. Do you chew it a lot because you're having a hard time swallowing it or what do you think motivates you're chewing it.
17257.0,Patient,"I don't know. I know done all I really noticed that, like i've noticed i've had something and i'm off for a while, but then i'm just like I can't swallow it like I don't know if it's a mental thing or physical thing it's just. I don't know."
107.0,Provider,"Do you ever spit it out, or you just take your time to kind of swallow it just takes a while, for you to get to that space."
17257.0,Patient,yeah just takes a while for me to swallow.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you drink fluids to kind of help you with that or no."
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, how are you about drinking fluids, do you drink a lot of water or or how much water, do you drink a day or what kind of things do you drink outside of the ensure."
17257.0,Patient,"I would say I drink, maybe one and a half of these 20 ounce things."
107.0,Provider,"Today, all right good. Good amount of water."
17257.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Okay, also. The lactose free."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so, would you say that your food that you ingest is guided mainly by your gastric stuff that you're eating like you said low fiber. you're eating particular things that sounds like some lactose free things to try and reduce your reaction to the gastric."
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,Do you have any other rules that you have in place that may be not quite directly related to the gastric so.
17257.0,Patient,I mean i'm gluten free but that's to manage like my symptoms. So. yeah my altitude.
107.0,Provider,Okay that's what I was going to ask next is How long have you been managing that are dealing with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.
17257.0,Patient,Since 2017.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you have a doctor that you work with regularly on all of these things."
17257.0,Patient,Yes.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Is that doctor somebody who can help you with the gastric stuff or they're aware of it and they're not necessarily a specialty or."
17257.0,Patient,"they're aware of it, but they aren't specialty."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, is the person that you're working with a specialist and fibromyalgia."
17257.0,Patient,"And um I have a rheumatologist and they're also have my PCP my PCP does deals with the medication side of things, where, as the rheumatologist deals with the sleeping lifestyle stuff."
107.0,Provider,Okay. In terms of. How much you eat or when you eat is that guided by what's you have a hard time kind of knowing if it's guided by your stomach or guided by mentally trying to keep your calories down.
17257.0,Patient,"I mean i'm not trying to keep my calorie. I mean, I feel like I am let's not like it's not like a weight thing. i'm actually not happy with my weight right now. My body shape because. I used to be able yeah that's a whole nother thing but. it's more. Like my brain is trying to see the food for when I really need it."
107.0,Provider,yeah so you need to eat more in order to not feel like you're starving all the time.
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"you're having a hard time eating, because the gastric stuff."
17257.0,Patient,"uh huh and also. I don't want to run out of foods, I can eat."
107.0,Provider,Okay. Is that an issue do do have you are you not able to kind of stock up.
17257.0,Patient,"um sometimes yes um I live with my dad and. The problem is sometimes. Like we're not very consistent about going to the grocery store and these days in particular i'm just too tired to go there myself. And some days i'm too tired to like oil pasta or stuff like that, because I get brain fog and then. I do not it's not safe for me to view. around like in. A hot stove like i'll probably forget that it's all. about the. So. yeah."
107.0,Provider,"So it's really sounding like clarity and your medical condition. is going to while working with your dietitian is going to be kind of the focus, because until you can really understand what's antagonizing all of your medical stuff in it and i'm going to make a guess here that in 2017 you had to deal with some pretty terrible trauma stuff. Okay, and so it's very understandable that you would have a physical reaction to all of that that would antagonize your fibromyalgia and all of these other things and. As you're trying to manage that it doesn't surprise me now that you're starting to have some flashbacks and some connections to all of that, and you have apprehension about what else is coming, and I don't blame you. It really seems like your medical team needs to be very aware of what's going on for you. Emotionally and that that they need to be maybe working a little bit more diligently to try and help figure out what's going on with you medically so that you can at least have some skill sets to manage the medical conditions, while you're managing the emotional ones. And if you do you feel like you had a good connection with your therapist or do you think you need to work with somebody new to have kind of a different perspective."
17257.0,Patient,"me my therapist changed jobs. Okay, a different thing now."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, it sounds like you could benefit from working with somebody who specializes in trauma. And, most people who specialize in trauma have familiarity with working with eating disorders Okay, so I would recommend. That you get your medical stuff address on a on a more complete basis and that you see a therapist once or twice a week to work on your trauma and I don't know if you would really meet criteria for iot level of programming. It probably would be more outpatient related if you continue to struggle and needed more support than maybe you would consider doing by op or even going somewhere and kind of getting out of the environment if you feel like that's, something that would be helpful for you. At this point, i'm not sure about the criteria for that, but. But it's something that I can look at once we kind of work through your vitals would you say they how often would you say that you kind of struggle with feeling disoriented or or wanting to pass out like your blood pressures off."
17257.0,Patient,I say. All right now I am definitely feeling it um. I don't usually la i'm about to pass out it's more like I feel out of breath and very sleepy all the time.
107.0,Provider,"it's very possible it's connected to your concerns about your flashbacks and different things to it could also be there, you know my emotionally connected and driven. So you're got a little bit of a twofer here going, which is very unpleasant. How often do you see your dietitian."
17257.0,Patient,once a month okay.
107.0,Provider,"So you're not really seeing anybody weekly right now. yeah okay. So you definitely need to have a weekly therapy session, if not twice a week. To start working on the trauma to start working on. Helping you develop some basic coping skills to manage all the different things that are coming up for you. As a result of this assessment it'll go to your insurance company, and we can make those kind of recommendations and all review. was talked about I don't again I don't see rate, making a higher recommendation, except for the medical pieces a little bit concerning to me, but that is more that needs to be addressed in that venue that's not something that we could address here. Because you need to have. You know those different people working with you and potentially even adding a special to specialists in that. To help you with all of those things. You mentioned that you do a lot of reading have you done a lot of reading on fibromyalgia and trauma."
17257.0,Patient,i'm not a whole lot.
107.0,Provider,"So I don't know how helpful, this will be, but I think it might be helpful if you can focus on some trauma readings and the auto immune response. To give you some education on what's going on with your body and what's going on with your mind and how the two are kind of. working at odds and were together with each other, depending on your perspective and how you manage it, that might give you some hope to know that if you can identify those things, and you can work through them, which is true. But it can be very overwhelming and frustrating at times. So I don't know I don't have any books to recommend right off the top of my head, but I think if you were to look up some trauma slash auto immune response. That maybe that would be helpful for you okay so that's an immediate recommendation I can make so it gives you something to work on right now, while you work on kind of developing the specialists and then I can write up my recommendations in terms of. You know therapy twice a week I think you should see your dietitian weekly. You should get some more medical support, I think the medical conditions really need to be. addressed or continued to be addressed, not to be disrespectful to your medical team it's a big deal to deal with fibromyalgia and it's not. it's such a complicated issue that it's hard to get the care, you need because it's just it can be so overwhelming and i'm sorry they're having to deal with them."
17257.0,Patient,"Can you also write a recommendation to my gastroenterologist just like see them ASAP because I do have one scheduled, but all the way out February."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, are you on a waiting list by any chance, can you talk to them okay. yeah I will. I will certainly advocate for the medical workup tab and sooner rather than later, I don't know if I have any pull in that I doubt it, but you know I will definitely. That is by far and away the biggest priority I see here not to be dismissive of the other concerns because they're big and legitimate, but if you can't manage the medical piece, and everything else feels that much more overwhelming yeah yeah. So that's kind of where i'm at I don't have any other particular questions or concerns for you do you have any other questions or thoughts for me i'm happy to take some time to go over them."
17257.0,Patient,"Okay well. I think. I guess another thing i'd like to talk to you about is um. My family doesn't have the best. relationship with food either. Okay, I believe that my analysis or my i'm the oldest of four girls my the third in line I believe she may be dealing with an eating disorder and she's currently at ucsd. is so like I guess. It sounds cold blooded but it isn't as much of a problem for me the bigger problem is my dad is obsessed with his weight. and eating a certain way. and Like. fantasizing about food and stuff like that. hmm so i've gotten better about like saying no to that stuff and. telling him off for these acting like that, but like. um yeah so something I, like you."
107.0,Provider,So the environment you're in because you said you're living with your dad and your sisters nearby sounds like she's going to school nearby that you're kind of in an environment that's not exactly conducive to healing in terms of food stuff.
17257.0,Patient,Exactly.
107.0,Provider,"Okay well that's yeah that's good information to have because again like I said I need to go back through and work up the numbers, it may be that if you can. You know, meet kind of criteria we can make a recommendation for. A higher level of care where you can be in a different environment potentially."
17257.0,Patient,"yeah it would be nice to not I don't know like i'm dealing with this on my own, and I recognize that there's a problem that they don't so it's kind of like I had to issue smack Downs when they're not backing down this thing so."
107.0,Provider,"So, as if you didn't have enough to deal with in your own body now you have to deal with their nonsense to it sounds like. frustrating. Know goodness, I have the needy dog right here, let me see if I can get him to chill for a second. Okay, good to know noted what else anything else I need to be aware of."
17257.0,Patient,"I I don't think so, there is also family drama but um. I think I can deal with that I need to advocate for my younger sister. I have a lot on my plate so yeah. And I do need to. convince my mom to not go on a yoga retreat and leave my 17 year old little sister behind for weeks at a time. But yeah that's a whole nother thing. But family is also not like about. setting boundaries, with people when they're screwing up and telling people no that's not okay they're very enabling a toxic behaviors. I need to talk to my mom about that. and yeah i'm worried for my little sister I don't know if that's more something to talk about with a therapist or."
107.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. Well, I mean all of it is good to know that you've got a lot on your plate, and that you're very concerned about your family dynamic doesn't sound like you have any really solid support people in your life, right now, outside of your clinical medical team."
17257.0,Patient,"I do have my church. Okay yeah I have some long some friends from my old church as well, so i'm pretty connected over there."
107.0,Provider,"Great could you potentially move in with somebody from church or rent a room or something like that, and maybe get out of your family dynamic. Because it sounds like they've got a lot of stuff going on, and maybe you don't need to be right in the middle of it, and maybe you need to kind of step aside from it and and still pray for them and love them, but not be right in the middle of all their nonsense."
17257.0,Patient,"Try now I can't exactly work because of all the medical conditions, so it would be."
107.0,Provider,"One maybe you could do chores or something I mean you know just put it out there and see you don't. Who knows, somebody might be willing to say yeah absolutely you can come and stay in the room above the garage and then, when you're feeling better you can do work around the House and pay for yourself that way. You don't know what is out there until you ask."
17257.0,Patient,yeah good point. I had asked my church about that.
107.0,Provider,"yeah I think it would be it sounds like you could, at the very least, you could use some more support and maybe there is some support groups or Bible studies or groups or things that you could join there to help bolster you through this challenging time yeah. beef up the positive troops in your life."
17257.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,Any other questions concerns thoughts.
17257.0,Patient,um no I think that's everything you just need. A lot yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,"yeah so we'll have this done within about a week. or so that'll get out to the insurance company in that time period, but you have my verbal recommendations anyway, for now. And if something comes up and you want to ask me you're welcome to reach back out to corey and she can get Ahold of me and will answer any questions you have, in the interim, and hopefully we can. Get you going, but hopefully I mean it's really your insurance companies to get you going at this point, and just really advocate for yourself, which is what you're trying to do, but. Definitely lean on church a little bit more and work on the lean on the positives and maybe step away from the negative stuff it's very legitimate, I understand that you're concerned about all of them, but. In this is one of those annoying situations where, if you can't take care of yourself, you can't take care of them, so you got to prioritize yourself right now in order to be in a different space so down the line you can advocate. Better behavior and better support with your family okay. that's frustrating to hear, because we want to be helpful to other people sometimes it does help to be helpful to other people when we're struggling with their stuff but right now I think you've got. Plenty on your plate, you need to really just be a squeaky wheel, and you know advocate for yourself and your medical stuff for sure.

Special to office weekly just checking just checking squeak squeak you know it's it's not going to hurt your case and they all appreciate that you really wanted to get seen."
