298.0,Provider,Trying to write. How would you. How have your moods been.
7442.0,Patient,"um. I guess. I don't I don't know like I don't know I don't know if I could say more or less because I don't know what time to necessarily compare it to but. I feel like i'm making progress on certain things that i've avoided working on, but then, at the same time. it's like because i'm so almost like emotionally involved in working through something i'm less patient and more irritable. with other things that I can just eat like that i've already been okay with before you know, like other things are just bothering me easier."
298.0,Provider,kind of an increased irritability yeah.
7442.0,Patient,"yeah but I didn't necessarily the same as it was a feel like a year ago, or so, when it was more than it was more like yelling and such at my kiddos so I feel like i've worked on that, but it's almost like it's kind of mellowed out to just more days, though, of irritability or something."
298.0,Provider,um are you having struggles with anxiety. Panic attacks.
7442.0,Patient,mm hmm.
298.0,Provider,How often.
7442.0,Patient,"it's kind of. On an increasing scale and it's like. Just going along the line of you know, when working through some trauma or certain types of traumas traumas in general that you can get worse, with certain symptoms, as you work through it. And it seems like At first it was kind of about once a month, but now it seems kind of more like every other week or so. Now that's not necessarily like always a huge one, but it could be a little one as well. Okay, and that i'm just including and then. But I think to like my personal awareness of how my how anxiety is showing with me has also increased, so I think that's also kind of a part of it too. Like I finally accepted like Okay, this is probably actually just anxieties fault like if I worked on that it's not I could just stretch this out it's not anxiety."
298.0,Provider,i'm like bad It shows me you've been in counseling.
7442.0,Patient,yeah working on it.
298.0,Provider,"i'm just going over. Like for the first time we met i'm looking at that. Where you were when we met and. um how much cannabis, if any, are you using."
7442.0,Patient,i'm probably smoked like three or four times throughout a day.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you feel like it's an okay amount to much what are your thoughts."
7442.0,Patient,i'd rather. I don't know I feel like I smoke too much in general but that's because that includes cigarettes as well.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and how much cigarettes are you smoking daily."
7442.0,Patient,it's about half a pack to pack depending on if there was like drinking involved or like a stressful day where i'm just like overthinking of something. And i'll try to go outside to do that. And i'll end up staying out there. or end up sharing I don't know how much like I tried to put more of myself and others.
298.0,Provider,How much are you drinking.
7442.0,Patient,"And then that hasn't been as often but we've recently i've had a lot of friends and such and it was just like after Labor day weekend. It seemed like there was some downtime for me personally, but then it seemed like that energy went out into the world so everyone decided to just like. hey what are you doing tomorrow let's come over as in like oh just sort of stopped by after work like there was almost not more than one or two days, if even that someone else wasn't over here. And then, but at the same time they were over here, bringing drinks and like. I came here with this to have with all of you guys i'm going through this our time cope with me bubble, you know or. I haven't seen you in so long it's the first time let's celebrate this together, and just all the reasons of like a reason to bring something over to drink and celebrate was more often than just like the weekend. because everyone was able to come over daily. So it wasn't even kind of something where if i'm aware that. Like I would say no to and going out because I just don't want to drink and if i'm there i'm probably going to. But it was a whole different story when everyone kept coming over and bringing it here. And then I my fear of missing out kicked in I felt like I needed to you know host need to support this friendship, I need to be there for them i'm a good person i'll be fine like. So was kind of like a one, I would just say up to like a week or so yeah like a week like five to seven days that there was probably a good amount of drinking every day. But then that's finally calmed down."
298.0,Provider,"Okay okay um how is your ability to focus, are you taking medication what's happening that way."
7442.0,Patient,"i'm Am I am taking the adderall. And that definitely helps me focus. it's i've realized that my struggle. is like I can get myself stuck in bed before I can get myself to the kitchen to take it. And there's some times, where. I have actually had my boyfriend help with me and it was really helpful of him getting because he doesn't have an issue in the morning and he would get up and bring it to me so that I would just like kick in anyways and I wouldn't want to be in bed. But there were a few nights that I just didn't sleep well and then on top of it had a really bad dreams. And so, even though we handed it to me I just didn't even want to take it so now, I was just like a like a few days of just kind of being off and like. mentally in a fog, but I felt like I was choosing to do it that way, but I was like almost like a teenage version of i'm Moody so i'm going to be Moody."
298.0,Provider,"And we have to we all of us have to remember that adderall can treat depression, because it works on giving dopamine to the brain. domain gives you motivation, it gives you. Focus, and so, by not taking that you are choosing to kind of feed that."
7442.0,Patient,"Depression yeah. Like and it's it's one of those things where it's just so like I don't even know the right word because it just feels so foolish almost when you're like not in that state. And you talk about how aware, you are what you need to do to help yourself, but then in the moment you're just going to sit there quietly, whatever your thought you're stuck on and then just be like yeah I know it's there and i'm still not going to do it."
298.0,Provider,"So I know I need to lose weight well I. said yeah I know I need to lose weight, but i'll sit here and eat this you know."
7442.0,Patient,cheating exactly exactly.
298.0,Provider,"Well how's your how are you doing in the program as are you meeting your requirements, I have not opened your. heart."
7442.0,Patient,"yeah for the most part it's definitely been something where like I said with being social people have came over were like school started, so the socializing time turned more from afternoon and like lunchtime in summer to after work at like six o'clock time. So that I feel like definitely was something where I had to just adjust to my new schedule, because people would come over. And then that would get me totally off like I would be in the middle of a survey set my phone down to go just say hi but then get part of the conversation and then i'm like Oh well, that times past didn't even finish the survey and I can't get back into the group now so. embrace this. For that happen. Like i'm aware of it. not trying to accept it, try and work on it, but aware that, like, I was talking to amanda on our last appointment and made up like you know, trying to find ways of me being able to set the boundary you know, while people are even over here."
298.0,Provider,I hey is there anything I any questions you have anything I can help you with today.
7442.0,Patient,"um well when I was so with the trauma therapy. I go to that every Friday and they had me take you know, like the initial assessment, just like you guys did in the beginning. But then, after I think it was like once the panic attacks started to kind of almost be seemingly be kind of regular. that's one they had me do another assessment, and it was progress was made on the depression, the depression scale, but was raised on the anxiety one. uh huh and so that's when they just recommended to make an appointment with you to just bring that up and consider I don't know what the options are with that if any. If it like just so I can go like no way, like my choices are, if I have like worsening of this, and what that would mean okay."
298.0,Provider,"um so on our skills you you you're you're running middle of the road you're weren't running you know moderate anxiety and that can change depending on your circumstances. There is a medication out there, that is not addictive, it is not a benzodiazepine, it is not an anti histamine, it is a. blood pressure, medicine that lowers your heart rate and it lowers your blood pressure, when you start to get excited if you know you're going to go into something that's going to raise your blood pressure. And something you can take it. it's not high enough to do any like big damage of a blood pressure and bottom you out, although I wouldn't advise to get up and you know take it, and then go for a jog but if Then again, you probably could but don't just jump out of bed. i'm finding that people do really well on propranolol for intermittent anxiety, what are your thoughts have you ever tried it."
7442.0,Patient,"i've never heard of it before. So I know my like get get that like sent to me in some way, so I can look it up and not look up the wrong thing."
298.0,Provider,"Okay um let's see do I have your. email address. i'm sure I do, I can email you the name of it."
7442.0,Patient,yeah you.
298.0,Provider,would like the name and. look it up i've been having a lot of success with it and I love that it's not addicting it's not going to be it's not going to mess up your system mixed with alcohol that sort of thing.
7442.0,Patient,"yeah That was something to like I just like go like I don't know the whole knowledge of what it is you're going into, and that was like the main thing I think of the beginning of when I started coming to therapy with you guys was. Because it was one of my best friends that pointed out to me she's like you know, have you ever been looked at for ADHD she just might have it yourself it's, just like the only reason i'm saying that those because I do and that's why I know. I feel like i'm the same as you, but I almost want to just like pop one of these in your mouth, because you need to like calm down. And I was like oh man okay if she's saying that she's someone I know it's not going to be messing with me kind of thing and like a really nice i'm aware of how long she's had it for since a kid and all that. But then I was like maybe that is why I work so well in. This i'm like line of work and everything with special needs kids I was like I just get it."
298.0,Provider,You get it.
7442.0,Patient,didn't know I understood.
298.0,Provider,"I hear you. Alright Sabrina I sent that over to you look at it, email me back if you'd like to try a couple pills see if it calms you down when you've got to do things and it's not going to really work on the brain like a benzodiazepine or alcohol it's not going to do that."
7442.0,Patient,"Is there um. If it's something that's like. A panic attack moment would that be beneficial, or are there other options, if, like I or what would be the case of like I just get worse and that doesn't necessarily seem to. come out."
298.0,Provider,"going. In something it's not going to have the effect that out of banner sonics does. Having said that, I have people who have panic attacks, and this is what they choose, because fences have their own problems that come with them it's so easy to build tolerance to a benzo and then it doesn't work and then what have you got a situation that you can't do. Anything with. And so. You know. As your prescriber, I would like you to try something that's not addictive before we go down the road of addictive."
7442.0,Patient,But that would be like once it gets like to a more severe severe level type of things that's the route that it usually is.
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
7442.0,Patient,"Because that's what my one of my friends like the friend that I just said that has this you know she's the reason we're best friends basically she's like one of my only ones that's gone through similar type of traumas and same mountain we all just get it. And so that's what she takes but man like she's gone through a lot same time and she's older than I am so like she knows what she's doing she's gone through cancer, at the same time she could take. One, so the great okay. So I just. Like even before I had kids like I was are in the middle of like having them, I had to look up everything, so I appreciate you answering my questions."
298.0,Provider,"No i'm happy to, and we all we can do is try to figure out what it is that helps you."
7442.0,Patient,"Thank you, and a little quick note Do you remember that big fluffy dog that I said I talked about in group that we rescued. or not. This is him."
