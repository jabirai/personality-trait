Because I did. I didn't mention that it was like, if I have something that I feel like I can manage to therapy and being better I would prefer you that before just kind of. going straight to medication. So I still haven't taken an admin has done, you know because i'm also i'm scared to like. You know, eventually future for want to get off of like the withdrawals, and all that, even though it's a small dose it's something that kind of scares me some just like what if I didn't need it, that bad and no i'm just feeling like long term side effects. So yeah I think it's something that I think i'm gonna wait and see. Because I am not, I mean I have anxiety, but i'm not really a person that you know, has. Like panic attacks or stuff like that sometimes it does it has kind of affected me in my daily life. But I still don't know if it's like a severe to the medication. mm hmm so we go."

15816.0,Patient,"um. When I will likely have just kind of all right, and I was kind of anxious about being sick because I thought it was covered like. I feel like health is still one thing that kind of does. can trigger like things I um The other day I was kind of anxious and it was something that I haven't really been anxious about ever really but it's just stuff. From like my childhood because also my mom. But I also like some like kinda like. Memories that I had a hard time remembering because of. When we first moved to to the United States, I was we flew up my one of my dad's like families, families, housing, there is like a couple people living there. And my mom would leave me alone, like a lot of the time she had to go to work. And there was a lot of my own oh he's not my uncle like what uncle but he was married to my dad's cousins and I was just talking about um I would just feel uncomfortable around them all the time and, like. All these like kind of like feelings I don't know it's like a child, like of uneasiness and, for some reason I never really paid attention to any of them to like. Literally like last year is when it kind of started bringing up some things from my childhood I kind of like just didn't think we're okay or normal and I was just one here that sometimes like now it's kind of giving it because I just have a hard time remembering those things."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm so kind of like you have anxiety kinda remember remember about the past and what happened in the past, your childhood."
15816.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"sounds like there are some you know, maybe some disturbing things that you know you were you actually saw or maybe you know, like you're not true blood uncle you know but. Maybe he gave out a vibe that you just didn't feel comfortable around him. What other things, do you think might have happened in your childhood."
15816.0,Patient,"I i'm not sure I mean, I know I. I kind of in my talks my dad used to work a lot, he was gone wasn't the truck driver. And I feel like now. Now that i've grown up, I feel like I really saw my dad not being there did affect me a lot. As a child and. i'm not really sure like I feel like when I was a child, sometimes I when I think about it now, before again I didn't really get to stop but um. I now realize that I was just. kind of like wanting to grow up like really fast and the area of like sexuality, I would say I was like. I was really young I can remember, I was kind of there was a point where it kind of became obsessed with it not not questioning my sexuality, but just like you know in in that sort of Rio. And now that I look like, I think it was up until last year that I realized like I feel like I somewhat even almost like miss a lot of my childhood, because I, it was something that I was just always thinking of are always worried about and i'm. Now yeah so it's just those things have kind of made me think i'm a couple things."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're all kind of a little bit questioning your sexuality is that right."
15816.0,Patient,"No, it was i'm sorry I didn't mean it in the terms of your question, or I meant it in just like. Exploring yeah like always just always so worried about that as a child. I remember like going to my friends houses and. I just like always just was like when I would see like like their dads you shouldn't be like that, like, I was just really. It was just me I was always you know, I was just like. Sex so like that, and I was really when I was like since I was like four it's something that i've just I remember."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so just thinking about sex in general. All means you know, in terms of you, and another person or was it just thinking about sex."

759.0,Provider,yeah like is it a good memory and bad memory and something that you're not too sure what to think of.
15816.0,Patient,"I think it's something i'm not too sure what to think of I mean now that i'm older, I really I kind of think of like. I don't think it was. To normal that I was just so obsessed with that and, like new as much as I did, like since I was like for for as long as I can remember why I had these like thoughts. So yeah I think."
759.0,Provider,"You know sacks and your sexuality and he said, being a little bit obsessed with it. yeah okay. I think it's you know, like as far as it being you know, like sex is a big part of like who we are, you know non and our sexuality. Even at a young age we you know, like in terms are curious about you know sex in general are not to say that most for years, but sometimes when we were witness kind of like maybe. You know people doing a certain thing and and and in relation to like ourselves, it might make us feel a certain type of way. And then also I think it's exploring your sexuality to like in relation to other people, you know, like I don't think necessarily that's a bad thing, but as long as the way that makes you feel like if it makes you feel you know certain type of way. in regards to see yourself then yeah that's a problem are to be a problem. But how would you like to process through that is it kind of like something that you wish that you didn't do our it's just you want to know why he did it."
15816.0,Patient,"I mean, I think it's both I can Oh, I wish I wouldn't have done any one of like been something I was so worried about all the time in my life, but she is such a young age, because I feel like one of the biggest parts of my children, I feel that our Members. it's just really the most that I mean obviously a pretty normal childhood, but I feel like it was just a really big like to bigger part of my childhood. And yeah, I would like to know, you know. I mean I don't know if I if I did see something that, just like."
759.0,Provider,"that's why you know, I was thinking about maybe you did see something in your childhood, are something that might have been to you know, like early for you to see you know and yeah."
15816.0,Patient,"You know that Sir, I mean as much as like, why did it like I don't know if I was listening, I was like so influential that it just kind of like affected the next like. 16 years of my life so. You."

759.0,Provider,"Well, how can I help you process through diet is a modern kind of I want to talk about what my feelings are in relation to sex in general, you know what's your relationship with sex today hey that way."
15816.0,Patient,"I feel like it's kind of all, I mean it's not like how it wasn't much older products i'm still I have like a different idea of what it is no like you know I know what it is no but. I feel like it's a same time almost Council scene. Where it's just sometimes I do catch myself thinking about it, so a lot. But I know that, like i'm not like I don't have like i've haven't had like extreme. kind of like risky behavior with it, but. I do feel like I have something for myself is that could have been kind of dangerous just have sex yeah so I feel like maybe it's not the best. today."
759.0,Provider,"Not the best today yeah so sometimes what i'm hearing from you is sometimes you've been impulsive in the past, and in terms of sex."
15816.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"It happened, and maybe not paying yourself back in the best social interactions with other people. And yeah yeah make you question like Should I be doing this, or you know, like."

759.0,Provider,"Just the sex part okay okay. So it's not like you want to be in another relationship it's just that you just want to have more sex. yeah okay I got you. was definitely something that if you want to continue to explore within yourself like, if you want, you know from partner in terms of that you know, having sexual relationships with other people, you know, like, I think. It can be you know. Something that you can do you know, like, if you want to do that or incorporate that into your life, you know I feel like as long as you've been. Using protection and doing all those. Things you know not putting your. stuff and risky situation and managing like your impulses important I think it's okay. yeah."

Because you are young, you know, being in obviously the same thing to young man, you know just making sure that you're protected, you know and it's safe. yeah it was definitely something to keep on thinking about like in terms of do I want to break up with my partner or do you want to break up with him our Dean wants to you know stay in a relationship."
15816.0,Patient,"Is between the both I don't know that's my of do with the fact that i'm so pretty young and not. Everything has happened so quickly like having a baby and all that. So um. yeah i'm not i'm not too sure, so you."
759.0,Provider,"can always been on the back burner, you know that. Just one of kind of your innate kind of fight desires, you know, in terms of having sex with someone else or having different sexual relationships know like this right now just continue you don't have to make mean decisions that's why i'm coming at."
15816.0,Patient,You know yeah. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"And you are for young, I think, right now, just in terms of of right right now, the goal is, you know, to help you feel better and once you you start to have like improve your mental health, you can get back out there, you know people right."
15816.0,Patient,Good yeah yeah it's.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. Is there anything else we're childhood and dad you know you feel as though might have happened, you know to in order for you to start thinking about sex is actually young age."
15816.0,Patient,"I mean I kind of mentioned it to my mom those kind of thing about it is I talk to you about shoe so the she was a little scared in the past that. That same father, I was born. might have done something to me or something, because I mean I know he I mean he didn't get arrested because I guess, no one in the family said anything but. When he was like 30 something he did i'm. asleep with a 12 to 12 year old and he had a baby with her and he he ended up just kind of like ignoring it and everybody knew about it, but no one said anything so. I mean so she doesn't she saw that. yeah she's always following. him and his wife or or not I mean she didn't shadow really better relationship with his wife, because she was just. kind of should I call you my mom kind of when she was living there, and my uncle is not always been the best person, you should show is wasn't comfortable around him leaving me with them. So yeah I don't know that something is possible, I mean. I can't I don't have any memories of anything really I barely even have memories of living at all, I think the only memory have is the day that my sister was born in that's about it. yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah how old were you at the time when you're with uncle.
15816.0,Patient,I think goes to one. or two.
759.0,Provider,So it'd be really hard to kind of like think of you know that's a really young age to remember you know exactly what happened.
15816.0,Patient,yeah so I. don't have any money.
759.0,Provider,"Well, you know, like in, just in case you know that it's a possibility that that did happen right, you know it's possibility that it didn't happen, but since you bring it up, it needs me to you know believe that may be something did happen, you know, like. You just can't remember, and you know that's I know that's a probably disturbing, you know, to think that someone would have fired lady you at such a young age."
15816.0,Patient,"yo yo so. I kind of got screwed I mean now that it's that's that's like cuz I never thought about it, like, I think the first time I ever thought about it was maybe like a year ago. And at the same time I kind of almost try to like avoid it like i'm just like if it did happen like I don't even care to know. So yeah cuz I remember again like as a young age, when I was a child, I remember had feelings of like again, oh no it's like. For instance, or stuff like that I would since I was so worried about the curve so for us. I would, I knew I knew was wrong because you really like they were a little older, but at the same time, I like I almost wanted it to have it like I didn't really mind it. And I know for a lot of people like a lot of people, especially kids you know I feel like some people like might see like oh that's sourcing that one of the worst things that happened to you, but I I didn't think like that I actually wanted it to happen so just. I don't know why I was having those feelings."
759.0,Provider,yeah why you're having us yeah. How what age were you when you first.
15816.0,Patient,um. I think I was. Maybe.
759.0,Provider,And was the person that you're having sex. With your same age.
15816.0,Patient,"um yes oh. No, you think you have he was like 16."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15816.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,Okay. So you're like 12 or 13 when you first had sex and then did you stay with the same guy for a while and continue or did you meet him other guys to have sex with.
15816.0,Patient,"No, I did not see was just just come over to other people."
759.0,Provider,This other people yeah.
15816.0,Patient,yeah I remember when I was 15 I did end up. doing it with some I think it was 28.
759.0,Provider,"or 2928 29 year old. that's pretty you know by the age gap, you know. aware of how did that make you feel being so in being on someone who was older do. separately."
15816.0,Patient,"It didn't make me feel really anyway, I mean I was kind of just happy because there were a lot older, but those buddy."
759.0,Provider,say that again you're kind of happy that.
15816.0,Patient,i'm sorry I said it didn't really make me feel any kind of were just again I was just happy that they're older.
759.0,Provider,"young girl there okay. Okay. Well, you know, like i'm sure you're aware of. kind of. The laws about having sex with my nurse, who are still under age, do you feel like he he took advantage of you are, it was a mutual. Agreement evaluation."
15816.0,Patient,"i'm sorry i'm just reading feminism only another. i'm not sure you hold it was so I don't know if that's gonna happen. again at santana what i'm saying is I was just kind of want three years since I was a child, work I don't really care, you went to the State like. I don't know if it's just coming like i'm just continuing denying your phone just avoiding issue that like is further than that, but I don't really care if even if she was like I just don't it's not even not even cared about."
759.0,Provider,care about it.
15816.0,Patient,So yeah I don't know if it's because i'm just trying to avoid. Solving an issue or just come on wanting to accept that it's a problem.
759.0,Provider,"That what happened when you, you know being 15 and I was 2829. yeah. Okay, well, we don't have to go too much into it, you know I don't want to you know overly like bringing you with you know thinking about these things, because it can be heavy sometimes."
15816.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah so i'm like if there's a possibility that something to happen in my childhood I just I don't even know if I like. If I really care I don't know if it's just because i'm kind of scared to solve the issue or script accepted but it's just kind of like mentality that i've had for a long term, but I know it's not like a healthy one. yeah yeah."
759.0,Provider,"You know, like if it did happen, that means that you have significant trauma in your childhood. You know, being violated, you know, like and I know you probably don't want to go to that place to think about that, but there's a possibility of you, having. You know, gone through a traumatic event, you know, and that will need to be true, but for right now, I just want you. To you know, maybe in order to kind of like express what happened in the past, either to do some journaling you know and just kind of like write it out, you know, like in terms of how you feel about it and not can help you kind of like explore maybe the past does that make sense."
15816.0,Patient,"yeah um yeah i've kind of tried to journal I don't know I don't know why it's like journaling can because I know like I think last week. I was having anxiety and it was kind of bad, so I said okay i'm gonna sit down and journal, and maybe this will help me but it just kind of makes me anxious. I realized i've tried journaling in the past we're not many times, but I have. And some of that and also just makes me more anxious to like see like you know."
759.0,Provider,But you wrote down.
15816.0,Patient,"Issues written down and just having to see them I don't know if it should mean that i'll just like I kind of just again just kind of want to stay in like avoiding it and not only to like see what's face it see what's going on, so yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah it might be kind of like you want to avoid maybe your emotions a lot better right. yeah yeah you know wanting to you know explore. express yourself that's It makes you look inches. yeah yeah.
15816.0,Patient,"Yes, sir."
759.0,Provider,"Well, we can table journaling and you know, like. In terms of that. But having like a healthy outlet that's why i'm kind of thinking ways that we can come up with a healthy outlet for you to be able to express yourself and maybe it just it's just going to have to be darby right now, you know. You wanted to express yourself more."
15816.0,Patient,"yeah I think yeah therapy, I mean I feel like i'm just yeah it just does help to can talk about it because it's only I, like, I guess, I never really taught me up until recently I kind of somewhat tillman one I mean I haven't told her all my exact things but. yeah I know like even in previous therapy sessions I don't kill, something I ever brought up. Any I mean it was all just something that finally started like coming into my thoughts will your coastal yeah there's no."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. How do you want to kind of reframe what happened in your childhood, do you want to say to yourself. You know blank I had a new, you know, like a. My past, you know, like, how can we reframe it like in my past I you know might have witness or been you know, like something might have happened to me i'm not too sure why and me, we just try changing the narrative for yourself does that make sense."
15816.0,Patient,um as in like kind of.
759.0,Provider,"Put into in perspective or maybe accepting something from your past like you know, like I said, the fact that. You know this might have happened to me, you know I might have had someone who viably give me or maybe I witness event that was kind of traumatizing to me and therefore you know, like i'm not to share, about your bicep the fact that this might have happened to me."
15816.0,Patient,"um. yeah, I guess, I could put it like like just kind of put it in yeah like just accepting it, I mean it's hard, because I don't have any memory of it. At all it's just kind of just a feeling, but I don't have any memory to like really say for sure, so if the comics in order and yeah I guess just accepting it and kind of trying to like. kind of come to terms, my feelings because yeah I feel like for a long time, and even up till now, I just don't have that like I don't really care. I just like if it happened, I don't you know I don't know and I yeah I know it's not the best way to like feel about you know, a big emotional that and. So I think accepting."
759.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
15816.0,Patient,"i'm just kind of. Think of I think the biggest part is just kind of or I just want to know why it was just thinking so much good. To see everybody start from there, and finally start taking on issues that. brought me later on, because of thinking about so much."
759.0,Provider,yeah use it for a why.
15816.0,Patient,"yeah so I can finally start understanding myself and my feelings and why I just kind of been like that, for a long time."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. Well it's hard to get to the why because it's kind of like hard to you know bank on your memory you can't really remember you know exactly what was what happened. But we can dance around the why meeting that we can you know say like maybe mean something did happen, and maybe just as a reason why you know I felt this way in my childhood, you know into my adolescence into my teen years you know felt like hyper sexual you know. When it came to you know my relationships with other people or were are in relation to other people."
15816.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah. yeah so. yeah I don't know I don't think I don't know if i'll ever get a why what happened. is just kind of train it's just something I know is something that has been a big part of my life, and I feel like so it's a lot of issues that I have kind of that so. that's why it's on, I would like to one day just. kind of accept and move on from so that doesn't affect me so much."
759.0,Provider,yeah. And what ways does it affect you today.
15816.0,Patient,"Because i'm still. kind of do be avoided a lot. i'm just kind of like again my relationship with people. I was I put myself in like not the situation, so we kind of. risky. we're kind of feeling like that's. kind of most important thing in in relationships to the primary. Care to have a relationship is just to support that I hear about and honestly that's kind of the only thing that. i'm worth at some point so yeah."
759.0,Provider,This is my thing that you're worth.
15816.0,Patient,yeah sometimes that's kind of like. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"that's your only worth like sex. well. How can we kind of like we framed out, you know, like a little bit you know, like I know that's how you feel you know, like you're only worth you know, sex, you know, but also on the flip side you can be but worth so much more. As a person."
15816.0,Patient,yeah it's just it's it's been hard to get.
759.0,Provider,Something started out.
15816.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Well, you know just to give you some psycho education, you know people like going back to what I was saying, people with kind of like trauma and your background, you know that significant, will you know have distorted views be we about them themselves are.
