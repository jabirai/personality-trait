7783.0,Patient,Hello.
416.0,Provider,i'm great how are you.
7783.0,Patient,hey i'm doing pretty good how you doing.
416.0,Provider,hi I haven't seen you for a couple weeks so what's been going on.
7783.0,Patient,"Okay right away, I have a confession I have not done my homework yet i'm so sorry I know it only hurts me it doesn't hurt you, but I just wanted to say that, and it wasn't intentional. Every time I remembered it, I was like in bed or driving or something so i'm just but i'm going to make it happen. It was it was kind of a like a whirlwind of sorry my dogs doing something it's just as busy, but I do want to do it. Okay, so there you have it um but yeah. A lot going on i'm. Really quick before I derail off of you know lots of different things like I do today, I really wanted to talk about. Well, I want to talk about my daughter um and then look kind of balancing time with her. And let me hear you."
416.0,Provider,know that was me sorry.
7783.0,Patient,"just want to make sure that i'm giving her the time that she needs, because I feel like she's kind of struggling. With the transitions of like. Her dad moving, and I mean, whatever else it might be. And then."
416.0,Provider,"Oh that's right, you said her dad that he took a job in another State right."
7783.0,Patient,"yeah and it's been like he's been coming back every other weekend and. it's been pretty steady like he's only missed a couple weekends, but every time she comes back from the weekend that she's with him, she seems to act out like a lot, like the first two days, and then I I just I feel like I need some help balancing out. Making sure she's getting the time she needs, but then also like giving some time to my boyfriend and then also like giving some time to like my best friend who I live with, because it seems like a constant struggle of like. i'm letting one down after the other, like. I, and I know it's important to have friends and. And I live with my best friend, but we don't get a lot of like. One on one time, so we can't like talk about everything, want to talk about. And so i've gone through the. The whole like they're both like jealous of each other and i'm just like I love you've also got to be in the middle of."
416.0,Provider,"Your your friend or jealous of each other, not my daughter my."
7783.0,Patient,"Like my boyfriend and my best friend and then it's like at the same time I you know I want to be a mother, first I want to make sure, everything is put first for heather. um, but I think I just wanted to talk about it because it's been. it's been like an issue. I don't know for a while now, it like not isn't like an everyday struggle, but then every time I like something like that happens, like. I need to ask somebody for help on this, but yesterday I had to tell my boyfriend because we went with me to. We had. like an annual. party for my work last night and then he's like so am I gonna follow you home tonight and stay over i'm like well. Because I had heather and I said well heather's just. Not I don't know like I have my are adequate or bad, it was like really late already and i'm like she hasn't been doing really well like behavior wise. And so, he was like I could tell that he was disappointed that he get didn't get more time with me. So I I sent him a text this morning and I said hey, I just wanted to let you know that you know I don't like to cut our time. either, but I feel like heather's going through some stuff right now, and I said that I was going to have my therapy appointment and see if I can get some help like on on awesome advice on how to juggle everything."
416.0,Provider,"So what is, first of all, what are her behaviors that she's coming home with what's going on."
7783.0,Patient,"Right okay so she she has a with a huge attitude right now she's been she's great for like everybody, except for me i'm gonna i'm sorry and open the door really quick, so the dog out."
416.0,Provider,No problem.
7783.0,Patient,"So. yeah she's been really good for like everybody like she's she went camping with my dad and my stepmom. Just this last weekend, she was supposed to be there Friday to like Sunday afternoon, but my step mom like twisted her ankle or something so they had to come back home on Saturday night. yeah and my daughter was like I was in Arizona, I went to Arizona, this weekend, so my daughter she facetime me and she was like mommy i'm so scared because they have to take me to. grandma's grandpa's was just my step mom's parents house, while they go to the emergency room and it was already like. I don't know like 830 or something, and she was like really scared i'm like honey it's going to be okay because i'm going to see you tomorrow it's not going to be a full day before I you know I have you back. And, but yeah like the scary thing is new, like she's not she's usually not like that so ended up actually calling justin my boyfriend. and saying hey do you have Charlotte tonight his daughter. And he said yeah and I said what was going on and he's like Oh, I can pick her up and we can like they can have a slumber, party or something so we did, and then heather felt a lot better. Great yeah sorry totally derail don't think that was important."
416.0,Provider,But you need a response is fantastic great you validated her feelings yeah. He needed you to respond and you did.
7783.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely felt a lot better, especially since I was in another state, and I couldn't really do anything. But she's been when she's like alone with me. She doesn't like alone attitude and it's like she's constantly trying to argue about things that are necessary to argue about um but I I recently made like a post on this like parenting group on Facebook and it was like it had to do with. Briefly talked about these like energy profiling this like book that I read maybe."
416.0,Provider,"Like she said, well, I think you. did mention it actually."
7783.0,Patient,"Something like that it's like a community that. Then knows a lot about like a lot about the different profiles and stuff so I just kind of said what was going on and like if anybody can offer advice you know, let me know because I feel like i'm so frustrated and I just don't. want to do the wrong thing, but like yelling doesn't help the talking calmly doesn't help, and so one of the responses I got was like. It sounds like you, are her only like safe place and that's where she can let it all out, and I was like she's like you know kind of take it as a compliment, I was like wow that actually changed everything that i've been thinking about. It sounds like so."
416.0,Provider,I meant to mention.
7783.0,Patient,"This via I was like wow I don't know like i've never heard of that before, but I feel like that makes perfect sense. So when you know i'm like putting her to bed that's when she gets like all her like frustrations out because she's not embarrassed to let it out in front of me i'm guessing um but at the same time I don't want to be mad at me, you know so. Like that the response was saying it sounds like you know she's upset about whatever it is like maybe just changes in her life and, hopefully, you can just kind of. get to the bottom of it, but I think that's where I need your help, because she doesn't want to tell me what's bothering her Maybe she doesn't even know."
416.0,Provider,"She might not know. So I think it's um. she's come to you because you're a safe place like like your person on Facebook said. So it's a fine line right you want to continue to be her safe place that's really important that she always knows that she has that because fast forward to when she's 17 years old, and she. Somebody pressuring her to do I think she doesn't want to do you just want to be your safe place then right because you want her. To come to you with that, so you want to stay that safe person. doesn't mean you know, a free for all right it doesn't mean that she has the right to yell at you or have give attitude to you. it's just so what what you want to make sure that you're conveying is I love you i'm here for you i'm never going to judge you it's okay to get all your feelings out. But what it's not okay to do is to try to hurt me in the process. uh huh so. i'm here. i'm going to hold this line for you, we gotta love you i'm going to be here and i'll sit with you and i'll just make space. For whatever you're going through and your feelings your emotions whatever you can talk to me about them or not, but it's great that you're expressing them and i'm here for that. Okay, but but expressing them by being rude to you or mean to you or hurt trying to hurt you that's where you draw the line right it's like. You can aim this in lots of places but it's important to aim it where it's supposed to go or in some sort of neutral place right take it out through exercise take it out through journaling take it out through. screaming into your pillar or whatever, but you can't take it out on me i'll make space for your feelings i'll sit here with you, I will love you through them, but you can't take it out on me. Okay, that makes sense."
7783.0,Patient,yeah it does. yeah I totally remember that and. i'll try that tonight.
416.0,Provider,"yeah it's um. I mean how nice, is it to have somebody make space for just whatever it is you're going through like it's okay it's just okay it's okay to go through what you're going through. Right you're having a reaction to something I don't know what it is, you might not know what it is that's also OK it honestly at her age, it could be the start of some raging hormones that are going on, like we just don't know right. 11 right."
7783.0,Patient,Now she's she'll be seven next month.
416.0,Provider,"Oh that's right, no, no, no yeah. nevermind nevermind oh that's right I forgot you had yeah, so I do this with my son all the time and he's the same age he's he's like six months or eight months younger but similar and he he is a big personality with big failings. And and i've had to do this with him too it's just like listen dude. i'm here for you and i'm just going to hold on to you or sit next to you or whatever and keep you safe, while you're having whatever you're having going on and it's okay. it's cool to have this experience it's totally fine it's great feel your feelings i'm here for it take it out on me."
7783.0,Patient,yeah he. Does he seem to understand like what you're saying.
416.0,Provider,"Over time, he has yeah absolutely now he's like gotten, to the point, because i've been doing with this with him for a long time now he's gotten, to the point where he'll just tell me mommy I have to go feel my feelings. Like go in his room and rage or do whatever it is, he needs to do and then afterwards he's like oh i'm better now."
7783.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, I like that I wish I mean I feel like that wasn't an option for your kids when I was kid you know."
416.0,Provider,"gosh no not when we were kids, especially not when I was a kid i'm older than you but i'm no no talked about this stuff that my gosh like we all need to do that right. it's so important for us to just get in touch with whatever it is we're going through get it out if we don't get it out get stuck let's just normalize feeling it making space for it and moving through it, so you can get to the other side let's just normalize that."
7783.0,Patient,"That kind of makes me think of when I i'm pretty sure I briefly told you that I, I feel like I have a meltdown or basically a tantrum every time I see my mom and I. was thinking about that the other day i'm like well, maybe it just happens because it's never been resolved, but she's never given me the conversation that I wanted you know. So I mean it just might happen every time."
416.0,Provider,When I.
7783.0,Patient,get over it.
416.0,Provider,yeah. Sometimes you. need to do it.
7783.0,Patient,"But at least I am aware of it, and then I can yeah i'll definitely offer that to my daughter every time it happens."
416.0,Provider,"And and yeah with the boundary of you can't destroy property and you're not going to take it out on me. here's some healthy ways to get through it, but by all means get through it experience it."
7783.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"yeah the. yeah I mean we I don't know if you, it was like that in your family but in like in my generation, and it was very much like. Oh you're crying no stop crying or i'll give you something to cry about right like toxic messages like."
7783.0,Patient,"yeah everybody I. know, as I said, my parents says that to me."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
7783.0,Patient,"I mean i've heard it said to I mean my boyfriend said it to his daughter to my daughter, you know he's like my mom he always has the exclusive well my mom just this way I turned out Okay, and then I think."
416.0,Provider,Did you. Not you know I don't i'm not gonna say out loud i'm like.
7783.0,Patient,"No, you don't have a lot of issues, I mean everybody does. But."
416.0,Provider,Right so let's just give it some space let's just honor what people are feeling and obviously it's the stupidest thing to say to you right because it's like obviously she already has something to cry about otherwise she wouldn't be cry. let's just not go there okay.
7783.0,Patient,"I know okay that makes sense hmm. It seems like. What do you think about like and I tried to limit the time that heather does this, but like she has like in the morning, sometimes she'll have like her. Like a tablet with like kids YouTube and then she does have like her own Nintendo switch but like that is I mean it's parental controls so like it only allows us like a certain amount of time and then she doesn't even use it every day, I want to do it if, like. I don't know like she finished her homework, you want to play for a little bit cool but like it seems like every time she does it just like so cranky afterwards is that it's normal rate for kids to like pull off electronics and just be like super rude and cranky."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I have that same struggle um. yeah I. I mean, yes, yes it's normal it's normal because they're not really getting their needs, met during the time that they're on devices right it's an. escape for them and. it's a fantasy world and their brains love it, and then they get ripped away and they feel a little crazy and they feel some withdrawal, you took their little drug away."
7783.0,Patient,Totally makes sense.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean it's it's normal and. I. don't know I see it, and I don't know if i'm right on this, so please take this as gospel."
7783.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"But I my approach to this has been. When I noticed that i'll be like hey if you, if this is your behavior and your like your expression every time you get off devices, then my solution is going to be no more devices."
7783.0,Patient,I have said that.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so like if you can't function well after devices, then i'm gonna just take it away. yeah it's like it's clearly not good for you. Under these circumstances. I haven't had to do it, yet, but I know you can tell me how it works for you i'll tell you how it works for him."
7783.0,Patient,"Okay yeah she just and then as she's playing to every time like she dies in the game, just like. Come on, like she sounds like a full on adult like so frustrated about it and, like. I mean I kind of do that when I play against, but like she's a kid. But I think, maybe when she starts doing that i'm like all right it's time for break."
416.0,Provider,"yeah i've had to do that for sure to okay so here's The lesson right now you're frustrated you're upset. A lot of times you can take a break and come back to things that frustrate you, you know, like it's okay come back with a fresh perspective you'll get to the next level, I mean I don't know I probably use it as like a learning opportunity but it doesn't always work."
7783.0,Patient,yeah yeah i've tried that but i'll keep trying.
416.0,Provider,"I and like I said i'm going through the same thing, so I don't have the answers."
7783.0,Patient,that's okay.
416.0,Provider,that's totally fine you know a lot about child development and brains and that sort of thing without still knowing how to this. Just guesswork.
7783.0,Patient,yeah just learn as you go.
416.0,Provider,john it's tough and it's okay also that we don't always get it right right. Right.
7783.0,Patient,"I hope so, I mean every."
416.0,Provider,Time i'm like.
7783.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,How could we possibly hold ourselves to that expectation.
7783.0,Patient,I don't know just I just want to be the best I can be but.
416.0,Provider,"yeah and you are and that's Okay, I mean you're asking the right questions you're connected to other moms like you're a very present mom."
7783.0,Patient,I can work.
416.0,Provider,"on it, I mean the fact that you're even asking questions indicates how much you care."
7783.0,Patient,"It was sometimes you know, so I worry about that because, and I thank you for saying that makes me feel better. And like making sure don't you hear me OK, so my best friend she I mean she noticed this the struggle that I have to, because we all are so and her girls are 13 and 14. And they're like they're very, very well behaved and you know I see what did you do like what she goes, you know it's one thing I can really pride myself on is. Just how well behaved my kids are and she's like it, we were very, very strict you know, in the beginning, and she says look, if you want, I can. Like kind of. I don't know like intervene when heather's acting a certain way if it's in front of everybody, you know sort of like a supernanny situation. And she's like it's going to seem harsh it for she's like Obviously it would never hit her or anything like that, but i'm very good like letting him know without raising my voice just being stern and i'm like yeah we can definitely try that you know. We have it hasn't happened yet, because I was in Arizona, and we weren't even home but um. yeah but. Then they."
416.0,Provider,offering you some backup.
7783.0,Patient,yeah and I said yeah I would love to try that and see what happens so you think that that's a decent approach.
416.0,Provider,"to it, why not."
7783.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,always say no later I mean.
7783.0,Patient,Just yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I think it's totally your judgment it's like what do you think is right um you know heather best You know yourself, you know your best friend and. And it doesn't sound like you're struggling so maybe even just having a backup voice. yeah just a feel. Good about yourself, you know."
7783.0,Patient,"yeah but about that too is that work Party that I went to you last night. They just have it once a year for Christmas and I didn't really want to go, because I haven't been feeling great about work in general and then. i'm like oh I should probably make an appearance, or something and I asked my friend on my K, are you guys still okay to watch heather while I you know stopped by the party. And then she was like overtaxed and she was saying this whole thing about like well you know I hate to say no, but heather's behavior and yada yada and I just don't think it's the best time to go, and it was it just made me feel like. And I know she didn't mean it intentionally, but I just felt bad for even like considering going at that point is like oh yeah heather needs to be right now. But I also have her the majority of the time to it's not like i'm going to miss out on time with her, so I was just going back and forth my head. And I was talking to my my dad about it and i'm like no I don't have a sitter anymore, is it but we'll just bring your right here, so you can stop by i'm like okay sure, and then I just ended up doing that, and then I went and it came back and I just was like. The party sucks didn't want to be there at all my gosh and even gone as a waste gas, but now i'm like did I do the wrong thing for heather it's like everything's gonna be fine. It wasn't that long. I don't know like I take I really worried about judgment from other people, and I know it shouldn't, but when it's about me as a mother i'm just like oh my God makes me a second guess everything."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I hear that montclair. yeah. I mean you are heather's mother and you know her better and to some extent, you know, hopefully we can get you, to the point where you're trusting yourself a little more to just trust like I do. I have her best interest at heart, I know her best i'm gonna trust what I know is right about this. A little while."
7783.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I believe that to be true, but someday you might too."
7783.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"So um when you do spend time with heather cuz I know you have a lot of time with her, is it like quality time is it like. Or is it like you're doing your thing and she's doing her thing."
7783.0,Patient,"I know we do things together, like we'll go for a walk or we'll. we'll do like was like color what does she like to do. Right yeah just stuff like that real watch something together um."
416.0,Provider,I know you had homework. In her when she has a lot of like direct you know direct connection time with you do you notice a difference.
7783.0,Patient,"He like in the middle of when we're doing something like that she's super sweet and she's having fun. But it also feels like a lot of the nights is just they go by so quickly. Well, I mean like Mondays and Tuesdays are our best days, because I get to go I don't work, so I could pick her up right after school, but like on the days that I do or. It feels like I just I pick her up go home, make sure her homework done, you know dinner shower and in bed there's not a lot of time for other things you know. But yeah I mean like on Mondays and Tuesday, she definitely seems like she. she's happier. So that's good."
416.0,Provider,yeah and let's just recognize that this is a really big change for her right we're like going back and forth seeing her dad every other weekend I mean that's a big transition for a kid at this age. yeah normal that you would also see some behaviors as a result of them.
7783.0,Patient,"Okay, and then her dad is coming home. On the 17th and then he he's actually staying the whole time until like January 3 which he originally asked if you could have heather the whole time i'm like i'm. I don't like I like I kind of get it, but then i'm like I don't think that would be good for heather so i'm like no let's we'll just keep like our 5050 schedule, you know so he'll. she's going to be with him, like every other weekend and then there'll be like a couple Mondays and Tuesdays when she's with him. and hopefully that's okay i'll see."
416.0,Provider,"Well it's Nice that you know I mean part of what's going on might just be that she misses him, and she she might want some more dedicated time with him so."
7783.0,Patient,"yeah my. name is changing her. She accept she doesn't want to go there, she says she doesn't want to, but do you think maybe she's saying that maybe thinking it's makes me feel better or something."
416.0,Provider,or she. doesn't want the transition because transitions are hard on kids at that age. yeah knows.
7783.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,could be a lot of different things.
7783.0,Patient,"So i'm. Like about my my boyfriend and. I don't know I didn't want to say about that I just. I don't like so do you think heather would probably be like we normally don't Have a nice chat room. So, and she has her own bed, and everything too, but a couple of times i've had just been like over and like she's cool she she likes them a lot more when his daughter is not around. But there's been a couple times, where we've like. she'll go to bed and help them are like watching movie downstairs but then he'll just like sleep over you know, and I mean obviously nothing happens in the same room i'd be horrible but. I don't you think that's like not appropriate, is that we're like i'm just I just thought of it and it's only happened a couple times."
416.0,Provider,Have you ever talked to her about how she feels about it.
7783.0,Patient,"um no but I definitely can but she's at she's just she's asked him before like justin sleep over tonight and he's like Okay, you know and. She doesn't seem upset but now i'm like thinking like because he asked you know, he should last night and i'm like no, you know it's too late, I have to put her bed, but then i'm like well, what about when he asked again like is it."
416.0,Provider,"I didn't. Talk to her about it, I think you should talk to her about it, I mean a lot of people would feel really uncomfortable with that and a lot of people would judge that and i'm not one of them, but I think it's really individual. and I because I don't know all of you guys very well like it's hard to really say. I think you know you're pretty tuned into her and she's giving you any reason to to worry that that's like really uncomfortable for her that that's one thing. Obviously, like if there were sexual activity happening, while she's right there that's a different thing but it sounds like that's."
7783.0,Patient,Not never know.
416.0,Provider,yeah just like just sleeping then. I would say talk to her about it and see what she's comfortable with.
7783.0,Patient,"OK, I will um. That made me think of another like sheet lately she's been acting like she's just like afraid of everything like. Oh yeah, this is what we should definitely work on at some point, but she she asked me she's like I feel like she's like a. daredevil at her like she's used to not be afraid of anything, and you know once she gets on the roller coaster she's loving it wants to go over and over and over. But as a lately like she will not be in a room by herself, she will follow me to every room. Even my dad like when he has picked her up from school he's like I can't get anything done because she has to follow me to every room, you know, and whoever watches her same thing um and it's really hard at bedtime because. She wants me to like cuddle with her while she falls asleep, and you know i'm like thinking Oh, you know I definitely do this before she's so old and she won't want to anymore, you know so."
416.0,Provider,I buried in.
7783.0,Patient,"Your head, and all I get in her tiny little bed next to her and so she falls asleep, you know I can get up and do whatever I need to do. But sometimes I don't have time to do that sometimes I need to do things when she's asleep, but she like I can't leave the room without her freaking out and I just. I can't live like that, and I feel like i've made a mistake by. You know, starting to do that, like it started once we moved into this House like I. I didn't want her to feel like the change was scary or whatever, because she is to share a room with Charlotte. So they had their own little like. Girls room together and we will be able to say good night and walk out and like crack the door, but now it's like money don't go until I fall asleep, and sometimes you fall asleep and I end up falling asleep and I wake up at like. midnight and i'm like damn it I didn't brush my teeth, like, I have to get rid of bed now it's all late. yeah I just need to. Stop I don't want to be scared and I don't know how to. Make that stop happening."
416.0,Provider,"So what if you did it if that's what you want to do what if you did it as a transition where instead of snuggling in bed with her you you stayed in the room, with her for a week, but like sat in a different chair, or something. And then you know and being honest with her about like okay we're not going to snuggle because this is what's happening, and I still have things I have to do. But i'll but i'll be right here, I don't want you to be scared. And do that and kind of slowly transition your way out of the room you something you could try."
7783.0,Patient,"Okay. So. Do you think that that would help with like, how can I help her. With the."
416.0,Provider,With the daytime stuff.
7783.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
416.0,Provider,"So she I mean usually, when that happens, it means they really there it's there her way of asking for attention right it's her asking her way of asking for more time more attention. And I think you give it to her, and you can even call it out like hey i'm noticing that you're following me around a lot and that seems like you don't really want to be by yourself, you need some extra attention right now."
7783.0,Patient,well.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then you can even say like here's how much time I have like I have. 45 minutes, what do you want to do for 45 minutes let's get let's get all your attention, I am totally you're like you know totally undistracted. And then, after that, the expectation is that you go do something, you know, on your own."
7783.0,Patient,"I mean it's gotten so pointing to the gotten so bad, to the point where. Last week we went I had to get some gas and she's my mommy I want to come out with you and i'm like no babe like i'm gonna be right next to the car the whole time, you can see me the whole time. And she's like no like she's like started like freaking out is like I really want to come on with her i'm like no other, you need to stay right in the car there's no reason to come out like it takes just two seconds, you know and i'm like. Put the gas in the car and then i'm like opening her doors I bet i'm right here like it she's like I still want to get out my other sick i'm scared and she goes i'm scared of what i'm just scared i'm scared like she cannot give me an answer as to what she's scared of. Even when i'm standing right next to the car."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7783.0,Patient,"But like, if I were to go run into like. The convenience store or something which. I just can't do it is just like an imaginary situation. She would just go absolutely crazy like yeah like she acts, the way, like she would give herself a heart attack. Like almost hyperventilating i'm like. Why, and I honestly think that this started one time because. I don't know if the same exact issue, but like before but there's one thing that happened that I think is the root of all of it and one time we were at my aunt and uncle's house for the fourth of July. And I took her to the bathroom and we it was their new house, so you know the bathroom and then we were trying to open the door to get out and it was like stuck. And I was like I was super calm to make sure like I can't figure out what's going on this door knob you know and then she starts panicking and i'm like heather it's gonna be fine like I have my phone. I just text somebody to come open it and then you know they just showed us how to do it, but she was after that she she won't shut a door, all the way. Those the bathroom and it's like craft open and then we go like to the bathroom like in a public restroom where it's like a stall she's like, can you please not shut it all the way, please i'm like no other like it's, just like the little goofy lock, you know it's not like anything major. So she hates that she hits elevators now. I feel like one instance like really messed her up. And it wasn't even that traumatizing I wasn't nervous about it but i'm an adult so I guess that's different but."
