And I got to fight with my kid because he was being rude demand I. don't know. Just pissed me off. That didn't go good night. And so okay now, but that was like ptsd trigger. My night, all I get is just like that repetitive thought, like the same thing happen or. thing with the state and then anytime something bad happens and go into this loop phase. Okay, and I can't stop thinking about it or. it's really making me cocoa. Okay okay."

527.0,Provider,Okay.
11786.0,Patient,"For a long time just letting things kind of. Dell but um. So, I guess, he was a really difficult child to raise to. embarrass me it take him in the public and even want something and behold i'm going to be square square minute screaming and everybody think kidnapping him and like two different times I got stopped by the people, I thought I was stealing my kid I had to get. So I was like i'm never taken him in public, again, I mean it was so bad. And such bad add and he was so hyperactive. yeah I was that was pretty depressing."

Shall I send and money. And then he stopped blowing up on me and and that's when it all right as well it's like you know you gotta.

527.0,Provider,yeah.

527.0,Provider,"Where their things said on both ends that. Probably probably shouldn't have been said. Okay, so once you kind of cooled off what how did you go back and approach things with him."
