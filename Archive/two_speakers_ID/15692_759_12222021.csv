759.0,Provider,"Like I, I do have."
15692.0,Patient,"experience, I do have some clinical I have a lot of field experience case case carrier so but one on one sessions, I can I can do pretty damn good at that now. First At first it was nerve racking as my flower inside a room, this is different than when I can't go for a walk and you can talk to me i'm like wait a minute. As time goes on, if they want to go for a walk we don't have to sit in a room plan well go for a walk let's go away i'm starting to catch on to this stuff like nothing has to be so traditional. If the kiddo says, I feel really uncomfortable in this room, like it's okay let's go for a walk like wait a minute I can. So that's my job is to put them in a comfortable space to where they can open up and not do anything traditional like they say I don't feel comfortable in this room, I want to be somewhere else okay let's go. To go into the bathroom by myself scares me i'm not used to this yet my okay i'll help you out i'll go with you, but once we hit the door that's it right.

759.0,Provider,Like I.
15692.0,Patient,"Do. I just go with it and that's what i've been trying to do with the mood tracker like just go with like if you're pissed off feel that feeling let it run through. Express nice you. don't hold a dead and just keep walking and that's what my logical brain beneath you know these scenarios to process the acre do it if it takes it on their 510 minutes, just to be like you know what this makes no sense, then find it takes 510 minutes."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,Just not putting all this pressure on me of like figure it out now doing.
759.0,Provider,doing now yeah. yeah I know it's hard for you to go with the flow sometimes right.
15692.0,Patient,"It, to be honest i'm. My husband is more of the schedule person. And he unlike hey relax for five minutes late we're five minutes late before I was like that i'm like let's go let's go come on get in the car i'll be upset if we're like five minutes late. But I coulda it's not a meeting it's not a client is not a life baby we're five minutes late five minutes late."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So i'm just trying. To to you know, be able to do that, you know you don't have to be so, you know, on the you know with that and just being able to just relax slow but."
15692.0,Patient,"Just it even with the work schedule, sometimes I realized, I have another client in 20 minutes i'm like wait a minute I have a client here needs my help either the work knows what's going on, or they give me more time in between clients for me to handle this stuff appropriately."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,"And that's where I start to read English job sucks and the cutting out, and let me rephrase this this company I work for sucks. I remember i'm like hey can I get door dash deliver to the client's House like no you can't do that, why is that because i've been working six hours straight with no lunch break you guys been putting me back to back with clients So can I order food at the client's house at eat. that's against the regulations of our company like oh i'm leaving early because i'm hungry. So I go you still have to be there for another hour, am I eating kiss my ass you can fire me now or i'm going to go get food it's up to you. And that's Another thing I. People are like oh you work at a house I bet that super easy like, though. These damn parents think we're babysitters we always tell them, you need sit at the table with us, you see what we're doing so, when we're gone. You know what to do with this with the behavior or when you give us or they're not telling me what they want, like whoo hey on. Everything here the communication cars are here, you need to train, we need to train your brain to do it that and they never do they always leave the room to go do laundry or go do run errands yourself oh my no. No, not no not a babysitter not getting close to one. Another aba homework. i'll never do homecare again that's."
759.0,Provider,"Not yeah So what do you want, in your next dog, you know by what do you want to be doing."
15692.0,Patient,"One on one talk therapy group therapy if I need to do a BA work so down for that it's just not home cases, because a thin. yeah then everyone starts to think all somebody there for my kid I can walk away like know the game of this is that they learn to not need us anymore. And you learn new skills, how to communicate with your child and then communicate with you. that's why i'm here i'm not here to do anything else, but that and I remember I would complain to management like I need these parents here is it's not helping the child, because they're still doing. bing work with like chocolates, or something after I told no I basically wasting my time here and they go oh. Well, we still need to stay on the case we find somebody else might know you need to have. Either need to give me the power to tell this parent what needs to be done, or even just somebody to come down here and tell this part wouldn't see be done so, which is it because i'm not doing that, then. After so long and i'm like here's my two weeks notice i'll can you work tell the 22nd here's my two weeks notice."
759.0,Provider,"right here, the date and everything's right here. Well, definitely being able to hold firm to those boundaries, you know that's what you're doing you know for for work again, you know, and I think that's important."
15692.0,Patient,"To be a while, because I was so eager for work and I did great work and after the last job I had when I was trying to get my number, it was office work. i'm not really used to doing other people's work which is like the office where like the files and. So I yeah I was bad at it, I didn't get a lot of training for what they wanted, but I mean I got an hour worth of work in the day, because they say you answer your phones you get paid kind of thing. And I realized wait, I mean you guys are making me work eight hours a day, and I were getting paid for an hour or so, because. like this estimate and they're like Oh, we have to let you go my cool I. was like whatever i'm not mad at any way, shape or form, like, I had a feeling, this was going to happen, because this is not my not my forte it's not what i've been doing for so many years. Right job is coming. it's coming."
759.0,Provider,"it's coming yeah I want to get your opinion on us doing a trauma workbook with you. OK and i'm going to i've been putting the feelers out there, asking people what which one would be the best one because it's going to be my first time kind of like using a workbook and I want to try to. Do a workbook with a client. So I kind of want to try it with you, and hopefully you won't be too expensive, so you can get the workbook yourself to. And we can work together."

759.0,Provider,give you the workbook that you already have you know why. came to that if we don't need to.
15692.0,Patient,"I just I never opened it because I know. Because i'm doing one in my group, which is the anxiety phobia one."

759.0,Provider,So do you want to continue to work with kids.
15692.0,Patient,"How to lessons. Lessons I guess was. I don't I don't mind working with adults they're just going to get a someone's literally younger than you and someone who's going to tell you how it is. I that and i've also similar with my kids and they will always be like you have no idea what i'm talking about my I don't get personal with my life, for various reasons, but you don't know anything. We, and I remember, I had one I have you ever tried weed. or like or drinking in high school like I was a teenager to ban."
759.0,Provider,"I mean that should pretty much answer your question, I was a teenager to once, yes I got curious I was wondering why is everyone trying to hide this for me kind of thing."
15692.0,Patient,"But here's the difference I didn't go joy writing after I had a bottle of tequila. yeah I you know I didn't go streaking down naked down the street, after a bottle of vodka, or whatever like there's so there's so there's a dip my gas costs self control and I love those conversations. But these are the two I have."
759.0,Provider,"OK OK, so the ptsd workbook and then other one is."
15692.0,Patient,Peter. yeah What did you.
759.0,Provider,"want to work drew you can tell me, and I can get the same workbook. um or should we think of another workbook or which one, since you are we, how to let's not you know why spend more money to get another one."
15692.0,Patient,"Maybe the pts workbooks simple, effective techniques for overcoming traumatic stress symptoms."
759.0,Provider,So that one I will get you hold it up again. second and third is.
15692.0,Patient,"I speak and. Book so I got. I I remember i'll have like my friends, and when I was working out the schools, when I would do middle school substitute the like go ask me for books like hey we know you're going to school, do you have anything we can kind of borrow my. jacket and get give me tomorrow i'll bring some some stuff back, but you're sending a piece of paper that you're taking my book, and all that fun jazz i'm keeping track of y'all."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're going to be doing that and hopefully i'll get the workbook hopefully arise by the next time they should arrive by the next time we meet okay. And I wanted to talk about your treatment plan today. Okay, the treatment plan is really kind of like road. You know map that we need in order to kind of map out what you hope to get out there, p."
15692.0,Patient,"i'm still I still not have I still haven't walked to the comic book shop by myself, yet, and that has been my goal. um then it's every time I think about walking out the what is the catastrophic thinking happens on my you are such a moron. And I shouldn't I just find myself like i'm not going today. And I like I mean as sensitive I need and I always tell myself you're going to buy your new comic book finished the series that you're on. sweat I might. like these are great incentives, these are great rewards for you, once you go down there to the shop you moron if you want to get lunch on the way back you have a plethora of options. And I just started like breathing a little heavy and everything my eyes, I kind of do the blinking thing and i'm like this is not cool like. i'm getting i'm starting to like having say like this is not okay this shouldn't be that big of a deal."
759.0,Provider,That big of a deal to go yeah so the comic book store you explained last time that you have is right down the street from you right.
15692.0,Patient,yeah it's.
759.0,Provider,"Within walking distance. And it's that window, where the accident took place kind of by it."
15692.0,Patient,It was between so the event that he goes to use across the street from the comic book shop so when they take a Min I go get comments.
759.0,Provider,"Oh, I."
15692.0,Patient,"See so, but it was that day from the comic book shop to my place that closer to my places where the exit pretty much any accident happens closer to my apartment complex, because people don't know they just drive. It just look for another vehicle and that's it and I already told you, the story is like I didn't see you or. yeah auggie or. Oh, I didn't think it was that big of a deal like. Everyone around sucks. So that's why i'm trying to tell myself that like dude if you stay closer to home and you're more likely to get into an accident there compared to just walking. To the comic book shop. Because you're more now you're getting away from. That set that one area where accidents happen consistently. So i'm trying to use my logical brain to be like this makes no sense, what you're doing. Your but then might be anxiety and the fear the ptsd like weapons to someone calls me on their car weapons what like why, but if I get followed again like that only, no, no, there goes the what ifs, the Castro thinking, the setting myself up and. that's why i'm like oh wait, maybe the traumatic stress one."
759.0,Provider,"A little bit more about your stress responses, you know your responses. To kind of like the trauma that you have went through in your life yeah."
15692.0,Patient,"And Oh, speaking of trauma my I finally got to talk to my dad about what happened with my with Vivian. turns out my older sister her daughter is getting married and I was like okay that's cool and I kind of looked at the wedding party and my dad asked. My dad asked me is like Oh well, she was screaming at me that she was gonna walk Melissa down the island everything on my call that. there's a website where everyone their mother wants to wants for extra attention, called the not dead, and he put all their personal information on there when the weddings that. During session. he's like people do that I get stupid rates open invitation for anyone to come by anyways. No, I don't see her no don't see her name anywhere on that list so she is on some good drugs, which apparently. She is okay my dad's 60. mm hmm he's like 5958 she's like a year or so younger than him I guess her hair was falling out her skin look really bad like your teeth are rotting now. She had so much anger in her that my dad asked her for two bucks or something, and she went off on him in public and he had a like well okay so. I was like how bad how bad a wishy."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,"Like the haha I you probably won't even recognize you're kind of saying it like. Right. down and written i'm i'm actually glad I didn't go gay yeah I guess Melissa was there for vivian's support. She she didn't look at my dad one she didn't like go on the Court row she wishes, I guess, from what was described to me, she had to face of Why am I here like, why are we here kind of thing I do I want nothing to do with this. The it just I did get triggered the other day because of with the insurance company and stuff my husband's like oh you're acting we're going to be like Vivian now my all. Oh sweetie we we just went right cross that red line really quickly to not ever compare me to her, no, no, I was, I was, I was livid I walked away, I know that that's when he came back he's like I should not have used to be and as an example i'm like i'm not vindictive. Not evil i'm not going away 20 years and then it's like me. You know the next 10 years or whatever I go after my ex husband over hey I didn't get enough money from you kind of thing like. Why because part because in the end, like part of me wants to do something with my life because i'm nothing to do it doesn't make sense, so it's. But yeah she's we had a conversation about them, I just don't ever compare me to her again i'm not i'm not an addict i'm not abandoning my kids or my family like he's like I don't know much about her what you tell me him. Well, obviously, that you think it's a kind of a clear marker if I don't talk to her like she's a human being, that kind of says something. that's what we don't talk about her in this House, because. It makes them very, very uncomfortable me talking to somebody that gave birth to me as if they were. Nothing kind of thing like he's shocked by that. And you know I tell my David you and I had similar upbringings but different parents. yeah so that's The only thing is that my Vivian was out looking for Dick while I was out trying to like find food and make sure I got home okay kind of. survival mode compared to you know."
759.0,Provider,yeah. which you have been in for a really long time a do you think you're still trying to survive.
15692.0,Patient,"A little bit of me. Because I haven't been working up and taking some money out of my savings i've been saying selling some pokemon cards here and there. that's my that's my side gig everyone trips out on that, like What do you do for. extra money in this time I go I I open cards I hold them for a little bit I great job and I resell them for like three times to pray like. Wait there's my God it's like a running a small business it's just about math and what's gonna what's popular what's the car that everybody it's it's all about knowing your hobby. So, and then every everyone trips out to this day how I paid that Oregon trip flight hotel everything with one car was like. wow yeah guy he's like i've been doing this, since I was eight. And my friend she's in Florida she's like sending me pictures of a bunch of original cards and why do we get some of these created. Instead of it being like 20 bucks a card, it can be 150 but you do have to put some investment which is $20 service per card, I was trying to explain she's like holy crap there's so much with this stuff there is, but in the end game is pretty damn sweet."
759.0,Provider,"yeah $150 per card, I mean can't go wrong with that you know."
15692.0,Patient,"And that's my dad asked me to he was just what's the most expensive one you got me i'm like you know the original packs that he's like yeah well I have those graded in a case and someone says they're one pristine mint condition is like how much does that go for my 10 grand. wow he's like oh yeah house payment going on in there don't shoot my dad I do that's what no one's a lot of my office. it's the perfect workspace for me it's like. I go to work i'm in my office no one's allowed in it anyways because my collection, he said, what about damon my David just goes in when i'm not working to get his golf clubs and that's it like there's no reason for anyone to be in that room."

We all know what's going to happen we to set that dealing with crowds so what they like about him he's the same way with crowds like. He I guess he had I shouldn't say I guess that's what his there he has social anxiety, since he got sober he relied on the alcohol on the cocaine now can socialize better he got sober he gets more anxious. mm hmm so i'm like hey we can go during the week where it's less crowded. yeah it's like Okay, I can do that I was like oh thank. You. So i'm so glad we're on the same page of like. weekends, we can go to work kind of thing because we get more money and more hours and during the week it's nobody's around, we want to go do certain things."

15692.0,Patient,"And then we go to a sushi spike down the street from us for happy hour. Nice big baller ramen noodles for like 815 compare to 13 bucks. mm hmm and i'm looking at him like you're going to happy hour, from now on he's like oh yeah happy hour sushi happy our. roles everything.

759.0,Provider,No he knows.
15692.0,Patient,"And he gets excited as like says, where else is there happy hour like that way. So he's. So it's cool he's he's he's learning about. Happy hour is like the world around certain words. Just means more than just one thing so it's not like this is fine, I like introducing you to a different meaning of the word."
759.0,Provider,"yeah that's good. All right, alright so let's talk about your treatment plan okay."
15692.0,Patient,I keep going around that I know. Around that stupid happens.
759.0,Provider,"yeah What would you say is your primary goal free free, for I hate the word treatment. you're a goal for Derek up."
15692.0,Patient,"I would really, really be proud of myself I just go into that comic book shop to."
759.0,Provider,comic book shop okay.
15692.0,Patient,Right right.
759.0,Provider,"Right now that's Yi a short term goal like we put in place that you will you know, be able to overcome your anxiety, you know when in relations to going to the comic book store."
15692.0,Patient,"and long term. Long term goal I. I don't know, I have to go through that workbook and see like what happens because. I like I I always have short term goals with my mental health and everything like. You know, like with Lego i'll go for a mile walk with him in the morning. He does. Whatever he has allowed to go with me he goes with me and to mentally prepare myself Okay, I can go do this without him if this is what's happening now with him, I can go do this without him and I go do stuff without him. But I can't do that for the rest of my life kind of thing like so I guess my long term goal is. Not having so much what IFS catastrophic thinking I. I that's probably the biggest one with me is I worry too much. Just, but I think i've said it before how many times can something happened to a person over and over again, and not and have them not think down it's going to happen again, and once I step out of this House, apparently."
759.0,Provider,"yeah I think it's feelings of hyper vigilant, you know, like very kind of like you know, in terms of you may be having some flashbacks to times when you were under. You know by duress started something dramatic has happened to you, you know from the past. So it's definitely something to look at into focus in on how do I overcome deaths, you know, like how do I be how can I cope with having you know. trauma in my background and be able to cope on everyday level without thinking that something bad is always going to happen without thinking, like, I have to look over my shoulder all the time because something is going to happen."
15692.0,Patient,Even even with women it's like when women talk to me i'm like what does she won she sent me out like the last one did is she going to be scared of sketchy in.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,"So that's I. David has mentioned it a couple times like sometimes he talked down to women, once you find out their education status. And I go no David it's not about education status it's not about my upbringing, or who I was married to before. Women are sketchy as Fuck they can come up with you, with a smile and be all poli and the minute you have alcohol in your system or you take us ahead of that weed and they kind of see are like Oh, this is a different kind of. How do I know they're not going to jump in and do something stupid like oh come over here come take a shot over here like. And he's like not everyone's I know it's hard for him to understand and i'm happy he's trying to understand, but it's I don't I don't like women."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,"In a way to where if I if you come to me all smiling everything was like a year, I feel like you're up to something. yeah like you know either introduced yourself to me you didn't say like hey what's going on you're just really super friendly off the BAT like what do you want. Where you go do you want to drink my non good I have water fine it's like."
759.0,Provider,Do you do the same thing with men.
15692.0,Patient,"I just don't have met come near me. Like be before I was it was very unhealthy put myself in dangerous situations because my I looked at as my body was being used for whatever, so why should I saw my stop anything from happening. But that has gotten so much that's now a completely different story ever since we know with my husband and then him being fluff like flat out with me oh. you're you're being too comfortable you're putting yourself in situations, you need you need to look at things, what do you. Okay, so now to where men come up to my go away shoo shoo go go somewhere else, like Oh, we just want to see if you're having a good time, or do you work here like no and get the Fuck away. And i'm like maybe I shouldn't be so mean because that concern like. Because, with some of these guys it's I was just trying to be nice to you i'm like i'm not asking you for anything i'm going to ask you to come say hi to me and I asked you to say what's up. But apparently by put if I say the wrong thing it's going to be oh crap now, here comes me really having to be super hyper aware. So. I guess is finding the right places to know like okay like there's a bar down the street from my apartment I went with my girlfriend. She was like Oh, how is it, am I to be honest man there's no college kids there so there's not random guys trying to hit on you. it's middle aged women and guys are older men just want to walk away from their kids that are wise for a couple hours. she's like like nothing we go in there, everyone just does the little hand wave and they go back to their dreams she's like that's it that's it you want to play pool us as you guys want to play pool like everyone's very. You know. She tripped out she's like wow you can actually make yeah you actually come in here and have a drink."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15692.0,Patient,"or like how a bunch of women at the table like What do you do, and this and that like it. She tripped out she's like I can't believe he found this place i'm like dude I like middle aged bars and I do college bars like I were both she's younger than me well, I started laughing i'm like dude I can still go to a college bar and then people will still think i'm in college. Go to a middle aged bar they're like oh she's a real young buck lever like. You know i'm like okay like this is perfect it's. mm hmm and then you know I we play pool and everything we had a really good time and she was just like well we crowd the squeezes great."
759.0,Provider,Good good.
15692.0,Patient,"So it's it's just I guess finding the right spin and finding the right spots see what happens if i'm comfortable there and I just keep holding back over and over again. And I guess trying new places that can that can be difficult, unless i'm with somebody."
759.0,Provider,She was somebody yeah.
15692.0,Patient,"So I guess that's another goal is to walk somewhere by myself and have lunch, without having to i'd done it before. i've done it so many times before, and now it's just it seems harder now I don't know is because, with the Internet and then everyone showing Karen restaurant carrot and everything and like I don't want to go out and deal with it. look like it's happening more often not I wanted to. Just a little expand and grow was just going to sit down on my my own business."
759.0,Provider,be able to walk to restaurant. To have lunch.
15692.0,Patient,"But yeah. I don't i've done it many, many times before i've done it so many times before, but now it feels like it's like I regressing back. Like I don't know what's really happening with some stuff I don't know."
759.0,Provider,"Like you feel like hesitant to kind of go into places, you know, like nearby go do things that you normally do. yeah I think that is to be concerned, you know by. You know why am I, you know, having so much anxiety over you know going into the comic book store going to go to a restaurant have lunch by myself, being able to try out new places are all places that you, you know, been to before."
15692.0,Patient,"she's trying to figure out what my mind and body is, why are we, like this."
759.0,Provider,"Connected so maybe define more of a balance, you know between. Not balance kind of what not balance but harmony between your mind body and spirit, you know, like I don't know I did we talked about spirituality before."
15692.0,Patient,Mine maybe a.
759.0,Provider,"Little a little Okay, do you have any you know faith based or just spiritual this be spiritual you know, believing universe or God or."
15692.0,Patient,"i'ma i'm a believer in God and Jesus. Okay, I I don't like to put the word Christianity or Catholic just because I had an extra the church so. yeah I, like you know it just. It makes an adder know different things to people's different strokes for different people but yeah long story short i'm a believer in God and Jesus."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So being able to connect to your mind body and spirit to find harmony. and safety because it sounds like the little bit that you fill to me it sounds as though you, you know you don't feel safe."
15692.0,Patient,"I don't get. Why stone I don't know what. What happened between my divorce, to now where I regressed a little bit."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,"And I tried to think about it, and then it's like Fuck I now thinking about what happened to me and everything and i'm like okay that's probably why i'm avoiding. i'm not really thinking about it to where i'm not processing it to where i'm back in the situation again."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15692.0,Patient,"And that happened already wants to before where I didn't leave my parents House for a couple more only only to work. Only to work and then that was it. Not only crab i'm going back into that mentality again, but why what the hell's going on."
759.0,Provider,Along with that yeah.
15692.0,Patient,"One day, at a time."
759.0,Provider,Yes.
15692.0,Patient,"that's What moves me is just relax with like breeze. mm hmm but I noticed I do avoid the feelings of discomfort and anxiety, I like oh i'm gonna go do something else now and crap I didn't realize whenever my husband says you're really fidgety you want to move everywhere, like I think that's my anxiety right now. And I never really noticed it because I try to avoid it by walking around everywhere, like. gotta really sit down and think and write it out and figure out what the hell happened."
759.0,Provider,"You can do that in journal work, you know play you know why do I feel this way you know what is going on within me and just do it as a free writing. experiment, you know something that you go and see what answers to come up with, and we can talk about your findings and Derek up you know today. i'm or maybe last week, I wrote about you know how am I feeling towards you know i'm going to a new place you know my is it you know was really bad that they are without her you know, and we can talk about and Derek up."
