And then I talked to Sean tell about it a little bit, but. yeah and then just the next day, I was so tired. Like wasn't talking anyway, so we just don't ask."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so kind of like having a sleepless night is number of really good especially you know, like how being like feelings of anxiety and it's not good to when you're trying to sleep. So you're basically after that day that nine we did you have any other incidents when us hard for you to sleep."

759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,"And like even on vacation. Like i'm still writing super anxious and like. Oh, I have to be wide awake to be able to socialize."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,"it's just like that aspect of it. mm hmm like I don't know why that gives me like makes me not like I don't think it makes me anxious, but then when i'm like laying in bed about to sleep. It does i'm like Oh, I want to like make a good impression on her parents like that's not what gives me anxiety like I love her parents, but. uh huh yeah just yeah having enough energy to like be present at dinner."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,"Anyway, so i'm starting to think like. I have more of like social anxieties to maybe. That i've always just like summed up as. anxiety anxiety."
759.0,Provider,anxiety yeah.
15945.0,Patient,i'm getting rich I don't know. So i'm trying to like navigate that.
759.0,Provider,"So you know, like having social anxieties a totally different thing from just having anxiety when you you kind of like you know. Basically, people who, who have social anxiety fear you know social environments are where they're going to have to talk, or you they're going to have to kind of interact with people or engage with people they avoid crowds the invoice you know kind of like. Basically it's like this overwhelming feeling, you know that they often dealing with social situations. You know, so it sounds definitely sounds like. you've had a little bit of that not maybe to the extreme, you know definitely felt like anxious being around other people if you don't you know the people and they're cool people and."
15945.0,Patient,from her.
759.0,Provider,All around them is still that kind of anxious nervous yeah.
15945.0,Patient,"yeah sorry want to learn how to combat back so so I have a birthday party in San Diego she's like my childhood best friend. We have just like best friend group it's five of us, but i'm the only one out of five who can make it and the rest of the Friends going or like friends, I don't even know but they're all really close it's like her core friend group and then going to be me. And i'm really here to bail. And I don't want to do that and that's what happened to say like. I say yes i'm like hey, how can I get out of this but she's my one of my best friends, I haven't seen you in forever and I don't want me having social anxiety and a group of people I don't know to make me bill."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,"To me, we are ways to navigate that. And I don't really know how i've done that, for so long and i'm just now, like processing it and realizing that it's. Like is affecting my life like I think it's always been a thing and i've just been like whatever I can bail I don't have to do what I don't want to do. But also, like, I want to meet new people, and I want to be there for my you know, my friends, even if it's in a situation where I don't know many people. yeah I don't know how to get past that."
759.0,Provider,"This work that you can do to help you know cope with social anxiety as far as you know, sometimes pushing ourselves, you know, even though we might feel a certain type of way you know engaging more with people which you have been doing. A lot. anymore, since, especially since this break you know, so I don't think it's mostly dad let me think about it for a while."
15945.0,Patient,"Okay yeah cuz i'm. Because i'm good with like my friends, I have here in San Francisco i'm like always open to do stuff with them if they have like a couple of new friends like that doesn't make me nervous. But yeah I think it's just when it's like just you me, and I don't have a like like Sam going to a party or a dinner, and I have my best friend with me, I have her as a pillow to latch on to and then i'm fine. Because, then I can go socialize man, if I feel like I need a home base, I can like go back to my best friend. But me and a new whole new."
759.0,Provider,Environment yeah.
15945.0,Patient,yeah that stresses me out.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,And I don't know because I also talked to Sean tell about like meds.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,"Sunday, but that was like her, medical clinic hour, so it was like a 20 minute thing. yeah I don't think. We were able to talk about as long as we should have but. yeah I don't know if it's like. I don't know something that meds could help me with or if I should like try to figure it out on me and."
759.0,Provider,"Something we can work on definitely and in therapy like there's a lot of different things she can do you know, like. Things have been talking about. You know you doing such as like the ground new word keno and journaling and things of that nature."
15945.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah you know, like there's things you know calm and breathing. techniques there's you know, like other things that you can do, such as challenging your thoughts in certain situations because you know our thoughts kind of control how we think and how we perceive the world around us. So doing that, but let's. table this until let me think of some really good strategies for you, because I feel like we already talked about, and it seems like the strategies that we have talked about you doing. it's not helping with you know the social anxiety that you're having now, so let me think there's some other. strategies for you and I have that when you come back okay. But, for me, I want."
15945.0,Patient,I guess.
759.0,Provider,"For right now, I just want you to challenge your dots you know, in terms of you know, like it and to basically say to yourself, like, I can do this, I can get."
15945.0,Patient,To this.
759.0,Provider,"You know, by being around my best friend and other people, you know. Like it's not as scary as maybe i'm thinking it is, it is. You know right yeah."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah and I think i'm like just now, realizing. That it is social anxiety and i've been like this, I think my whole life and so i've just grown to live with it, and I think it's just me it's whatever it's just me i'm. More shy but i'm not I don't know i'm not really shy anymore anyway so i'm just holding on to it like it's okay like i've always been anxious around big groups of people like it's just me, which is also true and it's fine, but now I like now i'm realizing I don't like that. So I think it's gonna take me a while to kind of get past that since i've lived i've. dealt with it my whole life. But. And then another thing i've noticed too is like. Even when i'm talking to people are like even my roommate my best friend, or like on vacation well when I just like have very low energy all the time, but to like sometimes i'll just like not want to talk and like. Have a conversation with someone or i'm realizing like when I do have a conversation with someone i'm literally just like having my own thoughts in my head and then i'll like literally miss 30 seconds or 45 seconds of their conversation."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,"And then i'll be like oh shit i'm having a conversation I need to respond, I was not listening to them and i'm just like good yeah. And I realized I do, that a lot like I literally just like have thoughts in my head when i'm talking to someone and like thinking of like either assignments, I need to do, or like. A lunch, I have that day or like literally just anything other than the conversation in front of me if i'm not like super interested in it. Which isn't great either, and I don't like doing that because then it makes it harder for me to respond and then i'm not very engaged and then I just like don't talk back."
759.0,Provider,You know pop back yeah.
15945.0,Patient,"Which is no fun for anyone. yeah like myself, nor the person i'm talking to. So yeah I don't know if that's like a focus thing."
759.0,Provider,"It can be a focus thing you know it could be, and definitely you know just being able, just to sit and talk to someone and not think about what else you have going on. I also think is anxiety thing too, because if you're thinking about other things and other things that you have to do you know your mind is wandering it could be a little bit inside it too."
15945.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah kind of like over. yeah yeah.
15945.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. too, and I don't know how to because I do journaling and yoga and stuff not too great for like overall ease of anxieties but. I don't know yeah I still have those like instances like right in the moment where those things happen and I don't know I feel like journaling isn't going to. be enough to help with that yeah."
759.0,Provider,"yeah definitely. i'm looking over some of your goals you know, the goal that I have for you right now is like I want to feel less overwhelmed and more balance is that something that holds true to you. You know, but drill for therapy yeah totally I feel like i'm always just like kind of fluctuating."
15945.0,Patient,"With being like super happy and then i'm sad and then i'm irritated and i'm talkative and then I don't want to talk to you at all, then, I have a lot of energy and then i'm sad mostly so."
759.0,Provider,"yeah and kind of like the sub goals, I have for you steps to take gifts yeah to journal one time daily to learn to express your emotions. Originally, like you've been doing for a walk you know one time daily to improve your mental capacity, because walking really does clear your mind sometimes you know. Are you he used it as a mindfulness walk when you just pay attention to the you know sites and scenes of wherever you're walking to. and patient to practice to mindfulness activities per week. that's really good so. Balancing yourself, overall, you know. In terms of you wanting to have better mental capacity in terms of you wind just Center yourself a little bit more, so that you feel balance. Being dream, and you know medication, you know so that can help you as well, and you can always go on YouTube I mean they have like hundreds and probably thousands of mindfulness videos. yeah you know meditate to. And I have you know that you want to engage more with the world around you right. As another ball."
15945.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"You know, to create your social Iraq interactions by one time, a week with your friends and family but it sounds like you're doing that, as well you know."
15945.0,Patient,yeah trying to uh huh it's easier now with my break but.
759.0,Provider,yeah we can add to your goals ways to help you overcome social anxiety does that sound like a plan.
15945.0,Patient,yeah I think that sounds good.
759.0,Provider,"You know, sometimes preparing you know, for when we're going to go to van be with people with social anxiety that kind of mentally prepared themselves. Like I said, like bringing up seeing those affirmations to yourself, like, I can do this, I can you know walk. You know, like you know with having anxiety and being around other people, and that can do both and to pay attention to kind of like your negative thoughts about the situation as well you know. My new by say to myself, you know, like I can't get through this or you know you pay attention to those thoughts as well. yeah if that makes sense."
15945.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah like beforehand. yeah little warmer.
759.0,Provider,I we ever did like progressive muscle relaxation like meditation where you're kind of like just relaxing all your kind of like. Your body has. To. So maybe you know for one of your goals we have for you to do mindfulness to mindfulness activities per week so maybe that can be you know something that preview and try also.
15945.0,Patient,Okay. Are we good.
759.0,Provider,"And you know another way to help you to to take the focus off of yourself in terms of social interactions like if I go in and i'm just thinking about how i'm going to be in front of everyone, you know, like take the focus off of yourself. that's fine too like I. When I walked into you can tell me when i'm not hitting the mark with you. know."
15945.0,Patient,"that's like exactly what I think is like when I go into social situations. i'm like oh my God, if I say one thing. Like everyone's gonna think i'm stupid like if I say the wrong thing everyone's going to judge me. And so, like a lot of times, then. Sometimes, because I have like very outgoing friends like especially my roommate she's extremely loud and it's hard to get a word in with her. So that that already is like just a conference like whenever i'm around my friends they're all very loud and i'm or you know just like i'm not one to like. interrupting interject and like voice myself so in cases like that, like, I will just like kind of sit back and be like all right, like. And I just want to say anything so i'm like I don't want to say something and then it's my anxiety like I don't want to say something and then be judged if I say something wrong. hmm very much like putting too much pressure on ourselves. yeah uh huh."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you know people who kind of like can be able to take the focus off of yourself, instead of telling you those things or thinking about how you're going to be in that social situation, you know just. go there, you know by again pinterest focusing on you know meeting other people are just like you know, having fun in the moment doesn't about mindfulness to to be present in the moment. To truly be part present in the moment like when you're paying attention to what's in front of you, instead of like what's in your head, you know. yeah and attention to like the environment yeah that's your end. Okay yeah."
15945.0,Patient,yeah that'd be helpful.
759.0,Provider,"Craig as like I don't want to overwhelm you with too many things spiking just focusing on what we're doing already you're. handling the exercising with the mindfulness and just increasing kind of like the mindfulness activities because that's going to really help you, you know find balance for from within."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah okay. That sounds good. yeah I mean other question, too, because I like i've noticed like and i'm. literally just did it right, then, when you're talking, I was thinking about some dancer i'm sorry but. i'm the guy has to do with therapy, so I guess it's just what I was going to ask Max but i'm like i've noticed like i'm looking. Like constantly for answers like Am I depressed isn't anxieties social anxiety like i'm trying to categorize it so much and I don't know if that's such a great I do I don't know because i'm trying to its branches of like Why do I feel this way like. Am I anxious and depressed and my more depressed and anxious more anxious and depressed and more social anxiety that's causing my depression like."
759.0,Provider,uh huh.
15945.0,Patient,"Is that a good way to look at it, or is it not the best to like. You don't have to memorize every little thing."
759.0,Provider,Think you're overthinking it right.
15945.0,Patient,i'm a huge over thinker so.
759.0,Provider,"Probably huge over thinker so. yeah I think just you know, like I hate when people like with different things you know and self labels can be helpful on you, because you know what exactly is going down with you. And it's good to get treatment on things that you know that. You know, for anxiety or depression or ptsd you know we kind of put those in the categories, because there's a lot of evidence based practices that we use to help people with you know, during zipes here depression or trauma or whatever it might be. I think you know by you can say to yourself, like i'm not this disorder, you know, like i'm not you know, like my anxiety doesn't mean to define who I am are you know, like. And I can learn, you know ways to cope, and with what i'm going through and not so much is just to label yourself, but just to say like you know clearly you know you know off balance and I just want to find some balance and that's why we have that in your treatment plan. You know you're being you know your your moods."
15945.0,Patient,"Right yeah. And I think another reason why I asked to is because, like. When I talked to Sean tell about like medications and stuff. It was kind of like me telling her what I need. mm hmm but I don't know what I need, so I think that's why i'm confused."
759.0,Provider,Like.
15945.0,Patient,You I don't know.
759.0,Provider,"Well, the thing about us the therapy physicians we listened to you, you tell us because you're you're you are your best expert you like, to you, we have professional advice, but we don't know you like. You are your own best expert when it comes to yourself right, because how old, are you. 25 you have 25 years of experience or experiences I have. yeah you know, so you know you better than I can probably tell you."
15945.0,Patient,You know what's going on. So.
759.0,Provider,"Like I said we make those diagnosis, because we were using the best evidence based practices and medicines. That can help someone going through whatever you're going through so your. bag with how you're feeling is very important for us like and it will make our best you know professional decision based on that. based on evidence based practices are professional experience and then your own experience as you as a person coming to to us to you know for help."
15945.0,Patient,Right okay.
759.0,Provider,"that's good yeah. yeah. or assessments like i'm always assessing you know. In terms of like how she's doing. You know. And how you're reacting to kind of like our treatment goals that we have for you and you know, like based on you know, like the best way, so I can find to kind of like help you with whatever you're going through."
15945.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah right. Now that all make sense, yes right, the first time coming to like therapy and having a psychiatrist so it's like navigating it all is all so new to me to. yeah so that that reminder. yeah and. that's like a lot of because I started my roommate about it too that's a lot of. Like self learning to, and I think I just assumed like coming that therapy psychiatry like the psychotropic Okay, you have this and this like you need take this like here are all your answers. yeah i'm learning that's like not the case. Which is fine and that's obviously totally understandable since you guys aren't. mission. fortune tellers you don't have a crystal ball."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you know, like acting sometimes you know, like when you see psychiatry at Derek up like on the TV shows and movies, it does kind of like portray as these all knowing you know, like whatever you know and sometimes. I I do know a lot, you know, and I can tell you a lot, you know, but I like I said I don't want to overwhelm you."
15945.0,Patient,know.
759.0,Provider,"Like I can only do, because this is our what second full time or maybe third you know, like full session and i'm. know you know what is going on with you. As a person yeah. Right yeah."
15945.0,Patient,"No, that makes sense."
759.0,Provider,"So you know we have good coping skills for you. You know. And so, if what you're doing right now. You know, like, I really want you to really hone into those coping skills and to make sure that you're doing them each and you know by each and every single day are doing part of the work you know. A lot about therapy is the outside work that you put inside of it. Tomorrow, work, you can put into it tomorrow, better kind of like me so you're going to see you know."
15945.0,Patient,And then.
759.0,Provider,"it's going to be times when we have to go back to the drawing board, maybe these coping skills are not working, maybe something out of the box for you to do yeah. All right strategy."
15945.0,Patient,"mm hmm yes, what I have now is like the walking and the to meditation which I have really been doing, like meditation practices, a week. Right okay."
759.0,Provider,"Internally, one time daily and just keeping track of your mood. You know john when today, I feel anxious because X y&z happened, you know how does that make me feel. You know, and you can share your writings and guarantee you know you can take me back in Gudrun all say like on this particular day I was having a tough time. In desert, I think I was having a tough time let's talk about it, you know. Okay yeah."
15945.0,Patient,That sounds good yeah cuz I do. Because I started journaling just like. Like free journaling I guess you could call it.
759.0,Provider,Like fine.
15945.0,Patient,"yeah and then, but I also have this. thing called the five minute journal I don't know if you've heard of that but it's like prompts have like three affirmations today. Like it's like kind of just questions. mm hmm so you do that, which is good but yeah I think i'm gonna try to do more of the like. Just like no props journalists like writing down stuff."
759.0,Provider,"out right now yeah I think that's helpful to. And you are just beginning therapy to so give yourself some grace to like it's not going to be an overnight change, you know it's going to be. yeah being able to you know just you know, keep on working on the things that you know you're supposed to work on, and you know, like challenging your thoughts all that stuff that i'm telling you to do. You know, hundreds of it is kind of like hard work, you know but. yeah work."
15945.0,Patient,"like an investment yeah. yeah yeah. I know I think I am I i'm just overall an impatient person, so I think with this stuff i'm very impatient hard on myself, especially for school starts in a couple weeks. So i'm like I need to get rid of all my anxieties and. In two weeks, like, here we go. You know. That when school starts to get really bad and so i'm just. yeah i'm no I think i'm also interest for school to start in a couple weeks."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,cena that kind of hits the fan when school starts they're not going to have like much time and getting more stressed and.
759.0,Provider,Anxious I mean.
15945.0,Patient,When.
759.0,Provider,"you're taking away from these moments, so that when you're you know, like, and you know not in school you're taking away, you know somebody like relaxing moments that you have right now."
15945.0,Patient,"I am yeah. Totally. yeah. And it sucks. yeah yeah. Sorry i'm trying to be better about that too and i'm trying not to like look at these I think I mentioned, maybe we went to me, but like how I looked at these breaks it's like. all or nothing like, if I have like a few days, where i'm not doing something or like i'm like not feeling good i'm like why what am I doing like Why am I feeling sad and not doing thing that i'm on my break like i'm wasting time. And I just get like really hard on myself. yeah and then I started to think. of school, starting in like I hate that i've because i've pared school now with being like depressed and anxious. And so now, when I think of school. I like it's constantly like a dark cloud for me and I hate that it's become that because I forever it's been a dream of mine to get into physical therapy school. I ucsf so i'm like living my dream and I hate that I might have such a negative connotation surrounding it now. yeah you know, like I want this to be a happy thing."
759.0,Provider,"So you know. One thing I notice about you is that you do you know, like it goes back to that overthinking."
15945.0,Patient,It goes back.
759.0,Provider,"kind of like you know, like. Like, how can I put this it goes back to kind of like that cycle that he told me about last time, when you start to think about something and goes like the worst case scenario. there's all these different scenarios and different things that can happen and i'm just like you know just constantly in this loop. So, in terms of how you think about different things and area so things you know. We can change that loop for you. can challenge yourself to bake that padron and just you know say those things to you, you know, like we talked about balance and really is the mind body and spirit that's what's going to balance you out. You know, like and that's you know kind of. Going back to kind of like your spirituality you know just saying to yourself, like it's going to be okay, you know. affirmations that you're learning your five minute Journal and really just keep on saying that to yourself, like it's going to be get through this, this is a happy being for me because i'm finally in physical therapy school. And you know, look forward to my classes and being able to learn more about my my will house of you know, physical therapy was a to yourself, you know and keep on you know, like reframing. yeah I."
15945.0,Patient,Think that's good yeah just like interjecting the loop.
759.0,Provider,yeah interjecting.
15945.0,Patient,yeah no definitely work on that.
759.0,Provider,yeah it's gonna be okay.
15945.0,Patient,"You know, there are no."
759.0,Provider,"cool you know you finally doing you're doing you know, in terms of you know, working towards your degree. Like in it should be kind of play. You know, like a good time for you, but I do know like with school comes stress. And so. You know, it could be good stress in terms of US learning, you know are some stress is bad stress when we tend to, but the it's overwhelming us, you know so painted into like your stress responses to."
15945.0,Patient,"uh huh yeah. yeah I mentioned to do, I mean like I said yeah I tried to like. put these practices into habit form over break so that way when school comes I can do it more easily."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. hmm yeah and you know, like if you don't always get it right, you know don't beat yourself up you know."
15945.0,Patient,uh huh yeah. yeah nice to give myself more of a grace period. For sure.
759.0,Provider,yeah. waking up just a little bit. I can't hear you now.
15945.0,Patient,"Okay. Well, I think I brought up everything I wanted to talk about um I don't really know."

15945.0,Patient,"I guess like the affirmations before. right before I go and maybe like even in my journals. Like talking about just like how maybe I like. I should look at it, I just more exciting experience like having conversations. Like meet new people. and see her."
759.0,Provider,that's going to be the fun part it sounds like fun in is it sounds like I know sounds scary a little bit in terms of. New people but also sounds like you can have a good time.
15945.0,Patient,It does sound like that yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah you know, maybe you can be both scary. And also, you know, like. I can have a good time here."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah and I think what's bad about it in my head like when I think about it it's like. it's all kids who are my age that's all people, adults who live in San Diego. mm hmm and it's always so it's embraces the girl my good friend from high school and so she stayed in San Diego when. I went off to college in San Francisco and she befriended a bunch of other kids from our high school, who we were never friends with before, who also. stayed in San Diego. And so now they've been friends for seven years, but i've been in San Francisco so i've never befriended these kids but I went to high school with them."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,And so they know me but they know high school me and I haven't talked to them in seven years.
759.0,Provider,Seven that's a little bit kind of like a little nervous to me.
15945.0,Patient,"yeah I think so, and I."
759.0,Provider,yeah with them.
15945.0,Patient,"And I changed so much since high school. mm hmm I think to starting maybe that's why it's a little nerve wracking. And then, when I start thinking about it, like. Right now, and I was telling you like oh yeah it's exciting to have any conversations and stuff and I meet new people it's just like i'll never see them really against they live in San Diego. Why get to know them. Which is a bad mindset to have. Five yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Oh it's not yummy. reframe that to you know, maybe it's just just hanging out for the night just. yeah like. Just hanging out seeing people that you haven't seen in seven years since high school, you know, maybe. catching up I don't know but you're never friends with these kids so maybe it's just. High and just like. don't you know, and do you have an exit plan you know i'm. Saying."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah no I mean yeah i'm just gonna i'm leaving the next day so i'm just going to be like I gotta go and I think i'm gonna borrow my mom's car and she'll have work in the morning. say she has worked the morning, and then I have to go home after dinner and that's the thing it's like it's not like an event, where I can like pop around and I talked to annalise like. it's a sit down dinner."
759.0,Provider,On been there.
15945.0,Patient,"So actually need to say, because then i'm going to be sitting next to who knows who the whole time. mm hmm and so, in my head i'm just like oh my God they're all best friends like they're a really good friend to hang out all the time, like it's a really close friend group and then me. So i'm just like i'm. picturing in my head DEMO talking about life and whatever they talk about as best friends and and me being there like yeah like trying to like talk."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15945.0,Patient,"Now, and i'm just being like. We don't hang out with you. So, which is like a drastic thing to think but that's where my thoughts go."
759.0,Provider,"After your thoughts go. Well, hopefully, the five is not like that, hopefully, the vibe is you know more relax you know kind of like relax you know, like in terms of just eating dinner sitting down for dinner. Maybe focusing and so focusing you know, on yourself focusing on your friend, whose birthday and your dare to. celebrate her birthday. Know paying attention to cuff kind of like what she is doing in the moment in our life when her birthday, you know yeah so. Even though, like it does part of it sounds kind of like it could be annoying but the part of it sounds like it could be actually you know Okay, you know i'll be okay in this environment. You know, you can exist up to same this two dots you know can exist about the party right, you know another hand just might be really annoying because I don't know these kids and I don't want to be here, and this kind of like i'd rather be doing something else with my time. On other hand, i'm here to support my friend."
15945.0,Patient,i'm here.
759.0,Provider,"Like a happy birthday to her i'm here to enjoy. The moment so. You know, closing thoughts right."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah that's true that's a good way to look at it, because i'm always like Oh, it has to be one or the other."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15945.0,Patient,So that's yeah that's a good way to look at just that lots of different things.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15945.0,Patient,two sides of it. yeah yeah and that's where I want to go is like to be there to support her so.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15945.0,Patient,we're gonna get that gift and.
759.0,Provider,"and hopefully the line is good, there you know, like i'm always advised person so when i'm talking to partners is checking the vibe will look like."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah. I think it will be fine I think when I think of them to it's like. When I think of the people who are going to be there, I think of high school and not necessarily they were clicking because, like it's people from all different friend groups now that are part of. One big group, like it's just like a bunch of different people from San Diego who went to the same high school, but when I think a high school, I think I think of cliquey. And I think it's, just like the drama and, like the shit talking, you know all the bad things that come along with high school. And so I think I associate them with that, and then I just have yeah that's fine, I think I have that whole perspective in my head, which probably isn't necessarily true I feel like we've all grown up now enrolled like adult so. I doubt, I doubt that that's going to be the case, but. yeah I go there, I go to the worst possible outcome, always with my little."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15945.0,Patient,We went it's better I have already prepared and that's my coping mechanism. yeah are you better at but yeah I think it'll be good. we'll see i'll let you know.
759.0,Provider,yeah next session right. You like no dredge out was horrible.
15945.0,Patient,Let me tell you. Where do we.
759.0,Provider,"might be just be like Okay, I went there was fine and. You know left you know."
15945.0,Patient,It is what it is. yeah yeah. yeah. But. yeah sure that coming up bootstrap coming up. And then i'll be home or San Francisco home yeah then they start school. see me breaking a server.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm so really enjoy you know if you know it's in two weeks just enjoy yourself and your time off and really do two things that you want to do.
15945.0,Patient,You know.
759.0,Provider,"Practice what we've been talking about, and you know, like how many more years or how long do you have."
15945.0,Patient,Two NAPs. yeah.
759.0,Provider,This past fall okay. Two and a half years okay.
15945.0,Patient,"Yes, Sir i'm brand spanking new any that's what makes me anxious it's like my mental health has never been so fluctuating created like a server fluctuated so much and it's ever I like got to the lowest point i've ever been like last quarter. So i'm trying to. Say get ahead of it really freaked me out, I was like whoa i've never felt this way i've never experienced mental health and never gone to therapy. or something you've had to deal with. And so, now that it's the beginning of my program i'm like oh my gosh I have two and a half, more years. i'm like I better get a grip on it, and I think i'm so impatient because i'm like oh my God, if I don't get a grip on it it's going to get worse and i'm going to spiral."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15945.0,Patient,So of course there's my loop again. For the worst outcome. But that's where my head goes.
759.0,Provider,"It goes. Now, being able to reframe that for yourself like you know, like. I know, like school stressful but i'm living out my dream, you know, this is, you know, has his own challenges, you know but i'm also able to you know, like do what I want to do in the future, like i'm studying become a you know physical therapist right. But again, you know this is has been something i've been wanting to do, and now I get to you know study for it. It takes takes time, you know, like. And sometimes you know, like, I remember when I was in school and went to like a hard school. To foreign in New York and went to New York university. yeah and just kind of like I remember in between, you know by these This is why, like brakes are important. You know in between us versus having some downtime and being able to self reflect on you know about also reminded myself of why I was there, you know by. Why am I doing what i'm doing so harder working so hard is because I want to build the life for myself. fulfill my dreams. So, like we might need yourself with that to."
15945.0,Patient,require da yeah. yeah that's good yeah I feel like it's so easy to lose sight of that. When you're in it. yeah how long was your program I don't even know how we're how what does it take to be.
759.0,Provider,"A therapist. yeah well i'm first guy got his degree in psychology and then social work school was two years and then after social school, we have 3000 hours of clinical work that we have to do so that's another two years. And yeah so yeah it takes some time."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah. It was so so you went to social work school at nyu. or your undergrad for you, oh."
759.0,Provider,yeah I got my masters right.
15945.0,Patient,Oh cool. yeah that's cool and raise a great school.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15945.0,Patient,quite hard it.
759.0,Provider,"was hard. You know I got through it, you know, on you know pushing forward. I believe my last semester was the hardest. Because I really thought Oh, this is like I spent. Last semester i'm just out."
15945.0,Patient,"We mentally checked out that's how it was for undergrad for me, my last semester of senior year I was like I can't. This is so much. but luckily, it was your last year clinical beast."
759.0,Provider,For your search for it yeah.
15945.0,Patient,yeah because that's how mine is.
759.0,Provider,yeah we had if you'd like so me I was working I internship because they call internship so yeah.
15945.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm I know i'm I haven't done that, yet my first clinical is this summer it's like a 10 week clinical."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, Nice."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm either like. yeah i'm wondering if i'm going to like it better or worse than the academics. mm hmm of it, I don't know what did you like better or did you not have."
759.0,Provider,"A preference I i'm i'm practical. person like I learned by doing so, it wasn't so much in the book and in terms of what i'm supposed to do it was actually going out there and just doing therapy and just being around a clinical environment, you know working out patient, and you know was actually just doing the work."
15945.0,Patient,Right yeah.
759.0,Provider,"What I found the most kind of like joy. And once I think you're in front of after you know you're you know, been learning. Book wise in terms of how to you're studying I think once you're out there, doing what you want to do in terms of helping people with your physical limitations, you know, like I think that's going to bring and you know it's going to be the better feeling for you, you know. actually helping someone."
15945.0,Patient,"yeah I think so, too, I had my first last quarter, I had a two day clinical in is actually like in the middle, or like I guess towards then but right when I was like not doing well and I was crying all the time. you're just like really bad and then I had my TV clinical and then after that it was kinda like a switch flipped like I was done with a lot of tests and then I did the Tutoring clinical. I was like okay like i'm learning I know my stuff and like that was really fun like that that's what I want to be doing I don't want to be. said about cell types and like simple screen epithelium so. That yeah so that was refreshing so yeah I think you're right. yeah mm hmm yeah the first year is always more like textbook stuff. i'm like. Building that backbone of your knowledge."
759.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
15945.0,Patient,uh huh yeah starting to get better. Hopefully. yeah mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,"yeah just keep that in mind, you know, like you know just keep on thinking about you know how it's going to make you feel why you're doing what you're doing. So make school seeing seamless kind of light inside to provoke game. As doing something for myself. and challenges ahead of me, you know i'm going to be able to confront those challenges and do my best. You know reframing those things for yourself."
15945.0,Patient,yeah that's good. Okay.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so we talked about a lot today, you know started out with the social anxiety gave you some strategies. You know, like in terms of how you're feeling and you know hold off hold off on the labeling yourself, you know either anxiety or depressed just saying you know, like I you know i'm working on core issue that I have you know, like are. You know i'm not my anxiety or depression, you know i'm in therapy, you know for a reason."
15945.0,Patient,"You know, to work on."
759.0,Provider,These areas of concern in my life and how I feel. You don't have to label yourself as eating things.
15945.0,Patient,You know right yeah definitely. yeah. said that you're just like not feeling unbalance it doesn't have to be like i'm I have anxiety or depression. But I like how you put it like i'm just. feeling unbalanced. it's a good way to put it.
