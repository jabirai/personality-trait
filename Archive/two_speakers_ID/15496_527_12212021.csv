527.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah definitely sounds like. you've got some some options available for you then.
15496.0,Patient,yeah. i'm hoping that my. on having the post office on that resume and how about one of my cousin is like a small business will like actually have me like stuff to say that. Why i'm a good candidate for the job. I used to not really have anything to.
527.0,Provider,say.
15496.0,Patient,"And I would do interviews, just like what what I could do."
527.0,Provider,"You might just. do some like Google searches on you know. Top interview questions. And then that might give you some idea of maybe what questions could come up in interviews and then write down your answers, of how you would respond to those and just kind of review those."
15496.0,Patient,Oh that's a good idea i'm. really bad at coming up like organizing my thoughts on the spot. So I didn't have any pauses and. I just seem kind of like lost to them. yeah this is how I mentioned that my brain just seems to work really slowly. I thought so.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah so one of the things that we had initially talked about was. You were going to work on making a list of. The tasks that you need to get done and then being able to put them into a schedule.
15496.0,Patient,"I didn't write them down. You know, mine is good job now."
527.0,Provider,yeah so how did you do with that goal for yourself.
15496.0,Patient,"trying to grab a pen or. I did, like most old school I needed stuff but we were to get them. on the phone."
527.0,Provider,"How are things going at home, because I know that that's been a stress we're yeah."
15496.0,Patient,"I guess talking it out some help. Okay now just you know, trying to keep myself. Whether you know this listening to music or you know just doing anything to keep me focused. Understand that i'm struggling to try and stay on task. we're trying to move. All right, okay. The things I need to. have done like. Well, I did write down a lot of things. But I feel like it will work out if I just broke down. You know just from a certain time to another. Do certain tasks, but I definitely hope that I wrote down on a list."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah cuz, then I think you can look at your list and go okay what time of the day, do I need to do this one."
15496.0,Patient,Have a pen in my purse.

527.0,Provider,So how often do you go and exercise Catherine.
15496.0,Patient,"My current go every day, unless. Unless I like how an appointment today. Something like that."

527.0,Provider,Okay.
15496.0,Patient,i'm sure what I could do each day is just write down like a list of tests.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15496.0,Patient,"And just you know under cross them out, we get them done."
527.0,Provider,"I was gonna say are there some tasks that that you do like once a week is there some that you do like once a month. Is there some that you do every day, and maybe try to think about you know if this is something I do once a week what what day would would be a good day to do that on or. If it's once a month what you know, should I pick a day during the month that every every month, on this day I do this task."
15496.0,Patient,"I see yeah I have figured that out. That I, like, for my car I always avoid it because I don't like doing it, I don't know it's like my least favorite short. order was where i'm trying it's like all the water out I don't know it just too much. annoyance, so I decided like. i'll put it. Wonderful working i'll have to change. Like I had put like everyone's day all I clean my car."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think this you know, certainly your schedule is going to change once you get a job and and find out what your hours working hours are going to be. So this is a work in progress, it can it can change and and be flexible, for you."
15496.0,Patient,yeah no is how how mine work I can't speak to a new good things. was good to have like that structure i'm.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah I think you can get some sort of structure to it and then adjusted, depending on what your work hours are."
15496.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. How does, how does it feel when you're when you have some structure for yourself during the day, how do you feel."
15496.0,Patient,"going to say like if I don't have structure, I just procrastinate. Like I want to do something else. But I need to do another thing, so I just like meander around and don't do anything. So of structure, all these no okay it's nine o'clock I should be doing this. Okay yeah i'll actually you know get to work on it having like a visual of like. What time it is like got this watch."
527.0,Provider,that's pretty.
15496.0,Patient,um. So I I definitely need like a visual of time casino time blindness.
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah and that just that extra accountability.
15496.0,Patient,"yeah for sure. We had a structural structure will really help me. stay on task, because then you know, by the time it's like in the afternoon and it's time for me, you know I have time for myself now. To you know to work on my. any sort of well their hobbies, but I would like to have them as like a job at some point. You know, working on a small business."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah you mentioned that so good.
15496.0,Patient,By the time it's five and I didn't get much done it's like well I can't even work on the stuff I want to because I didn't get anything done.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15496.0,Patient,that's fine let 12 two. To five I also do get groceries and you sort of Aaron central i'll write that down.
527.0,Provider,or those like once a week things that you do go to the grocery and running errands.
15496.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15496.0,Patient,"But, so I think it definitely helped me to write down like you know everything I need to do. Sure, so I could have you know something to pick through like all business you get them. it's usually just say, what do you notice like if I see that, like the floors are dirty and so I focus on. Okay i'm fine yeah like my i've been like getting things done, like around six but my goal is to like. know how everything done and I could just from five to. I feel like I don't have enough time to really work on my business, though. Like Oh, I know wake up that's. All I guess working from 52229 is the good enough time I guess one thing my my aunt asked me is like oh how about ours is too much on my computer because yeah all my stuff that I work on is on my computer. I guess, do you think for four hours is enough."
527.0,Provider,For time to do your hobbies. and your business stuff.
15496.0,Patient,Computer wise.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. I mean, I certainly think you could get a lot done in four hours."
15496.0,Patient,"Yes, just on the focus part. not really so."
527.0,Provider,"But but remember Catherine, we talked remember when we talked about giving yourself some breaks like do do work for a little bit and then take like a five minute break and then go back so that you're you're. you're being more purposeful in the time that you're on the on the computer and not getting as distracted."
15496.0,Patient,link.
527.0,Provider,Like allowing yourself to have some breaks to help with that concentration goal.
15496.0,Patient,"Oh, I see what you."
527.0,Provider,"So, like maybe i'm going to work for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take a five minute break get up go, you know. make a lap around the House and come back and work for another 30 minutes and take a five minute break and like do something like that that helps you to just have more purposeful like time limited goals. Well, that makes sense."
15496.0,Patient,I thought you were talking about when I do chores. That to take like five minutes breaks between chores or something like. That because you were talking about when I do my hobbies but what did I work with chores.
527.0,Provider,"yeah like if you do one shore then take a five minute break and then you know, look at your list, what do I need to do next do that next."
15496.0,Patient,You see.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm because if you if you fit those little breaks in, then it will it, it should help you to stay on track, a little bit better."
15496.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,Because you're like okay I got the floor swept. Now I need a MOP so i'm going to take five minutes just kind of. take a deep breath I just got done sweeping the floors and then. next step is to get the bucket and water and soap and MOP and whatever else.
15496.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15496.0,Patient,Will.
527.0,Provider,Try to make it a little more manageable for you. Not so overwhelming.
15496.0,Patient,"yeah My answer is just very time management type of person well I didn't know that Okay, I need like some time to just stop and like. Just you know just first I need to organize what i'm going to do for the summer, let me organize what i'm going to do today, and then i'll get started. You know it's not you know i'm not wasting time i'm just trying to organize it will be more."
527.0,Provider,Like more productive and more successful yeah for.
15496.0,Patient,The five to nine. either not I like to switch switching like writing related stuff or video. Mother take a.
527.0,Provider,"Do you feel like that. will be more helpful for you now, can I have some direction."
15496.0,Patient,Yes. Okay i'm just trying to see about. The going of sleep that always takes me some time this this takes me a while to relax and actually fall asleep.
527.0,Provider,Okay what's going on in bed time that. makes it hard.
15496.0,Patient,Sometimes you just can't help the thoughts that go into your mind. And I want to like. look into whatever online. That one thing I have tried doing is just you know i'll just watch videos until like I fall asleep I tend to do.
527.0,Provider,"What kind of things, do you think about."
15496.0,Patient,Just anything there's any interest.
527.0,Provider,"yeah What if you kept your journal beside your bed, and as those thoughts popped in you wrote them down."
15496.0,Patient,"Now I see I don't. think that will work, since I tend to just. put in. Well i'm sure my method of just you know just watching videos and not start like wanting to write things or anything like them. Does you know don't try to be productive while you're in bed."
527.0,Provider,The other thing too I just you know if you think about just i'm going to dump these thoughts out on paper and then i'm going to close the book and go to sleep.
15496.0,Patient,"Oh, I see."
527.0,Provider,So that you don't have to keep thinking about them like this is my these are my worries i'll deal with tomorrow.
15496.0,Patient,"Oh, I see. Okay."
527.0,Provider,"Just something to maybe try to see if it, you know this is kind of like a trial and error to Catherine like trying lots of different things and we'll figure out, you know what works best or what you know five or 10 things work best."
15496.0,Patient,I see it's not it's not the worries that keeps me up it's like sometimes if I start thinking about a certain topic like I should have put it like marine library something and then I can't fall asleep because i'm just like. Like hyper fixated on learning about that stuff. it's just like a topic that runs to my mind. So I prefer to just. I guess just just relax and just. Listen to video quality falsely.
527.0,Provider,"Do you ever just listened to, like some relaxation music."
15496.0,Patient,"No, I haven't tried that but I don't know, I guess, though just watching stoked to our philosophy works best for me. Okay yeah it's just I go rare occasions. Where I get you know. Like Oh, I want to watch the show, but then i'll just keep watching episode so it's basically just telling myself like not to do this while i'm trying to. fall asleep. or like scrolling social. Media or anything like that. Basically, just just relax and not try to think about. Other topics. to wake up at six I would have to sleep like around 10. No problem it's just not getting caught up on on the Internet."
527.0,Provider,"So what if you put a time limit on that for you like we're we're putting some limits on other things like if you just gave yourself 30 minutes. And then, at the end of and, at the end of that time or 20 minutes or whatever, and at the end of that time your your timer goes off and it's time to put the electric the electronics up."
15496.0,Patient,I see. Okay. i'll do that. yeah I guess you know i'll give myself an hour to just to relax.
527.0,Provider,Whatever I mean whatever you feel like is and if it's before then that's okay to you know if you're tired before then. Then shut things off and go to bed.
15496.0,Patient,"yeah that's what happened yesterday. I was really like I was trying to grow because i'm trying to make these Christmas ornaments trying to get them done before Christmas, I just had a few days, but i'm close to finish here, but I was like falling asleep on my computer he was like no all this go to bed."
527.0,Provider,Good.
15496.0,Patient,I was tired. But yeah it's definitely my goal to just be productive from five to nine on my interests. nevermind to like 10. that's when i'll fall asleep.
527.0,Provider,Okay. How are you feeling about the schedule now Catherine.
15496.0,Patient,"I forgot nine that's when I like brush my teeth. I even have an alarm for it because, if I don't I just. A proud to say like i'm going to bed answer, or just lay down for a bit and i'll go brush that but I don't. know how an alarm for. All right, um yeah i'm feeling good about the schedule."
527.0,Provider,Good good. And it might be something maybe to review with your aunt to and say here's here's some things i'm working on and trying to put in place that can can help me stay on track and stay focused better.
15496.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm so that so that she can support you making those changes and following your schedule too.
15496.0,Patient,"yeah. Definitely a struggle i'm having now is just willpower like having to keep myself on test, so I really am waiting for next week, when I meet with Dominique about on medication."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah I was gonna say winter, when is your appointment, it is. 29th at 530."
15496.0,Patient,yeah so i'm gonna a day opened up and I didn't have to wait until January.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah make sure you got double reminders so you don't forget that one.
15496.0,Patient,"definitely have the alarm. I definitely put the alarms like. minutes before Oh, speaking of that I have, I have this, I had a room number, but I accidentally like deleted it I don't know weird fingers touching. It will help me get here quicker. I remember you had given me the room number."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, my room number you ready."
15496.0,Patient,Here it is i'm yes i'm ready.
527.0,Provider,Okay it's.
15496.0,Patient,A 482-482-5909 0183366 okay. Andrew.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, but don't forget to check into the virtual clinic before you come over to my room unless you're waiting a long time Okay, with the clinic. Then, then come on in and i'll check in but yeah they like to check you guys in and that way they can update if there's anything on there, in that they need updated like remind you of surveys or make sure your address, and phone numbers still correct or email that kind of stuff."
15496.0,Patient,"Oh, I see. So, like you're an issue I run into with the survey is I would I would complete it, but that one I would you know click to submit it, it would just like refresh."
527.0,Provider,Oh no.
15496.0,Patient,"yeah so I told them, I think, will send me that link again."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay yeah and save that link that way you'll have it all the time. To go do your surveys. yeah it makes sure I think you're doing them on a weekly basis, right now, so probably need to get those up to date, this week."
15496.0,Patient,yeah. I got caught thinking about some.
527.0,Provider,So that may be something you can do after our phone calls to do your surveys real quick get those done.
15496.0,Patient,yeah hopefully there's no glitch this time.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. Really slows down the completion, so it sounds like we've got at least a start, for your schedule until you find a new job and then we'll have to adjust and. change it up again, but do you feel like is there anything else that you want to work on with that or do you feel like that's in a pretty good spot now."
15496.0,Patient,"yeah. i'll rewrite it to like make it neater like growth slowed down, but then I remembered something else I just like squeeze it in there."
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure. yeah I wonder, Catherine if it might be helpful, like to get a dry erase board for you, since your schedule may change frequently I don't know depending on your job and that way you can put it on a dry erase board and then you can erase it and add and change it up. A little easier for you."
15496.0,Patient,I could I do tend to just. I do prefer to just have two separate. Two separate ones on my on my notebook. Okay yeah it's just easier to have around an hour have to worry about making time to switch it around.
527.0,Provider,Okay sure. It was just just something I thought of that might be another option for you.
15496.0,Patient,know I definitely prefer to just have like set in stone here. They all just my work thanks good.
527.0,Provider,"There you go all right, I like that good so What else do we need to be working on what are their goals, do you want to focus on."
15496.0,Patient,"guess. This is just my productivity my focus so i'll say no i'm just hoping to have already with what i'm doing, I hope I schedule so with the medication i'm hoping that or. I won't have to force myself every day. There was another goal. Was you know finding a job and then there's. I guess, a goal, I have is trying to find someone that could test me for any. Any learning difficulties because my psychologists like he was unable to test me for it because my insurance didn't cover. What he suspected like when I was given like instructions for certain tests, I was, I was struggling to do it. and any to look into."
