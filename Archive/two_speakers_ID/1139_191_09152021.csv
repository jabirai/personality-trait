Those for them and they went from 16 overdose all the way down to the you know something they felt fine at that, too, and they may decide. to three years from now. to drop down to one. There is no rush on Aryan okay."
1139.0,Patient,Last time I spoke. We spoke about.
191.0,Provider,The background uh huh.
1139.0,Patient,"So um last time I spoke to you. with Dr jamison a while back, so I am never felt the way that I did. When I was on subjects, when I was pregnant with the girls. I really believe a lot of my pain and and i've had people like. Like tell me oh you're like crazy because you don't know what you're talking about, but I know how my body feels. So I really think that the nail track phone does something to my bones literally and she said, like because I talked to jack Dr jamison and she was like basically. I can only write it write it for you, if you're pregnant and I said, if it's a if it's the well because there's no Blocker in it and you think somebody's gonna get high, then you test me every week. I just so tired of feeling the way that I feel Dr style and it's like i'm a 33 year old woman, and I feel like i'm in an 85 year old man's body who's worked in the field every day of their lives. You know what I mean."
191.0,Provider,You know i'm saying.
1139.0,Patient,"And it's it's affecting my sleep anymore. My back at night and I wake up in the morning it'll take me 10 minutes to get out of bed. I literally have to move leg my leg just little interest at a time to get it off the side of that bed, so I can get myself up, I mean i'm in it's like serious and. No, I don't know. I don't know what else to do and it's like. Be because you know people look at you like well you've been on this long how it I didn't know that there is a difference in the way I could feel until I got pregnant. And was put on subjects, you know what I mean. She told me that I should talk to you about it, you know I mean just see what you have to say, or if there is a way if there isn't a way what else I could do. Because I mean this program is so convenient for me i've been in it, for I don't even know how long now. You know it's convenient because the kids and so on and so forth, and I wouldn't want to like leave this program and go to a regular doctor. Because, sometimes I don't think they're so. tiny recovery. You know, they just want to give you a pill and you'd be out there office."
191.0,Provider,"Right, so we have to focus on the pain management, first I can't swim sw tix and usually it is for women that will people that are either pregnant or breastfeeding or known allergies, so we don't have any of that and then to. i've never addressed your pain yeah."
1139.0,Patient,So we'll.
191.0,Provider,"Address pain, one of the things we have to look at the pain first so you know we have to be held accountable and we're going to have to be very careful about. that one of the things. We may end up having to do and i've had. Patients. Not it by heart health do it. But when it came to the sub you text when you've been clean and you've been sober for so long. There is something called sub look late, which is an injectable form. Of the just the buprenorphine okay not saying it. Do that or anything but that is one option, because I know some people, they may feel more amenable to give you supplicate. than just giving you some tips because you're not going to divert sub located. So just want to plant that seed, but yeah that's something we'd have to look at in the future, right now, won't be able to do that."

1139.0,Patient,You.
191.0,Provider,You can definitely save a life by doing that.
1139.0,Patient,Even in even in your 60s you think. You can still get in the pool and.
191.0,Provider,"yeah yep so I just sent an email for you again, but you have it okay. Okay, I just don't want you to be without it okay so that's all yeah yeah. Okay, Dan all right so i'm only going to do two things at by heart health i'll do your addiction and either your pain management or your addiction or your mental health, but I won't be doing all three. Okay, and I do that to have balance, because I, with telemedicine i'm not there, looking at you check and vital signs. If we do everything, then there's a component of your health that's not being addressed and that's asheville physical vital signs being able to get things done in a timely manner, being able to look at you, you see what i'm saying. You know yeah, so I will consider that a disservice to you to do three things so it looks like mental health needs to be addressed by like your primary care provider. Okay, and she he or she may she or he may choose to get you to someone else okay so we're going to document i'm a hammer transcription document you need a primary care provider. Okay, and I need hands on one hands on you SOFA pain management, we still need a pain management appointment 30 minutes so whenever you're able to do that i'm i'm willing to see you and you need a primary care doctor, so we need to document need a primary care doctor highlight bow. So no gabapentin. And approximately three months will stop it if we can't get get get that primary care gotta get some things on board for your health will do pain management layups at your pain management appointment okay. Yes, so this is the thing when I used to treat pain management outside of Bihar health, there are certain vitamin. deficiencies that contribute to pain, so if all you're doing is treating pain with appeal you're not treating the problem and that's why we're. is so important that we address the problem we don't just put a bandaid on a sore that we address what pain pills, do you putting a bandaid on so. Well yeah we got to look at and see what's going on, and how can we address it and it's a step by step process and it was a huge mind body connection in as a diet connection we talked about all of that, and the pain management group. And we actually have fun to pay management group is on Thursdays at 7pm Eastern standard time and we've had people lose weight and group. Because you know watching just."
1139.0,Patient,I just went to a doctor yesterday for dragon ology appointment. And I weigh 228 pounds never in my life have I weighed 228 pounds.
191.0,Provider,"yeah you don't even look like you, you don't care you wait."
1139.0,Patient,"I work healthy, I think this is like the first time. That i've been like I mean, I think the devil the devil's probably adding to it. You know the way I am but. My problem is that night when everybody goes to bed, I like to sit in my bed watching TV and eat my junk food and then goes. that's probably causing a little bit of to I mean i'm comfortable with my weight well like don't get me wrong but i've never made that much ever."
191.0,Provider,"Right, and you know, some will address that in a group, because what you eat affects your pain increases your inflammation. So we have some really good conversations and people Ashley benefit one of the things people talk about is weight loss, you know and you're not encouraged to talk about it, people too soon, because they want to us to say. yeah legs and we talked about diet and. That mind body connection and exercise, I mean really I feel like it's just a feel good group that helps with the pain, because when you deal with pain. you're dealing with mental health you're dealing with diet lifestyle you're dealing with thoughts pain addresses to address pain, you have to do it on multiple levels, and so I would just love for you to just come and have."
1139.0,Patient,US sound good. sounds good.
191.0,Provider,"So, and the reason we encourage that is that, and then the other thing we look at how other countries deal with pain. And when you look at how other countries deal with it and there's less. peels and looks like for a lot of people less pain and you makes you think will because, for every time you take a pill there's a positive and a negative and so you have to wait it out to see which one is best for you okay."
1139.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"It makes you think differently about your pain you and we have to like for me if I have pain pill depending on what's going on for half the work and get through today, I might take a tylenol or ibuprofen but I don't ever take anything for penalty usually have pain on 52 and. I. may not. appeal twice a high at my last child slide in 44 I don't I took my arm. I might take a pain pill one time a day. Once in a month at much larger over 200 pounds I just changed my lifestyle my pain decreased I changed how thought. Most important, I increase my active and I changed my diet and I will tell you I started thinking, maybe something was in my head, I will eat certain stuff and I felt like I had more pain, I was, I really sugar, salt and fat was the thing that I noticed, especially white sugar. And I love kit kat bar peanut butter cup reese's peanut butter Cup. Especially."
1139.0,Patient,"Coffee I nice strong on me, you know."
191.0,Provider,I get that wrong here.
1139.0,Patient,"i'm like that, like, I can understand where you're coming from completely like totally um I think a lot of it, like my. Sometimes I think a lot of it may be, it may do it the depression depression kicks in, and it may hurt a lot more, you know yeah but then you hurt so bad so much that you are automatically just depressed."
191.0,Provider,"See ya about that see you already know you are with your mind and your body is telling you you already know your body is already sending sending out those cubes Q saying help me don't eat this don't do this or do this. And we need to get your lives, we need to look at your thyroid be 12 level your vitamin D level. yeah so let's move that forward. let's just one step at a time let's have fun when we do all of that that will give us more of a lever to say Okay, maybe we need to look at this as an option, but your insurance company is not going to approve it if we don't have a good reason."
1139.0,Patient,"Okay yeah legally if your chart ever gets reviewed and they say, well, you have to pay it is that you know they come."
191.0,Provider,"They can look at the track record all we've been legitimate Okay, are we being legitimate are we doing quality medicine together and do okay so we'll keep that on the forefront, but let's let's be objective and see what else is going on, OK. OK OK. Let me see review system any thoughts of plans of harming yourself or anyone else. No okay seeing or hearing anything that's not there. No okay any chest pain shortness of breath."
1139.0,Patient,No.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, any stomach pain nausea vomiting diarrhea constipation. Which wouldn't get constipated you."
1139.0,Patient,know that I diarrhea all the time.
191.0,Provider,Chronic area.
1139.0,Patient,I you know over this. past six months or so.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, we need to primary care to check that out."
1139.0,Patient,yeah yeah I know i'm keep on pushing myself to find to get myself a primary because I know that I see one.
191.0,Provider,"yeah and I know you take care of so many people, a lot of people are dependent on you, but really want to encourage you to take care of you. Here you have to got to see what's going on with that chronic diarrhea okay. yeah and I do see that there's some stress and sounds like there's some anxiety and depression going on, too."
1139.0,Patient,"yeah just so crazy I like it was never like that in my life, and so you know these past couple years. Later on, and having children and later on in life that's what what's really gotten like. blows my mind I feel so bad for me in front of my mother and sister for all the years I did because I never understood it, and now I understand it. all too well."
191.0,Provider,"But you know some awareness as one of the first steps to wellness now you know, and I believe you had a strength to overcome it. yeah sometimes we can't do it. immediately because we're taking care of other lives, but you don't forget about it, you still look at that goal, you know what's going to happen. It might happen in one month two months, three months, but it will happen, because I can remember sitting now over 200 pounds with. Two little kids under the age of four and work in and it's overwhelming because you give your life to take care of those little precious lives. And is one of the great want to best use of your time no regrets whatsoever, but there will come a time when you're gonna be able to rise up and you can do it, while they're little because they're such the best people to lose weight with just exercise and they bring so much joy. And yeah they love you babe is so. This is a face this a phase and, as I load one of my friends say this too shall pass. It take care of yourself, let me see what does that say. I came.

191.0,Provider,"It will pass and you, you will look back on this and, but I think it's really good that you are being so honest and you're putting in the work and the thoughts. And you take it just like your sobriety you got sober will guess what same thing with lifestyle changes with changing your diet and getting help saying principal wants to have. It yeah."
1139.0,Patient,"yeah it definitely doesn't all happen overnight. You know, it took me a long time. Yet yep it said to me a long time to realize that, like you know that's what. that's what happened that's why I originally relapse after I got sober some years ago. was because you know. I was like I have this better life, now, why are all these great things coming to me like liar and things falling into place the way they should. And it led me right back out, but just because of that thought process right there you know, and then it doesn't happen overnight, it takes some time, and take some work so."
