Her mom Oh yes, so. I was torn like should I make her comeback here first and like you know, try to relax and you know just because I know that she's grieving or, should I put myself first and tried to recover without her being in the House. So I was torn and then I decided and I talked to my husband that you let her stay in the House for the week. which was last week. And I think I would be able to handle it, so I messaged her and then she was like okay. i'm going to go there and then make sure, and then suddenly she just texted me Okay, make sure you did on Sunday we're going to go to church like this and then you plan we're going to go out Baba blah blah.

That was Okay, so I don't know if. In my in my thinking just hearing her voice gave me the attack. Depending on that because I dropped the my brain is telling me something that I cannot explain and then, when I talked to my husband, I told him that i'm not ready to meet her so we cancelled the plan of seeing her on this week that last week. yeah that's my current problem right now, like how to. Like how to how to deal with that because it's not going to be forever did I not going to see my mom. You know I wanted everything to be fixed I wanted to you know I wanted everything to not go back to how it used to be, but you know I also wanted to see here from time to time, but they cannot be having attacks like this."

14680.0,Patient,"yeah. First, I get. Well, first I get super depressed. Like. yeah like. Okay, let me put it i've self blaming that's the word. Self blaming and then. I feel, then the thoughts come. That I don't have any purpose and then whatever I do is not enough yeah. that's when it develops."
740.0,Provider,"All right, good deal. So this is the next part we talked about the coping strategy. So what are some things that you can do to take your mind off of your problem, without contacting another person."
14680.0,Patient,"Most leave what I do is I divert my attention so i'm into video games. So I. I I do, that their video games and then I just walk away from like, for example, I have an argument with letting my my son or my husband I walk away. glory to and then. I really don't sleep. I don't know I eat. Oh yeah just just that I watch TV I do video games, because I don't really do social media anymore."

14680.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"What was it was one that you would like to try that you know that maybe you'll be able to do. It something that you always wanted to do, but never got to do it."
14680.0,Patient,They can help you relax. I can go back to cycling again but it's just that I cannot find a time because it's been busy.
740.0,Provider,"So if we realistically recycling, are we just gonna put something in the blank."

14680.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"All right. Okay, so growing up what was. Life like."
14680.0,Patient,"It was hard because. We we were brought up in the Philippines. it's the Asian. Country Asian culture and in Asian culture, I think. it's also the same with yours like we cannot really express our opinions when our kids We just need to just be quiet and just listen to whatever the elderly are saying, even though we think that they are wrong in a way we really cannot say. what's in our minds and. In our family i'm. i'm the Third, the second we're family of three I have my two brothers, but i'm the only one who always expresses my mind towards my mom and then. The other two, but two brothers they're just so like quiet, so they call me the black sheep in the family, so I was the first one to move out. And then them, they were still with my with with with relatives, but me, I wanted to live on my own and then that's going against the culture, you know, like what Why are you doing this, you should like you know the how they control, you should be doing."
740.0,Provider,This.
14680.0,Patient,"should go to college, we should bubble blah, so it was hard and then like they when they asked me to go study nursing, you know you have to go, be a nurse, so I did nursing but it's like whatever they want it. You know, it was tough but. I when I started my own family, then at first, they were. They were really they they left me with it like I was the only one dealing with my family, but when my mom started going home stay with me during the weekend, then she developed the attitude of wanting to take control again."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah.
14680.0,Patient,that's how we're family go.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, any any um history of mental health substance abuse or food issues with your family. No okay well, good evening what was the like doing what was school life. Like. Well, you would go."
14680.0,Patient,"Well i'm pretty good at school, so I love going to school so i'm not to brag but among my three brothers, I always get the day awards and stuff so I finished two degrees, I have a degree in human resources, and I also have a degree in nursing so, but those two for. For some circumstances I wasn't able to practice because my husband wanted me to just stay home and take care of the kids until they they're old enough and then maybe I can go back to work. And yeah for for school I love going to school, I have no problems in that."
740.0,Provider,"um. Alright, so let's talk about this. It seemed like. No i'm just gonna a. dude you feel like you implement. Proper boundaries with your mother."
14680.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"Okay that's what it seems like. It seems like download boundaries exist. And that's the problem. you're 37. And so, she feel I get to reveal. You you are, what is it is because I don't want it, I never want to disrespect the culture. So if you're never grown in your parents eyes, like you're always there. yeah oh."
14680.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
740.0,Provider,"Then, whatever I."
14680.0,Patient,"Do with my kids it's always wrong like no, you need to do it this way, you need to do with this way even cleaning the House now, you need to do it this way, so."
740.0,Provider,"that's it so with what I would. Now this is what I see. No nothing but this what I hear I hear that. There are no boundaries that's, the first thing. Second, that. Your mom is a major cause of the stress. um. And the thing about it is. Is that. In order for you to heal. to learn how to be healthy mentally. Do you think that is healthy, for her to say on the earth."
14680.0,Patient,"No. I think, in my opinion, it would be better if she would be in a different place."
740.0,Provider,Okay does she have her own place.
14680.0,Patient,"She would is. from Monday to Friday she's a living caregiver so that's when the weekends, he goes she goes here."
740.0,Provider,Okay. Where are your brothers.
14680.0,Patient,"my brother is a he's in renting a room in sylmar. yeah but he's not married he's he's he's older than me for one year and the youngest is in Dubai okay. So, but, but the our setup it has been like my brother my older brother has never like dealt with my mom his whole life so when this happened. He also started becoming stressed, and he wanted to be like not be a part of the responsibility of taking care of my mom so right now, not only I am not in good terms with my mom but also with my older brother. that's that's the case right now."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, Melissa what what would help you, what do you think is a healthy alternative what, what do you need."
14680.0,Patient,"Well, I need to first I need to build up the courage to say that I need to set the boundaries, and then I need to get the courage to tell them. Like the rules that I wanted like how to live my life. Because I cannot tell I don't know I don't have the strength to the courage to tell my brother, if he can take care of my mom because i'm also thinking of my brother. So. Also, thinking about my mom."
740.0,Provider,"Thank you, so does mom mom make enough to live on her own."
14680.0,Patient,"She does she does but. I don't know because she has this attitude or she she's a cancer survivor. So anything that happens to her like she gets a cold she blames it on the cancer so she's like. Oh i'm like this i'm so pitiful, you know nobody's taking care of me i'm going to get cancer again, you know, like you, kids."
740.0,Provider,Like crazy oh very good trip yeah.
14680.0,Patient,yeah haha. So it's hard.
740.0,Provider,So. It sounds like. Is. um I don't know how it is in California. Do they have. Senior citizen apartments in California. yeah you still living community living type stuff in California.
14680.0,Patient,"yeah they do, but she's not qualified yet she's not a senior yeah."
740.0,Provider,How old is she.
14680.0,Patient,"she's 63 and to qualify, you need to be 65."
740.0,Provider,"Is there for all of us are you sitting in the car. me know okay okay so. There may once again what's an alternative, because if they improved in the UK stay with you."
14680.0,Patient,"yeah well alternative is for my brothers to to take her because my brother or also burns a lot, but I don't know, for some reason he doesn't want to get his own place and. I know this is my issue but it's my brother also like he has been engaged for many times and he always cause of the engagement, so I think, in my opinion, my brother doesn't want to take responsibility and is not mature like he doesn't want to start a family. For some reason, so now. My plan is to make him take care of my mom right now."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14680.0,Patient,yeah that's it but.
740.0,Provider,"Everything is like floating. ya know, but when we get on the phone. We need to figure this thing out and all the reason why I say that is because. Of the fact that. No argument that you and your mother hey basically basically. pushed you. almost to the age. of taking your life. yeah because that's what you felt like they wanted from you, was for you not to be here any longer that's not healthy. it's not healthy it's not. And so what you have to do, and a lot of times saying you know, and I said i'd never want to disrespect your culture. never wants to disrespect disrespect it never wants to go against it. And that's why he to you saying how. What do you think Dr you should be and how what how you want to go about doing this because. You know, at the end of the day. Yes, all cultures are different but life is life. Right, you only get one. yeah you know i'm saying, and so the last thing I would want is for you. To be triggered because that's what it is you get on the phone with your mom and they you tremblay y'all know what to say. You know you feel it's like it's like putting you back in and childhood. you're not not being able to say anything to your mother. Yes, and. You know if that is this dangerous I mean that's the best way I can put it. Right it's not healthy. Yes, right so. Maybe, hopefully, you and brother can come up with some kind of situation. And I don't know if he knows what happened with you. yeah he does, if you know so that's that's when you express to him. i'm trying to get better and he'll mentally. So I can't do that and and have mom. Under in the same place with me. So is it possible that she can come and stay with you on the weekend moving forward until I completely heal. that's just I mean that that's just type of conversation that you have."
14680.0,Patient,"yeah. And right yeah that's the plan that i've been thinking. But the courage to say that. To my. my brother. Like is what I lack and then I tend to I tend to overthink it like what's going to happen if I say it, then I think of the results already, even though it's not happening, yet, then I get stressed."
740.0,Provider,"yeah so you say, one of the most most important reason for living at this moment all your two boys and your husband. So, knowing that those three people. are the most important people in your life right now. If. You. don't have the conversation with them. That will lead you put yourself at risk. of another episode. And then, they have to go through this again. And what happens again to be what happens if we go over the edge like if we go ahead and take action Meta you i'm saying. Because we understand their mom in severe trigger mom pushes you to heart mom causes too much stress it comes to my things it. You know. It just so mom is not healthy for you."
14680.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So you so what I say that to say this. I need you to remember those two handsome boys. you're loving hosting. That you say all your reasons for living. and allowed that to be the animation to build you some courage to make their phone call. Does that make sense. Yes, because I guarantee they just say everything motto a year, a year old i'm not i'm not gonna lose a model. Right and so, if you're interested just really important right now. Right. Because we know that there has been so many attempts in the past. I don't know if this one was the word."
14680.0,Patient,"Was this one, the way it is, it is the word."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so that means they keep doing worse right so every attempt that you hate. It keeps getting worse. Right, that means I keep going a little step further. And then I go a little bit further, and then I go alyssa so if this was the worst one, then we don't know what the next one will be and I don't want I don't want that to be a niche. Right. yeah I don't want the relation with the Ad do not want them to be next one. All I know is. Is that in this in this situation now this you have joined this program you have to allow it to work for you first."
14680.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Before you can say i'm sure, even though to learn my mama live with a I mean to be with us on a weekend. Doing. Because, and the reason why I say that is because you're not in because you're not you said you lack confidence so that means you're not even able to put the boundary between your mother. and your your mom. So, since we're not strong enough to put to to. implement their boundaries, been the best thing to do if it's kind of like avoid it altogether."
14680.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"i'm saying so. That that's just that's just the route. That I see right now. yeah, mind you i'm just a suggestion. i'm just I want you to be safe. I want you to be able. breathe right and knowing that. That you're in a safe place being under your roof it's tough when you're under your roof in your own home and you don't feel safe."
14680.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
740.0,Provider,"Right, because if you came to a place for your home they won't you won't feel facing. yeah yeah i'm saying so. Think about how to boy."
14680.0,Patient,Cry i'm sorry.
