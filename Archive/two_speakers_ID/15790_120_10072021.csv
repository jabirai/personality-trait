120.0,Provider,"Yes, that's that's always a plus."
15790.0,Patient,"yeah and it's kind of an adjustment, just like with like having to like like do my own thing with my meal plan just because it's like i'm not eating, at the same times, as everyone else so yesterday was a bit hectic. Because I figured i'd packed meals for the day, so I didn't stress myself out and then I forgot the math tomatoes. So I had to figure out what to eat like during the day, but other than that it's pretty good like see my family and stuff."
120.0,Provider,"Good good, it is a little bit of a kind of like we're not in Kansas anymore kind of. You know. But. i'm. All right, that's good, though, that you were able to go to a place that at least in the same state. yeah man so cool how long were you there for."

15790.0,Patient,"Know it's my niece. She let me think um it wasn't fun, by any means, but I did need that I think i'm glad that I went because it wouldn't be like this right now, if I hadn't gone i'd probably be in like not so good shape. So i'm glad that I went."
120.0,Provider,"Good good. Did you go through like. resident i'll be like all the levels of care, like residential and. i'm here."
15790.0,Patient,"I didn't go through they had like the House that has like the people that really aren't doing well and like need like more like intensively care. I didn't go there, I went. residential and php."
120.0,Provider,"alright. So. My first question I wanted to ask you is basically. Why you're seeking help now and i'm assuming it's good you're looking for a step down. Is that yeah is that what they want it okay that's what you're recommending. yeah okay. And what what motivates you to work on yourself to change like are you. Do you want it or is it, this can everyone everyone else telling you you're supposed to do this."
15790.0,Patient,"yeah I. um I mean. At the meadows, I put in a lot of fucking work, so I keep the momentum going with that and not link step backwards as soon as I get home i'm really trying to avoid relaxing I don't want that. So I mean if it's more of a meeting like this is what I want for myself. So just like kind of keeping it going all that."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, good um do you think that your like eating disorder negatively affects your life, like in your relationships or school or work that kind of thing."
15790.0,Patient,yeah hundred percent.
120.0,Provider,yeah How does it affect things.
15790.0,Patient,"i'm in my eating disorder, I completely stopped talking to people at work, I kept having leave early. And I was like i'm a phlebotomist so I mean like when your hands are shaking and your coordination because you haven't eaten in like two days like you start like missing veins and you're like hurting people. And like it was really worrying my family, and I mean like now that like I look at old pictures of myself i'm like oh like that's not good, because, like I didn't see it as that so i'm. Definitely like it was hard to function, or like do anything I was either like sleeping or just sitting there with my mouth open not saying anything."
120.0,Provider,"yeah and. she's like. she's like she's like freaking anyway um. yeah no I mean it makes sense, like when you're like I want to have a life and not have to be. You know, making like this interfere with the life that i'm trying to build myself. make sense Okay, and regards to your treatment history, I know you are the meadows, have you done other eating disorder treatments or was that the only one."
15790.0,Patient,"No, that was."
120.0,Provider,Okay. Were you doing any outpatient prayer that.
15790.0,Patient,um you know I had a counselor and a psychiatrist and. They weren't helpful they didn't know much about eating disorders.
120.0,Provider,"Okay yeah a lot of them don't. they're kind of their own animal. yeah so. They. Do you do you know if you have any like dietitians and therapists in your area that you're going to be able to meet with me, what will i'm sure will meet with you for for a while, but I mean like wouldn't eventually."
15790.0,Patient,I have an appointment with a dietitian tomorrow over zoom there's none of new motto.
120.0,Provider,"Really it's pretty pretty sparse okay. Okay i'm glad that you're looking into that i'm. Sorry i'm not i'm trying to write this stuff down. Okay i'm. Okay. So, can you this can be kind of the an overview of of your eating disorder like when it started what the behaviors have been, and you know kind of what's changed for you, since being in treatment because I recognize that right now is different than prior to treat."
15790.0,Patient,"yeah. It was hard like answering all the questions like Oh, do you. Do this and i'm like no. yeah exactly yeah."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah I understand.
15790.0,Patient,"I. i've always had kind of an odd relationship with food, like, I remember being like eight years old and like wrapping my stomach and like clear plastic rob and doing workouts in my room and like. skipping meals I i've always like skipped meals, to be like thinner I didn't start like blatantly like deliberately like starving probably till a year ago. Okay, and it just kept like like downward spiraling and probably about three months ago, maybe four months ago I started, like the purging and i've been taking laxatives since like. December last year. And, before I went to the meadows I. I think I hadn't eaten maybe like three days. And I had gone to the hospital my say hi introduce me to the hospital and my parents were kind of just play um you're going to treatment or we're going to try to Title unit and it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa. whoa yeah. I went to the meadows and it was kind of like a I was ready by the time I got there, I was like Okay, this needs to stop like i've had enough I just need the extra push. So I mean like it was hard, but it really helped that I was already ready for it."
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So yeah. That does make a difference okay um so. Most of your eating disorder, it sounds like was related to kind of restricting starving yourself, basically, and then, but you mentioned about three or four months ago he started purging and that who vomiting or. Exercise or all the."
15790.0,Patient,vomiting.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, how much, would you vomit."
15790.0,Patient,Like how often it was about it wasn't very often just because I wasn't eating anything but it was anytime i'd like slip up and have like a little something that had to go. So it was either i'd take laxatives. or I just like self induced vomit so it wasn't super often it maybe like. seven times.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, like total during that. That four month period. yeah okay. And was a laxative use like daily or was that, just after you feel like you ate too much."
15790.0,Patient,i'm probably. Three or four times a week.
120.0,Provider,"And then, what about like exercise was was that something that you engaged into like an excessive way."
15790.0,Patient,"um at one point, yes, about a year ago I like RON and RON and RON RON like do you like the whole like. exercises in my room thing, but then like when I just like stopped eating I didn't really have the energy to do any of that. So I didn't exercise much. This past few months."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, that would make sense, because you didn't have any energy to spare. What about bingeing do you ever have binges where you feel like completely out of control and you just you like your brain takes over. I mean you're like you're you're just eating, so no benches okay. Okay um. And so, even though it's kind of hard to know how you're doing right."
15790.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
120.0,Provider,"What do you like when you're a php did you get to. plan your own meals, or how did they work it."
15790.0,Patient,"um they had like a menu on like a weekly menu everything that we were going to eat throughout the week we prepare it all of our meals like we would have groups that did it. And then, like three four times a week, we would make our breakfast The night before if we have like an early morning so i've been getting into like the making my own breakfast and stuff that's probably the easiest thing for me."
120.0,Provider,"Good especially cuz you can do it the night before or think about it before for sure okay. Right. What did he had some medical complications from this, I mean you had to go to the er so i'm assuming that there was some concern about your medical safety. Like. Sir."
15790.0,Patient,"um I was having some chest pain, I never really I went to a cardiologist once and then stopped going because I wasn't I didn't want to know. And when I got sent she said that I looked yellow and that will she actually dropped me she like cancelled are. Like treatment because she didn't want anything to do with what I was doing. So I don't I mean my labs all looked fine it never really made sense to me. Like I got like my discharge papers from the meadows and, most of it looks fine there's a few things that are like um, but most of it looks fine. So I don't think i've had any like super I mean with the laxatives and stuff I started not being able to control, like any like bowel movements i've been just like shit my pants like all the time."
120.0,Provider,Oh yep uh huh.
15790.0,Patient,But that's since like stop since being at the meadows i'm.
120.0,Provider,Like good. Good that's not so fun side effective.
15790.0,Patient,Tell me about it.
120.0,Provider,"yeah i'm only doing this for sure so okay. So you mentioned fatigue, so that was i'm sure a big one, and then, did you have like did you get like dizzy when you stood up or sit down. And to get that like black. room, you know, like that that kind of weird thing so probably some ortho static blood pressure issues. What about like temperature, did you get cold a lot, I mean you know you're Arizona in the summer, so you know I don't."
15790.0,Patient,know it was so weird because everyone be like oh my God it's so hot outside and like that's the only time I was without my sweater like I was standing and I but yeah I was freezing.
120.0,Provider,"So unusually cold compared to everybody else yeah. All right, did you lose your period. Yes, okay. So you very you know definitely had some medical stuff going on, what about like hair loss things like that. Okay. You know, one of the things that's interesting about the body is how amazing it is at at trying to balance the crap that we do to it yeah i'm recovered myself like I get. kind of what you're right yeah. But anyway, so like you know, even though your labs didn't show it, you know your body is showing that it's. struggling because it's like letting go up the things that aren't as important. So I know that's one of the things that's that's tough when we do labs because it they might look Okay, but that doesn't mean that your body's okay. there's a lot of pieces that are kind of you know, evidence of your body going i'm. dying, so you know. Okay um how tall, are you."
15790.0,Patient,i'm sizer four.
120.0,Provider,"By four Okay, and do you happen to know your weight, or do you, is it offline I wait. Okay, do you know, did they tell you, if you've reached like bill your weight range they wanted you to be in. Meaning meaning you don't know or that."
15790.0,Patient,They didn't tell me I assumed that I had when they started decreasing my meal plan.
120.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15790.0,Patient,i'm assuming that i'm there.
120.0,Provider,"Okay yeah yeah cuz sometimes i'll have you on that kind of weight restoration meal plan and then what kind of put you on like a maintenance. yeah so so you're pretty sure you're in a zone that you're that they thought was going to be good for you. yeah okay. Do you know, like what were you weighing yourself, before going to treatment. How often were you were yourself."
15790.0,Patient,um multiple times a day.
120.0,Provider,"For pretty obsessively. Year Okay, and what was your lowest weight and when."
15790.0,Patient,"The day the night before I went to treatment um I weighed myself, and I think I was like 99 pounds okay."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and then what about like a highest way that you know that you remember as an adult."
15790.0,Patient,"um I remember. Being like. 125 at one point, maybe closer to 130 somewhere in there."
120.0,Provider,"Okay okay um. Another us you mentioned weighing yourself a lot before so number for a pretty big deal for you, how do you has that shifted at all, or do you still feel pretty triggered by talking about numbers."
15790.0,Patient,"um sometimes triggering um I don't really know, though I haven't been around it all that much out of treatment and as of right now, I have no interest in knowing my way. whatsoever so i'm assuming it would still be a trigger I. Honestly don't know what it would what would happen if I knew my weight i've got like a ballpark idea and i'm just sitting with it like i'm just like I don't want to know the actual number. yeah i'm just because I mean like it's helpful, knowing that I was never supposed to be what the weight, I was when I went into treatment to begin with, so like that's helpful, but I young numbers are still pretty triggering."
120.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, I always like to kind of throw out the idea of finding other ways of assessing your overall life. Satisfaction or contentment that aren't weight related like, how do you measure your kind of happiness levels or your you know relationships things like that that are more important than a number. i'm glad that you're staying away from that. How do you feel about your body right now."
15790.0,Patient,"um it's an adjustment i've been having a pretty hard time I don't fit in any of my pants anymore, so I had to go buy some yesterday, but I mean like it was I mean I just went and bought new pants. Good press Western me to begin with. They were illiterate child size pants so. I mean. I just went and bought new pens, I mean yeah I mean it's still kind of hard, just like I had gone through my phone with my therapist Dr meadows. And deleted, like all the body checks and everything so i've still been struggling with that, just like not being able to like see the things that I could see when I was sick like bones and whatnot. So I mean it's an adjustment, just like with my body looking different."
120.0,Provider,and
15790.0,Patient,All that but.
120.0,Provider,"It sounds like you're working hard at trying to accept it, though, and."
15790.0,Patient,yeah I.
120.0,Provider,learned to appreciate it.
15790.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
120.0,Provider,"So overall better body image, then you. have had before treatment, but I mean like as far as being willing to try to accept your body. But still struggle with struggling tried to appreciate it okay. um so overall relatively poor body image, but working at it, which is cool. um and you're trying not to body check which is awesome sounds like used to do that a lot, especially if it's on your phone. yeah pictures. yeah um do you have any current food rules for yourself like I can't eat this or I can do that or. Things that are especially scary for you."
15790.0,Patient,"Nothing restrictive right now, because at the meadows, I like I think i've gone through all nightmare foods have tomatoes and I would least try them once, if not more than once, so i'm not like it's better i'm like out of here and i'm like not so i'm not like scared of things anymore. yeah it's still challenging but I mean i'm able to do it i'm not just like no i'm absolutely not going to eat that at least try it."
120.0,Provider,Good what what types of foods are the hardest for you.
15790.0,Patient,um I scream is probably the biggest one. burgers. Always oil and foods i'm. liquid calories like juices minis milkshakes. peanut butter.
120.0,Provider,peanut butter so yummy.
15790.0,Patient,I know I just had it for breakfast.
120.0,Provider,"I know I went once I. kind of was able to like get past the fear of it, I was like wow."
15790.0,Patient,I feel so much better when I eat this.
120.0,Provider,yeah your body feels better you're like oh. yeah different yeah.
15790.0,Patient,yeah definitely. I think that's some that's done yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, good. um in addition to the eating disorder, do you have any other mental health diagnosis is like depression or anxiety that you've that you have been diagnosed with or that you know about."
15790.0,Patient,"They diagnosed with depression and put me on medication and honestly I think one was causing the other, and I think it was my eating disorder it's making me depressed I don't think i'm depressed I at the meadows, I completely went off my medication and I I feel great."
120.0,Provider,"You feel pretty good now. yeah well even restricting definitely can cause that. yeah no because your body feels like it's dying. So you're off the medication now. cool are you on any other medications. Right and then so anxiety wise you feel, and you know, like you manage your stress without like flying off the handle. yeah good any like i'm like ptsd type of stuff trauma related stuff. um that you're aware of, or."
15790.0,Patient,"I did a bit of trauma work at the meadows um I don't know how much i'd be willing to work with it now. Just like. I did, like the whole like survivors week workshop and stuff. And it was really helpful but i'm just like abuse and stuff like that okay okay."
120.0,Provider,"You know, and one of the you know ideas about trauma, at least in my experience of it is you know if you don't feel the need to deal with it, you know, maybe you're not ready and that's Okay, too."
15790.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, you can do whatever you need to do to keep yourself feeling okay so. So I mean if you didn't have a ptsd diagnosis, it would be like a lot of intrusive thoughts about it a lot of memories and and nightmares are like triggering things in the environment that remind you of it like we're interferes with your life you think any of those things exist. makin kind of stuff."
15790.0,Patient,Nothing major known no.
120.0,Provider,"All right, um. Any history of suicidal ideation or planning or behaviors."
15790.0,Patient,"A long time ago, probably when I was like. 12 or 13."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. So nothing, nothing recently, do you feel pretty safe to yourself, most of the time. Okay, what about like self harming behaviors anything like that going on."
15790.0,Patient,i'm not right now now.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe some of the past but not. Okay um any history of substance abuse. Okay. Do you do you use alcohol at all."
15790.0,Patient,i'm socially.
120.0,Provider,"All right, um. And then in regards to like your family is there any history of mental illness in your family."
15790.0,Patient,"My oldest sister has some mental health issues i'm not exactly sure what, but I believe there's some ptsd in there."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. And what about like your parents or grandparents doing you do they have depression, anxiety addiction."
15790.0,Patient,I don't think so.
120.0,Provider,"I don't know okay. um and, what is your current living situation so little leaf."
15790.0,Patient,"yeah I live at home with my parents my older sister my brother in law, my niece and my nephew and my grandmother typically lives here, but she just had a lung transplant so she's in phoenix right now."
120.0,Provider,lung transplant. yeah wow.
15790.0,Patient,And my twin sister also lives here.
120.0,Provider,"Somehow you have a twin sister. yeah okay. Okay, and are so your parents together them. Okay, all right, as always, I thinking that they weren't but I, but I might be mixing up yes."
15790.0,Patient,"yeah he's he adopted me, probably in like the seventh grade my biological father is in prison oh."
120.0,Provider,"Okay that's what I. was thinking that your bio was not there. So your biological dad is in prison, but your spirit your stepdad who you you consider your dad adopted adopted you okay. All right, um. And how do you feel about your like home situation is, it would you feel do you feel like it's pretty positive for you and supportive, or is there a lot of tensions best there."
15790.0,Patient,"it's pretty comfortable my family still adjusting to the whole eating disorders thing like they think it's completely unreasonable for me to ask them to not comment on my body and not tell me I look healthy right now. or something a bit rocky just because they're getting used to it and i'm like, how do you think I feel like it's hard for me. But I mean overall it's pretty supportive good."
120.0,Provider,"Did they do some kind of education about it there, so they can kind of recognize why it's important to not comment about body and things like that."
15790.0,Patient,"yeah we did a family session. Over zoom at the meadows and my therapist tried like with the like this is why it's important to not say anything about her body and like. My belly was just kind of like but we never and i'm like Why is an issue, are you throwing a fit. Right not not commenting on my body so."
120.0,Provider,"Right and i'm like themselves. yeah okay. That makes sense um, what is your relationship like with with your mom."
15790.0,Patient,"um i've gotten super close to my mom and my eating disorder, just like she's like been like worried and like does a lot for me like. we're going to go today and buy whatever groceries I need for my meal planning so she's it's good, but my dad it's good, very good he's great I don't have a bad relationship with any of my family members."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, good. um you mentioned your twin sister lives there sometimes."
15790.0,Patient,"Yes, she. just got married and even before that she barely comes home she's always at her girlfriend wife house. Okay, she doesn't really show up for anything that she was supposed to pick me up for treatment yesterday at 730 in the morning, she didn't show up to like 838 45 so she was late picking it from treatment and. she's she doesn't show up she's not reliable my whole family knows that she's not reliable if you need something you're not going to ask her for it because she wanted to do it. Okay, so."
120.0,Provider,"So, are you more you kind of the one who is always trying to do things right and doing. Being on time. Things like that yeah she's kind of the opposite in. um. And then do interact with your bio data at all, or is that totally gone totally gone okay. Spam call. It spam. Alright, so you haven't talked to him since 2013 2013 okay. All right, um. let's see law, so you have an older sister a twin sister. And anybody else in any other siblings."
15790.0,Patient,"I have a brother he lives in the same town as me he kind of does his own thing now. The older, yes, yes, Tim he's 10 years older than me."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, for quite a bit older. Okay um but you get along with with them all pretty well, even if you're you know, some are closer to you than others. Okay um are you dating anyone do you have any romantic relationships going on. Okay. um, can you tell me a little bit more about like your childhood like how things were when you were kid."
15790.0,Patient,"I have very minimal memory on my childhood and, like the stuff surrounding my biological father's name is paused if that's What about around pause very limited i've got maybe like three before memories with him in it. And I think my mom and pause divorced, and I was in the second grade and my mom brought my dad into the picture, I think, also in second grade so pretty quickly and. You think I wasn't my mom was pretty strict growing up. And she's calmed down quite a bit since meeting my dad but it's always been pretty difficult to be around her when I was younger just because she was so like mean. Okay."
120.0,Provider,"But she's chilled more now. yeah right. So, not a lot of warm fuzzy for you growing up. Okay um. And then your relationship with your stepdad is that pretty I mean what was that, like when you were little."
15790.0,Patient,"um well when I first met him I just thought he was my mom's like friend who needed a place to stay. Okay, and I didn't know they were married until I saw everyone my mom's finger. yeah yeah she didn't really bother to tell us, I just kind of figured it all, but he was always really fun, he was like my buddy. Before they got married and then. Was it was kind of an adjustment like getting adopted and having to call him dad I was like. Wait away. Like and now he's great he does everything he, like he's the one that like scrambled to find the money to send me to treatment like it wasn't really important."
120.0,Provider,"cool sounds like he's a good guy for you. yeah your family, how did you do in school."
15790.0,Patient,"And I was really good at school, up until my eating disorder and then I almost failed, like all my classes senior year we had to pay someone to pass them, for me, but I mean when my brains, all the way there i'm pretty good at it mm hmm."

So we were always in trouble for that. And like getting in trouble for like for getting chores and it's like. Like even then my brain wasn't like really functioning, because I was already restricting so like that was like in high school, I always get in trouble for forgetting stuff and i'm like it's not my fault."
120.0,Provider,Like I my brain isn't working.
15790.0,Patient,yeah I know and I didn't really know that it was because I wasn't eating that my brain wasn't functioning and I was so forgetful so I was in trouble quite a bit.
120.0,Provider,Okay that's interesting how like. Your sister. You would get in trouble for things that your sister kind of was doing.

120.0,Provider,"that's got to be hard to think about because you're like I don't know. So there's there's. probable a B or possible abuse from dad that you don't remember, but you do remember stuff from mom but she denies it. Is that right okay. Any like physical abuse."

15790.0,Patient,"know if i'm not working i'm in my room with my plants cleaning I do a lot of cleaning, just like organizing moving stuff around okay."
120.0,Provider,"Okay um well that's all the questions that I have for you, I think that you'd be fine for the program I don't see any reason why why it wouldn't be appropriate for you. um the I always kind of tell people that. You know, whenever it's a virtual program it's a little trickier because you know you do have to practice a lot of. kind of self management. yeah cuz you could lie your whole way through it and. We would know. You know. yeah so because we're not going to be like micromanaging you. So it's kind of a good a good challenge for that you know, but also, you have to be wanting it, which sounds like you are, which is cool and and in regards to like weight and all that we generally. Since you're mostly weight restored, I think that you probably will have to wait every couple of weeks, but that's up to your dietitian. and As long as you're following your meal plan and there's no question about that and generally how we do, that is, you know going to your doctor and doing a blind wait and then having."
15790.0,Patient,them send it to us.
120.0,Provider,"or somebody else, and you know if you, you know if you have somebody else that you trust they can do that, but usually it's better to not have family members involved with that. yeah, especially if they're not real savvy on how to approach it. yeah So do you have any questions for me."
15790.0,Patient,um I don't think so.
120.0,Provider,"cool um alright, so I will let the team know and. We might be able to have you started as soon as Monday. group, what are you in mountain time or Pacific time right now, or what time is it right now, where you are."
15790.0,Patient,It is 848.
120.0,Provider,Your Pacific time or like because I know you guys don't do daylight savings. So i'm. In Arizona right yeah cuz it isn't the time doesn't change there.
15790.0,Patient,I have no idea.
120.0,Provider,Do you know what daylight savings is.
15790.0,Patient,"i've heard of it, I don't know what it is, I don't know it, mountain or Pacific time is i'm just hanging out with the time."
120.0,Provider,"that's unlike what time is it right there so you're. you're an hour behind me here Pacific time. By know Arizona half the year they're in mountain time and half the year they're in. Pacific time because of. Because they don't. switch like everybody else's. I think so anyway um. So group for you would be three to six Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. And then, and then the individual sessions, for your therapist and dietitian will be kind of as as your schedule fits with there so that's more flexible. Okay. Do you have any you know any other questions for me or anything."
15790.0,Patient,"what's the group on what was it Monday, Tuesday Thursday."
120.0,Provider,"Sorry, my cat is making. You just like I will walk the cat loves you, for some reason it's like to put themselves right involved with anything. What did you ask him about what what group."
15790.0,Patient,What is the group you're talking about.
120.0,Provider,"So so because you're expressing, for I O p."
15790.0,Patient,uh huh.
120.0,Provider,"there's three groups, a week it's there on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from three to six says three hours. and So for out with I O P, you know, because you did php which was pretty much every day I O P, is a step down so it's 11 hours a week. And then, a step down from that is just outpatient where you're just meeting with a therapist. So the groups it's three to six Monday, Tuesday Thursday and it's a three hour block of time, but there's two groups back to back so different therapists run it but you're with the same group of people."
15790.0,Patient,Okay.
120.0,Provider,Does that make sense.
15790.0,Patient,Yes.
120.0,Provider,Is that what you were expecting.
15790.0,Patient,um no I didn't know. That I was doing I O p.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, what are you I was thinking you were that that's what you're looking for, are you looking for just outpatient. Yes, oh OK OK um Do you know what your. What was recommended to you by the meadows."
15790.0,Patient,"um they really didn't tell me anything they made the appointments for me and I just signed the paper. Okay, because I don't like pretty new to all this."
120.0,Provider,And you're also super young they're like.
15790.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just like. Okay i'll sign it. But um. I they yeah they didn't tell me, I was doing I op. Because they asked me, and I remember saying that I wasn't interested in iot I would prefer. Just outpatient."
120.0,Provider,"Oh OK OK, I didn't I didn't know that so. yeah I mean. And we're i'm sure we can. Do outpatient as long as you can maintain you know. If it feels like you're. You know slipping a little bit, then they would recommend jump back about bouncing up to I O p. yeah you know the point of doing a step down is to kind of slowly take away the supports you know managing on your own. yeah um but it's you know it's up to you, you can decide that. So so right now you're my understanding that you're more interested in just outpatient. yeah OK, so the dietitian that you're meeting with is that, through us or somebody else."
15790.0,Patient,"I think it's to someone else I don't remember Okay, let me check my paper. I think it's i'm pretty positive it's someone else but i'll double check it. yeah it's just al-khan health and wellness."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, do you happen to know if they're eating disorder specify."
15790.0,Patient,have no idea okay.
120.0,Provider,"All right. I hope so too, because it's a different world the disorder dieticians versus you know some other types so. Okay, well, I will let amanda know that and she'll check on your insurance and everything and. And we'll also look at the recommendation that meadows, we tend to follow the recommendations of centers. That have spent time with you, so they might want you to do I O P for a couple weeks. I don't know if that's something that you're willing to do, but they might suggest that. The kind of help you get you know transition back into regular life but, but I will let them know about which. I will let her know about that and don't see that she goes over and scratches on my planner remember she wants I. swear it's always on the planner to my room. let's see. Now I know you're annoying. So okay alright well we'll we'll be in touch then and i'm will i'll talk to the team about kind of what you're hoping for and we'll go from there."
15790.0,Patient,Alright okay.
120.0,Provider,"Alright, thanks for being willing to meet this morning."
15790.0,Patient,Thank you.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, see you later I. feel like I got. Okay, so um diagnosis is our anorexia nervosa binge purge subtype. On. rule out ptsd I think it's probable but. I think that she doesn't do to catch from it so we'll out maybe. But I don't think she meets requirements or meets. criteria for the for depression or anything like that, right now, so just the eating disorder and then the recommendation is. I O P, if that was supported by the meadows. But or or outpatient with the plan to go to IP if she. feels like she's slipping."
