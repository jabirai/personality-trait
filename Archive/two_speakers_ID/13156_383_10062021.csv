383.0,Provider,"Do you know it's getting it's getting it's getting a lot easier, though."
13156.0,Patient,"Like as the months go by it's like kind of like how I how I was when I was using like that mindset, you know I felt like everything was okay. was using but really it wasn't. Now, like these past three months had been like really hard but it's starting to get a lot easier starting to feel like like i'm not high, but like i'm they come on life, you know not not I don't need like a substance anymore to. Do you know, to get the normal feeling I guess."
383.0,Provider,yeah well that's great i'm glad you're able to access some feelings of like high on life type of. experience.
13156.0,Patient,"yeah it's Nice, I remember, I remember, I remember Donald and Robbie telling me like when I first started with by heart like because I was kind of struggling they were like yeah just give it time and you know, I was kind of. scared that I wasn't going to feel normal again and I remember them both telling me like just keep my head up and i'll feel normal again we just got to give it time. In this year that's kind of slowly what's happening, which is just kind of Nice."
383.0,Provider,"Good good i'm so glad to hear that, how are you doing just taking care of daily responsibilities and. Trying to help around the House and feel. Your motivation motivation doing."
13156.0,Patient,"He don't know I think I still need more motivation, I think, like moving to North Carolina will give you that motivation, where we'll have a job and. Be more settled. What was the question again i'm sorry."
383.0,Provider,In terms of how are you doing in terms of like taking care of.
13156.0,Patient,"Daily response care of my son. i've been keeping my area clean still make my bed take the trash out from my mom. Just make sure my living areas. is clean, you know she doesn't like it when it's dirty. makes it easier for everybody if i'm doing my chores and everything."
383.0,Provider,and
13156.0,Patient,"i've been i've been putting my fingernails. A lot or you know, keeping up on my hygiene, make sure my fingernails and toenails or cut and showering at least two at least two days a week, I should probably get that higher up, though. Maybe like three or four times a week."
383.0,Provider,yeah. I think that that would be a good goal for you. how's your sleep been.
13156.0,Patient,"spread the same. Some days I wake up some days during the week I wake up a little later than I should. But it's way better than it used to be so used to sleep all day, and now I actually sleep at least like four hours a night now so that's good."
383.0,Provider,Okay. Tell me a bit more about your sleep schedule what time do you.
13156.0,Patient,"My mom goes to bed at like eight. every night and then she goes upstairs and I usually stay downstairs and watch TV and tie fall asleep usually I know we said I should probably turn the TV off, but I haven't really. Practice that yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Do you leave the TV on then, and just fall asleep to it on."
13156.0,Patient,yeah for some reason. For like the longest time i've always liked sleeping with the TV on for some reason.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Well that's you know interesting to know that that's something that brings you some comfort, it must. bring you some sense of comfort to have the."
13156.0,Patient,"Day, because when I don't have the TV on I noticed like when I was with my dad in San Diego and the hotel room, you told me to turn the TV off I didn't want to. But I did so, you could get some sleep and I just sat there with my eyes open for like two hours, when I couldn't fall asleep without the TV on. So maybe it just helps me, maybe it relaxes me to fall asleep I guess."
383.0,Provider,yeah I still falling asleep though you think like pretty late in the night.
13156.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I don't know exactly what time I fall asleep but it's probably like around two or three. Okay, and then I usually sleep until the morning time to my mom comes down she she wakes me up and then I walk upstairs and sleep till about 12 on my bed, and then make up."
383.0,Provider,Okay. well. it's. Good you know it sounds like you're still sort of in in a cycle of. You know recovery. yeah your body is still. yeah I don't know why it's been.
13156.0,Patient,"A while since i've used in this is how I used to sleep, when I was using for some reason it's been hard to break this habit and i've kind of been like this, my whole life to. Just like sleeping on the weekends, you know I didn't have school to sleep almost all day. My parents wouldn't like it, but no do it."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
13156.0,Patient,"Yes, so it's been like that."
383.0,Provider,"It could have been that you have had you've been struggling with depression for for a while, you know."
13156.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. yeah depression, anxiety and substance use, I think I had like some some of that stuff like my dad had when I was in high school and like as a kid but he refused to get me medicated also like on adderall or I think a doctor said I needed adderall or something back then in high school. I don't think I need it now, but my they wanted me to be on it my dad refused to put me on it. You know, and probably needed other medication to I don't know because i've always felt like nervous like you said a while ago, and one of our one on ones, and like more like on the shy side is like. Just like as a person. And that's kind of how was in high school Maybe it was anxiety, instead of being shy I don't know but. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"And, and do you think there's been some depression there as well."
13156.0,Patient,"yeah probably watching my parents and you know, seeing them not going along didn't really feel good as a kid."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. yeah so you know there's environments that help us feel happier and then there's environments that that just bring us down, you know, and when there's conflict when there's when there's conflict when there's fighting that that doesn't bring happiness, you know. doesn't and especially during your child there's nothing you can do you can't make adults be happy, I mean you can't make adults get along. really rather powerless."
13156.0,Patient,"And you know, as I mean I never thought about drugs as a kid I even. Like grew up like with both my parents shown me that drugs are bad and alcohol is bad and everything. And like I never thought about using as a kid but maybe some of that like old trauma made me use as an adult. not sure, but."
383.0,Provider,"Well it's it sounds like you've been struggling with if you were sleeping a lot when you were young, if you remember sleeping all weekend and. That to me indicates that you were struggling at that time with depression."
13156.0,Patient,"yeah I probably was. Nice, I remember crying in my room a lot. Just like when I would hear my parents fight or. You know, and I didn't feel I can control, you know I remember crying in my room once in a while."
383.0,Provider,Would you share any of those feelings with anyone or just be on your own.
13156.0,Patient,"As I mean i'd my friends my all my friends knew as a kid that my parents didn't get along, so I mean I had my friends there to. For support, and I think I really leaned on that, like a lot growing up, because I remember as a kid I remember feeling more comfortable like being outside with my friends and sometimes being home with like my brother and my parents. always wanted to go play with my friends, I mean my parents always let me, which was nice so."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
13156.0,Patient,Maybe I just. It gives me a lot of anxiety talking about it.
383.0,Provider,that's kind of an indicator that you know just the fact that it brings you anxiety to talk about it that maybe you're kind of tuning in with some of the feelings that you had at that time.
13156.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. yeah and i've always been the type of person to hold my feelings into i've never you know I kind of like if I felt sad or you know scared or something being like a like a man or a guy you know supposed to. You know, express this as much. As you know. sure people."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. So, right now, as we're having this conversation. Well, I think that we're. it's almost like we want sorry my."
13156.0,Patient,dog was just doing the same thing.
383.0,Provider,So it's just like this at this hour it's funny. i'm.
13156.0,Patient,working at something and said.
383.0,Provider,"yeah she's she is. I think that you know if you can maybe after this session just go and lie down, and you can just put your hand like on your part and on your. And just kind of comfort that child inside of you that was anxious and sad, you know that your parents were having these problems at home. And just just take some breaths. And comfort yourself and acknowledge those feelings. Any acknowledging the feelings of anxiety and sadness. and saying that you know you acknowledge those feelings those feelings that are there that's part of. You know, in a way, like giving. send them some attention. Because when we repress our feelings we're not giving them our attention we're saying Okay, I feel scared but i'm not going to just push that down, you know I feel sad i'm just going to kind of ignore that as best as I can."
13156.0,Patient,yeah and that's what I used to that's probably why I used to use also to note field down like that i'll just go right to using resist easy at the time to suppress the things.
383.0,Provider,Right right you use the the the drug to just kind of like part of a temporary different you know.
13156.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
383.0,Provider,But the true feeling is what really needs to be taken care of.
13156.0,Patient,me in.
383.0,Provider,"True feeling of I feel anxious, I feel sad."
13156.0,Patient,and
383.0,Provider,"When you put your like what hand on your heart one hand on your belly and you kind of are there with your feeling. With it, and acknowledging it. it's kind of like you're not you're not repressing it you're not running away from it you're saying I. acknowledged honestly acknowledge my anxiety yeah. it's not too much for me to acknowledge."
13156.0,Patient,"Being because when I pulled it all in it just you know the end up exploding, you know. yeah later on when some of the smallest thing can happen, then all those emotions come find out."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, so maybe at night, even if you have the TV on you know before going to bed, you can do this, you can do that, I acknowledge my feelings like knowledge i'm feeling today, and you know you can kind of."
13156.0,Patient,"Try that. yeah Okay, I did um I remember you know the Russell brand you're talking about. I didn't I. didn't really like like search i'd like to and I couldn't really go in depth, you know looking him up but I saw some quotes from I couldn't find this podcast but I saw his books and everything but there's this quote, that I wrote down, you want to hear it. Sure, it says, I don't have to be ashamed of what I am I don't have to spend the rest of my life apologizing for being a bit unusual I don't have to be afraid, no more I can just be me and. I feel like the beginning part of that, where I have to apologize, you know, for being an addict that's just who I was you know and. Now, like that that we're now, it says, I can just be me now I feel like bright heart and you and and everybody in group and chantelle has helped me like realize that I could just be me now, so I kind of related to me."
383.0,Provider,"that's great. yeah i'm so glad you found even just a quote, that was held."
13156.0,Patient,"Here there's a lot of quotes from him I was reading them, but that one really stuck out."
383.0,Provider,Good good i'm so glad that you're.
13156.0,Patient,"gonna have to be ashamed for you know. Like I used to use drugs, you know but. I was just a bit little bit unusual at that time, as a person, now it can just be me know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah and there's a reason why you. You did that there's a reason and what to do with the trauma that you experienced when you were younger, I think."
13156.0,Patient,you're I think so too.
383.0,Provider,You were just kind of self medicating.
13156.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think even a. thing I knew that I was self medicating like I would even think that to myself, but at the same time, it was still is not good at all."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
13156.0,Patient,"losing all my money on my health was going down I just i'm going to a better place now, thanks to you and everybody in the group and chantelle and everybody i'm really grateful for that."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm so we're so glad that you have been receptive to getting help you know it, it takes somebody to be receptive to receive the help in order, for you know for anything to work so. that's you know you're you're really the first your the entry point not to our. yeah yeah. yeah so as you continue in this healing process. I think now is a good time for you to start to acknowledge the anxiety and depression."
13156.0,Patient,"yeah because I don't think I never did acknowledge them, you know throughout my life."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. and Maybe doing some work in the next couple of weeks of just being with yourself like I was suggesting and say I acknowledge that I had those feelings, when I was younger and maybe I still have them now, you know. And, but there's a reason why you've had them when you were younger, you know."
13156.0,Patient,wasn't just me.
383.0,Provider,No it's not just you. So um and kind of accepting you know you're you're in this healing process are you going outside and sitting in the sun and doing some of your outdoor things that you'd like to do.
13156.0,Patient,"Yes, I still been doing them, but they haven't been as comfortable because there's been like really overcast and a ton of smoke is in my area now so going outside hasn't been like the most comfortable thing."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
13156.0,Patient,"yeah it's like really, really smoky here like the last like three days or two days since i've been back."
383.0,Provider,Oh gosh there must be a fire somewhere nearby there.
13156.0,Patient,"yeah my mom told me that the overcast like the clouds are pushing the smoke down, so I that's why the smoke isn't really like blowing out of the area, you know there's no wind or anything. uh huh so i've kind of spending been spending more time like inside and said."
383.0,Provider,"Well, when the smoke is like that it can be actually hazardous to your health to be."
13156.0,Patient,Out there the.
383.0,Provider,"focus is bad. But as soon as it gets better it's really good to still you know, to make sure you get out and get air but it's great you went to San Diego you've got."
13156.0,Patient,"The the beach, just like the beach and watching the surfers and you know, everybody on the stand it was it was really relaxing."

Like I tried to do it like do it do a hard time hard talks and stuff and yeah a couple of the subjects, you would you know talk to me about, but other subjects, you would just shut me write down say I don't want to talk about that I don't want to talk about that."

383.0,Provider,"i'm glad that was a positive chip. seems like he does need you know if he was sort of shutting it down here and there, sounds like he. may need some therapy himself."

Care like you know kind of came out, you know, and he I think he noticed it and he was kind of. kind of just not like I don't know what the word i'm trying to say like he was just he didn't want to talk about certain things. And I mean we kind of feel a little down when he would do that, but I could understand the reason why he didn't want to talk about certain things. Probably you know, probably doesn't bring back good memories for him, I guess."

13156.0,Patient,"I haven't talked to her in a month or like like three and a half weeks to a month. So I mean. she's just out doing her thing and it's probably a good thing, because every time she does contact me or if I contact her easy there's a lot of drama. In like the following day or two which doesn't doesn't help. Okay yeah but it's it's a good, I think I need my space from her."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm is she working on her sobriety or she still using.
