148.0,Provider,Good okay. Any triggers or anything. we last spoke that you want to process with me.
13283.0,Patient,"yeah there was one day. I came home, and I was just really irritated and I don't know if it's because I was going to work from home and then I realized how much work I had, and I was just overwhelmed or I don't know if it was just the House being less or what it was, but. I just became really irritated and then I tried to talk to my husband about it, and he was taking it is everything he does was stressing me out and that's not what I wanted him to get I wanted him to help me figure out and process. What I was trying to. figure out. And then I was, I was bothered by the fact that he was not getting. The right. helping me and he was taking it the wrong way and I was like that's not at all what I mean and it bothers me that's what you think I mean that's all you ever think I mean. And so that really, really triggered me."
148.0,Provider,um how was that how did you work through it.
13283.0,Patient,"I took the doctor prescribed me some there's a hydroxyl seen that I take for bedtime. He gave me a half those to help with anxiety. Okay, so I did I took that and just said i'll work another day. If it's overwhelming me to the point of this I don't need to."
148.0,Provider,"Absolutely, good for you good for you care of yourself first um do you find that the hydroxyl scene is helping you."
13283.0,Patient,yeah i'm. If i'm moving and doing stuff I stay awake but i'm a little. A little out of it. mm hmm and my husband can definitely tell.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13283.0,Patient,"I don't know if people around me who don't know me would tell other than think i'm just a space cadet. But. I have a couple at work, for if there's an absolute emergency, but like I would have my husband come pick me up I wouldn't drive with it, or anything. But it's not something that I would take at work if I just all Willy nilly or anything. And i've only taken it a couple times like we went to. A car race and I got overwhelmed by just everything."
148.0,Provider,yeah I remember that that was pretty recent and down San Diego was it.
13283.0,Patient,It was Los Angeles long beach. yeah it was. It was. I had a migraine and my. husband really wanted to watch the race and we had got the tickets for his birthday last year in the beginning of the year and it kept getting pushed back because of coded.
148.0,Provider,Right so.
13283.0,Patient,"I really wanted to let him watch the race like it wasn't something I wanted to like. Oh, I have a migraine I can't do this, so I was like oh there's a kids area our child who's being a brat can go to the kids area and i'll take him. But so we bought tickets and we just did. bouncy houses for like a good hour and a half. So it was nice and cool and it was inside and there were I didn't there was no loud noises and. So, and then walking out of that area, there was still loud noises and I started having really bad panic attack and I took a hydrox as well, no, I wanted to take one, but I couldn't find them that's when we found out that I left them in the car."
148.0,Provider,Okay.
13283.0,Patient,"But. yeah it was crowded loud noises migraine and a toddler who did not want to walk and just a little bit of everything. teenage boys who didn't want to come, they wanted to complain about everything."
148.0,Provider,"yeah that's a chaos around you. yeah which i'm sure doesn't help things at peace. yeah but it sounds like you work through it Okay, and it sounds like you're really working through things you know, in a positive healthy way."
13283.0,Patient,Trying.
148.0,Provider,"yeah I know, one of the big things that you brought up last time was journaling."
13283.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,That getting in a routine with your journaling again were you able to journal at all this last week.
13283.0,Patient,"A couple days I worked on it, and then there were a couple days, where I just like the one day, where I had taken the medicine and passed out and I don't think I even I missed a day of my nighttime medications and that's no good, I think that might have been the day. But then I wanted to. turn the last night, but I can't remember what happened. See I don't even remember last night, now that I think about it can't even remember it. But we. Can and. One of the things i've tried to do was write down a weekly goal Monday and my journal. between my group we set a weekly goal and then myself, I wanted to set a weekly people and really I know you said to kind of meditate on that on what i'm writing so I gave myself affirmations and I gave myself a goal. And so, and I felt like that was a good thing to start with, and it wasn't necessarily a big goal like right now it's just to try and get through taking some clothes out of the closet."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
13283.0,Patient,Nothing like conquer the world or anything.
148.0,Provider,Just doesn't it doesn't have to be right.
13283.0,Patient,Right exactly.
148.0,Provider,"smallest thing, and once you do it it's like wow that felt great. Something yeah like, for example, the first thing I do every morning is I make my bed that's my first achievement of my day. And that's the tone for the rest of the day, so it doesn't have to be anything crazy or big and you know, maybe that's all I do that day but hey I know that I did something."
13283.0,Patient,"I. need to get in the habit of that it's really hard, because when I wake up early my husband's still asleep. And I don't want to wake him up. or when he wakes up early i'm still asleep like we never wake up, at the same time. yeah it would be nice if we did I wanted, I always wanted him to wake up with me when I wake up early and be like yeah but it never works out like."
148.0,Provider,i'm too tired yeah.
13283.0,Patient,"No, it never does and then our other one our group goal is to set morning start with. do three things before not next week, but the week after next to work on an intentional morning routine. And I think this last this week I said what gold is I said. I think it was. to wake up early. or wake up the same time, every morning. I can't write it down I just wrote down that I have to do something with a morning routine. And so i've been trying to wake up, at the same time, because when I wake up and I go to bed the minute I get out of bed. My son follows me and as much as I want and love him and want him to be a part of my life like it's hard to set. The mood for being positive and everything when i've got this small child like who's clung to me all night long, and I want my moment of positivity and he's like tagging along. yeah. yeah right now i'm just trying to wake up and. and focus on what time i'm waking up and let that be my positive thing, because I wake up we're eating breakfast. yeah he's there with me."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah how are the boys doing.
13283.0,Patient,"Good good. My four year old is. Refusing to potty train well he's paying just fine and he was starting, but now we're regressing with pooping so lots of dirty underwear. Which is driving my husband and I crazy and we're trying to figure out what we can do. To encourage it without. losing our temper. And I know it's pause I know the answer is positive reinforcement. Right, but in the moment it's really hard. When you've got three pair of dirty underwear coming home from. From daycare that you've got to figure out how you're going to clean up. So. Like all you want to do is be like why can't you go to the bathroom in the toilet you did it at the hotel just fine what's going on. Like you can't ask questions like that, because that's the first of all that's not how toddlers work. And second of all like asking why questions is so attacking."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah.
13283.0,Patient,"And then. There yeah. Yes, yeah I just keep have to like having to tell myself."
148.0,Provider,"yeah those positive affirmations. yeah. sounds like you're feeling a little overwhelmed, though."
13283.0,Patient,yeah thing yeah. Maybe yeah.
148.0,Provider,feel suffocated right now.
13283.0,Patient,yeah just a little bit okay.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, what Let me give you some relief there."
13283.0,Patient,"um I think if I could go like on a walk in the morning or stuff like that. But the minute I try and go on a lot, I know that elliot's gonna want to join me and i'm going to feel guilty if I say no, and afternoon because my husband has had no time no break. and I want to give them that time. yeah and then, if I go in the morning i'm afraid i'm terrified that i'm gonna leave and then he is going to follow me. And my husband will sleep through it. And I won't realize it. So those are the two reasons I haven't gone on a walk."
148.0,Provider,yeah I mean you're taking really good care of everybody else. mm hmm taking really good care of everybody else. yeah and like you to give a little bit of that to yourself.
13283.0,Patient,No. I bought myself some new clothes.
148.0,Provider,Good okay.
13283.0,Patient,"yeah I oh at work, I won $1,000 gift card well. yeah gift cards giveaway. Good yeah."
148.0,Provider,There was chelation.
13283.0,Patient,"Every day, they do a coven vaccination giveaway if you've been vaccinated you get. A group of 1000 like a group of gift cards worth thousand dollars awesome yep I was super excited. yeah the minute I got the email, I sent it to the the fishing spam folder. I was like do not trust. And then I texted my boss like should I maybe have not hit that button. so quickly."
148.0,Provider,funny that's funny so you bought yourself some new clothes.
13283.0,Patient,yeah and some new boots.
148.0,Provider,"And that's Nice, how did that make you feel."
13283.0,Patient,"excited yes, sir."
148.0,Provider,Good good you deserve that absolutely work so hard you deserve that. You deserve kindness to yourself. So um yeah let's keep getting you back in that routine with journaling doing your affirmations doing. Writing down things that you're grateful for. really working on that positive self talk.
13283.0,Patient,"Okay, just being."
148.0,Provider,"kind to yourself and showing yourself some grace when you have a lot of other things going on, you know the boys, the husband work all those things. yeah and even took hey always remember it's okay to take a step back and take a deep breath and."
13283.0,Patient,You know.
148.0,Provider,know that this may be a hard moment but this moment is temporary.
13283.0,Patient,Okay.
148.0,Provider,yeah but you're doing really good work you look really good you look lighter.
13283.0,Patient,Thank you.
148.0,Provider,"yeah like your energies good, how are you feeling overall."
13283.0,Patient,"pretty good i'm really nice that I came back and I got to see my best friend That was really nice and she's also coming at the end of or the beginning middle of November, I think. it'll be nice to get to see her again and then depending on whether or not her husband has to go to England for training, I may be going out there again in January."
148.0,Provider,"awesome Okay, so I."
13283.0,Patient,know.
148.0,Provider,"You were really nervous when she moved because you guys were very, very tight and you were saying and tonight will be the same just you know texting or talking on the phone but sounds like you guys are really making this work. yeah."
13283.0,Patient,"yeah I think part of it was she like. a really good friend, who is also a best friend back in Kansas, when I left, like all of code happened a year after we got here, and then, but she was having issues with depression and. issues with substance abuse and ended up passing away and 2020 middle of 2020 with an overdose and everything. And I think that really. Having that knowing that that happened and I never got to see her really made me want to go spend as much time as I can, when I have time. With mar. So."
148.0,Provider,i'm so sorry that's awful.
13283.0,Patient,yeah I wish I had known or seen the signs faster. and had the guts to speak up quicker.
148.0,Provider,"yeah. Sometimes, at the end of the day, it's completely out of our power right. Okay. um anything else that you want to talk about today."
13283.0,Patient,"i'm. Not that I can think of, I think everything's going pretty good. i'm catching myself with what's triggering me and trying trying to figure out what's going on, but then, when I talked to my husband he's have to remember he's not my therapist when I didn't have a therapist he was okay with me. bouncing things off of him, but now he I need to not use him as a sounding board so much I can journal about it, I can process it in other ways, but I don't want to put all of my was on him."
148.0,Provider,Okay yeah I think that's healthy. yeah yeah and if. There needs to be some boundaries there. With that that's perfectly okay yeah that sounds really healthy.
13283.0,Patient,"I think that might be something that he and I should discuss as boundaries. yeah you know. When, at what point I can or should talk to him versus. What I should just be like Oh, I need to I should probably write my Journal and work it out internally."
148.0,Provider,"Right, when this is something that I know I need to work on for myself."
13283.0,Patient,"cuz he's got he's got so much on his plate with work and then just he's got his own mental health and he's supposed to be taking his medication three times a day, and he takes it one time a day. And I get on to him about that so."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah okay yeah. yeah um. keep taking care of yourself keep supporting him, however, you can and keep you know setting those healthy boundaries between the two of you. I think balance balance keeps popping into my head today as you're talking just finding the right balance for you and for your family. Okay yeah yeah. Okay Rachel let's get you. scheduled we're doing weekly right now right."
13283.0,Patient,"Yes, I think so. Oh, and I know that I told you that I was have a va therapist sometime in October, but that change to February so you're stuck with me a little longer."
