That I haven't seen growing up know watching them grow up he was kind of a type of kid That was a loner and kinda like a mommy's boy and stuff like that, but he kind of woke up on, you know he found out that you know I had this hip surgery, and he would say dad we gotta keep you healthy. Make sure you're staying clean. And if I have to walk you through it, I will, and I said sign i'm I don't need to be walked through it i'm doing really good but yeah he booked me another flight to Florida so i'm excited."

304.0,Provider,"that's wonderful yeah so you have one son in Florida, and the other is."
13643.0,Patient,yeah I got one son in Florida. and two. of my daughters are in Florida. My third daughter is in the marine corps so she's in Japan.
304.0,Provider,Oh wow.
13643.0,Patient,"yeah that's mainly the reason why we're going he's sending me back to Florida is because she's supposed to be back, and I can get to see her to."
304.0,Provider,Create oh wow yeah that's wonderful so your relationship with your daughters is going well to.
13643.0,Patient,"i'm trying to rebuild it like I said me and their mom separated about. 10 years ago. it's been a little tough on one daughter to rebuild it because she's a very sensitive girl. And I sometimes wonder if her mom. You know, put a bunch of stuff in her head. yeah she. she's a tough one to reconnect with, but I will I will."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I just have to charge my phone for a second time sorry just one second. Okay i'm sorry about that time I didn't want to lose you yeah that is tough just that it sounds sounds like she took it harder. than your sons and you're working on that that'll be so great, for you to to just have that time to visit them and kind of."
13643.0,Patient,"A little word next door to my son to soul. It was, it was a tough one, when we gave each other, a hug it just it felt weird but it that would that to start. I even told my son about it, and he says yep dad it's time for you to rebuild that and. move on and I am i'm going to rebuild it, I never really took time to call her or anything in the past few years, so I I need to start giving her a call here and there, and seeing how her days go and stuff like that."
304.0,Provider,"yeah just start small um and I think that's great you're kind of that your son was able to yeah book this trip for you, you know close together. Before a lot of time passes, but I mean it's it's always hard when you live far away, but I think yeah especially you're rebuilding that relationship, but yeah just making that time to call and invest that. Karen concern because I mean of course you love her and you care about her, but maybe. She needs to hear it, you know."
13643.0,Patient,"yeah it's a tough one for me. I get a little nervous just thinking about corner, because on how much our relationship is kind of insult this that. So I I just been thinking about that lately I haven't called her since i've been back from vacation about. spend a little less than a month or something like that and i'm still yet to call her because I don't know exactly what to say to her, I don't want to say the wrong thing that you know, makes me look bad or it's hard i've been thinking a lot before I call her."
304.0,Provider,"i've heard that from just so many of my clients today but you're not going to say the wrong thing you know I mean short of like. If you yell at or something but but you're not going to say the wrong thing you know in that fear of not seeing the perfect thing. Like that's the wrong thing to not say anything yeah all and just exactly what you told me hey how you doing how you been i've been thinking about you, you know i'm looking forward to seeing you next time. what's going on with you, you know it doesn't have to maybe be a huge in depth thing and and if it is hard you know, and maybe if it is just a short five minute 10 minute conversation that's okay um it's better to just I think start somewhere."
13643.0,Patient,"Being that i'm a little nervous on that subject, do you think it'd be wrong that though her like a text or something here and there are no. Better."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean if you feel more comfortable you know Todd I think I think anything is better than nothing. So I don't know her and and. But yeah I think anything is is better than nothing and yeah if you feel if you want to work your way up to you know if yeah text text her Okay, I mean yeah that's how the world sort of communicates now right. So if if you feel more comfortable with that and and i'm sure she texts, a lot on her friends and everybody and she's that too so um yeah I think anything anything is better. than not, and if you are feeling nervous, I mean that is kind of the nice thing about it, it, it gives you time to just sort of type out what you want to say and think about it and and it gives her time to respond. So yeah I think whatever way you open up that path of communication there's no wrong way."
13643.0,Patient,I just wanted to start like with baby steps. You know and get the nor it's like starting all over again to nowhere again because our relationship got damaged and. This is probably been two years since i've seen or talked to her when I went on vacation so. yeah.
304.0,Provider,It see her last time.
13643.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,yeah and how how did it go given.
13643.0,Patient,"It was weird I got I gave her a big hug and I didn't let go for a little bit and she seemed very happy. I just want to keep that communication line going. yeah well i'm. tall, I told her i'd keep in touch so now, I need to follow through on doing that were before I never would follow through with anything."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's huge right there taught yeah because you're different now you know you're in a different place than your you know, two years ago. And so we want you want her to see that you want her to see that you really have changed in like when we throw these words around like you know rebuilding relationships rebuilding trust that's like the basic right do what you say you're going to do."
13643.0,Patient,"And all that damaged, a lot of things in my life, and that was one of them."
304.0,Provider,"yeah definitely but, but these baby steps like you said in that first step to repairing that relationship, you know just follow through. You know so yeah just send her that that quick text, if you feel more comfortable and you guys will get there to where you know, hopefully you're talking or face timing or so, but I would just start small so that you are following through with with just keeping in touch. yeah that'll be. Okay that'll be your homework."
13643.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
304.0,Provider,"Next time, you and I talk okay. yeah i'm good but but otherwise everything else going okay."
