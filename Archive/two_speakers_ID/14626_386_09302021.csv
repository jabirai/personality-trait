386.0,Provider,"Okay, so originally you're taking just a half and then. you realize that you could take a whole one, and then you act so you're able to extend it out a little bit. So your last dose of medication, if you are taking that at at the directions of one per day, then you would have been out 12345 so that you would have taken your last dose approximately on the 14th does that sound right."

386.0,Provider,You understood. yeah I know it's different definitely um let's take a look here so last full day was nine eight picked up on 910 approximately last dose was on 916 and then are you currently in him having withdrawal at this moment time.

386.0,Provider,For relapse heroin.
14626.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Because when I thought I could call I didn't realize the time difference, I think it is. yeah yeah and then I don't think I tried on Sunday, maybe I, and then I end up seeing the hours and matt used to the zoom and trying to figure this all."
386.0,Provider,"Understandable let's use was. So, three days ago for heroin. yeah okay um any relapse on any opioids."
14626.0,Patient,Just the hero and. He has been all in it. So.
386.0,Provider,I ever went laced with.
14626.0,Patient,"fentanyl and then but I haven't used that and, like a week."
386.0,Provider,"math was a week ago. yeah okay. Okay, so with this prescription because it's been been so long, the only thing that i'm able to do is really send the message over to Dr farrago. For the prescription recommendation for you on what it looks like inside of your chart is that. you're currently enrolled in our program for opioid use disorder, as well as chronic pain. But you're supposed to be seen on a weekly group therapy appointment basis and then twice a month for individual therapy, but because you have not been seen by Dr farrago since your intake which would have been let's take a look here. checked in on nine seven of 2021 for that new patient mediaeval I know i'm not able to bridge a prescription, because it would be a completely new start, because it's been so long already. And so what I have to do is I will get a message over to Dr farrago requesting for the prescription order. but also for review what I highly recommend is you logging in to the care navigation virtual clinic. And, to see if you can get scheduled sooner rather than later, either for like a MED follow up one on one with Dr farrago to see if he has something like that available to get you some type of treatment started that way you're not experiencing any more withdrawal symptoms okay. And that way we can you know, reduce um."
14626.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I never really. know what the real answer, how it all works, you know this whole program and on zoom and I told them I said Monday I go to the group, because I had a family emergency I said i'm all set up someone went over everything with me and we were all down, I was with my therapist yesterday. But I thought. How, may I was a I thought he would write more than this, I, is there a month supply."
386.0,Provider,"So what he did, is he wrote out on nine seven the quantity of five to get you to the group appointment on 913. So what he did, is he wrote you enough medication to get you over to the group appointment, but then you didn't show up for the group appointment on the 13th. didn't show up for group on the 20th it didn't show up group for the 27th, then you checked in on the 29th for your bps evaluation, so thank you for that on that gets a lot of stuff out of the way for you and then. It looks like here that you did check in for that and then moving they moved over to us basically to get that straightened out for you. Unfortunately, because it's just been so long and you haven't been seen and you haven't followed up since your new patient mediaeval we're just not able to bridge a prescription order that has only been for quantity of five so. um let me, let me get a message over to Dr farrago and then, if he responds back to me i'll be more than happy to give you a phone call back to let you know what his Directive is. But i'm recommending that you log into the care navigation vc to see if you are able to get scheduled with him on a one on one basis."
14626.0,Patient,OK OK.
386.0,Provider,"Let them be very honest with them i'm going to just it's better, to be honest with them Tara let them know that you have relapsed and you're needing help that we we that's what we're here for we're here to help and so. Let them know that there was relapse that had occurred alongside of family emergencies, you know personal life when there's family emergencies and their stress involved it's one step at a time. One right time. You know, and so, and we, we understand that so let's see what we're able to get you back on track. I just not my appointments with my therapist yesterday all planned already so NASA she didn't say into so okay. yeah and she definitely I mean they definitely got you scheduled in for group on the fourth, and then they got you scheduled for group on the 11th and then individual therapy on the 13th peer support on the 19th so they did definitely. scheduled in I just want you to have that one on one time with Dr farrago to explain like weird loud here was that."
14626.0,Patient,"way and I will get my last. do that. And then I think I get. Where I a package scheme, I think it may be, is it. That is your mom already."
386.0,Provider,"Come that that is your it looks like it says it's in transit, but if it came into came in don't open it up log into the care navigation BC and open it in front of their team for them to be able to complete the euro drug testing out for you."
14626.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, where would I go now as you like what you said, to try to get back in with Dr."
386.0,Provider,yep so the care navigators and I can give you the meeting ID number of their meeting ID number it's the basic that's the base one so it's 884.
14626.0,Patient,"Okay, I got that one yeah yep."
386.0,Provider,The 847141175 you're going to log into that let them know that you already discussed your medication concern with the prescription team and we're going to send a message over to Dr farrago but let them know that you need an appointment with him as well.
14626.0,Patient,"Okay okay. Okay, all right great."
386.0,Provider,"alrighty best of luck and I hope that i'm able to reach out to you, it may not be we already technically closed for the evening, but i'm I may."
14626.0,Patient,"If I get all that, by getting is 18 hours on yeah so maybe where he will eventually right like a month."
386.0,Provider,Supply i'm.
14626.0,Patient,going to be completely down the road.
386.0,Provider,"down the road for far into the future, if. If everything is stable. And he does start patients off on a very low key prescription order it's normally no more than seven day scripts. And i've seen no less than three day scripts from him so he used sometimes if it's a bridge required if it's a bridge order that's being recommended. So what he typically does is he'll prescribed for three days and then four days, so he does a three day script and a 40 script on the same day, and he he's been just affiliates like that. And that's usually what i've seen i've seen a lot of seven day scripts from him, but you have to be stable within his program requirements up to date compliance wise. For him to write out more. It takes a while and and that's just good standard and you don't think that he's picking on you he's just very strict with."
14626.0,Patient,"Other people are in different programs. And they're like Oh, I really, really just started interposing oh I don't know I regarded as as but."
386.0,Provider,"As we we are diverse we prevent diversion as much as possible, and so, if, as long as you're stable and you're going to the appointments appropriately, then he reviews it all. Dr farrago is probably one of the most thorough providers that we'd have here at bright heart health and he reviews your chart extensively. So um. I put a lot of faith into Dr virgos judgment 100% so if he's not comfortable prescribing for 30 days at a time on there's there's typically a reason but it's usually his scripts i've seen. You know I have seen 30 day scripts from him it's just it took the patient, a while to get to that."
14626.0,Patient,Open okay all right great.
386.0,Provider,All right.
14626.0,Patient,"let's go to that, right now, thank you."
386.0,Provider,"Absolutely not a problem, I hope you have a great rest of your afternoon and i'll be in touch if I get any feedback okay."
