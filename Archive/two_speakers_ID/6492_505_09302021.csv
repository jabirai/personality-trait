505.0,Provider,"error gotcha. So the other. That is pretty remarkable, especially with that friend no use. yeah what i'm also seeing in your. record is that you're on xanax two milligrams. Twice today, so I want to be really. Clear with my role, I am happy to help you with a taper. But I will not. Be prescribing xanax."
6492.0,Patient,"Long long term, are you interested in working on your anxiety and specifically getting."
505.0,Provider,off the bends oh.
6492.0,Patient,"Okay i'm interested in working on my anxiety i'm interested I definitely need therapy, I know I do, because I know that the medication isn't the. isn't the solution, you know, but I do know that for right now, it is a bit when I have my panic attacks. Right now i'm not willing to go completely off of it, but what I am willing to work with you on a plan to you know to taper off of it once we maybe we can get another men on board that we think works and then."
505.0,Provider,"A profit or so let's talk about ready to do it all right now that will send me in and I get that let's. Talk about what this looks like for you on a daily basis, do you take the xanax two milligrams twice a day."
6492.0,Patient,"Every day, not every day but there's a lot if you once we get a chance to talk and you know my past you'll understand why. it's not like i'm just being a weenie about stuff like i've been raised as an adult I was abused as a child by my stepfather for 13 years who beat the shit out of me, but he had a. He was a coaching coach in the town We grew up in so every time CPS came to school to ask about my bruises he had some live that covered it up and they believed him over me because the golden coach teacher guy in town. And he got all of it."
505.0,Provider,"That is a huge part of your story, and the fact that you got often know. That kind of trauma is."
6492.0,Patient,"and It goes one that I got I got when I was 26 years old, I was kidnapped and raped by another male. I I I had a incident, when I was in jail, where a guy I was asleep on the floor and our cell, and this is like a 300 pounds Samoan guy decided that he was going to come in and break three my ribs my jaw my scapula and one of my life. While I only thing it's. Just."
505.0,Provider,"A lot of stuff a lot. Of trauma for sure, but I want to be sure that i'm not gonna disappoint you, you are. Somebody who's worked hard for your recovery. And I. Think. That we could do a lot, as far as group. scriber so I want to be really clear what I hit can offer you and the first step would be that will get you off the xanax and I. want to pin. Which is a longer active."
6492.0,Patient,"And they they didn't put me on content, and this is my thing is, I talked to Sean tell this is why shauntel put me on the on the xanax was because i've tried all the what is it fluoxetine of antidepressant is that so often or something. But anyway, I had tried all the antidepressant I mean everything lexapro is the only one that worked for me and then. As far as like with benzo we tried, we tried valley and we tried and we tried what's the other one that's like they give for like alcoholics and liberalism. She wanted something she she the reason she gives me xanax is because it's short acting and it also has a short. Half life and so i'm able to like, if I have a panic attack at work, you know I could go take a half hour lunch break and then come back and still be completely ambulatory unable to work."
505.0,Provider,gotcha so it sounds like you're wanting to keep where chantel. Yes. she's here prescriber.
6492.0,Patient,"She was I just I had an insurance hiccup with bright heart and that's what ended up causing me to you don't have a laughs and then, when I came back, I was living in Nevada and not California."

6492.0,Patient,"Well, she is."
505.0,Provider,She just got licensed in Nevada.
6492.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean, so it would be easier for me to see her, but I mean if you could talk to her, I mean you seem very nice if you could."
505.0,Provider,"Have Richard i'm very nice, but what i'm not is on board with the annex and I tori honest to God, I do I don't doubt what you're saying for my practice I don't prescribe xanax."
6492.0,Patient,"The other ones, the other ones don't don't get."
505.0,Provider,My yeah.
6492.0,Patient,under control so.
505.0,Provider,"I yeah I got it, so I think the best way forward here is let's get you connected with shine to hell she knows all this trauma and the end she really understands your story. So let's get you i'm going to send a message i'm going to get you connected with her. As soon as possible and then we're going to get you back on track. she's also has West Coast groups. Whereas my groups are east coast and um I think the time would be. Challenging yeah for you. Okay, so let's leave it there. have somebody reach out and connect you. With Toronto."
6492.0,Patient,"You know, you know when to expect that or."
505.0,Provider,Do you want to call them instead would that be more can be knit and also no.
6492.0,Patient,"yeah i'll do that. Okay, send them a note, if you can send them a note though, also, and you know that way you know it just goes a little smoother."
505.0,Provider,Perfect I get to. My friend I gotta run to my. event. i'm thinking out okay.
6492.0,Patient,"Alright, have a good one. You."
505.0,Provider,"So this is patient Richard all right, it sounds like his history of opioid use disorder, he is not on buprenorphine he went off of it, it may. sound like a key has a serious history of trauma and anxiety and it has been treatment resistant to many medications I will i'm not going to be accepting care of this patient he's obviously i'm X two milligrams on. The ID, and so I would want him on a longer acting benzo or and he's not really amenable to changing he's also very well known to chantelle so i'm going to recommend that he follow up with her and i'll help facilitate that transfer of care thanks."
