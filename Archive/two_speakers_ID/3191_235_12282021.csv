235.0,Provider,Working on that for three months the grief and loss okay cool because a lot of people have been going with the anxiety and let's see what they say about grief and loss and what are some exercises maybe we could look at so. yeah well. I pull up on my screen here because i've been trying to figure this out let's see okay.
3191.0,Patient,"Well, as your friend in the Philippines Okay, have you heard her."
235.0,Provider,Oh yeah she's doing fine.
3191.0,Patient,Oh good.

Okay really good. Okay i'm going to have to go to my mailbox I thought I was going to be able to get that there so bear with me if you would."
3191.0,Patient,No problem.
235.0,Provider,"I don't know why it's not going in my documents, but you know. It seems OK inbox. Well, should be 1214 school right here. Sometimes. amy. i'm sorry for this delay, here we go."
3191.0,Patient,it's fine. Technology has a mind of its own sometimes.
235.0,Provider,yeah it's yeah to navigate it sometimes it's really tricky for me so. Okay let's go to grief. And loss. So she. Childhood trauma. got read that one is fear these up dependency okay that's a PCP D depression. yeah so how was that visiting got how did your mom and you know how did it go visiting your brother.
3191.0,Patient,"And it was a pretty painful experience, to be honest, I kind of glossed over it a bit and group. He was really he'd been experiencing a lot of psychosis. And he was just. hard to talk to him when he's hearing, who knows how many other conversations and you know you try to just tell them a. Basic story about your day and it's somehow entwined in one of his conspiracy theories and he."
235.0,Provider,didn't ever that's gonna make him angry or upset.
3191.0,Patient,Sir so.
235.0,Provider,"Far yeah I mean. Oh, I know I know that conspiracy theory like they people are they you know they've they've got you know there's zoning in on you, I had one friend of church it had that same thing Kevin it's just it's heartbreaking you know because."
3191.0,Patient,apple pay.
235.0,Provider,battling that all the time.
3191.0,Patient,"Exactly and it's hard to see him and just he's so sick and he's not in the right place, you know he needs to be he needs treatment and medication and he's not getting that yet I mean he. they're working towards it it's a process, and they have to keep them in jail for now, because he is you know he's not in control of his own actions so. I understand why he's there I just don't like it it's painful to see and i'm pretty sure there's. I think he's they have them by himself, which is probably good because I doubt too many of the other people would understand them or be real patient with them. I did meet one really nice jailer who said he'd he'd actually transferred over there from working with. People with disabilities. And he does that he did it. Well, number one he gets you know better, insurance and things like that, but he also wanted to bring kindness to a place that doesn't always offer it, and that was most heartwarming thing i'd heard all day. And he he warned us of the psychosis ahead of time, and he said he'd actually sat and talked with my brother for about a half an hour, this is just a jail or I mean he doesn't have to do that. So I what a blessing that he's there. That was comforting. Know there's at least one person will take the time to."
235.0,Provider,"yeah a lot of them could care less you know they're loud here number whatever and. Exactly sorry show compassion like that's. Definitely out of out of the norm, I think."
3191.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I I just really that was just like oh Thank heavens, you know there's someone that. Any kind of I think he might have gone to school with them, so he. You know, small town that stuff happens. But that's good because maybe he can remember him and think of him as a regular human being, not everybody can do that you just see him as a weirdo sometimes."
235.0,Provider,it's heartbreaking. But you know and it's like 1% of population really deals with that form of schizophrenia and it's so sad.
3191.0,Patient,yeah.
235.0,Provider,"I saw this one that has a book in, and I was just thinking you said watch videos on the theme of grief and loss to compare own experience with that of characters in the film. Would that be something be interested in they talking about watch the films turn terms of endearment dad ordinary people or similar film that focuses on loss and grieving then discuss how the characters COPA floss and express their grief."
3191.0,Patient,Ordinary people dad.
235.0,Provider,In terms of endearment.
3191.0,Patient,terms of endearment.
235.0,Provider,"Those those movies right there so let's put down as our specific goal. is to to read a few movies. The short term, this is short term goal. Okay okay so. Reading material. and"
3191.0,Patient,"yeah I love to read, so I can definitely probably."
235.0,Provider,"yeah I remember you mentioned that yesterday, so that i'm right there with you reading material and viewing films. In relationship. To. grief and loss."
3191.0,Patient,Okay.
235.0,Provider,"And that's and that will be our specific goal right there. Let me give you a book, let me give you a recommend and but. This one right here is verbalize unresolved feelings of anger or guilt focus on self or deceased loved one that blocks the grieving process. And this is what it says here, encourage the client to forgive self and or to cease to resolve his or her feelings of guilt or anger recommended books like forgive and forget by speeds you've probably heard a speech before s m E D s smad. Forgive and forget and then number 20 is support and assist client in identifying and expressing anger feelings angry feelings connected to you know your losses or loss is that something we want to look into their."
3191.0,Patient,Maybe yeah. i'll see if I can find forgiven forget at the library or something.
235.0,Provider,"Okay, so measuring is a good way. Good way you can measure your progress, a goal is a goal is to measure measure your progress and. I think. In additional material so read materials and viewing films. In relating to grief and loss measuring. Will. review. In three months."
3191.0,Patient,or.
235.0,Provider,"Three months what. Julie has read. This read and maybe and and written down, can you do this written down in a in a journal written written down. In. A journal is that doable. yeah yeah like a thought of that tf thought actions and feelings, you know something like that, and then we could just kind of go over and review it a little bit."
3191.0,Patient,"Okay, you can do that."
235.0,Provider,"Okay, good and then let's see number three is achievable goals need to be attainable. They give the example you know you don't jog around the track two times and run a half marathon or whatever you know. So that you feel this is attainable."
3191.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
235.0,Provider,Beautiful yeah. Absolutely Julie agrees very achievable. How did your mother handle it.
3191.0,Patient,My mom is probably the best at handling it out of everyone in our family she's dealt with it the longest she's able to keep it the topics very light and to kind of. she's just read so many books and.
235.0,Provider,yeah.
3191.0,Patient,"In there from day one, that she she navigates the waters, a little better, with him, but she knows him very well he's her son."
235.0,Provider,"yeah and that's it that's a progressing thing isn't it that doesn't manifest itself until what maybe your teams, or maybe just."
3191.0,Patient,"back. I think you was 15 or 16 when he was finally diagnosed 15 started showing the signs, so I mean he was."
235.0,Provider,What could trigger that I mean the brain to flip like that you know.
3191.0,Patient,And I think.
235.0,Provider,"During my day where they you know they called it. They flipped out or they you know. They took acid, and they flipped out and they're not the same they get psychosis."
3191.0,Patient,yeah he definitely was dabbling with with some drugs but we don't know if. that's what came first honestly.
235.0,Provider,"Exactly I mean. Mental illness or is it substance abuse. Right, you can fill that's the."
3191.0,Patient,chicken or the egg.
235.0,Provider,"Thank you. But i'm not the only one those all those corny sayings but it's true. Realistic realistic it's not to be easy, but feel capable of achieving the goal. yeah."
3191.0,Patient,"My goal is my watch this movie or read this book, I can do that and start from there."
235.0,Provider,"yeah very, very. realistic and reasonable. yeah and. it's been a lot better if it was just a month that were made, you know once every three months, but like I said, you know when you when you if you get any insights or whatever, when your journaling. That would be really that would be the the thing, maybe something in one of those movies might you know steer. set a time frame for the when the goal for the goal Okay, so our time frame. is for. Three months from today. From today, and let me give you a date okay."
