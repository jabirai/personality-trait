And I mean they were just you know their answer was to just to lock me up or whatever, but it was was more of out of sight out of mind like. You know what I mean because they wanted to they were still fairly young they wanted to you know drink beers and party with our friends on the weekends kind of thing to you, I mean."
214.0,Provider,By okay all right fair enough so high school was what what was high school like dumb.
10124.0,Patient,"Non existent, well, I went I ninth grade, I think that I made it about a month and a half, two months, and then I got I got in trouble, and then I started going to an alternative school, which was you know the same grades, but across town, and you know more lacks whatever. But I didn't even you know I ended up they gave me, you know to where the school was like I barely had to do anything and then. What I do I just I didn't do anything you know I mean, so instead of being instead instead of leniency like okay well, maybe he can do it like this, you know it just it went all the way out the window, you know."

214.0,Provider,Any resentment for that. Absolutely yeah. Who do you currently live with.
10124.0,Patient,I live with my friend patty.
214.0,Provider,"So, all in all, what i'm thinking is we've got to figure out. i'm going to talk to Dr cell if it's okay with you we've got to figure out what's going on with the mental health, I think if we can. help you with that I don't think that the opiate the alcohol or any of that will be so present I think that's what's not manageable, I really do I know the pain. is something that we got to address by also think you know you've got to size and you're trying to balance them we haven't been able to find it so I am going to talk to Dr cell about that i'm just let me see here. When you got diagnose after 48 days of being cleaned from. Was it a psychiatrist."
10124.0,Patient,"I don't know if it was a psychologist or a psychiatrist. I know it was I mean I know it wasn't just a counselor I was a I was either you know, it was a psychologist or psychiatrist I think she was a psychiatrist."
214.0,Provider,that's a little earlier be diagnosis somebody.
10124.0,Patient,"Right, I mean yeah I mean I especially I mean being ivy's or for you know better, part of a decade like I think it's gonna take me a lot longer and that's the level, you know, think about level and."
214.0,Provider,"that's at least figure out, you know where are we in in reality and where we are in fiction I think you're right. I think I want to work without the cell to see So let me ask you a question, what do you think of some of the solutions for yourself like you know yourself best we don't know you."
10124.0,Patient,I I honestly.
214.0,Provider,yeah I.
10124.0,Patient,"I think that my solution is I mean. I need to be playing music or doing something with our like you know when I get when I get to where i'm row, you know all over the place, I need to you know. I need to focus on something and do it like you know the creative outlet kind of thing actually I it's it's good for me, I know it's good for my. You know, it helps me kind of stay calm and level out a little bit um I don't know if. I smoke a lot of weed, but I also I know that I probably am not able to you know able to do that one for bright art and also. i'm on medicaid in Ohio so I and if I would you know I can't get my I can't get my license although it's legal here from the distantly I can't get my license and still be medicaid. um I mean I know that's not the answer you know i'm saying, but."
