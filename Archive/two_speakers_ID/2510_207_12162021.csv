2510.0,Patient,i'm good.
207.0,Provider,you're not working today.
2510.0,Patient,"No, I believe, right after this or like 15 minutes after our appointment."
207.0,Provider,"i'm. All done. Oh, you messaged me to say that you didn't have the number anymore."
2510.0,Patient,"yeah I got it, though it was. For me to be the host. I needed some password. hit join."
207.0,Provider,know your your God. um how are you liking this.
2510.0,Patient,"looks pretty good. I enjoy the work but it's a. It can be frustrating um I took care of. That situation, I was talking about Monday I called my temp service and told them 12 hour days were just too much for me to handle. um and. They called the factory and told them that and the factory needed me so so far i'm just going in work donates and going home. So kind of worked out, but. They want me to. apply to hire into the company and when when I do that there's no way i'm gonna be able to tell them I won't work 12 hours for it."
207.0,Provider,hmm so you have to decide whether or not even stay on or not.
2510.0,Patient,yeah but I learned I. learned how to run cnc machines which is pretty big for finding work.
207.0,Provider,"You said you said it again, you have to learn how to what."
2510.0,Patient,"i've learned in the last month, how to run cnc machines."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2510.0,Patient,You can find those jobs anywhere.
207.0,Provider,"What are you gonna do, are you gonna just continue."
2510.0,Patient,"I don't know. i'm thinking about just not applying. To that company and keep working there as a top right now that way I can just worked eight hours. But then I can learn more about running these machines get some more experience. And I because I really don't know phone work for this company their vacation plans sucks and they they're pretty low paying for machine shops, but i'm learning. How to do stuff and getting confidence because uh. uh I don't know they they told me how I did really good and stuff like that. When I showed up. Like they were going to have these Arabic train me and I couldn't understand where they said. So they wanted me to like work 12 hours and. come in for four hours. to train of someone who speaks English then just work for eight hours, not doing nothing. And I didn't lie I said no. Can you just um then they said, can we can you go to first for a while and train on first ship and I said yeah but they kept me there longer than I wanted, because I was away from my wife for because she worked SEC nights you know. i'm. For four weeks, one of those weeks was thanksgiving so we got four days off, but, and then we got the weekend off. While I worked, I worked on Saturday, which she didn't so we got a couple nights to spend together, but they moved me to suck at and. My first week there. um I work I work, four days, and then they had me come in for 212 hours on the weekend and. So I came in four hours early Friday and Saturday, and they were just like the guy on the ship before me he left mean terrible because they weren't 1012 hours to and um. He also had a baby ciphers grandkids so. He yeah couple hours sleep go in there do a shitty job and leave me screwed soon as I get there soon as I show up for the start of my ship and then i'm running behind all night. And like I don't have time to do. Like everything i'm supposed to so, then I gotta take shortcuts and. Be it's just I would be frustrated for 12 hours that's way too long to be frustrated doing something so. uh at the end of my shift on Saturday. i've been there 11 hours i'm ready for a day off. And I was there 12 hours a day before that the Supervisor says, do you see the. The schedule you're working tomorrow, right at the end of my shift I went off I snapped on them and said i'm not ain't coming tomorrow. he's like well, then you guys will be working next Sunday and i'm like. I don't know I I was like I told him I was i've only been on second shift and they're crazy on switching you shifts they one working on Saturday. and change shifts on Monday, so they tried my after my first week they tried having me work Saturday night and be there at 630 in the morning Monday. Well, I didn't go to that either and Sunday morning I woke up and I was falling asleep all day. and So they would have been like I don't know they're just then after four weeks, they wanted me to work Saturday and then go to work Monday, when you when you switch shifts on factories they're supposed to be able to do the whole weekend off that way you got more time to get acclimated. They just they so that they have very unreasonable expectations that's why I call my temp service Monday and said i'm not where I came out, I was like I I did real good at this this job and. i'm So if you if you have other machine shops i'd like to go to one of those because. i'm at like they gave me the on machine the the guys who've been working there for a while don't want to run because it's new and it's there they told me the most a lot of people can't can't do the job i'm doing. And I was like after eight hours i've had i've done and exhausted mentally exhausted I just can't handle the 12 hours so she called and told them that. Instead of me then finding me a different place to work so it's all it's working out at work."
207.0,Provider,i'm.
2510.0,Patient,I know it's very hard to follow.
207.0,Provider,"The, no, no, I mean when it is OK so for you and I think we've talked about this, because I know for some time, like you've been you know my changing jobs because of one thing or the other. No other."
2510.0,Patient,"Half yeah, no, no, sir."
207.0,Provider,"yeah no I was just saying, like you, you've been training for one word like one not being a right fit for our is that just you getting acclimated adjust that on the level of work that's required or your different things like what would you say, would be a goal for you. so that you can you know go in Vienna job and stay in that job for a while, meaning that at least stay long enough, that you can build up some form of decent retirement plan or something like that."
2510.0,Patient,"yeah well that's what i've been trying to do find the right factory. It took me a while to find out what I wanted what factory, I want to work at or what what I want to do, while at these factories and I do want to be machine is so i'd kind of like to stay here. i'm fl let me work is a time because I don't want to get hired in because then they will make me fucking live there. they'll have me work, as well as every day because that's what they just did. not want to live there, so i'm going to try to just stay at a time."
207.0,Provider,"But is there any position that you can work in that it will not be worth Mike you said, did you have any live here."
2510.0,Patient,"Well, the Supervisor, he did say he wants to train me. On another line that is it as i'm isn't as high doesn't need as many parts, because he doesn't want to lose me because I learned how to do this, one job really good I don't know if I did it fast or not, but i'm doing good. So he doesn't he doesn't want to lose me. So he wants me to start learning another line but he's also going to move me back to this line so because they put in four weeks training me there. So um."
207.0,Provider,"So. What do you would you work like what is it. What is it like three days 12 hours, four days 12 hours like how many days so."
2510.0,Patient,"I want to want to do that, I want to, I want to work i'd rather work, six, eight and possibly 112 12 hour and five eight at the very most."
207.0,Provider,Because i'm just thinking like if you were supposed to work 312 and all four days wouldn't it be better.
2510.0,Patient,"For me, not for me i'd rather word it like i'd rather be there more days but work shorter days. I know you don't get as much like. You know, like it does feel good to have a two or three days off, but I also. I smoke more when I have. Like if I had three days off half the week i'd smoked a lot."
207.0,Provider,"Not rather all. So it helps with the creep Okay, so what is, what about your wife."
2510.0,Patient,"Well, she she actually she's doing really good she just got hired in this factory and she makes more money than me um she was on a temp to hire position and. she's pretty excited she's getting hired. On full time and, like she's she's never been hired in before so."
207.0,Provider,And you guys are back living together right.
2510.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we we've always lived together. To pay but, even though she was paying to live there, she didn't live there shoe do."
207.0,Provider,You have the whole thing with the brother in the work in the pizza place and all of that you guys have split up.
2510.0,Patient,yeah but not for more than like a week want the longest was a week. But it wasn't even a week it was like five days.
207.0,Provider,"Out of my because I met with you more than once, then she one now."
2510.0,Patient,"No never longer than that, like she she got an apartment but. She never stayed there longer than two days at the apartment before she got the apartment one time she was gone for like five days but that's that's the most."
207.0,Provider,"hmm OK OK, but so you guys are working, what about your kids."
2510.0,Patient,what's that.
207.0,Provider,What about your children.
2510.0,Patient,"That man it's been a rough month on that um that from one kid. One of my stuff kids she's married and she had a baby and they got CPS is now involved. And there was a. Some some abuse the baby had a. Few broke like three broken ribs but they didn't the hospital didn't find out about that, until the bones were healed. So yeah and that was pretty crazy because. They never, ever, let us watch the baby, but all right, like we were right at near the timeline we watched her one day, and it was like they tried to establish some kind of timeline based on the healing and we were like close to it. Like we had her for two hours, maybe two and a half, one time. And so I was kind of worried about that, but. i'm. A few weeks after that the other, the other stuck kid got like she was starting to get legal problems and she was around her around. On like high on math doing some crazy stupid shit and she went to jail one night and she got dropped off here and my wife was at work, and she was just pushing my buttons for like three hours. and I tried to go to bed. And while I was in bed, she was like packing stuff that she was going to take with her like grocery bags of food and but also different weird stuff they want to. You want to thank somebody would. Thank thanks to bring when they're. Trying to like get a play find somewhere to stay. But like i'm I woke up and I saw the stuff that she had packed up and she said she was going to be cleaning the House, and she just moved all our shit around. Like just destroyed the House and our that I was trying to lie down and go to sleep, but I couldn't sleep, because I knew, she was out there being crazy. I came out there and because I noticed that she took my. My bait. Pan and. Like I told her hey you need to give that back and she she didn't know where it was because she had all sorts of shit packed up she had no idea where this was. So it took her like five minutes to find that then she has to borrow my phone and I let her use my phone because he was trying to. find some place to stay. And she won't give me my phone back. Then I finally got my phone back and she told me talk to you talk to you, and then I I said you gotta leave I told her, she had she had we've. wow. Early I told her. She told her mom to Fuck off when your mom was on speaker. My wife got upset yelled at her that she ran off the storm in the bathroom. And I told her you can't talk to him i'm like that. But when I told her, she had to leave she said, fine i'll be back when my mom gets home and she ran upstairs and she was shaped she's living her so she had a bunch of her stuff upstairs. But i'm like wait, because I was trying to go to bed when I asked for my phone back and. She took you know storming for us, so I kicked her out i'm waiting still wait and go to bed and i'm waiting for her for her to come downstairs. And we've but she's upstairs making just a huge ruckus throwing shit around I go upstairs and she's throwing her shut out the fucking windows upstairs out under the earth. she's throwing her shit out into the earth, and I was like i'm like what are you doing and she's like this is all mine i'm you know just throwing my shit out i'm taking my stuff and then she she's grabbing this baby thing that my wife bought for our other daughter and. She. I was like that's our stuff you're throwing out I ended up calling the please, and I said you. I asked her leaves you want to leave and. she's. Throwing our stuff out the window. And so the police came and. Like. She she finally went outside when I call the COPs and she said i'll i'll tell them my side of storage side of the story i'm like whatever. The COPs show up and they they came inside and talk to me and I pointed to everything that was lying around or like the bags full of our stuff that got packed up when I was in bed. And I showed him the hair that she cut off the head, it was like in the bathroom doorway. i'm. I said she's upstairs throwing shit out the window. or she was upstairs throwing shit out the window that wasn't hers because he said, well, she said everything she threw out was hers I was like it wasn't and the next day when we went outside half of it was our stuff like fucking pillows blankets. Because I left, I went to bed after the COPs loved I find me head around the House and."
207.0,Provider,It sounds like. It sounds like you need to set boundaries.
2510.0,Patient,"We are setting boundaries she she didn't come back she talked her mom and. She threatened her mom after hours of sleep. um because their mom was telling her. What she saw like the the our House is destroyed and. uh. You know, tell her why. She was why. Was she couldn't come home, right now, and all of us. because she could she tried coming on the same name, you know. But her mom said no. But she like after a few days after this she brought on she came to her sisters, and the reason she was staying at her sisters, not in our House. When she got arrested and then came here she came from jail, to hear or see actually no she came from jail, she went out and got high and then came here. And like a few days later. I mean, she was at her sisters in some car and the COPs called her sister looking for her as what we heard from her sister but her sister said no that's not really his car because they were looking for we have because some guy reported this car stolen. But my wife come to my wife talked to her, this was a couple weeks ago when I call the COPs on her, but like within the last four or five days my wife talked to her and she said that she was in this car with this guy our age and my wife knows them and the guy does have a lot of. CSC charges. She like because and the COPs thought it was weird they found one boo. And they found half of a costume. and Like a wig but. I don't know she's claims the guy was trying to rape her and she got out of the car, but she couldn't grab all her stuff because her sister identified the stuff in the car is hers but there's only one boo in the car and. I don't know it's nuts, but she also like when she was here, because she was trying to get her car out of the impound I forgot that part. And I it was 150 bucks and eyes she's wanted the money for me and I was like I don't get our $50 and then the girl started crying like a three year old. For like five minutes and then she stopped that and was fine and she and one start cleaning the House and. What she called diana's mom who also adopted her so this woman's my wife's adopted mother and her daughter's adoptive mother and she's telling her grandma that she's gonna go. i'm hook, to make 150 bucks of their grandma can't give her $150 it was just crazy and she was. Just the way the things she was saying to me is stuff she shouldn't be Sanders step that. Like because she's playing she got pepper sprayed by the COPs and the COPs raped her but i'm which I know is all fucking bullshit but she's she said she got pepper sprayed four times and how she doesn't want to she never wants to be pepper sprayed four times again and not get fucked. Fuck it just stuff she shouldn't be saying to me and then later."
207.0,Provider,daughter.
2510.0,Patient,"yeah later after she was getting. asking her grandma for 150 bucks. More she's gonna hook she tells me that she's off the phone up or grandma she tells me that she's a. Sex worker and. i'm stuff and I, like the next couple days I was I I wondered if she was trying to get me to give her $150 for sets i'm not sure she was or not. Just it was. I know i've never been around somebody who who. Did whoo I don't know, been around other addicts female addicts that fucking sold themselves so. I don't know what if."
207.0,Provider,"You talk about in the past, not just you've talked about mom. You know her own history."
2510.0,Patient,"yeah but I didn't know we're back then, you know. mm hmm and yeah I know and then, when I was at rehab I met addicts who fucking hooked and stuff but outside of rehab I never met I really didn't hang out with that other addicts I just became an addict by um my doctor given me madison's medications for three years. So."
207.0,Provider,"I mean, but as i'm saying it's like you know there's oftentimes a history of certain behavior. You know, with the fact that mom has her own history and now her children, and not just her home history of addiction, but just kind of a lot more so, of the trauma yeah that she's gone through and her children being that."
2510.0,Patient,"her children say that that. The woman who adopted them, who also adopted my wife that her husband there has there the woman's husband sexually abused. And Diana said. The first husband and Roman she's on her saga husband, since my wife's an owner and 20 years she said hit the husband never abused her, but he said really disgusting things to her stuff he shouldn't be telling is is a adopted daughter um. that's the first husband, but he so he didn't abuse her, but she says he did abuse his biological daughter. Which is the diana's adopted mother and. The kids adopt mother's first haldeman was sexually abusive do is show his own children not Diana, but he said things shut it up to her and the kids are claiming the second has been abused them so. I don't like. I don't know diana's abuse. it's weird I mean it's not weird but her kids are also saying that i'm. They were abused, but by by the. Their adoptive family. So it's it's kind of in my my wife's biological mother was pretty crazy and sexually abused like Diana faints her mother killed her first kid who, and she was pregnant by our own father, like the the the family has a. history of him, like. inbreeding and sexual abuse. it's just. I don't know it's. it's like I had so just having to deal with the daughter on drugs but also worrying about the other daughters criminal case it was a lot that all happen in like. Two weeks, while i'm training on this job on that now, and I still I managed to learn how to do something that is kind of a skilled Labor. I don't know I think i'm doing okay. But. i'm looking forward to last stuff. going on at home open Some, like some of it corrects itself. No, I mean."
207.0,Provider,"you're not going to correct itself, I think it just comes down to a place are you addressing it, you have to set boundaries, you have to talk to your wife about the behaviors of your of her daughters and her needing to send appropriate boundaries with her job okay."
2510.0,Patient,"We have my wife she's doing pretty good like she's not she's learned that she sorry for interrupting you but she's learned that she's a lot like she's been enabled and i'm over the last two years and, like it's come down to them having serious problems, right now, you know what i'm saying. and sees that giving them money like. The because the daughter who's got the criminal case her husband's still not working and she's she's not giving them money, right now, and the daughter, the daughter works, a. daughter works at wendy's. So I mean so their incomes isn't enough, it takes two incomes to have an apartment or a trailer it's cheaper to live in. My house is cheaper than rant but. That everybody says we're so I really gotta go to work."
207.0,Provider,"No problem alright, so let me, let me get will you for. You don't have any next month will be at right."
2510.0,Patient,Yes.
