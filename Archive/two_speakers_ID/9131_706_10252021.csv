706.0,Provider,Hello. How are you doing.
9131.0,Patient,i'm much better than I was a few days ago.
706.0,Provider,"All right, tell me about it."
9131.0,Patient,"Much better okay one second. You get back to this. So yeah i'm much better mentally than when I was a few days ago. I started a new job Wednesday i'm i'm starting a new job I went on the date with the guy and it went really good it went so I went into that whole thing. I went into that whole thing you know, like we talked about i'm just going to have an open mind and see what it was because I was so hung up and stuck on. So cringe even thinking about how sad I was about it. But I knew that was gonna happen, but. Oh, my gosh i'd like this guy so much he's so sweet i've never been treated like actual like lady before it's weird it's it's different. But we went I went there we went to the dislike haunted thing like 100 trailer whatever Friday and as soon as you drop me back off well, he was like. When can I see you again did it in a way that's been in the whole weekend together we didn't we didn't do anything physical or anything. we're getting to know each other, I don't know it's fun it's really fun right now and then my new job on top of a are we making a lot more money than I was I don't know she's it's a lot of a lot of good things going on right now than what it was a week ago. yeah."
706.0,Provider,"See, I told you, you just never know you know and. Seeing you know you think that the one that you think you're gonna like and turns out to be the way."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's it's so i'm just talking about this last night it's just so different like I don't know little little mannerisms like he holds doors open for me everywhere we go. I mean, he pays for everything he's just really respectful like we went to the flea market yesterday. And I wanted to look at and buy some instance so and I was smelling all these instance, and I was sitting there for like a half hour looking at all of them, he was just so patient with me, he was just smelling them with me and. He was holding my purse for me and he was just really, really sweet and. it's just different, and I really I really, really like this guy but what's going slow it i'm taking it slow I don't know what the what it's going to happen, out of it but i'm just enjoying it white last right now."
706.0,Provider,"yeah and that's all you can do and get to know them because, like I said the best foundation for a relationship is a friendship first."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah exactly, and I remember you saying that and I was thinking about that I was like that's so true it's right i'm gonna i'm gonna try to do it right, this time."
706.0,Provider,"I really am you communicate to him, like where you're at, and you know no expectations and all of that stuff."
9131.0,Patient,"We haven't really had that really have that conversation I don't know it's just like when we're together we don't know we just didn't we just enjoy each other's company we don't really put any pressure on it or. I don't know we haven't really had that talk, you know what I mean it's just we're just we're just enjoying it right now. Okay, and and he is as much as I am, and I like that to. Have you know I. Get that back. or anything right right."
706.0,Provider,"Well, good i'm glad you're having fun and that's I mean that's like the best part of like a new relationship is that, like butterflies in your stomach like. To have fun and spend time with the person um but like no like I said no expectations and no pressure, because then that makes it so much more serious than it needs to be. yeah you just need to have fun."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So we'll see about that, but yeah it was I, and I think that's I think that's why i'm enjoying it so much because I went into it, with no expectations I didn't I well I went to because I was trying to get my mind off somebody else but it just. Totally not not be in what I thought. Even. I just look back at that whole situation which I knew I would I knew I would look back eventually be like Why am I so upset about this, but."
706.0,Provider,"you're so used to dysfunctional relationship. Yes, when a good one, is approaching you you're like oh i'm not gonna like this guy. Like he's born. You know, like whatever, but then, but then you go and you're like oh so this is how the other side lives. I could write this like treat me like a real person like they care about me like."
9131.0,Patient,Here I.
706.0,Provider,"Know like i'm a lady like that's you know that's that's good I like this, but you've never. Had so you didn't even know what to expect."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm I don't really like I said I really I really want to do it right, this time I don't want to push this guy away. And I feel like some of my toxic traits are going to come out eventually because I don't know how to handle someone treating me like that it's so foreign to me. like somebody holds the door open for. me i'm like oh my God he's such a gentleman like i'm just i'm trying to work on that, right now, not letting my past trauma take it out on somebody who really honestly doesn't deserve it. will try to be more aware of it."
706.0,Provider,"Now, and then the other thing too is. Coming to the realization that that's what you deserve well you know because you've been in such toxic relationships forever that that's what you're used to so then your brain starts telling me well, this is all I can get."
9131.0,Patient,And so I you know you have to.
706.0,Provider,"change that thinking around and say no, this is what i've had but I deserve better and just because this person has different doesn't make them bad."
9131.0,Patient,And just because they treat it.
706.0,Provider,doesn't mean that there's something wrong with them either.
9131.0,Patient,that's a good way to look at it.
706.0,Provider,"You know, because you're just you get into those those mind functions like. yeah it's so used to being treated poorly that you're like. you're so."
9131.0,Patient,"it's just like you don't. You when you if you don't know something I mean i've never experienced that before so, how would I know that that's even."
706.0,Provider,Exactly.
9131.0,Patient,You know I don't know how would I know if I don't have it let's just like you said you just feel like that's all you deserve. It you're like that's all you deserve because that's all you've ever known.
706.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm going on the other side of things, you know, then, then this guy is different, so, then you instantly think well what's wrong with him i'm not gonna make him like."
9131.0,Patient,"You know, trying to catch myself thinking that."
706.0,Provider,"Right yep so you're starting to think that because you're like well why are they, why are they Nice and all these other guys weren't Nice. yeah what's their end game, you know, like when's that other shoe to. Choose it to be true. kind of thing exactly you have to you're getting in that mind Funk and you just have to like change it around and like Okay, no. i'm a different person than I was then so you have to look at that it's like when you were in those dysfunctional toxic relationships prior to this last guy because I feel like he was just a learning lesson for."
9131.0,Patient,You know exactly exactly what he was that's exactly what.
706.0,Provider,He was he was just a reminder that you don't want to be the person you used to be.
9131.0,Patient,So not going to count him yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Exactly so like you think back and you think about when you were toxic your spouse and so you were in toxic relationships and you're not that person anymore. you write so much new become a totally different person, so now that person is going to attract a different type of person. And so."
9131.0,Patient,that's what you're getting like.
706.0,Provider,"A real person, a person who really wants to get to know you whether it works out or whether it doesn't whether you guys stay friends, whether you don't whatever it may be. Just know that that's that's how it's supposed to be people are supposed to be kind and gentle and understanding and non judgmental and not pushy and that pressure you. and"
9131.0,Patient,"Oh, it went. It muted."
706.0,Provider,or there.
9131.0,Patient,Oh there it is. Right yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So so so you know you have to like I was saying is, you have to understand me these people that you come across that are good people that care about you. and care about what your needs are and understand your needs so this this guy before you know that you were all broken up about like he didn't care what your needs were he didn't care that you had insecurities and that you needed to feel comforted and cared for and he didn't care. No he didn't care because he didn't fit what hit what he needed. So. You need to find somebody that understands that you've been jaded that you've had toxic relationships at one minute to trust. it's going to take you a minute to you know, be completely open and vulnerable and until you get to that place you, you know you you're going to be more attention seeking, I guess, but it sounds like this guy is okay with that because he just wants to spend time with you."
9131.0,Patient,With no. With no APP right.
706.0,Provider,"it's, on the other side."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that that's that's really good way to put it yeah and it's yeah it's just so different like last night he was he was dropping me off, we went to the flea market went to the movies yesterday. We do normal stuff like normal dating stuff like you're not coming over to my house to hook up or anything like we have fun normal stuff. And he was dropping me off, and I was getting out of his car and we were talking about how my car's radiator problem, and he has a little bit about cars and. He was like I was getting out of cartoons like Well, I can look at it, if you want me to. And then he was he took his all flashlight was looking in my hood and he was just talking about all this car stuff you know I didn't understand anything he was saying. But you could just tell that he didn't want to leave he wanted he needed one me like he wanted to keep spending time with me and I thought it was cute he was just like he was just stalling does he didn't want to go home."
706.0,Provider,To need your House painted him.
9131.0,Patient,yeah exactly that's exactly what i'm looking.
706.0,Provider,For yeah.
9131.0,Patient,My dog. yeah yeah. yeah yeah it's it's it feels good to have to have it reciprocated and him feel the same way.
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
9131.0,Patient,"It really does, and we have the same beliefs, and we have the same beliefs like with our faith and stuff he's been through he's been through a lot in this life like I have he's older than me he's a little bit older he's 30 326 so I like that too."
706.0,Provider,there's nothing that's nothing.
9131.0,Patient,"yeah let's help my mom and dad were part two. he's got a he's got a daughter she's a my son's over seven so our kids are close in age, you know."
706.0,Provider,Oh perfect.
9131.0,Patient,I don't know I just. i've been praying for somebody like this.
706.0,Provider,"yeah no that's great you know take it slow and enjoy it and and don't rush it, you know because."
9131.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,You just have to if you're like nurtured it's a new relationship.
9131.0,Patient,You know yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Like just add water instant family, because in some cases that works, and in some cases, it does."
9131.0,Patient,yeah no I don't want to do that.
706.0,Provider,sure.
9131.0,Patient,yeah so.
706.0,Provider,"You just want to take it slow, make sure that it works, you know and. yeah and just enjoy it enjoy the time that you guys have together, because once you do that whole instant family blended family thing then your alone time goes away."
9131.0,Patient,yeah right oh yeah.
706.0,Provider,"enjoy enjoy the dating time because, once you become family then it's like a whole different it's a whole different thing. Right, because you just you just go to a different level and and being apart in age is is not like a huge thing and. on either side, like if you were older and he was younger or if he's older you're younger, you know, in your in the age bracket that you're in you don't change that much like your late 20s till your early 30s like."
9131.0,Patient,you're kind of right you're.
706.0,Provider,"In this instance, in the same place in life yeah early 20s to late 20s."
9131.0,Patient,Right right.
706.0,Provider,"And so you know you don't have you don't have that much discrepancy, and like where you are, as a person."
9131.0,Patient,Exactly that's exactly what I was thinking you know i'm in my late 20s and he's in his early 30s I mean honestly. we're not it's not that it's not that far apart yeah.
706.0,Provider,"And you know cats are the same age, so I mean. yeah and, obviously, he has a car so that's good. And he has a job oh that's good so you know, remember, we talked about the negotiable and the non negotiable, did you make your last."
9131.0,Patient,"I did, I made it mentally but I didn't write it down as part of the job that's a non negotiable and. he's got he's got that."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
9131.0,Patient,"You know, he lives, he lives 26 minutes for me and he's he's willing to drive it every day, I mean he did for the whole weekend so. I mean honestly if I if I asked him, I asked him right now hey do you want to come watch paint drives me. I feel like he'd be like sure."
706.0,Provider,Watch paint dry well that sounds like a great time.
9131.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,Well that's good that's.
9131.0,Patient,Good now.
706.0,Provider,"makes that makes you feel good, like you, you know you're important to him and his wife and that's a good feeling to have."
9131.0,Patient,A game is at um but at the same time i'm trying just not to get too excited about it because. I don't know I don't want this to I don't want this to crush me because I could see this hurt really bad if it doesn't.
706.0,Provider,"Well, and and that's where that fear comes in."
9131.0,Patient,"But you know, like ever known."
706.0,Provider,"Exactly, but the thing is is you never will have a chance, unless you take one. So, like never going to know, unless you just give it your all and if you give it your all in it doesn't work, yes it hurts and hurts when we break up with people, it does, especially people you care about. But on the other hand, it also happens for a reason it teaches you something that you're supposed to take with you into the next relationship to help you be more successful to keep you grounded um you know it's just. life's like a roller coaster it just follow ups and downs, and you just can't predict it you just have to go with the flow."
9131.0,Patient,"You really can't and i'm just sick i'm sick of breaking up i'm sick. yeah exhausted about I don't know i'm i'm not speaking anything over it, because i'm not gonna jinx it. Just really. Just I don't I don't want to keep doing this i'm just trying to be in the moment and."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm just take it day by day. me, the one thing that is key, when you are in a friendship even trying to move into like a relationship place is communication so. Just being open and honest about how you're feeling and. If he's the right person like yours and you're supposed to continue down this path and he's going to understand."
9131.0,Patient,Exactly.
706.0,Provider,"You know just. Just drew about how you feel because holding it in until it's too late, then it's too late, holding an end and not seeing anything, then, can also cause you to act or radically. Because you're trying to deal with those feelings on your own and you've had you know bad experiences with that so if you're starting to feel like. You know I really like you, I still want to go slow, but I really want you to know this, then you need to say that, because if you don't then it's going to come out in weird ways like Peters. Right hey you're going to be like Oh, he doesn't really like me. Right, he doesn't like me because he didn't call me for a day and squeeze out probably out with somebody else and you're going to start doing this racing thoughts in your head and it's going to all."
9131.0,Patient,"Yes, that's true."
706.0,Provider,"So you just need to communicate, because if you say to him hey I still want to take the slow, but I want to let you know, like, I really am enjoying spending time with you i'm I really do like you. And then he says, you know that's awesome like I really like you and, like spending time with you, too, now you both have a mutual agreement that you both are in it for the right reasons you feel the same. So then, if he doesn't call you for a day you're not going to instantly go to that negative place you're going to be like Oh well, he's probably you know hanging out with his daughter, or you know, maybe he's. You know just really tired, or you know, or you can send them a text be like you know hey I haven't heard from you today just wanted to say I was thinking of you, and then that's it, you know so it's, not even a like Where are you, and what are you doing."
9131.0,Patient,Right right exactly.
706.0,Provider,"Just like this, like just cute little hey think just just you know just walk by some paint thinking about watching with with you, and while it dries or whatever you know, like. yeah or you know just pass. just thinking of you or a flea market or you know, whatever."
9131.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,Just like those little tiny.
9131.0,Patient,We don't want to come off. Too too intense.
706.0,Provider,"needy or clean. Exactly you know, but you know, but just sending something little like that, because more than likely. Especially if you guys are on the same page how's it he'll send something back you know. All that sweet or you know i'm thinking of you to or you know, maybe even a plan for hey let's get together tomorrow, you know something just something very simple, but you know not like 17 texts, you know within an hour and that like. yeah it's like."
9131.0,Patient,"A good exactly i'm not gonna i'm not I told myself i'm not going to do. This with him i'm not i'm not going to do that with him. i'm not going to do with him. And you know he works during the day I don't I you know I respect someone who works i'm not going to sit there and blow you up while you're at work. But you know I it's i've been having those same thoughts and it's like every time it's so weird it's like we're on on this weird same wavelength him and I. Every time i'll start to wonder like dang I haven't heard much. At all he'll text me and then the day of the haunted trail thing. We send each other, we were we were googling other places like last minute we were like Oh, we should go to displace instead of this one, or whatever. And I was like okay i'll look it up and, apparently, he was looking at places at the same time, I was. And we both took a screenshot of this exact exact same place and send it to each other at the exact same time like maybe we should go here. And then another time something similar happened it's just like. it's just like we're on the same wavelength it's really it's really strange there's a lot of weird coincidences that have already happened with him. But i'm like I said i'm just I don't it's weird and it's sad that I can't feel like I can't get excited about something, because I feel like it's going to be ripped away from me."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
9131.0,Patient,And something terrible is going to happen soon and. I don't know.
706.0,Provider,"And that's I said, instead of thinking like that just enjoy it for what it is. you're just not used to it."
9131.0,Patient,"And I have this huge mentality of I need to hurt you if you hurt me that's a whole nother issue that I need to work on, because I do that with everybody."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and the thing is is that's that's that toxicity but you've had your in your life you've had that toxicity, so what would happen if somebody doesn't hurt you."
9131.0,Patient,know.
706.0,Provider,"You know what I mean like what if you wait around and you don't push them away or do something to push them away, and then they don't hurt you."
9131.0,Patient,it's a good question. What would I.
706.0,Provider,How are you going to know that.
9131.0,Patient,If you keep pushing them away right.
706.0,Provider,"So what if every time you get that feeling I need to push them away you just don't and then nothing bad happens. And then you do it again and nothing bad still happens. And then. And then you don't feel the need to push them away anymore, because the bad stuff you think's going to happen it's not happening."
9131.0,Patient,Right yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, and when you get into that mentality so let's say three weeks from now."
9131.0,Patient,you're like.
706.0,Provider,"US I better push him away because, if I don't he's just going to not like me and he's going to break my heart and I just. yeah but what would be making you think that what what would be making you think that he's going to hurt you."
9131.0,Patient,"Well, you know what my thing is I. If i'm not if someone every day i'm like oh they're they're texting weird now or they're being short with me or I haven't really heard from them much today they they have to be losing interest he has to be he's going to eventually but that's what I think when i'm in relationships."
706.0,Provider,So.
9131.0,Patient,They lose interest in me that's what I feel like.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so, but is it possible that it's all that's all in your head."
9131.0,Patient,it's very possible.
706.0,Provider,"So this guy that you've been hanging out with since Friday. you've seen him every day since Friday. Yes, and now today's Monday. Have you talked to him today. yeah okay so you've talked to him today, so this is one day. So. Is it possible that he somehow understands you or is in many ways, like you, so that he makes that extra effort every day, just to say hey. Because, maybe he feels kind of the same things you feel like people lose interest in me or I don't want him to think i'm losing interest or you know these these different things, is it possible that he. understands you."
9131.0,Patient,Right or feels the same way to.
706.0,Provider,"feels the same way, which, in a way, is understanding you because. He can then relate to how you feel because maybe he's been that guy because there are guys out there that are super sensitive and."
9131.0,Patient,"Yes, there's."
706.0,Provider,"Women as women have been hurt by men um you know and so maybe he's like you and he needs to have that at least that little bit of interaction every day, just to reassure him that you're still interested because maybe he's had some toxicity in his life."
9131.0,Patient,"I could see that, now that you say that I could see that I could see that, because it is. Good morning, every morning good night, you know, even if we haven't talked much during that day it's always good night, you know it's always got to have least like let you know i'm thinking of you right, for I go to bed every night every morning and. You know, every every time we hung out as soon as he gets home he's always like made it home, now that i'm how or when or what can I see you again I want to see you again soon as I get home. That kind of thing so. Maybe he maybe he has been through similar things and just once I don't know that's a good that's a good point. I guess the world doesn't revolve around me that's a good point he could have been through something like that. So maybe I I haven't got into. The mom situation because he has his daughter like they just got our lives with him I haven't even asked about that, so I don't know what that's like which I need to I feel like I need to ask about that. But yeah I don't know what that situation is that's. a really good possibility now that you said."
706.0,Provider,"You know you just. You know if he's doing those things, every day, then your gut because if you hear from them, you know, at least for like a good morning and good night, and you know he's working all day and maybe you don't hear from them, or you or maybe you do, but at least you're getting that little bit. Right."
9131.0,Patient,"That you need yeah every night yeah I mean if I just get that every night i'm good yeah I agree just that little bit of I still exist kind of thing you know i'm so needy i'm so needy, I want to work on the I don't want to be like that, like I don't want to be that girl. Like I cannot delete not cause constantly need you to tell me. You love me or like you think of me i'm pretty I don't want to be that person."
706.0,Provider,"So what you need to do is to fill your life with other things besides the relationship, so I think, where you where you have faltered in the past, is once you're with somebody your whole world is that person. And what you do is once you're with somebody you don't make them your whole world there a piece of you a piece of your world. But do you think that they don't have other pieces of their world that don't include you because they do and that's how it should be, they should have separate lives that you live, and then a life that you live together and then. Exactly, you have to be your own person, you have to know who you are before you can know what you want, or even if you. If you want to, or if you even like what you're doing who you are your life, you have to figure that out individually and then the other person has to figure out that individually and then you can come together and share your life together. Do you share your life together, you still have, or should have outside friends outside interests outside things that maybe you just do by yourself. And so again altered in the past is that once you meet somebody and you connect with them all you do is think about them and you don't do anything else besides focus on that relationship or that person."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah that I there, I very much was like that, because any became it became really obsessive because, like my way of thinking when I was on drugs was just so so different than what it is now. Like I would yeah that's exactly what I would do I mean it was drugs and my boyfriend it wasn't even like. taking care of my kid wasn't a priority, none of that I was terrible mother it wasn't any of that and it's just. it's just it is different, like, I really liked this guy and I think about him a lot. But yeah that that codependency used to be really, really bad and I think I still there, to a degree, I can feel it is, I can feel it still is there and I know i'm I know i'm codependent but. yeah used to be a lot worse, I used to be exactly the way you just described, oh yeah like it was it was my world revolved around that like I would drop anything and everything and I wasn't working either so like my mind was. was not in that routine every day yeah. yeah which made it even worse."
706.0,Provider,"So what if this time I mean obviously like this guy you want to spend time with him, but what if you. Try and set certain days so like the days that you will see him are the state that state that state like you can see him more than that, but maybe set like date days like. You know, like these are going to be your date days this week and we can talk on the phone or text in between, but these are going to be our date days, because you need to have you days to so I want you to start trying to figure out, you know what is hunter like to do. Like what does hunter like to do like you work and you love your son, but what does hunter like to do like for fine they."
9131.0,Patient,"You know if you, I know I know what I know what I love to. Do and I love I nails nails is my hobby is what I do I do other people's I do my. nails or it's my favorite thing to do and that's what I do when I have."
706.0,Provider,Time and you know.
9131.0,Patient,What was that.
706.0,Provider,You should go to school and be a nail technician.
9131.0,Patient,I did.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
9131.0,Patient,I did yeah.
706.0,Provider,So why don't you do nails.
9131.0,Patient,"it's just. The nail industry is very, very, very toxic that's why, and I don't want to work I don't want to work at a salon I don't I do it out of my house sometimes. I and that's about as far as I go with it, I used to do it like as you used to be what I did and it's a. I said i'm stepping away from that i'm not. Yes, terrible women suck women with that industry, they will tear you down to build themselves up it's a competition it's just like being a. cosmetologist doing hair. it's either it just wasn't what I thought it would be."
706.0,Provider,"I don't know my nail place, I can never understand what they're saying, because they're talking like a wave a different language and so."
9131.0,Patient,yeah that. one's yeah and they will work you to death to.
706.0,Provider,That and i'm like I hope you're not talking about me because I have no clue.
9131.0,Patient,Because I don't have the time now and i'm like are they laughing at me because they really aren't.
706.0,Provider,"So um but no so you like nails, but do you have to have other things that you like like maybe go take a zoom the class or a dance class or an art class."
9131.0,Patient,"I am i'm exercising right now. Oh, my gosh it is just big clearing my mind, so I got up this morning, yes. yeah it's just like that that that fresh air that it's just like oh I just like all my frustrations out this morning and I exercise for 42 minutes. Just felt so good it felt so good, and I have a house in the past month and a."
706.0,Provider,"Half that's awesome. So, yes and that's another thing so like you can focus on that, so what you're going to find like I said this this. Other guy that was just in life, the last week, he was like your reminder, you know it's kind of like that reminder, you said on your phone to do something he was the reminder of what not to do so."
9131.0,Patient,he's actually.
706.0,Provider,He came into your life for a reason he reminded you what you don't want so now that's done and it's let you focus more on what you do want.
9131.0,Patient,And while you're good way to look at them.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so much why, when you're focusing on what you do want, then you can also focus on things that maybe you didn't know you want it like exercising that's a really great thing like you can exercise losing weight is great, but just that endorphins that you get from exercising."
9131.0,Patient,Absolutely.
706.0,Provider,"makes you feel good. You use when you look at yourself, you think that you, even if you haven't lost any weight you'll look at yourself and to you you'll be more attractive more pretty more acceptable. Because you you've changed that kind of that chemical makeup of your brain, so you just feel better So then, when people feel better they think okay they're more accepting of themselves when people are depressed they're not accepting of themselves because."
9131.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"You know, like themselves. So you know working out is great. You know, and all those all of the little things that you can do to make yourself feel good that's why I said, even an art class because there's also like and i'm."
9131.0,Patient,So good idea. In a really fun idea. and art class.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
9131.0,Patient,"Well, because there's an exhilaration. Just starting on. nothing wrong with do that with me yeah. yeah or even like a claim modestly class will be. fun."
706.0,Provider,"I will warn you those wheel classes, where you do like the spinning with the wheel. yeah those are hard Oh, those are."
9131.0,Patient,They really.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh no, they are because you like you're like have it perfect now the side and. Just a little too much light goes off flat and like rings."
9131.0,Patient,So it's harder than it looks.
706.0,Provider,It is but it's super fun it's super fun.
9131.0,Patient,sounds fun.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so it means there's all those like cool things that you can do, and like I said, there is its own kind of exhilaration to making something with your hands or with your mind like creating something. And you're creative because you do nails and nails is something creative you know, like so it's. it's one outlet yeah so but I mean it's one of those things that's like the creative part of your brain so obviously if you can tap into that in different areas that's going to be awesome. yeah that also gives you that time where you can focus on something else besides the boy in your life. You know yeah you know if it's this guy or if it's a different guy or whatever, but then you're not so over focused like you might go the whole day and be like Oh, you can text me. Oh yeah he must be having fun doing what he's doing to because i'm having fun, you know."
9131.0,Patient,"And it's relieving when you do that it's really easy because you're not sitting there thinking about it, I mean it is it's it's. What you're saying right now is I was I make this homemade little sugar scrub I used in the shower every day, I was making it earlier and I was after I got an exercise, and I was taking shower. And I was making earlier, I was thinking this feels good to not like think about like Why am I not talk to him or Why have I not heard from him in three hours I don't know it was just like. I don't know I felt really good in the moment like I just got an exercise, and I was like i'm not I don't have like this sense of. I don't have this anxiety this guy like I don't I don't worry about like oh he's probably talking to tenor of the girls, because they usually always wherever guy was with. I just don't have this within like I don't feel like I need to obsess over him I don't feel like I need to sit here and think about him all day why haven't heard from him. I don't know I just don't feel I just feel different with him I don't feel like that was like I don't feel like I need. To. Like every day I need to wake up and you're like I need to keep my mind busy because i'm not gonna. i'm gonna think about oh I don't feel. Like that within its relieving if it feels good to just like be happy, you know it just just feels good to be happy like. genuinely happy."
706.0,Provider,"yeah be happy and enjoy you and enjoy that time and I think it's a great idea like you and your mom if you want to take an art class how. You know, and the other thing too is when you talk to him again tell him that you're like looking at doing, like all these new interesting things like you know, like taking an art class or doing this or doing. That and just see the reaction, you get from him because you'll be able to tell a lap and the reaction if it's like super supportive and oh my gosh that's awesome I think you're good. Or if it's a very much well then, when are you going to see me, you know. How that reaction, just to kind of see like where he's at in his mind to. What you've told me, I feel like he's going to be more like support."
9131.0,Patient,yeah I don't I don't.
706.0,Provider,I don't think i'm super happy that you try that you know. So yeah I think that that's going to be more so maybe that the thing that that way that he's going to be.
9131.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know another thing to where you guys can kind of connect is he knows about cars, you don't maybe you maybe you help them fix your car."
9131.0,Patient,You know yeah he was trying to think back to over that it was.
706.0,Provider,"yeah we'll see and that's the thing because guys. like this, this area of being come comfortable when they can teach you something way."
9131.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,Whatever it may be.
9131.0,Patient,Like your work with some of them.
706.0,Provider,yeah so it's like something that they know about that.
9131.0,Patient,And they want you to listen yeah.
706.0,Provider,"They want you to listen and like learn it and so that's kind of how they like. Try and connect with you, so how cool would it be, though, if you can actually learn something about cars, I don't know anything about cars, but if I can actually learn something it'd be very helpful. yeah you know, maybe that's something that you guys can connect on to you know so it's not so much always focused on just you to like and being to get, like the other guy was, like you, and like being together, and it was more physical yeah this needs this can be so much bigger than that."
9131.0,Patient,"yeah exactly exactly exactly it's it is, it is more than that yeah yeah on a deeper yeah for sure."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well, you seem super happy, you have this like like i'm glad lemon your I. know you do like."
9131.0,Patient,"I said, like."
706.0,Provider,"Right, when I talk to you, like you just look different like you just have this like sparkle about you like you're just happy."
9131.0,Patient,"I am and i'm just trying to get rid of the feeling that it's just going to be yanked away from me, I just want to enjoy it now. I just want to join now."
706.0,Provider,"Looking at that way don't look at as this can be yanked away from you, because. You know if, for some reason it ends it ends for a reason."
9131.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"that's what you always have to remind yourself if it ends it ends for a reason, and so, and you know how many relationships and and then, and then they restarted because. People don't even realize, you know what they have until it's gone or some there's bad timing, or you know, whatever it may be. yeah just take it slow just take it one day at a time and enjoy it but don't think about it being over."
9131.0,Patient,"Just focus night again i'm not even gonna think about it, and not even think about it."
706.0,Provider,"Focus focus on the now. You know and focus on making plans you know, like you know if. Make figure out something to do a month from now, and say hey you know, on November is such and such there's."
9131.0,Patient,This going through this okay that's a good idea.
706.0,Provider,"To give you reassurance. Like if you're with you for a month from now, you know he really likes you."
9131.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"You know, neither yeah that's a good idea yeah. yeah go to a concert or comedian or you know, whatever it may be that you have in your area that you guys to go do together. You know, seek something out of a few weeks down the road and see if he's interested because no one's going to commit to something in a month if they don't think they're going to be there in a month."
9131.0,Patient,that's a good idea i'm going to do that that's a good idea.
706.0,Provider,And that's kind of that that's like a kind of backdoor way to give you reassurance without when you're insecure. He just thinks she's. gonna go do this thing in a month. But really. Looking for him to be.
9131.0,Patient,yeah that's yeah that's a good idea i'm going to do that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so try that and that will give you some reassurance so you're not waiting for the other shoe to drop, at least for the next 30 days."
9131.0,Patient,"Well, hopefully next time I see you. I don't know well we'll see we'll see you next time I see you all that you know what."
706.0,Provider,I have to.
9131.0,Patient,Go to the care navigation and schedule I schedule with them that you right.
706.0,Provider,"yeah do it with them, because otherwise things are getting all mixed up and. yeah it's easier to do it through them, because then they put it in there and they make sure it's there, and if I do it somehow sometimes it doesn't connect to their system and it just gets messed up. All right, we'll see you."
9131.0,Patient,Casey Thank you i'll See you in a couple weeks. Okay bye bye.
706.0,Provider,All right.
