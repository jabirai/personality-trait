15377.0,Patient,Hello.
748.0,Provider,"Good morning, how are you."
15377.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, how are you."
748.0,Provider,"I am well. I am. just yet, and yet all right i'm all set here on this side, my name is Karen. I always say my name is Karen a non that like that the these days."
15377.0,Patient,So.
748.0,Provider,"That said, is you're absolutely right. Anyway, I am happy to be with you today, and I am going to just you know i've never met you before and i'm just going to ask you all kinds of personal questions and and. And that's just the way these things go so hopefully you'll you'll feel comfortable enough to to be able to respond so that we can be as. As much service as possible on your journey. So just to start was. wearing to break."
15377.0,Patient,"Well, I was. I was an Inpatient treatment down in San Diego for the entire month of July, basically, for a whole month from July 9 until about August 9. Okay i'm an."
748.0,Provider,Education treatment for what.
15377.0,Patient,"anxiety and. I have. ptsd related to the workplace, because I was in Scientology for 16 years. And I was. The sea organization there and I don't know if you've ever watched any Leah remedies specials but she talks about that and. So I find it very difficult to. i'm. Working in an environment with other people and with anything that might remind me of things that happened when I was there and better but i'm still there's still things that happened that cause issues."
748.0,Provider,I can only imagine. Only imagine how did you get out.
15377.0,Patient,"I actually got out in 2002 and I got out literally running out the door with just my purse and like hiding and bushes and they were driving around in a van trying to find me and. That sounds really stressful. yeah. That part was stressful but what happened, while I was there was worse."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, of course. Of course. yeah absolutely. So. you're trying to put the pieces of your life back together still it sounds like."
15377.0,Patient,"Yes, I mean I got in there, when I was 16. So I didn't actually finish high school I didn't. Go to college or any of the things that people usually get to do, and some of the difficulty that I have is the only place that I worked from the age of 16 till I was 33 was. That place and just trying to get my mind out of like what their indoctrination is where and practices and policies and. there's that there's that part of it, too, in addition to the. The various kinds of abuses that happen there, and you know what might I never know what's going to trigger any of that and it's. Right margin of the gate a day, and then I end up with a panic attack and then I. I would last last job that I had, I would just. end up in panic attacks and have to leave. For the day sometimes and. I I don't know how to navigate it I don't know how to deal with him."
748.0,Provider,"That really makes sense, I mean it because there are so many things that can trigger ptsd that aren't conscious or. to other people wouldn't necessarily make sense, but it could be malice sound. I mean, it could be so many things that aren't specific it isn't yeah wow. Well i'm glad that you're here. And I really hope that we can be of service and moving the Needle for you, so that you're able to feel like you're strong and. able to have the life that you long for what are your hopes, as you as you look at this situation different What would you love to see yourself get out of being with bright heart."
15377.0,Patient,"I. mean I guess part of my hopes, would be to have hope."
748.0,Provider,I love that that's beautiful. been a long time since you've had hope it.
15377.0,Patient,"sounds like. yeah or there have been times, but I did, and then. Whatever hopes that I had would be dashed by. New experiences."
748.0,Provider,Okay. So what got you involved at 16.
15377.0,Patient,My step dad.
748.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, so it wasn't a choice on your part."
15377.0,Patient,"not really I mean i'm gonna say no, since I was too young to really understand what was going on."
748.0,Provider,And i'm guessing that at the time you trusted your step dad too.
15377.0,Patient,yeah and my mom got to it as well at that same time.
748.0,Provider,"And is she still involved. Okay. Are you connected to her. Yes, Okay, so are the two of you feeling together."
15377.0,Patient,"Well, she was only in for about a year and a half. So she really didn't experience, all of the things that I did, thank goodness yeah."
748.0,Provider,"And being younger i'm sure well i'm making an assumption, but what it would be like to me is that being younger you could be manipulated, a lot more easily easily."
15377.0,Patient,Right yes.
748.0,Provider,A lot of trauma to carry. So.
15377.0,Patient,You left.
748.0,Provider,"When you were 33 years old. Is that correct so about 17 years and. And since then it's been a path of trying to survive, is that what i'm understanding just basic survival, as a result has anything you done been useful or helpful that you would found so far to mitigate the. anxiety and the ptsd responses."
15377.0,Patient,"I mean. One thing would be. Immediate immediate Lee if I take a walk it really helps. Okay, just get out of the office or whatever situation is is there and I just walk outside and walk around. And look at them."
748.0,Provider,"Okay. So you've learned. set that. tactic that technique with. Your nervous system, when you do get triggered the trauma gets really stimulated of actually focusing your attention on something else, and how that can shift the inside world."
15377.0,Patient,Right what's going. On mindset.
748.0,Provider,and getting out side and breathing and being in fresh air and a new environment and have you found work environments that support you in that understand and support you.
15377.0,Patient,Not so far.
748.0,Provider,that's the hardest piece i'm sure is not not what would you love to be doing as far as work.
15377.0,Patient,I mean there's just so there's so many aspects to like. My life and the problems that i'm encountering part of the thing is that. In 2005 I got a job with the sacramento superior court and I worked there for like 15 years.
748.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15377.0,Patient,"yeah. And it was usually pretty okay um. But. Like my personality is not well suited for that job, particularly like. i'm an nfp and. So that's kind of really an opposite job for me that's kind of an is tj job."
748.0,Provider,But you kept it for 15 years. Was there anything positive about it. Like the security or the benefits or the mean i'm just wondering what kept you there for 15 years being that it had to have been a really challenging environment for an nfp.
15377.0,Patient,"I mean mainly it's because they put me at the front counter so I was able to talk to people all day. Okay, while filing their documents, so there was that social aspect to it. And then I really liked most of my co workers, so there was that as well and, yes, there were really good benefits the salary was decent but. I mean, I think, part of it, too, is like I had my son in 2003 I had to feed him and clothe him, and so I just had to do what I had to do you know now he's 17 he's almost 18."
748.0,Provider,"Are you in need connected, are you close. and his his his father, a part of the picture."
15377.0,Patient,that's like a whole other story his father's in prison.
748.0,Provider,"Okay. are used to connected, even though he's in prison."
15377.0,Patient,yeah we do talk on occasion and he calls and talks to our son as well okay.
748.0,Provider,How long has he been in prison.
15377.0,Patient,15 years.
748.0,Provider,had a very challenging path haven't you. So you met him after you left. Scientology.
15377.0,Patient,"Well, I actually met him when I was still there."
748.0,Provider,"I was afraid you were going to say that. was part of it. No okay okay well that sounds like almost you're. Even know you were older than. That team, you were when you started there, it sounds like you're active rebellion."
15377.0,Patient,"yeah and also a little bit of naivete because I didn't know about the world, having been cloistered away. Now I didn't know what people on drugs looked like I didn't know what. You know I hadn't been around that element at all, just very sheltered."
748.0,Provider,yeah. Really uh you have had a challenging path.
15377.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"So tell me a little bit about growing up, and your stepdad and how this all evolved what was growing up like for you."
15377.0,Patient,"I mean my life was pretty good until I was about 11. and had a pretty amazing life I have an older brother and sister my parents were together. And my parents divorced, when I was 11 and that's kind of where all the trouble started. For me, like mentally and emotionally."
748.0,Provider,When your parents divorce did it create a feeling of abandonment for you.
15377.0,Patient,Absolutely.
748.0,Provider,that's what I was hearing. did your dad actually leave the picture.
15377.0,Patient,yeah okay.
748.0,Provider,"And Have you had contact with him since. Yes, have you do still have contact."
15377.0,Patient,"yeah I mean he left. To move in with my step mom well they later got married, but he was just not any longer present, it was just gone okay."
748.0,Provider,"And even though you were yelling it sounds like he left you for another woman. right which i'm sure well i'm not sure, but it feels like. We take on as if we've done something wrong as the child that he would leave. And you can hear logically from lots of people that that's not true, but that doesn't take away the bed it feels. Right yeah. an intense path to walk. So what has been the most helpful as you process all with this you've been in residential for a month that sounds like it was probably intense but it isn't it, I mean it's a bandaid it's not a it's not the solution, what has been beneficial for you."
15377.0,Patient,"I mean. A lot of different things i'm going to say. family. Like my sister my brother my mom my dad even I mean my dad and my i'm really close to my dad now and i'm really close to my mom now as well and they're still alive, which is great my sister and I are very close and my brother and I are very close. my brother actually is tj Woodward that road conscious recovery."
748.0,Provider,Okay.
15377.0,Patient,"So i'm not familiar with it, but I will look it up."
748.0,Provider,Even though I don't know that i'll see you again. I will be thinking of you. So i'm i'm going to make an assumption that conscious recovery is based on Scientology getting out is that accurate or wrong.
15377.0,Patient,my brother was never in North Texas. Conscious recovery is a is a book that he wrote.
748.0,Provider,Regarding addiction.
15377.0,Patient,"I guess, they just use it down in Costa palm area in San Diego. When he has a workbook and and they used his Program. And that's."
748.0,Provider,phenomenal so addiction is a part of your family's journey.
15377.0,Patient,Yes.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, but not your."
15377.0,Patient,"No, not really."
748.0,Provider,"So you, you will your addiction showed up differently in terms of the system that you were put into. right and it does become addictive, but it isn't quite the same yeah and yet i'm sure that that the support your brother's been able to give you, through his journey has been helpful."
15377.0,Patient,Absolutely yeah.
748.0,Provider,"What a story, you need to write a book."
15377.0,Patient,that's that's what i've been told.
748.0,Provider,"No really I mean it. You know, as. Not only because it's such an intensely powerful story with tragic consequences, of course, in terms of debilitating impact for you, with the anxiety and the ptsd. And i'm sure depression as well."
15377.0,Patient,"Well, I also have borderline personality disorder. On top of that."
748.0,Provider,And how is that show notes for you.
15377.0,Patient,"That might be the hardest part to deal with, as far as all the different mental issues or aspects that I just sometimes. can't deal with any particular situation and I might get angry, I might get a. Bad anxiety attack and just have to run out of somewhere or I might react very strongly to something. I mean the good thing about borderline is like you might be really upset and then an hour later you're fine."
748.0,Provider,Right.
15377.0,Patient,"As opposed to as opposed to bipolar where you might be depressed for just days on end, with no particular reason, it seems to me when i've been observing borderline people in myself that there's a reason and you get triggered or something happens and you're upset and then you're okay."
748.0,Provider,Do you find that you do. That strong vacillating between loving someone and hating someone and. Because that that tends to be a characteristic that manifests a lot.
15377.0,Patient,"You know, when you ask that question, I do identify with that I don't want to say it's necessarily loving and hating I want to identify it as more as. I really like this person I really like this person to be around me, I appreciate them and then suddenly oh they're on my nerves they're making me mad because they've done or they had not done this, this this and this. yeah now that you mentioned that, yes, it happens for me with all of my loved ones like I really appreciate my sister, but I wish you would stop bugging me about taking walks all the time, you know it's so inconvenient. yeah."
748.0,Provider,And do you take it out on her.
15377.0,Patient,"No, because. Okay, well, sometimes I take it out and i'd like I take it out of my son, for example, sometimes like you know we get along well and then after a while, sometimes that he is or isn't doing starts to really crawl under my skin and sometimes i'll just get really angry."
748.0,Provider,Okay now.
15377.0,Patient,it's not that the problems that i'm having with him or not legitimate it's just that my reaction probably isn't helping anybody.
748.0,Provider,"So, have you done much with db T is that if. It is familiar to you. yeah Okay, because that will probably be something that will get employed while you're a bright heart to really strengthen and support you in in staying as centered within your process as possible, so that you can feel some relief from that intensity. Right yeah. Your awareness is really powerful I can feel it and I hope to have you done other programs that have been I know you were in residential but if you've done other programs that have been helpful and supportive in the past."
15377.0,Patient,yeah I mean in 2018 I was when I was first diagnosed with ptsd and borderline. And I did I op and then I felt like that wasn't enough and I went into php. About two or three weeks. Okay helpful.
748.0,Provider,"Good. When did you. connect I think. You mentioned that you got involved with your son's Father before you ever left Scientology before you. escaped is what i'm going to call it. and And so, how did you two meet."
15377.0,Patient,"um I he came up to me and just started talking to me when I went out. To make some copies down the street, from where I was working."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, I see."
15377.0,Patient,"And he asked me for my phone number and, for some reason I gave it to him, probably cuz he was cute. he's kind of like a dark James Dean, like our guys kind of looking guy. You got like modeling offers and all sorts of things. You know in Hollywood. Just a really handsome and charismatic guy you know."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long is the in person."
15377.0,Patient,he's got life without.
748.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15377.0,Patient,yeah the book gets more interesting I guess.
748.0,Provider,"Yes, it. wow no, there is a. yeah I don't know actually nevermind I was gonna say there's a video i'd love to share with you it's about the trauma most people in prison, have such severe traumatic history."
15377.0,Patient,Of course yeah. thoughts about that yeah. yeah. Where is he he's in Nevada. Okay Carson city.
748.0,Provider,Okay prison state prisons.
15377.0,Patient,"mm hmm. And we hadn't been in touch with him until like the last year and a half, when my son decided he wanted to actually reach out to his dad and get to know him."
748.0,Provider,and has that been beneficial.
15377.0,Patient,"I think, overall, it has."
748.0,Provider,"And is is he doing work on himself, while he's in there, it sounds like no."
15377.0,Patient,"I don't really see that I think he tries to but I asked him what's your diagnosis, because i'm sure you have some sort of diagnosis and he said paranoid schizophrenia."
748.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15377.0,Patient,yeah I was like oh yeah okay.
748.0,Provider,You know so organic on top of yeah okay.
15377.0,Patient,"And then i'm sure he has ptsd from his childhood he's spoken on many occasions about the abuse that he went through when he was a child, physical and other types of abuse, plus his father died when he was two and a half of drowning. So he's just got a whole trauma childhood really."
748.0,Provider,Well that's that's typical I I. Do you have any interest. In in seeing something about that piece of how severe trauma is for people in for incarcerated.
15377.0,Patient,You know.
748.0,Provider,"You to clip. is called compassion prison project and. see what. don't want to take away from the times for. There we go i'll just get it really quick and you copy the. copy the link and watch it when you have time, if you want there's. Nothing. surprising it's just the way it's presented, I find very. healing I guess is the word I would say. In terms of. The. idea started okay. Let me get back to you and i'll put this in the chat for you. And then, if you want to copy it, you can play it. After that. Our session is over, and like I said it six minutes long, it might be something that would be beneficial for your son."
15377.0,Patient,Right. You know recognize.
748.0,Provider,"Because there's such a universality to it. there's also a. Where it's played in the film and i'm not sure if it's know that the period of time that it was being shown is over but i'll put that in the. In the chat as well it's a powerful powerful film and it, they tend to. play it every month or so now, because so many people want to see it, it was only on for a short time, there were 4 million views worldwide and it's called the wisdom of trauma. And it's by one of my favorite teachers in the field, whose name is gabor Mateo. So I just put the name of the film and his name in in the chat as well, if you want to copy those two things. and put them wherever would be useful for. You to refer back to, and if you if you get a chance to see the wisdom of trauma you'll see that same YouTube that I sent you in the film itself, but the film is about an hour and. 30 minutes it's a documentary. it's quite possible. And there's just something to me that's very healing about recognizing the extensive list. The hugeness of trauma in our culture and that that it is going to us. We didn't we're not the only ones that have created these circumstances in our lives that have been so debilitating it's, it is the nature of reality for most of our culture, because we're all so isolated from each other, even though we're all packed in together."
15377.0,Patient,"that's something that I definitely talk about a lot, and that I realized, when I was in php is I was like the problem with people, one of the biggest problems is that we're communal creatures. were meant to live together we're meant to function together and we're so isolated and the way that our you know whole society is set up, we don't have time to even socialize for a few hours a week, most the time. let alone we're supposed to be like you know living and operating and functioning together, like in a Community situation and I just think. Most other than Third World countries everyone's off base with it and it's creating a sense of isolation and everyone else's over there, and you know egocentricity egocentricity and all of that and separatism and it's a huge issue."
748.0,Provider,yeah That is exactly right So what do you have your masters in.
15377.0,Patient,um what do I have.
748.0,Provider,You really I mean you sound very well read like you've done a lot of research and that you've internalized a great deal of wisdom.
15377.0,Patient,"I mean I just read read read and I don't know how else to explain it other than i'll read something or will be in treatment and i'll be reading something and then somehow I. extrapolate. Things that was the extrapolation that I had when I was in php and I was like wait a minute. And then I was realizing that all the trauma that we go through as children or as spouses, a lot of that could be mitigated by a communal situation where the entire community with observe these things and not allow folks to get away with it. protect the children, and you know, there will be really they people throw around the phrase, it takes a village, but no one's really doing that that's just some colloquialism at this point, exactly."
748.0,Provider,except the places that actually do it. That originated the. Words yeah. yeah much down on it being civilized.
15377.0,Patient,Actually.
748.0,Provider,"Well, you have tremendous wisdom and. Tremendous insights and what i'm really getting from talking to you is that, being part of programs like this is you, creating that community."
15377.0,Patient,It you know.
748.0,Provider,"it's really one of the only ways that we have of of doing that in our culture, have you ever done any work with 12 step groups."
15377.0,Patient,"i'm only when I was down at Casa panera. done a little bit of that and I don't identify with that very well myself. It just it doesn't really resonate with me. I don't have a drug or alcohol problem at all, not even a little bit like alcohol can sit in my house for months on end and I won't touch it don't care."
748.0,Provider,I was thinking more along the lines of I mean there's a 12 step program for everything now.
15377.0,Patient,Right and.
748.0,Provider,"I was thinking more along the lines of adult children and alcoholism another dysfunction. is really about healing the inner child. and NASA term that you can translate into so many other things it translates. or or parallels. Work with poly bagel theory or. ptsd work or any of those theoretical concepts, you can really see and feel the parallels and the only reason I bring it up is because that could be a lifetime Community appealing for you."
15377.0,Patient,Right okay.
748.0,Provider,"And unfortunately, because of where we are. With co bit and so forth, most of the meetings takes take place on zoom and. We need is people, but there are some that are happening in person, again, and there are some that are happening, where do you live sounds like you live in the La area."
15377.0,Patient,I know sacramento.
748.0,Provider,"Oh sacramento, you said that."
15377.0,Patient,that's right guys are in walnut creek right. Right hearts.
748.0,Provider,"Right hard isn't it great but but it's actually nationwide and it's all Tele health, so there are counselors and people working everywhere in the country."
15377.0,Patient,"gotcha so you can be in Atlanta, Georgia or whatever it's still work for them right."
748.0,Provider,"Yes, Oh yes, there are people everywhere working i'm in California, like you, because that way it correlates with your insurance or whatever it is that yeah um so sacramento sacramento actually has some of the best meetings in the state now that I think about."
15377.0,Patient,It okay.
748.0,Provider,So. I think it's a da nor how.
15377.0,Patient,i'm gonna write this stuff down.
748.0,Provider,"I just put it in the chat. i'm going to go to. The website. Again, and to Google, I should say, and of course because that's where we get our information these days. yep there it is okay i'm going to put the Web CC actual link in for you. It might be a really nice adjunct for you, as you are. doing the work with bright heart and then it would be available for you after you're finished as well, in terms of. keeping up that sense this Community."
15377.0,Patient,Yes.
748.0,Provider,"And you may be connected to bright heart in having sessions, for you know. Two years but, but it would be nice to have that consistent Community that you can start to develop. And the resources as well yeah and I don't know if i'll be able to reach out to you in any way with bright hurt, but I am going to tell you i'm going to read your brother's book."
15377.0,Patient,"Okay, he just got he wrote conscious recovery and he just had a new book come out like last month conscious creation."
748.0,Provider,wow.
15377.0,Patient,And he's from San Francisco.
748.0,Provider,Okay.
15377.0,Patient,"For a long time and now he lives in Marina del rey. Okay he's like really big in the recovery community, as you can imagine."
748.0,Provider,"Yes, it sounds like it, and you know, considering what you walked through that Community could feel like another cult. It. it's it is you know, because there is so much that occurs with people and it's just safety, but still where everyone says the same thing and it starts to feel like oh. yeah and and so i'm not going to say you're going to love it, you may find that it won't work for you, but you could find a meeting or two that feel safe and healing for you and I would love for you to have that, because then you've got community. yeah and and you haven't tanned healthy Community since you were a loving that sounds like. yeah. Other than that, that you create. Temporary with php or whatever."
15377.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Well you've given me I there are specific questions that we can ask when people aren't very forthcoming because it's nerve racking to do this, like who are you you're a total stranger and you're invading my life with all these questions. But you. Really covered all of them. So my question for you when when you started. You went as far as 16 years old in school. And you've never gone back and gotten your hsa D or g. g D. You really. You deserve to have. Some letters after your name with your wisdom."
15377.0,Patient,Thank you. yeah.
748.0,Provider,"I did have a friend once I was I did the opposite, I was an achiever because of my background I was like you know school school school yeah. And when I was in my master's program for psychology I I was telling a friend, maybe i'll go get a PhD and she said Karen how best we just put rsvp ASAP after your name. Happy enough letters for you. I only tell you that, because I can imagine you as I mean you just really. strike me as someone who could get. At least in hs ED or something like that, based on your life experience. and your wisdom. And I don't know if that would support you in getting a job that was a better fit for you, or what but I."
15377.0,Patient,"mean i'm just trying to figure out what to do with myself in my life I you know I i've been on I was on disability from July when I went into the facility I. went on leave from my job and I went down to cost of home era, and then I got out, and I was doing I op and that finished and then I found bright heart as a segue to further therapy right my disability ran up October 1 now i'm just kind of trying to figure out what am I going to do."
748.0,Provider,yeah. So you took a leap from your job.
15377.0,Patient,With this.
748.0,Provider,court or. Is that what you took a leap from or was it a different job.
15377.0,Patient,"It was a different job I actually terminated my employment with the Court in February of 2020. Okay, there were just some things that were happening, where I was like I just can't cope with this anymore, and I got another job lined up and nail down, I went to that job for a month and I loved it. It was just a tiny office with four people in me and it was a legal document preparing kind of job, and it was for me, it was very easy it was low stress and I really enjoyed it. She paid me very well to provide excellent medical insurance she also paid us until Friday and we finished our work early so we got incentive to like finish early so we'd have to deal with rush hour traffic and then. She would go ahead and pay us the full day it was amazing but then coven hit, and she had to lay me off and it's she hasn't been able to take me back since then. it's really sad because I was like I worked for the core for so long, and then I got that job and then coven like destroyed her business she's a small business owner, and you know she hasn't had."
748.0,Provider,Many some.
15377.0,Patient,"it's so sad, I mean really the the reaction and all the different idea at all the things have been happening as a result of. What the control of cove it is, and all the things that are being implemented are far more destructive than the disease itself, in my opinion it's both bad, but it's."
748.0,Provider,yeah and yet we've got to protect the population. Right. And what else.
15377.0,Patient,No wins. it's like small business or losing people are having really bad you know mental and emotional. And everything else.
748.0,Provider,"yeah and yeah it's it is really true. yeah and yet, maybe what's. what's happening is we're on the brink of such a huge crisis, not the brain core in the midst of. Such a huge crisis that it will transforms. Our awareness and more people will start to see what you see in terms of how desperately, we need to create community and come together. yeah yeah."
15377.0,Patient,"Really, I mean, I have a whole like. Not like a whole fantasy world about like what America could look like instead with my communities in mind, and you know it would actually help with the spread of covert even because you just have your community. And pretty much the people that you're around but there's all this support and like there would be a local daycare elderly people will be taking care of we'd have like an organic garden and chickens and goats and. You know, places where people can gather and you know sing and do music and in one area, maybe you know do art in another room watch movies, and it, you know just a lot of Community and. You know people that live in the Community, that would have different skills to offer and it's just to me that just idyllic that's just what things should look like, and of course i'm pretty liberal, so I said, well, I think the 3% should just pay for the communities."
748.0,Provider,Well there's wouldn't even.
15377.0,Patient,Be.
748.0,Provider,You know it wouldn't even be a blip for them.
15377.0,Patient,"No, not even a little I mean not everybody has to live in one of these communities, but I really feel like if people knew what it was about. A lot of people would choose to because you would have to only pay in my mind. I have it all like mapped out you'd have to pay like $250 a month in rent you have your own little private space, but it's not extravagant because no one really needs. 2300 square feet, which is the average number of square feet of the American household so no one really needs that what people really need is connection, you know. And we can share so many other square feet together, but when you need your downtime you can go to your private space and you sleep there, and you know all of that yeah I don't even know how to make it happen, but this whole thing, in my mind. How it would be so much better."
748.0,Provider,You really use your time and your mind for beautifully created things.
15377.0,Patient,"I like to think so, but then I don't really do anything actually with it, which is like the that's where i'm trying to make a connection like what am I supposed to do with all this and. I mean part of part of one thing that I thought that I could do is like I could maybe run a sober living House like for mental track people that get out of. rehab and i'm like well Do I really want to take that kind of responsibility on that's not exactly what i'm thinking of with my Community i'm looking at more like functional people. Look well. But who are they. Right I don't know who they are."
748.0,Provider,"pretty sure there's the equivalent of a dude somewhere with. Like 2030 people that. Actually fit that, and you have to pay admission to see what that looks like. Because the reality is that this is a very stressful and challenging life that we've created and it has a significant impact, but your ideas are wonderful."
15377.0,Patient,"Because, everyone should have a lot more. than the normal person has right now, not not just the Community factor but also health like better food. Also, just more like in the Community, if you have like this big movie room for example melon has that in their house unless they're a millionaire. Right it's in that you can have in the Community, you know, in a sports room for the guys where they can be over there yelling at the TV I don't want to hear that. I don't want to be married to anyone like that either, and also. The Community would provide a situation where people would have marriages last longer because I don't feel like people are supposed to be around one particular person for so many hours a day. And that puts a strain on marriages if you're spending more time as a woman let's say with your other female friends and you're commuting and. you're cooking together or your gardening together or whatever it is, you want to do just sit around and talking and then you want to go home to your husband you're gonna have a lot more healthy view of like your marriage as well and marriages would last longer. Just I don't know what to do with all this information that I have in my mind, but."
748.0,Provider,"Like you know, I think that do you have you heard of cohousing."
15377.0,Patient,No.
748.0,Provider,"Okay i'll put that in there to there are such things, and of course in California it's gotten incredibly expensive but and also it's very hard to get into that's what it's called those co housing. And that is intentional community. Right and and it's. Like small units for individuals with big rooms and people do meals together, but they can also do meals alone. There tend to be organic gardens on the grounds. yeah I it sounds like something that you might want to pursue investigating and see I would think the sacramento area would have some."
15377.0,Patient,it's very possible I can look into it.
748.0,Provider,"yeah you could look into it and maybe even find a way to work in the field, as well as develop. living space within one of those all those, as I said, they they tend to be it's not easy to get in. Because you you basically have to wait for someone to die. waiting list, I mean seriously but. done families, as well as elderly, as well as. You know middle of that so there's lots of human connection on multi generational levels, which is a part of what you're describing. yeah yeah it was an ideal that I think is brilliant and I hadn't thought of it in a long time until you started talking. You it'd be a great place for you to pursue in terms of job some kind as well as the living environment and then take your ideas to the next level."
15377.0,Patient,that's true.
748.0,Provider,I got here I am planning your life.
15377.0,Patient,I mean that's good i'm also a painter see this in the background is one of my. leads i've been.
748.0,Provider,Looking at that it's beautiful.
15377.0,Patient,"that's that's one of mine, and I would like to have like a an artist Community kind of thing."
748.0,Provider,That would be fabulous.
15377.0,Patient,"And a community, I can also teach the children how to draw and paint I also seeing, so I could do that kind of thing."
748.0,Provider,That would be wonderful.
15377.0,Patient,"i'm going to figure this out, but i'm just trying to figure out what do I do right now, you know."
748.0,Provider,"And right now. what's most important because you getting strong. and building your resilience and feeling confident about your well being and now. you're here with us, and it is really been an honor to talk to you."
15377.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you, you too."
748.0,Provider,"You had has been just amazing Have you already been given a group, you know when you start group."
15377.0,Patient,I started group on Monday.
748.0,Provider,Wonderful and is it a good fit for you.
15377.0,Patient,"So far, it seems fine yeah great. Wonderful yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Well, if you have any follow up questions about this, I mean, as I said, we've we've really talked a fair amount did did anyone in your family your you talked about the divorce happening and your father. Leaving and ending up with somebody else and those pieces and then your stepfather getting involved in your life in the way that he did did either of your parents have mental health issues."
15377.0,Patient,"Yes, my dad I don't believe so, but my my mom does my dad has some I believe some sort of sexual addictions. Okay, maybe something there's been a little talk here and there, he was a high school band director there's been a little talk in the family of like gossip of like him engaging with some of his students in an inappropriate fashion. Okay. I don't really know that it was like newspaper articles, a couple times and different things like that, so my dad has some issue my mom has, I believe my mom has borderline and. she's just. And when I was reading up on borderline it says its genetic Plus, it has to be you know, a trauma in your childhood, on top of the genetic disposition. So it looks to me like my mom has those moments of rage We grew up with that my brother right it's all about it in his books, I mean he had. trauma as well."
748.0,Provider,Of course.
15377.0,Patient,"yeah yeah It makes sense right and then she would yell and scream and then she would just be whistling three minutes later. wow you know, we thought it was insane but now I understand it, because i'm kind of like that myself i'm like I just might be might be really mad and then i'm letting it go i'm happy okay i'm fine."
748.0,Provider,But that self awareness is powerful I don't know that your mom has that it doesn't sound like she's done the work you have.
15377.0,Patient,"she's not done all the work that I have, and I believe she's undiagnosed borderline. She was also she said molested as a child as a very young child by her grandfather, and she talks about that and she's done some work on it, but you know she she's gotten she my whole family's very spiritually aware. Which is a huge plus so yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Well, why is there, what is the positive side of being attracted to something like Scientology in the first place. Yet it, you know, and you don't know what you don't know. Right now you're involved in it too late, especially as somebody as young as you are, but. That makes sense. That there was. That that spiritual inquisitiveness and interest."
15377.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely. yeah and there's a lot of truth to Scientology as well, obviously one wouldn't stick with it, that long. Without That being the case. So i've taken that with me and i'm just leaving behind the rest. For you yeah so are you just are you just doing an assessment today that."
748.0,Provider,"it's called. it's called the bio psychosocial. So it's the initial sort of gathering of information, so that its present for others, that you work with. yeah so I don't know if i'll get a. chance. To see you again. Okay, have you already had an. Individual session setup. No okay."
15377.0,Patient,I might have one scheduled.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, because I was gonna say I would love to see you again, but I also know that anyone you get with bright heart is going to be great and if it doesn't feel like a good fit. For either one of you, for whatever reason, you can talk about that and and make sure that you do get somebody that feels like isn't it."
15377.0,Patient,yeah I mean I don't know if you do therapy or not.
748.0,Provider,"I definitely do that. I am I have groups with bright heart i'm brand new with braid hard at. Work for 30 years, but I am brand new with Ray hurt within the last three weeks."
15377.0,Patient,"gotcha okay well I don't know if you want to be my therapist that would be great because I really feel comfortable with you, I just felt like immediately like it's open up and just talk about whatever and."
748.0,Provider,"Well i'm really grateful to hear that I feel very honored, as I said, and you are a bright light in the world, and so I can put in a request if that's what you'd like."
15377.0,Patient,"I would love that I don't know if you're able to do that, that would be amazing I just really feel like. That would be."
748.0,Provider,"Like. I would love to do that. too, I really would. Okay alright. So I will I will put in a request I can't guarantee it'll be honored because they may already have you sat with somebody. But if that doesn't work out, you can you can let them know you would like to get an appointment with me and i'm not sure how it works yet to be honest, but I think they're very, very flexible and want to make sure that you get your needs met."
15377.0,Patient,yeah it sounds like that yeah I don't know how or if I should continue to be on disability I don't really know currently i'm working like and I don't know if that's something that you're probably not dealing with that aspect.
748.0,Provider,"Of it no I don't. I don't I that would be the. More. The word that I want. Not like the care navigators that you interact with to get into your appointments and so forth, could probably give you the information about who who to talk to about that. Whoever you talk to you next in terms of the administrative side of things yeah I would I would suggest that they might have the information."
15377.0,Patient,"Because i'm not sure right now i'm working for my mom doing ihs s in home support services. Okay, for whatever hours that I do for her. My disability ran up October 1 and then I also have been doing uber eats. delivering food I just did that, because i'm like I can't seem to get along in an office, right now, not until I get a little bit better like I don't know what else to do. So at least you can drive around deliver food."
