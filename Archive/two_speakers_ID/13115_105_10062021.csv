ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,Sam Rivera or social. Are you looking for a place to sit down and set that phone down.
13115.0,Patient,yeah sorry.
105.0,Provider,"go ahead and do that i'm going to be setting up the assessments go ahead, we can have some quiet that's okay in telemedicine it's not like a regular phone call."
13115.0,Patient,My dog with me.
105.0,Provider,Okay excellent i'm. gonna take a couple more seconds here to. This. initial assessment.
13115.0,Patient,So.
105.0,Provider,"you've already sort of met me in group. A tiny, tiny bit at least you know you're not a complete stranger to you. But I just want to go over a couple of little things and then i'm going to have to dive right into the assessment questions okay. Just so you know who you're working with here i'm in Florida and i'm a licensed marriage and family therapist and have been licensed for about 22 years. Four years in new Mexico i've worked with folks in substance use or process addiction, most of my career, whether it was residential in custody outpatient employee assistance Program. i've been intrigued by it. My entire career, I find it very interesting and I continue to so this this MIT medication assisted treatment is new it's about for me about four years old. and that's, that is, the time zone is is different, but I will do my best i'm pretty good at it, I only say time zones in your time zone. So whatever I say hey we're going to meet at one we're going to need 11am i'm talking about your time and you don't have to overthink it, but if it ever sounds really weird. Like she never makes it with me at five o'clock right, you may want to say wait a second what will will will will China zone is that you're welcome to say something. There is there is. Nothing that we can't talk about in here. which includes things that are in romantic relationships family history things that even happening group things that happen have it with me, for some people, that the something may happen in here with me and you can share that I don't get mad. i'm never going to get offended, this is a safe place for you anything that has anything to do with your treatment that's grist for the mill it's something that you and I can process in here. Let me see I use the phone, for I didn't do it with you but. Typically, although the last two weeks I haven't been doing it, I tend to send messages 24 hours in advance the night before i'll say hey. Are you attending your appointment tomorrow, and then I get a quick little yes i'll be there some you know, and if you can I need 24 hours in advance to. schedule someone else in that time spot because i'm an. Independent contractor, which means, if you my client. or another client doesn't show up I don't earn a living. So they're very important that people keep their. Appointments, not only because that's the medicine that's sort of recommended for you. But it means that I get to earn a living. So I don't use the phone for like clinical stuff if you're having a really big feeling which many people do throughout the weekend, or something like that I can see the text like oh my gosh the socks my boyfriend. or my dog right has an ear infection or something you know something could be distressing but what you get back for me won't be the warm fuzzy stuff. that's going to happen in here i'll probably be like. Sorry, when can we meet so just so you know i've learned that texting is incredibly flawed the intent. Behind it just gets lost, so I need to make sure that we. We have a one on one to be able to talk. you're in DR aubrey yells. Group I believe right and have a female. Have a female."
13115.0,Patient,physician right mm hmm. So.
105.0,Provider,"I need to tell you that she. Is my mother and. I will not refer to her that. way she will be Dr aubrey L and I, like my clients to refer to her that way. I will not be sharing personal stories i'm very boundaries, it allows my clients to be able to. Never have to take care of. me it's. very effective, but that's not she doesn't have to follow the same ethical boundaries, and so you may hear her sharing personal stories. But that's not really her role to is to manage those you might see me do something that's more managing boundaries and limits setting, but you may not see as much of it and in her okay. But if something does come up because for a lot of people parent. Child dynamics are very central to their early childhood wounding something comes up in you like Oh, I saw this thing, and all of a sudden i'm not behaving the same. In group, please. Just tell me because will process it you wouldn't be the first person okay and. We can use it as grist for the mill mill it's another way for us to to have a healing experience for you. I think that's it we're going to dive in your Oh, I have to talk about this assessment for a second. So i've watched over the four years that i've been here a couple of tricks that make this assessment move. quickly it's about a two hour assessment, but I can't do that so i've got to smoosh it into one hour. And what i've seen that works is you're probably going to have this longing to want to explain why you're giving me an answer. But see if you can hold back on the why and we're going to get into the reasoning next time we need or throughout the whole time we're working together, but in here i'm going to say whole where you will how much. And when was your last use you're just going to tell me and you're not going to say why Oh, I had this nervous breakdown not why, when was it how old, are you how long does it last what was the medication not my boyfriend cheated on me that's the why okay. But it's going to be tempting if you hear me catch you just kind of circle back, I have a transcriptionist, as we all do, and bright heart, and so you can hear me say weird stuff like least transcribed verbatim or clients nice lifetime history of gluten Baba so that's what that is okay. Okay, all right we're going to dive in here i'm going to be getting. Your substance use history there's a word you don't know I won't take time to educate you on it just say never did it or don't know that. Okay, all right so we're going to start with age of first use of a short acting opiate those would be percocet axes. Is some people start with heroin, not everyone does, but some do fentanyl so when was the first use, and I do want to know what was surrounding that whether it was recreational or you had a surgery."
13115.0,Patient,um. It was a chanel and it was around maybe 13.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was the progression from there, so you tried it at 13 for what was it."

105.0,Provider,we're going to stay with percocet.
13115.0,Patient,"So okay sorry, there was no progression just I didn't, for I would steal my parents. pills pretty much didn't know what it was with snort them."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you'll get you'll get the hang of it as we stay here with the percocet so i'm 13 years old, I have percocet I snort it. I snort it and then I do it every weekend or I snort it and I do it every day and i'm doing two pills a day now you're getting a sense of what progression is and now timeframe is always doing that every weekend. For three years now, you get a sense of duration so go back to percocet at 13. You did it personally go ahead."
13115.0,Patient,Okay percocet at 13 um I did it every day um I learned them every day and then.

13115.0,Patient,"I have formulate a plan, I guess, per se, because that's why I initially started doing opiates and injecting and wanting to learn how to do it all um but I never I never went through with it i've always i've really communicated my. These things with people so that they know that i'm like worried about myself, and so you know."
105.0,Provider,So you started injecting what.
13115.0,Patient,"I was injecting what at the time I was injecting methamphetamines but I was I had started doing opiates and I was planning to use that I never liked opiates but then I got stuck on it, no."
105.0,Provider,"And, did you carry out the Liesl intent of. Taking your own life. Okay, all right. Has there been another time or you've been experiencing suicidal ideation say."
13115.0,Patient,"No i'm it lasted a long time, though."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, from when to when."

Something the day it's not quite as relevant but it might be for you, I know it was 2020 2019 2019 all right, if you happen to know the day because that may have meaning, what was the day."
13115.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know the day."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, moving on to when."
13115.0,Patient,To November 2020.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, that is a long time. So did you take action either passively or not to enter life."
13115.0,Patient,"um no but I that's why I relapsed was so that I did it because I knew with doing math so it was a backwards point, point of thinking, but. I knew that at least with math math I would feel Okay, and I would be able to work and be productive, even though I felt like this. that's why I relapsed was to keep me here on earth for that moment in time, you know because I was extremely suicidal the whole time. And it worked in a way, because it did keep me working both jobs it kept me me productive, but it was just it was still maladaptive you know it's still created a whole like. hornet's nest out of nothing you know okay."
105.0,Provider,All right. um.
13115.0,Patient,I know I explained.
105.0,Provider,Sorry. When was your last suicidal thoughts.
13115.0,Patient,Probably this month.
105.0,Provider,"Well, it just started October just started you think it was a week ago, or today."
13115.0,Patient,"No probably September. Probably September. They don't it doesn't stay consistent, though, like a dozen constantly affect my mind anymore like that it comes and goes and I usually try to get it to go away as soon as possible."
105.0,Provider,"If those show up those would be time she'd want to reach out to me, I want to be part of your support team, you have people you talk to. And I want to be a part of it so reach out to me we'll see if we can schedule something quickly, sometimes I can jump on the phone. Other times you may have to go to the hospital okay all right, because we need to keep you safe, we know, I think you know something's really off when that solution is the one that's showing up that dramatic solution, so you know something really off. yeah all right um if you were to say what would prevent you from taking your own life, what would be those things."
13115.0,Patient,It would be hurting other people and then also probably allowing my challenges of life to overcome me I wouldn't want that i've been through too much i've overcome too much stuff in my life to just let it overcoming like that.
105.0,Provider,"i'm gonna put you on hold for 20 seconds. Okay. i'm. Thinking back to when. i'm sorry sample. When the the earliest age that you engaged in self injury, could you could you focus there the earliest age that you, you. Were cutting or burning. How old, are you. Okay, and what were you doing to hurt yourself."
13115.0,Patient,I was cutting in In fact I was burning to at that time.
105.0,Provider,"And was let me rephrase it, what was the intention behind it, what would you were hoping would happen from that."
13115.0,Patient,I was hoping that I would go.
105.0,Provider,"OK OK. OK, so people would see it, and then there would be some help coming okay. about how long did you do that."
13115.0,Patient,Probably for. Maybe like two years.
105.0,Provider,Okay. Was there another time.
13115.0,Patient,It was 13 not working.
105.0,Provider,"Sorry okay. Was there any other time in your life, you were doing that."
13115.0,Patient,Probably like whatever I started injecting I use that form of like. hurting myself but it wasn't it wasn't to seek help it was just more soda relieve pain from my mind.
105.0,Provider,And where would you do the burning.
13115.0,Patient,"The burning, it would be just wherever on my arm ruminates to. I don't have any burns."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So if that shows up again, or you start. craving doing it, or you get the thought of wanting to I also want to know that as well. Okay, not you're going to learn in working with me that it's not. it's not viewed the way a lot of people do it's not to shame you this is basically the best solution that your mind is coming up with to try and relieve that pain. So there's really no need to withhold that information, we just need to know where you're at in your mind, so we communicated as best you can to me okay. And because i'm not gonna you know it's not like we're going to go into a hospital. Because i'm you know it's really that's the suicidal burning is cutting isn't the same intent as completely ending life versus trying to end the suffering so so don't feel shy about telling me. The when was the last thought you've had. The thought of wanting to burn or cut."
13115.0,Patient,"i'm. Those ones come and go very like rare like they really come anymore on, but I do get them probably a real nice one September as well, they just came with."
