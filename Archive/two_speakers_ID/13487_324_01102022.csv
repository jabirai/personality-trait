324.0,Provider,Good morning.
13487.0,Patient,"Good morning. Stable for now okay. The reason I say stable is because. um me and my husband are expecting my mom anytime it's gotten worse. The other therapists I talked to she's like way more aware of what's been going on with me. I think the last time I told you, the last two group meetings were physic were literally about me leaving and. My mom's just made it very impossible to live here so, especially for my mental health, especially my mental health, I. i've come to the conclusion that she's the one deteriorating my anxiety she's the one that's causing it because I sorry give me a second i'm gonna take off my sweater hold on. long story short um some really bad things happened on Wednesday, and my husband had to take me to his parents House for a couple days and within those couple days my mom ransacked our play our room that we pay rent for and. he's trying to like find any motive to like get anything to put against us to take my daughter way she has like no motive to take her away. She just can't accept the fact that her only daughter is moving out of her house with her husband and her kid and my mom is extremely close to my daughter, so I think she's not taking the move very well so she's going like on the better side and she's been very sour about this. We came like to a lot of like messed up things on Saturday, because we were gone for so many days, she was gone, thankfully, she was gone, because my anxiety would have just been horrible but. it's been bad it's been very bad here um we're almost to the point, we might end up homeless, so we need to figure stuff that we need to figure that out, because my daughter so it's been really difficult and challenging lately so that's what my anxiety hasn't been the past."
324.0,Provider,isn't an option to. What.
13487.0,Patient,"Is it is, it is it's either him it's either them or i'm the sister, and right now the sisters got things going on to and well the parents house it's extremely tiny. And my daughter kind of like after like a couple days to kind of like got fed up because it's so tiny and I, you know i'm not trying to like you know make her seem like oh she's live in a big house that i'm not getting that like. But after a couple days, she was kind of like getting too many fussy and when she gets a little too fussy that's why I do a very good job of not having her cry because her client gives me anxiety so i'm very good i'm not having her cry. And just being over there after maybe I think like on Friday, she started like getting like okay. I keep going from one room to the other end is this is really tiny and she just kind of started getting fuzzy so we chose to come back home Saturday. So I mean it is an option, but not like forever that's why me and my husband because he's the only one working is trying his best to find us a place. But um yeah we're working that out we're trying to work that I work on is trying to figure something out this week, hopefully."
324.0,Provider,And then. You stopped that it was causing more anxiety.
13487.0,Patient,Stop what Doc.
324.0,Provider,looks.
13487.0,Patient,"deluxe approach yeah I mean I just I didn't feel it doing anything like I was so I was religiously taking it i'm still religiously taking it, but I just mentally I just feel like i'm still like not there, like i'm still not genuinely happy. I actually did feel genuinely happy when I was away from her that I did notice, I was you know from Wednesday to Saturday. Were honestly, like the best days of my life, because I was away from her I had blocked her on Wednesday, because we had an argument that Wednesday when she showed up to the House, because I was alone with my daughter at the time. And when she showed up it wasn't it wasn't a good outcome, so I blocked her, and I think from blocking her helped my mental health so much. So I think yeah, I think, from my mental health, I need to leave I need to get away from her because she's extremely controlling and you know the other therapist says that she's noticed that my mom shows no boundaries. You know, family need boundaries, to be honest."
324.0,Provider,It sounds very toxic.
13487.0,Patient,emery extremely.
324.0,Provider,toxic. and Even though best mom. You still have to put your family and your mental health first.
13487.0,Patient,Exactly huh.
324.0,Provider,"Members, you have to. Put it you love them but love them from a distance. yeah you know, to help protect your piece is more important than your peace. So if you do not have peace have a peace of mind. You got to do whatever you need to do. To get to make sure that you have that because it's affecting you."
13487.0,Patient,"And it is, it is very much."
324.0,Provider,"For so. Okay, so I made a note, so I thought Okay, and with everything going on. Because I remember. Because the dosage you start off with a lower dose anyone. And we're going to gradually increase it. Okay um because it can take up to four weeks before you start to really notice anyway. Right um. But when you have a lot. Externally going on. yeah um. You know, no matter what you're taking it, you know."
13487.0,Patient,again.
324.0,Provider,"It might seem like it's not working. Exactly so. Okay, so Okay, so you didn't start you didn't continue."
13487.0,Patient,"I did I maybe I might have stopped for like a couple days only because I was kind of bummed. That it wasn't working and also because my anxiety, has been very bad so maybe you know those two point in point I felt like it wasn't doing anything and my anxiety was just terrible regardless of me taking it's I kind of stopped for a couple days."
324.0,Provider,Oh.
13487.0,Patient,"I just came back, maybe i'd maybe started back Saturday, when I came home so."
324.0,Provider,Are you having any credit because.
13487.0,Patient,"I had a severe one on Friday and that's why I had called bright bright heart i'm so i'm not sure what company, this is called but I had called them and I was actually able to get Ahold of the actual therapist I talked to which is, I think Lisa yeah I had a severe panic and anxiety attack. yeah it was very bad I was like crying to the reception is the. Reception me talking to the reception is actually therapeutically helped me because it was just someone to talk to. yeah she caused it because it was it's just some stuff happened on Friday with conversations with my cousin and. Her telling me that I can just cut people off of my life i'm like i'm Sorry, I have to for my health. And you know she kind of like backstab me and then after that my husband noticed that Friday that my mom came in barging into our room that we pay for, and she was like looking for stuff I don't know what she was looking for looking for stuff. And well yeah it causes it causes anxiety attacks definitely. A point where my mother in law was she had to take care of my daughter for a little bit because I just couldn't breathe, I was trying so hard to like breathing exercises it took like maybe a good tip or two minutes for me to like genuinely calm down so yeah Friday was bad."
324.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so will you guys will see. If you can meet with Lisa did you meet with them."
13487.0,Patient,"I did, I was able to. was able to make me feel a lot better honestly. Oh yeah."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, in order, because. Right now, we gotta we gotta do something about the anxiety. What about depression and far as your mood outside of the anxiety any like depression suicidal thoughts."
13487.0,Patient,"suicidal, no, no, no. it's just."
324.0,Provider,Mostly inviting.
13487.0,Patient,"Well, the anxiety you like the depression, maybe lifted a little bit when. I started putting in my head that i'm leaving her like i'm leaving the House. Because when I didn't have motives of leaving it was it was getting worse, like the depressed like Oh, my goodness i'm never going to leave, I mean i'm not gonna i'm not trying to get a job, so my husband's like the breadwinner. And you know we can't really get a job if there's not a lot of income, so all that just started like causing me extremely depressed or like anxiety more anxiety, if anything. And then, once we started really legit talking like Okay, we need to leave, we need to leave after her making that first threat that she's going to take her away from me because we're leaving. My husband was like okay yeah let's do it i'll work my butt off, and you know we leave, and I think that lifted up the depression, a little bit, I want to say it's like okay it's giving me motivation. i'm happy that i'm getting to do something, you know i'm going to leave, so I want to say that. cured it a little bit I don't feel suicidal about anything regardless, I never felt was, I know I told you about it only because of the moment with my my husband situation. But i've come to terms that I do not want to kill myself, because I love my daughter too much, I would not want her without a mother. yeah i've come to terms that I would never want to do something like that to my my daughter, especially seen how i'm having a relationship with my."
324.0,Provider,mom. I wouldn't want to leave him.
13487.0,Patient,"or her motherless so yeah I don't think you should work on me being suicidal mean obviously you're allowed to ask that question every time, but no, as well as of right now i'm okay."
324.0,Provider,Are you are you sleeping.
13487.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, actually right now i'm a little tired, even though I got like a good amount of sleep but yeah yes, I am."
324.0,Provider,yeah I know it's a lot going on how's your appetite.
13487.0,Patient,"um some days it's like like I really don't want to eat anything but it's been okay it's been Okay, he, like it hasn't been terrible were like I don't want to eat anything it's been it's been stable."
324.0,Provider,Okay. let's see so. Then let's bump it up to up to 10. We talked about. US or.
13487.0,Patient,i'm sorry for which one.
324.0,Provider,"Talk about these are useful, we made."
13487.0,Patient,Like the medication no I am never heard.
324.0,Provider,"Okay, we do. To help with anxiety, but think I say we're going to just try one, at a time."
13487.0,Patient,"Right, I remember you saying one, the left, which is the lexapro."
324.0,Provider,I think it's time to. start off with 13 when I start off with five milligrams twice today.
13487.0,Patient,I say okay.
324.0,Provider,These bars twice a day. it's another one of those that may take a couple weeks literature says three to six weeks. um. i've had people say oh I don't think it's working. And then I think i'm gonna stop taking it and. The minute they stop taking it they're like wait a minute. It was actually working. They didn't realize it was working you know. Okay i'm.
13487.0,Patient,Okay i'm open to that anything honestly just coming down.
324.0,Provider,"And I think with so much going on. We need something to. help with you for is what you have to take it twice a day. Okay morning take it at night i'm. Perfect from the similar ones white with the lexapro nausea. sedation nervousness headache or dizziness reference for insomnia. Also, what i'm thinking when you mentioned the panic. always see what you've tried before Have you ever tried gather pin."
13487.0,Patient,Know you're actually the first one to put me on medication so lexapro the first.
324.0,Provider,"medication or no. gabba penton this one would be strictly as needed. Okay, so if you're starting to feel anxious, you know feel you're inviting."
13487.0,Patient,Increasing.
324.0,Provider,"before it gets to panic, you can take one."
13487.0,Patient,"Okay, make sense okay sounds good okay."
324.0,Provider,"The abuse bar and then let's, the problem is I just call it long term overall maintenance to control the gabba pin is like a fit as needed. Okay, especially until we can get to the therapeutic. right with the other two, since they do take a little bit of time. Okay, you have the gabapentin on board if you need it."
13487.0,Patient,Okay. Okay yeah.
324.0,Provider,"And it's um it's in the class is this in the classical jam and anti-convulsant, but it is used off label i'm. to augment anxiety. And argument is is our eyes, which would be the lexapro. Okay okay. I call it. I call it a wonder. medicaid medications because, for those who may have seizures you know seizure medications. for diabetics are people with pain. Especially like neuropathy is really good for for pain and then it's also helpful for anxiety, so I said, is it helps with a lot of different. things which are like it so. So i'm going to send you right so i'm going to send in a prescription for that one. Side effects. The galloping could be sedation dizziness fatigue tremor vomiting diarrhea dry mouth constipation. and weight gain the best with like long term long term use. blurred vision. um. If you take in assets like Tom and."
13487.0,Patient,I don't.
324.0,Provider,"Like my land or something don't take within two hours. Okay, of each other yeah. So this is going to be useful. I think what I want to do I think i'm going to do a 10 milligram tablet. Because we're going to do that, for one week. is going to be a 10 milligram tablet but we're going to cut it in half."

My cousin tried is she sounds like my mom it sounds like my mom literally brainwash my cousin because it was like oh you already seen a therapist for mental reasons and that already does it look good on your case. I was like wait what what are you even talking about so i'm pretty sure my. mom deteriorating them and telling them that oh she's getting she's going crazy she's taking meds she's going to be crazy she's gonna be unstable like i'm sorry but I think are the one that's unstable because you're trying to take a perfectly healthy child away from their parents. how's that for stability, though it's just it's been on this and my my family's My family has always been toxic, since I was very little it's actually been soap I would actually. Witness my mom fighting with my grandmother so it's kind of like history repeating itself and that's where i'm cutting it off i'm like i'm not gonna let my my daughter see me fighting with my mom that's not happening so that's why I need to leave."

324.0,Provider,Really.
13487.0,Patient,"Like we're trying to get away from you like respectfully but away and then. yeah but regardless no it wasn't going to work out I just it was kind of a. bold move I think me mentally I was just trying to get away, far from a person, but no we're gonna stay here but yeah that was her words, it was like."
324.0,Provider,It is you literally have to pop up in the middle of the night.
13487.0,Patient,yeah.

13487.0,Patient,"I just control. Someone i've noticed several people have told me she's she's scared that you're not gonna be able control you anymore. So many men called it like you're technically married to your mother that's why you need a divorce her. Just people that people like the terms you know because i've gone on to talking I know i'm not i'm literally, not the only person in my life that has a toxic other there's millions of people out there that have toxic mothers."
324.0,Provider,So what if they were gonna. Take medications.
13487.0,Patient,So let's uh.
324.0,Provider,"Well, as abuse bar in the gap or pin and much of you and make sure that i'm really. Getting clear on instructions so there's not confusing you know and that way, hopefully until you can. You know, because you might not figure it out overnight, but he'll maybe he'll be able to kind of deal with everything. Okay until you can. Leave right."
13487.0,Patient,"I feel like maybe honest. I think that, once we start like once i'm actually out there, moved out because we know we have idea in mind. i'm like within a month or two, I feel like you're obviously going to see that their friends and me because me being away from her. helped me mentally a lot, so I think me physically moving out of her house and being in my own little state of mind. I feel like you're going to see an improvement, and I feel like I probably will tell you I won't even need them anymore, because I think she's only one triggering them so we'll see I want to say that's what it is. it's her."
324.0,Provider,"Okay. You know, whatever you do protect your peace still you know, still have mom and maybe it will take sitting down and saying look i'm not, I think she feels like she will be abandoned. Fear there. You know i'm not abandoning you you're still my mother, I still love you, but we need our own you know. face and if we're five minutes away from it, we still need to have. It doesn't mean that our relationship."
13487.0,Patient,is over.
324.0,Provider,"You know right. And maybe try. Even talking to her and kind of explain it that one. She may calm down a little bit, but. I think some of it is fear to. The loss of control your only baby so i'm going to lose molly HP. Man and I think a lot of and she's acting out in a way that's actually pushing it further away is what's happening. It is that's what it seems like yeah. yeah. So you know, even if it means lift. Go to a little CAFE or sandwich shop or something and let's sit down and have lunch and just talk."
13487.0,Patient,I hope.
324.0,Provider,"mom i'm not right i'm not abandoning you I love you my mother, you know but. Exactly my husband I, we have a baby, you know we just we don't you know space it doesn't mean that we don't love you and that you're not going to see us. yeah you know, and maybe that'll kind of help her. call a little bit."
