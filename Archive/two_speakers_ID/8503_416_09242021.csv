416.0,Provider,that's why yeah.
8503.0,Patient,"Until I find another place, so my best compromise is to go with Montana, a look from there when i'm interviewing people and I facetime them and they're like hey we really think. you'd be a good man. i'll be like Okay, this is serious and i'll fly back to La and. If it doesn't work out then i'm on the ground there and then maybe I spend some time you're looking and then I fly back you know it kind of has to go like that, but it's it's, the best thing I can think of right now.

8503.0,Patient,Oh no I wasn't I wasn't offering a critique it's just it's.
416.0,Provider,kind of our.
8503.0,Patient,"it's the familiar it's the backdrop that i'm familiar with. You know what I learned, when I was a drug user was there is a state dependent not state dependent memory, but there is like a. I don't know where i'm going with us, but there's a thing, where, if you take a drug in the in the same environment. Your body gets used to it, and then, if you change environments and take that drug you can overdose because your body wasn't used to it, so if you were doing heroin in your friend's basement a bunch. yeah that was body was used to, and you would like your body would sense here in the basement and would prep chemical so I had, I saw your Green curtains and I was like okay it's cool we're safe now."
416.0,Provider,"Ah, OK. The ugly green curtains are your safety yeah."
8503.0,Patient,"I did not editorialize you, you heard what."
416.0,Provider,"I know I kind of think they're ugly. I just they were like there's a big glass door like a mirror sliding closet doors behind me and it's so bright, because the windows in front of me, so I had to put curtains up and those are the ones first ones I could find. Interest smart fi is otherwise this is what you see. And I don't get any. it's like really."
8503.0,Patient,annoying yeah gotcha. yeah smart solution to that I hate the sliding glass mirror things they're incredibly helpful for picking out it's been. A.
416.0,Provider,"While, and these are like ancient because the house is built in the 50s and I. think they might be original and and they're also like awkwardly size so they're just."
8503.0,Patient,There you. have to do the.
416.0,Provider,"critique thing so Okay, the plan is keep trying."
8503.0,Patient,If you find in.
416.0,Provider,shows couple days. I think Montana.
8503.0,Patient,"My mom's house. In orange county and find a. A. A storage unit that's big enough, and then I have to spend some time moving my stuff out of my friends houses into the storage unit, so I don't want to just leave shit at their places in definitely yeah. So, and then, as soon as i'm in a storage unit, I can fly them on to him."
416.0,Provider,"And I mean in terms of the way we're thinking about Montana, I feel like we could see it, a whole bunch of different ways right our interpretation."
8503.0,Patient,My current interpretation is very not good.
416.0,Provider,"yeah can we work on maybe coming up with a better interpretation, so that it can impact your mood in a healthier way. What are some alternative interpretations here."
8503.0,Patient,i'm succeeding to Montana. night that was pretty good. That sounds right.
416.0,Provider,I think we can do better. How about i'm. Just. it's a reset. it's temporary it's a temporary reset to be able to kind of. find what it is you really want for when you come back and all that's true.
8503.0,Patient,No i'm glad i'm going back to see some fall for a little bit.
416.0,Provider,Okay we'll focus on that.
8503.0,Patient,it'll be nice to just get back for fall so i'm sick and tired of the weather here always.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8503.0,Patient,People that if you grew up in the West Coast I don't know how they do it out here it's just one season year round it's crazy.
416.0,Provider,Parts of the West coaster I mean southern California is particularly like that that's. not like that.
8503.0,Patient,But even like Seattle and portland felt like they had 2.5 seasons. yeah I mean or like two and a half. yeah. yeah. i'm so i'm excited to go back to my. hometown for that reason i'm excited to go back to a bed. um.
416.0,Provider,"you're going to find a soft place to land, while you make your plans for the next step."
8503.0,Patient,"yeah Unfortunately though there's no making plans for the next step, my plans are now for the next step they're happening now, like the only thing that's frustrating to me about it is there's nothing i'm going to do there that i'm not doing you know what I mean like. searching emailing and calling, and then the event and when they're like oh yeah let's let's schedule a time, I have to be like i'm 1100 miles away you don't I mean."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, thank God for zoom and facetime."
8503.0,Patient,"yeah sure, but like. it's it's it's hard for me to feel like i'm going back there with i'm going to go back and i'm you know we talked about um. I like i'm happiest when I have something to look forward to when I have somebody in my future I have something to believe in. kind of going back to Montana right now is really specifically hard, because there is no clear. anything. If there was a clear i'm going back to Montana, but there's a job coming up in another city in December and. If you don't find anything you can take the job i'd be going back to Montana, with a very different attitude, it would be like okay let's see if I can make something work, maybe I enjoy some time Montana, but I get ready for this transition into another thing. Even if it's not good just that there's something happening down the road, I have a way to feel about my day to day, going back to Montana right now trying to make something like doing what i'm doing right now just it's just really hard because it's just treading water and i'm. Like I think what's going to happen is i'm going to go back to Montana and i'm gonna spend a little bit of time not not looking for places because right now i've looked twice a day, every single day and I like. I know what's I know what scams are there and I know if I go out there and i'm there for a week and a place pops up 100 people are going to be on it before I get a chance so i'm kind of gonna go out there and just like."
416.0,Provider,Take a break.
8503.0,Patient,"Just fucking sit yeah which. The hardest part about that specifically is, and this will be important if I do go back there because you're going to see the result of this feeling, but I might not be able to recognize that i'm experiencing it. The hardest part about taking a break right now is I don't know what the Fuck i'm taking a break from. And I feel like i'm i'm going back and i'm going to like I got to unwind and I gotta chill and it just i'm like well i'm still wasting my time, which you know how I am about time and all of that stuff so."
416.0,Provider,"Well, but Okay, so why. Okay you're when I say taking a break i'm thinking specifically taking a break from looking at craigslist twice a day. Thinking about like retreating from the life at all."
8503.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I know, but usually taking a break means like I don't know I just don't feel like I deserve a break from nothing."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you do deserve a break from the totally crushing feeling of you know not finding some place that to live for eight like you. We won't get you."
8503.0,Patient,"that's what that's what going back to Montana, the positive spin. to interrupt you sorry but."
416.0,Provider,Please do.
8503.0,Patient,"The positive spin is that I get to go back to my own space i'm going to go back to Montana, which is beautiful. i'm going to turn on a fireplace i'm going to have to go to bed bath and beyond, and buy some fucking new pillows because my dad is ridiculous with these cheap shitty pillows. i'm going to like nest in my room not sleeping his room i'm gonna make my room Okay, and no one's going to be around during the day i'm going to eat food that's probably going to be a little unhealthy, but you know, like. i'm going to i'm going to go back to Montana and i'm going to have a space that's my own from sunrise to sundown. And that is a positive thing that's what i'm looking forward to your question."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and that gives you space. To create a new strategy. Right, you too, if that that might mean you shift gears from craigslist twice a day to looking for work in various cities right."
8503.0,Patient,"Now, or. In work back here if I found if I were to apply for and get a job, while in Montana, before I got an apartment that enables me to get an apartment more easily if that makes sense. yeah i'm in. Montana, and then and then be like oh I gotta get back, I have to find an apartment. Now I know what my income is now I know my budget is, I have to lock down in three weeks, whatever the Fuck it is, I can move later, because then i'll have the money to do it right now i'm like thin budget trying to find a place that I can land and cruise for five years. Which is a much. More target to hit okay."
416.0,Provider,"So. it's you're going to take a break from this craigslist whirlwind that feels demoralizing and focus you're going to shift your focus into something that will hopefully be a little more productive and get you a little closer to your goal you're going to. you're creating a new strategy. And you're hitting the reset button, at the same time you'll be doing it from not from a place where you feel like this pressure to not be yourself or to. not be fully present there and because it doesn't feel all that safe or like you're a burden to a place where you actually get to be comfortable and not have somebody like all over yeah."
8503.0,Patient,that's terrible and that's all.
416.0,Provider,Good that's a good that's a better place to be searching from.
8503.0,Patient,"that's true and that's all good, and I agree with all of that, but there's also an extraordinarily high probability based on what's happened in the past that I go to Montana. And because i'm alone because there's No one to hold me accountable, because I have no daily structure that I flounder harder than I do here, because here. When there's people outside i'm like I have to be doing something I can't just be sitting on my phone grab your computer go look at craigslist. there's also a chance that I go to Montana. You know shrinking and shrivel up a little bit which i've always been afraid of you know, this is one of my things about I don't have the self discipline to stand up and do things on my own for myself. that's a very that's a very likely outcome of going back is that I kindness."
416.0,Provider,"So I think we're gonna hold you to a different standard when you go back. Right. And I can help with that because I am gonna hold you accountable for this to we're gonna hold you to a different standard, so the stuff that was working well for you, before all of this. turmoil around living spaces and everything really sunk in and got bad like the you know, limiting the number of hours that you're daydreaming the. The meditation mindfulness the you know not getting up in smoking pot right away, but getting up and doing the mindfulness work. yeah and and creating a little bit of structure like we're going to hold you accountable for that and we're going to keep going with the db T while you're there. yeah, so I think that we have an opportunity to change things around a little bit so that going home to your dad's can be. More like them it's going to be a little bit of work right."
8503.0,Patient,"It would be great if I had like the reason, when I went back there last time and I kind of asked him for projects and things to do, around the House. was specifically so that I had you know, a you remember me talking about all I have to clean this and I haven't done it but i've done all these other things, and all I need to say on the porch but what was I talking to you when I was sitting on the porch was it. let's talk. Okay yeah so you remember it's good to have things like that, during the day, so when I go back there's a high probability that i'll be like i'm going to paint or do something for your you know, like i'll talk to him on the phone about what can be done with me there. So that should help."
416.0,Provider,"yeah and there's going to be, I mean we can also create will create some benchmarks for you around like a certain number of things that you will want to accomplish every week or every day, you know so we'll get those going as well. And i'm going to hold you I mean i'm going to be checking on that, so I will help you find some accountability for that too yeah."
8503.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So let's try really hard to focus on this with a different bend. And when you start going into that the that brain weasel of. i'm just retreating i'm a loser, whatever it is that your brains going to. Now that's not what you're doing this is a conscious decision you did have other options, you could stay in La. you're choosing a healthier option and for very good reasons, with a new focus. you're trying a different strategy."
8503.0,Patient,You can try it out.
416.0,Provider,How have your thoughts around suicidal ideation.
8503.0,Patient,You here in there it's fine last two days we're okay.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, no plans."
8503.0,Patient,No.
416.0,Provider,"i'm glad you've been eating today, at least."
8503.0,Patient,"yeah well, I actually ran and grabbed food, I was starving hungry, but I was like i'll grab food before this time, so I don't repeat and what she was trying to avoid when she cut it short on Wednesday."
416.0,Provider,He was so miserable.
8503.0,Patient,I was so miserable. And I would have been. wow yeah I was very much.
416.0,Provider,"You might have been miserable anyway, but adding hunger, on top of it all is a. recipe for disaster."
8503.0,Patient,"yeah for sure. yeah all right, I talked to tanya i'm a step up the zoloft that's good."
416.0,Provider,Really load us like subclinical right.
8503.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm i'm at i'm going to bump up to 15 now, which is still pretty low."
416.0,Provider,Very low.
8503.0,Patient,"yeah so what we're going to see how that goes and if, after six eight weeks I feel like there's room for improvement or go up higher just take it, step by step. All right, well, nothing changes between now and next Tuesday so keep your fingers crossed that I find something in the next three days."
416.0,Provider,All of them everything's crossed.
8503.0,Patient,me your eyes yeah.
416.0,Provider,everything's trust.
8503.0,Patient,All right. I just thank you for splitting up our time this week and accommodating me.
