323.0,Provider,"We had to do the. At least in the basement anyway that dripping faucet through the night, just to be sure there'd be a little water running. yeah like Oh, this is, I forgot, this is why I really don't like living in the Midwest."
7772.0,Patient,"Now huh yeah yeah we had quite a few call bus the pipes today and stuff which you can't really do a whole lot when it's this cold out, you know. Some of these some of them we can't even get to the water mains because you call the water department they're like you know if there's. Because we had a quite a bit of snow last week I think Saturday, and then we got hit again. Early in the week you know the kids they only had a couple of well they went to school today, for the first time this week."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
7772.0,Patient,"yeah we had quite a bit of snow, then we had some mixed precept some ice on top of it, so we had about eight and a half inches and less than a week. yeah so which doesn't sound like a lot, but we haven't had any snow all winter, so now it seems like."
323.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well and it's yeah because I think we got like a five inch dump and then a few more. On top of that, so the accumulation yeah."
7772.0,Patient,But.
323.0,Provider,"We were cruising along like a pretty mild winter in it, let us know it's still here."
7772.0,Patient,"I know we were scheduling windows. For second week of February, and we had to call them back or like well we'll see what happens just because we just go with the flow if it's nice out will work out, you know there's some stuff but."
323.0,Provider,Right.
7772.0,Patient,We got plenty of stuff to do inside so we'll stay in where it's warm. Right so but yeah actually I think we're leaving next week for that stephenville thing for hgtv I was.
323.0,Provider,Getting asked you what the update was about that.
7772.0,Patient,"Well, I kind of got some mixed reviews I ran into an electrician who I know through the guy that introduced me to them, and he was just down there a couple weeks ago and. He said that they're not even close to being ready and then his kind of perception of what we have to do there is a lot more, and what I talked to the guy. But he's an electrician i'm like you know he doesn't he was just saying he's like well there's a 16 foot island you guys got to build there's. All the doors aren't in yet i'm like wait what like so I sent an email out to Doug and he assured me he goes no the scope of work that we agreed to is only on your contract, so you know I kind of had to play it low key now like, I was tattletale and."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
7772.0,Patient,"I needed to know what i'm getting into you know if i'm going to be down there for two weeks, I might I might not agree to that, I got other stuff to do. right as i'm just kind of. tip dipping my toes and at to see how this goes."
323.0,Provider,"And you. Bring supplies or equipment or they're going to have all that there for you, or do you have to bring all know that yeah I have to use all my own stuff as part of the insurance thing."
7772.0,Patient,"they'll have some some things there like ladders and scaffolding and stuff i'm sure will be supplied, but you know power tools and stuff we got to bring which this always comes up I need a trailer and. Right. All right, an enclosed trailer because, like if I bring my entire wood shop I can't fit that in one van which the one guy that i'm taking he's going to his diesel truck just broke down today so he's taking that into a shop in the morning. Because it says anytime you get a crazy freeze like this thing for a."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
7772.0,Patient,"So and it's a newer trucks, so I think it's electrical just it won't start so and I don't work on diesel, so I can't help them. they're a totally different animal I know nothing about them, so if he hopefully he gets that fixed in time because we were just going to split it up the load between our two vehicles, you know, put the big stuff in the back of his truck so but we're excited."
323.0,Provider,it'll.
7772.0,Patient,But yeah hey before I forget I got all that.
323.0,Provider,Did you hear me.
7772.0,Patient,"yeah we must be. home right, but my. wife and I, so it shouldn't be too bad."
323.0,Provider,I just thought it would be worth the adventure to. What before you forget.
7772.0,Patient,"yeah everybody's excited We keep talking about it at work and I don't know it's just some different we've never done this so which we're going to be doing another project shortly after that. tick in February, maybe early March here in Columbus it won't be filmed but it'll be with the same company. And he said there's some huge project coming up in spring and you know if everything goes smooth we would be first on his list so we're excited about that I have no idea what it's about where it's going to be. Because I told him I wouldn't travel out of state i'm not interested in that the one guy works for me he used to work in Florida he built. The steakhouse Texas roadhouse."
323.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
7772.0,Patient,"And he's like dude it just sucks because you're on the road you don't have everything with you you're there for two weeks or off a week and which I have no interest in that, but. He just says it gets it gets the first two weeks are really fun and then after like three weeks it gets boring, and then you get home sick."
323.0,Provider,Well yeah and that whole living out of a hotel room loses its appeal very fast.
7772.0,Patient,yeah yep even when we do long vacations after the fifth day i'm like I want my bed I want my stuff. My washer and dryer. Right so but I got everything worked out with the with bright heart.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
7772.0,Patient,"yeah the so they had when I called so I got it worked out with the doctor and I was right they had just messed up something on my chart so they got that all squared away. But when I called in, because they hadn't sent me any UAE and it was right at the it was actually I just did it yesterday. Maybe Maybe it was Tuesday today's Wednesday Okay, no I did it yeah so I did it yesterday. And they hadn't sent it and they hadn't sent it and she goes well, we have you in here as we never received a ua from you, since March. i'm like what I was like i've never missed the UAE i've never had a bad UAE like I screenshot it, you know, I was like I can email you screenshots and then, as she was digging through it, they just had an updated my file or something. So, but it's all ironed out now they said they had it overnight, and because we were getting into the end of the month."
323.0,Provider,"Right okay actually I just got out of group a little while ago, and there were several people still saying they haven't received it yet either. So if it's. Postal hold up or we're just putting them out later or what's going on but."
7772.0,Patient,"I gotcha yeah cuz they usually send it like the first or second day of the month, usually for me, and it does take about eight days to get from wherever to here, it seems like lately with usps, but this time it came and day two days it was real quick. So I got it got it all wrapped up."
323.0,Provider,Well i'm glad between my notes to. them and then your conversation they finally got the compliance piece figure it out so that's good.
7772.0,Patient,"yeah I actually I just popped into because I tried to set up an appointment with Julie, but she was booked out, so I just went into a group. A day or a week, I was supposed to be off and I just talked to her real quick and because I didn't know they had somebody on staff it's kind of in the back in the shadows."
323.0,Provider,"yeah they just started doing that, with most of the groups now that there's a care navigator in the group with us. Doing Okay, and then dealing with all kinds of any compliance types issues that surface so."
7772.0,Patient,"Well yeah cuz she just told him she's like yeah you need to fix that that's definitely an error, so they got it all fixed up."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
7772.0,Patient,But other than that.
323.0,Provider,Do you have an appointment with Julie Julie do medical appointments once a month or no.
7772.0,Patient,Not with me.
323.0,Provider,"Oh, I haven't done that i've only I."
7772.0,Patient,"had one appointment with her, but it was requested, because I wanted to get a. Something for sleep or something this was months ago, and she prescribed something it didn't end up working out I got my flexor all refilled with my local doctor who'd been away on maternity leave. Okay, so that that's, the only thing that seems to help me with sleep just because I can't like relax because of my my back issues and stuff so I just take a what they call a baby dose of it, and it seems to do the trick. I take it, like once or twice a week, maybe."
323.0,Provider,Have you ever tried melatonin.
7772.0,Patient,"Oh, have I tried melatonin let's see, I have chewable. five milligrams 10 milligram I trust me i'm a professional at sleep aids i've battled this my whole life like it started when I was 10. And it probably got sprung on from family stuff the divorce and all that I just could not wine at that time so it's always just been in the back of my head, I have problems with falling asleep so yeah i've been taking melatonin since I was a teenager."
323.0,Provider,Does does that help.
7772.0,Patient,"I I think it's a placebo essential oils seem to do more for me, so I keep at least six of the the lavender."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
7772.0,Patient,"i've been switching to cedar wood, nobody likes, but I seem to like it, I have cedar wood and then what's this new one, I got from Joe Tara all it's there it cedar wood with something else in it, but two drops of that mysteriously enough under my big toe seems to relax me the most. yeah and the girl that I got the dough Tara from is the one that told me that she's like I. something about it, she said it's even better if you where you put the drops on your underneath your big toe socks on I can't sleep with socks on so. I do, that you know the CBD oils and all that I don't think any of that stuff works, but I keep my eye on it. I like."
323.0,Provider,"CBD stuff, I think, is that they're really not regulated so you really don't know what. How much you're getting in them."
7772.0,Patient,Right.
323.0,Provider,tried that also for different pain points to and it's just so random.
7772.0,Patient,yeah I get mine I I buy it from the actual person who manufacturers and they get it from St claire's bill Ohio. it's from aya door.
323.0,Provider,hmm.
7772.0,Patient,they're.
323.0,Provider,Pretty highly get a lotion.
7772.0,Patient,know those are those are gummy bears for the time.
323.0,Provider,Okay okay.
7772.0,Patient,"uh the pain cream, you can get a 500 milligram or 1000 milligram I can't tell the difference between the two, but I can tell when I don't put it on my life, because I have Bruce itis if I don't go like two days without i'm like oh wow it's coming back, so I do believe it works. i've tried everything. But those seem and i've tried other brands like through the pharmacies here in town they started selling them and i'm like well i'll give it a shot it sucks because it's 6070 bucks a."
323.0,Provider,trip yeah yeah.
7772.0,Patient,"And then I can tell like is there even any in it, you know because you're right it's not regulated, but I adore they're pretty well respected I did research on them and I actually. saw their shop in the mall the Ohio valley mom like oh wow you guys have like a full fledged retail facility, and so I just communicate with her directly, even though she's like the owner of it doesn't have time so she cuts me a pretty good deal."
323.0,Provider,Of that so.
7772.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz usually dummies like that are 60 bucks and she sells them for 30. The pain creams, I think those are 30 as well, and then there's other stuff she's given me free samples, but I just always kind of levity towards those. So, but they seem to work and my wife even takes it like when the kids are sick and she's stressed out she notices it but schilling do a gummy once in a while. So."
323.0,Provider,I didn't know the big toe trick that's an interesting one.
7772.0,Patient,"yeah when she told me that the Terra sales REP actually she caught wind, I was buying it from this other girl in apple valley and she's like oh i'll i'll just steal her client because they were friends. Then I found out that's how they got my name so she's like i'll just give you a free sample and then I was like wow this really works like it's a lot more potent I probably just because I got immune to the other one or got used to. But yeah cedar wood seems to really work there's another one that you can't even get any more. What is that it's super expensive and it's from young living i'm sure you've heard of them. Oh it's a lavender my wife would know but she's cooking. But you can't get anymore I can't remember what it was been years since we got it, it was a lavender extract with something else, but it was really good high cedar wood seems to be my favorite that and it's about a third of the price of the other ones."
323.0,Provider,Had you ever heard about dabbing it behind your ear when you're going to sleep. Is sort of like this yeah closer and then it gets on the pillow and all that kind of stuff and.
7772.0,Patient,"yeah I do my wrist and my toe so. I have to be it's kind of sounds weird, but I have to be careful what I put on my face I break out for no reason, like after shades even my beard oils and stuff."
323.0,Provider,Like I can only get like natural extracted ones.
7772.0,Patient,I think i've tried that and I don't think I had any problems but i'm just used to my routine. right they work and I tried to tell other my other buddies about they're like there's no way i'm trying that i'm like. I don't know man he's told me you haven't slept in five days i'm just trying to help yeah you know I can't take any tylenol PM I can't take any of that stuff makes me feel very groggy the next.
323.0,Provider,day all day yeah yeah.
7772.0,Patient,And I just can't be on alert we're. right because we i've had an accident doing that and it's just don't just not worth it.
323.0,Provider,Now it's. yeah yeah.
7772.0,Patient,But yeah so the I don't know if i'm i'm a tron or however there pronouncing that is it bad where you're at.
323.0,Provider,"yeah the variant. Yes, we're kind of coming down now they think we hit our peak, but it was the schools closed again and. Back to masking everywhere. yeah. Nobody, you know again it was it was pretty awful hospitals didn't have beds all that kind of thing they're like don't come to the er unless you can't breathe it's like oh great."
7772.0,Patient,"So that's going to be the wave here because that's a client of mine is a doctor and he said Knox county we're probably six weeks away from really getting the wave. But the schools are still open they're gonna they're starting to bring the masking back now we went to Columbus last week weekend I took my oldest because everybody. My wife misty Carson my oldest carly and case and haddock Carter was the I think me and my one son Carter a some symptomatic because if i'm in a household and. Everybody tested positive. Right, I felt perfectly fine Carter felt fine so we just we were like well we'll just go out and stay away and that was before we found out they had it we just knew everybody was kind of feeling cruddy. yeah but uh yeah they all had it and then my dad got it. yep so he's still sick. So we've been i've been having to take him groceries and stuff like he's not even like I went in he's like he's asleep in the door unlocked he doesn't want to get up and lead me in which I have a key. Right so but with him and Lynn my stepmother with the colon cancer it's like damn this is rough so they've had to cancel her chemo and everything, because I can't I can't take care of that because they have to sit there all day."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
7772.0,Patient,"Well, they make you sell my car or whatever so he's starting to feel a little bit better today, I took him some stuff from walmart just regular stuff."
323.0,Provider,"Like he gets really awful though I mean from what i'm hearing we had because i'm doing some back to in person therapy stuff too. So they put us back into the end. 95 masks like none of this goof off cloth kind of things are like nope we're going back to hospital grade. And then we. gosh I don't know like for 10 days like half the staff went down. And I had tons of symptoms, so they sent me home first It started off, then it was the headaches and it was the chest. fever sweats. You know the whole thing that comes with it and."
7772.0,Patient,There were two days I just couldn't.
323.0,Provider,"Get out of bed my head hurt so bad. This crazy burning and the nostrils it was the worst thing ever. So they're like you gotta. Go that's good can come back to you get a negative test well I tested twice and I tested the negative. The first one, because it's a swab negative then they're like. Okay, give it a couple days go back to another test done they made me do this saliva test which I didn't even know. They were doing for you gotta. hook in this tube till a certain number, you know, whatever. Did that right oh came back negative and they're like there's some false negatives that come up but you've got every symptom so you can't come back to work."
7772.0,Patient,shoot.
323.0,Provider,So 10 days later. But it never tested positive.
7772.0,Patient,"huh yeah cuz my wife and the oldest did a rapid test and they both came back positive and we actually because you see all this stuff about the test coming back negative so they're like just tap water shows positive it didn't it showed negative. The misty and my oldest did so, I had to go get two more rapid test for my dad and, of course, he couldn't understand how to do it i'm like it's so easy just and you're done, I mean it couldn't be any easier so but yeah the burning nostril thing that's what my wife had."
323.0,Provider,"It was awful I never felt anything like that, before."
7772.0,Patient,Now Julia is your taste and smell.
323.0,Provider,"smell, I mean I was anything hurt, so I don't even know what I was smelling at that point, because it was just so awful painful, but I had to but I had no appetite so I wasn't really eating anything I was trying to just drink juice and stuff to stay hydrated."
7772.0,Patient,I gotcha.
323.0,Provider,"That headache and, like my I swear my eyeballs hurt it was just the strangest thing. i've ever experienced anything. like that."
7772.0,Patient,I think this thing just keeps morphing into whatever.
323.0,Provider,Is.
7772.0,Patient,it's an eye. Good.
323.0,Provider,"Like the first symptoms, I was just kind of like maybe it's like just the normal flu that we don't think exists anymore, but it's still the normal flu. And then I was like okay when i've had the flu my nostrils never hurt like this, my eyeballs didn't hurt my head didn't hurt there's something different going on here. Right. I don't know it was just very strange."
7772.0,Patient,"yeah she was down for like three days my oldest he was only down for a day and then he just kind of felt credit, but yeah me and Carter we were perfectly fine and I know we were exposed I. mean I kissed the kids every day good night all that all that, so I was like I looked at Carter I was like we're lucky now I did feel a little weird Monday I I went to work, I was like. But by lunchtime, I was fine like I thought for sure I was good at that I was fine. But we're working on a new build so nobody's there."
323.0,Provider,"Carter Carter has never had it, because your kids have. came up positive through the process at some point."
7772.0,Patient,yeah I could you have key and he.
323.0,Provider,created some kind of antibodies so that it just you're not getting symptoms.
7772.0,Patient,"I think so because I was the first one in the family, to get it, but I never got sick I just lost my taste and smell, I mean I felt karate for a couple days but Carter he's never had any symptoms ever. And I can't tell you the last time he's been sick. So, because we got everybody in Knox county got a letter from the school board saying our kids had gone over days absence, and you know and juvenile courts for intervene, well, here it was a mess up everybody every if you had a kid in public school you got."
323.0,Provider,letters.
7772.0,Patient,"Of course we're all we're all freaking out like what. You know they're gonna we got a cop come into our House children services so that you could even call the number on there because everybody was calling it, and then they finally just sent a. text alert to everybody just disregard it is unlike what isn't every absence excuse with code, right now, because they have missed a day or two and even carly who got perfect attendance attendance got one i'm like there's obviously a mistake. This whole school system here is all messed up right now anyway. I know."
323.0,Provider,One that's not right now good grief. yeah so.
7772.0,Patient,"Do we want to schedule. Yes, let me get another one. room, please."
323.0,Provider,get your chart up here real quick.
7772.0,Patient,is I think we're good for January now.
323.0,Provider,Do you have particular. evenings.
7772.0,Patient,830 is fine for me. Maybe skip Tuesdays with group in case that's a week. I got group or whatever. So you feel 100% now.
323.0,Provider,"No, I just it's just the fatigue, the it's awful it just hits me out of nowhere, and I was like one day I just put my head down on the desk i'm like I think I. just need a 10 minute nap to try to push through this. That and I noticed some labored breathing that i'll just hit me out of nowhere, which is kind of weird."
7772.0,Patient,What do you on day five.
323.0,Provider,"Day so much. i'm on day. No cuz i'm back in the Office now, so this is like two weeks ago."
7772.0,Patient,Oh geez. So you had it for a while. yeah my gosh.
323.0,Provider,yeah they made me stay home the 10 days.
7772.0,Patient,I gotcha.
323.0,Provider,So okay hold on one second here went to the wrong place. February to the ninth and the 23rd.
7772.0,Patient,Now works for me.
323.0,Provider,"and go with the 838 30. I will get that in your chart and you'll be all set I won't talk to you for a couple weeks. I hope it all goes well, everybody stay healthy."
7772.0,Patient,"that's the plan well Jason actually he's still out of preschool because he's just got a cough and that they have any symptoms. right because preschool attendance doesn't matter it's daycare he just goes there because his friends his there and as well, and it does get some prepared for kindergarten a little bit. Right, I mean I routine but he's missed. I well I think we're keeping them out throughout the week actually she called the teacher because she does pictures for so she has her cell phone and all that and she's like just keep them home no big deal and I guess there's only one kid in the class anyway."
323.0,Provider,Oh wow.
7772.0,Patient,"Because there's only five kids in that preschool for the pm, because he goes in the afternoon. After lunch. So one kids sick they're all second they're all out."
323.0,Provider,right that makes sense. yeah so hey just real quick the ninth won't interfere with your time away doing the filming will it.
7772.0,Patient,Oh uh.
323.0,Provider,cuz that's like. yeah weeks actually from today.
7772.0,Patient,"In well if it does, I can call in and reschedule. Okay, which. By 830 I mean even that's all i'll just do it all the hotel miss."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, I just want to make sure it doesn't interfere that's fine. You can. change it i'll just put it in your chart then if it's not going to work just changed."
7772.0,Patient,I got you know it should be fine.
323.0,Provider,"Well, I will i'll be excited to hear well, maybe if i'm there and i'll have samples in the hotel room I can show you because I guess he's."
