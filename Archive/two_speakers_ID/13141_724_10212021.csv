13141.0,Patient,"connected in a forest, I was watching this because I was thinking. To plants and feelings and communicate with each other and. Are they connected and they're connected underneath, and so the route. Work and tiffany it has a total net connecting to each other kind of. Was it something like that. yeah so that's why the brain waves probably connect to because it's all funky so it's all connected. But, most people and I don't know you know just want. We all blocked. And when you when you open, then that when you have that didn't like the open send you all of a sudden, you so we had."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah some people aren't ready to have like like like out of the out of the box conversation sometimes.
13141.0,Patient,"You have to follow and what do you say no, I don't want to talk about it."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
13141.0,Patient,I don't want to hear it.
724.0,Provider,"You know people look at you like you're nuts, you know, sometimes. Like there yeah Have you ever heard of the the the stoned ape theory of evolution."
13141.0,Patient,sale do.
724.0,Provider,"You have a stone date they think that it's possible that. tree dwelling. orangutans or monkeys and apes, or whatever we descend from the great apes, maybe potentially fell from the tree. was injured and as a result, had a forge on the ground, because it typically you know. If they went down to the ground level that's where they're vulnerable to attack, so they didn't like that which is why we have like a natural fear of heights. Why we're afraid of the dark why what every horror movie every horror monster movies got nighttime and then sharp teeth that come out. And it plays on like our natural fears that we haven't everybody has like that that built in fear that uneasiness like at night when you're walking around. So they think it's a leftover monkey stuff right, so we think that maybe an eight fell, out of a tree got injured discovered psychedelic mushrooms, a phone. And then had an out of the box thought process forge for more of it developed tools, all kinds of stuff and like and then it just spins off from there and it's like it sounds crazy, but it also."
13141.0,Patient,You get all that stuff. told me. don't get those crazy mushrooms.
724.0,Provider,"yep, so it is possible that that a scenario like that played out potentially and then maybe who's to say that it didn't happen that."
13141.0,Patient,"way, which means Where do the apes and monkeys and. chimpanzees come from."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
13141.0,Patient,So it's uh huh. We are here now and.
724.0,Provider,chicken and the egg.
13141.0,Patient,"concepts are variants yes, why does everything tastes like chicken. And we involve those experiences and history, but still too dumb to learn from it and repeated again. yeah like I do with my. cocaine addiction kind of I still get angry and stupid do it again. Instead of getting. Lower it down and slow out of it i'm in that kind of area have to slow it down make it smaller and smaller yeah."
724.0,Provider,"But that that's progress and that's maturity to you know what I mean, as we get older we start to realize the things that we. That we used to care greatly about you know some of that stuff diminishes and then we we refocus the energy that we do have the things that are important to us."
13141.0,Patient,"Well it's important to all of us humanity. i'm still come to the conclusion that really stupid seeds and small minded so very small brain. like this neurosurgeon because my mother had men and all of a sudden, development and Chinese like she waited for me to come and visit and and she got sick. And so, this neurosurgeon famous in Vienna. All over the world in the meeting Texas said when we all need to be ironed out and say it on sync then we know that we don't know, maybe half a percent of what the brain is all about and."
724.0,Provider,what's.
13141.0,Patient,"going on and how it all works, the whole universe, so I told him the whole universe is kind of neurons and synapses connected because they told, he told me about how it works that's how the universe kind of looks and. works like it seems it."
724.0,Provider,"seems like that, if you look at the stars yeah."
13141.0,Patient,It looks like there's no kind of. invisibly. There must be something else to hold it all together yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah it's the it's The great question.
13141.0,Patient,So we just in somebody else's brain.
724.0,Provider,Maybe.
13141.0,Patient,Maybe that's what I saw it just thoughts of somebody else.
724.0,Provider,"yeah they're fun they're like these exercises and you know critical thinking and research and. A lot of people don't have conversations like this, they don't they don't really think outside the box or content on being like very."
13141.0,Patient,anytime they have to go to work.
724.0,Provider,"yeah well I gotta go to work, I still have these conversations."
13141.0,Patient,"Well, you have a different kind of what we've been taught. Or if somebody is anyway, at the same level, you can. Have a conversation on occasion."
724.0,Provider,"Know sometimes is collaboration. And i've mentioned that people. Probably flock to the things that interest them and, like minded people will always find a way to connect."
13141.0,Patient,Well it's nice to connect on a table and have some coffee and cake.
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah for sure i'll.
13141.0,Patient,"try to get them out for ice cream and go to a show, so you. don't even know that i'm getting together. they're just going for it that's it."

Getting recognized. or remember. For the work you do and. So that's a hard work to to put people in put yourself into the memory of other. The world out there and so. that's what I did. And then dead virus hit yes so where did it go damn it.
