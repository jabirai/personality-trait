14338.0,Patient,Probably.
408.0,Provider,"Other blaming all right let's try that one other blaming. What are the facts say about the work stress and the money, how could you challenge the thought that you're not paid enough for work stress. You challenge, though the thought you have, would you challenge that thought that you're not paid enough. For the amount of stress."
14338.0,Patient,"or get like I get paid almost the same price as mcdonald's and it's like right up the street from me so. And even my girlfriend like she's. Here, she has clients and stuff like that and. So it and she complained she's like I might as well just work mcdonald's and like since i'm at a restaurant and i've worked at mcdonald's. And that was my first job and I was there for like all the three weeks and the pay was ridiculous and I moved up to a fast food to a restaurant and i've been in the restaurant industry, since so. it's kind of hard to get around it, but."
408.0,Provider,"So, are you saying one way to challenge your thought that i'm not paid enough for this work stress is you can say well i'm kind of blaming this job for work stress, but I do have the choice to go back and work for mcdonald's if I want to."
14338.0,Patient,"But I turned it around was at work, I was thinking about working trying to get an over at like a ups or something or like a warehouse because that I just like worked a lot of hours and. This is crazy so."
408.0,Provider,what's the challenge what's the challenge to the negative thought i'm not paid enough for the work stress how do you challenge that negative thought.
14338.0,Patient,that's The challenge is really.
408.0,Provider,"Because you're kind of blaming the job for that, but what's the challenge to that yeah I mean what you wrote is everybody else feels the same way right but that's not really a challenge, maybe the challenges if I choose I could go work somewhere else. Is that a challenge to that negative thought."
14338.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was trying to but, like my food my ADHD my focus like it's so hard. For some warehouse drugs really. temp agencies, because i've done it a lot in the past, but right now i'm going through some stuff with work and kind of get my license switched over to me because. They need to have some type of paperwork for the dmv for me to become a main resident and I already have like the meat like I have made insurance. I have my past where i'm going to skew I have my Pennsylvania and it's still like like it's not expired, yet, but like once my lease expires, like I don't know what i'm going to do so i'm kind of worried so."
408.0,Provider,it's like stick with this negative thought before we jump to another worry thought let's finish working this one through so down below go back. Go back to the previous screen.
14338.0,Patient,I can't i'm stuck. it's froze I can't.
408.0,Provider,"So the alternate thought that was the next thing you were going to work on the alternate thought. Is. Now that you're thinking about it, what would. be an alternate thought to the I don't get paid enough for this work stress, which is going to make you. really focus on and turn your mood down so every time you think that what's an alternate thought. To avoid your mood crashing. Hello."
14338.0,Patient,"i'm just thinking. it's. it's hard. Like. i'm just really in for the work for the check at the end of the day, and like it's it's all from my car and like trying to get out of the House, trying to. alternate but."
408.0,Provider,"Alright, so tell your ADHD brain every time it thinks that. The alternate thought is yes, but i'm in this. For the money. Even though sometimes it doesn't feel like it's worth it. i'm still. In this for the money until I get a. Better job."
14338.0,Patient,"yeah. Well i'm trying to do that and i've been i've been trying to get my Green Card for years and, like. it's so hard it's so difficult and. it's not easy it's like yeah. i'm trying to get my medical card i'm trying to get that i've been trying to get it for years.

I it's really frustrating to me and like nothing makes sense because I i'm doing everything and i'm working and I have the insurance I have all the paperwork. And my work is messed up on printing out the right paper that I need because I need a pay Stub for the address and the address needs to be on it, so that when I go in there, they can change to that address and so therefore I paste that because i'm work here."
408.0,Provider,Right yeah just publish all that documentation to prove what you're doing right now yeah. yeah and it's a lot of stairs ADHD brain that's a lot of steps to.
14338.0,Patient,"And, last night I got a paper and it had they finally found it, because in the system, I wasn't even in the record at first they had my work history. From when I was working in Pennsylvania, and I was so upset because once I saw the Pennsylvania address it still had the address that's all my license. And I was like it doesn't even have where i'm living at right now, like that's upsetting and she was like i'm gonna get that fixed ASAP. So then, last night, she gave me the paper and it didn't even have the address on it, and she was like is that the right one of those like no. I was like it needs to have the address on it like i'm I need to have the address on it she's like alright well we'll try to get like a pace stuff like that paste or something like print it out for you."
408.0,Provider,As a guest that when you say she. To whom are you referring.
14338.0,Patient,she's like my supervisor in the kitchen.
408.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like she's. worked with us, she is trying to work with."
14338.0,Patient,"You know she definitely is and she has been. All right, on your screen in front of you let's complete this cvt."

408.0,Provider,"always getting ahead and click on about the same. And now we can get out of the screen share. Go ahead and go back to your regular screen. Very good. Very good, all right so. I that's another thing you can do. With all the frustrations related to not just work. But to getting your Green Card. While you're trying to do what you need to do to get the. documentation in order not to be overwhelmed by the stress, Mr Fritz. yeah he's cognitive strategies that we do that, there and there's a reminder, on your mood log right of steps to take like look at the cognitive distortion. challenge than a thought. come up with a more realistic positive thought all these are the steps that we're working on it therapy and that's why I had to find a cvt log so you always have a reminder, on your device. How to do this. So, every time you're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated or angry, you can go through this every this process, it can be done three times a day once a day once right. whenever you feel."

14338.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
408.0,Provider,"This is not, this is something you don't have to agree, then. You don't have to eat it you don't have to inject it all you have to do. Is go through the. cpt steps. And the phone will help you. That cvt log will help you. So you don't have to remember right what the steps are that we work on in therapy, you can just bring them up on your phone and work through. Each time. Until. And the thought. goes away a little bit. Okay, the negative thought. All right."
14338.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"So, can you try to do. You think happens every day, try to do the log every day. In between our sessions, because we work one of. These sets of strategies every session.
