105.0,Provider,"um. let's see what we got here. Alright, we are off. And I just need to look through some of the things that you were working on with her and see if there's still. goals that you're working on. US you want your primary substance to school seems to be, I want to stay abstinent from using. and and I would like to obtain my barber's license So do you at this point, have a Barber slice."

8517.0,Patient,"So I have yet to I have yet to I just have to go in and pay. You know, a couple thousand more to my teacher. And they're like you know I can go on and take my my. My speed barbers board test which shouldn't be much."
105.0,Provider,and tell me about I need to pay my teacher the 2000 that that part I don't quite understand tell me how that works.
8517.0,Patient,"um. I stayed I stayed when I when I went to prison nice feed with a balance with him. He hasn't been charging interested in it, or anything so that's been a plus but um. yeah I do, I do have to do that 2000. So I can go in and start working on my terms and stuff. and"
105.0,Provider,I think that right there needs to be a goal.
8517.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"So let's break that down let's let me shift it a little bit because the way this is written, we have identified unhealthy thinking patterns replace replace them with healthy ones. So, since you and I are starting to work together. we're going to shift some of the goals around we're going to have new objectives and what i'd like to do is, I want to hear. what's your plan or let's say you were going to either save money at a certain amount each month or each week, how is it that you're planning on getting this 2000 to this person."
8517.0,Patient,"um well, I actually i'm in the. i'm in the middle of a lawsuit i'm actually towards the end of it and and it's pretty much. it's pretty much a done deal it's just a matter of waiting. But my mom. Basically, told me that that she would cover it and that I would over so. i'm. So pretty much. Whenever i'm ready to go, I can go."
105.0,Provider,So let's see what's holding you back then it doesn't sound like anything's holding you back what's your concern about borrowing the 2000 from your mom.
8517.0,Patient,"um. I guess it's it's it's not really about that she's you know she's already offered me her help numerous times um. Excuse me um. it's just a matter of going and getting it done my the with my new job and and my scheduling and everything it's been kind of hectic. And I take care of my 13 year old. I go with him to his football practices and his games and. I try to be as as much involved in his life as I can. So. that's really the only thing that. That I have really going on right now. With this lawsuit I like i'm constantly in contact with my attorney so. I always take your advice on on how I should go about things, because I am injured. um. I do, I had a an infection called osteomyelitis. needed attacked my. I had to add this to my spine. And somehow the. deteriorate, is my. Two of my disks in my back one of them is completely gone and the other one might as well be there's not much of it left. And this was all due to medical malpractice. They left me for about three to four months. begging them to help me um. Basically, all the game, he was a wheelchair and told me to deal with it, and when the time finally came. When I did."
105.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah hold on you're gonna have to repeat that last part. One more time there you go so when when they finally did come to help you repeat what happened.
8517.0,Patient,um oh shoot.
105.0,Provider,"Okay now we're back so, then what happened."
8517.0,Patient,Was they.
105.0,Provider,"When they look they. called again. I don't know if you want to text them and let them know you'll talk to them at. Nine o'clock. So yeah I can't see or hear you i'm hoping that you're texting them. letting them know that you're busy. So, again when you're ready hit your mute button and video, so I can hear and see you hopefully you're not been talking to me this whole time. walking, hopefully, you can hear me if you're done texting whoever was calling you please hit the mute button, because I cannot see or hear you for the last few minutes. There we go."
8517.0,Patient,"Okay sorry about that my. My son got into some kind of altercation at school, so. Somebody has to pick him up by guess, according to him, he was defending himself so Somebody needs to pick him up."
105.0,Provider,Okay. you're going to be okay with doing that later.
8517.0,Patient,In yeah i'll have my mom pick him up. Okay i'll send her actually so. should be fine.
105.0,Provider,So you also. Oh wait.
8517.0,Patient,i'm sorry i'm not on video i'm sending my mama text messages.
105.0,Provider,yeah just let me know when you're done.
8517.0,Patient,"You, the. Okay sorry about that."
105.0,Provider,"So let's back up to, I really want to focus on. You first, if you could just say out loud what your goal is nice and short, I want to and the topic is pay Barber mentor Now you can give me a different word, you could use this fellow's name, but I want to put it in quotes so that it represents your goal. what's your goal."
8517.0,Patient,Okay um. I would like to pay my my mentor my teacher. I like to pay him in full. Which won't be a problem i'm just trying to work everything I was.
105.0,Provider,scheduling I stopped that's too long. Right. So I want to pay my mentor in full what's the full amount.
8517.0,Patient,"Is $4,000."
105.0,Provider,it's interesting because you were talking about to earlier.
8517.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not sure where where that came from, but I do oh."
105.0,Provider,There we go.
8517.0,Patient,"it's not a problem to pay it it's just. Like I said, my scheduling so I want to work everything out to where they can move take my. My feet test and be done with it."
105.0,Provider,"So we're going to take each piece, I would like to pay my mentor info $4,000. You already have the ability to get that done. Which is different than going and taking the test. I want you to think about what it is about not maybe wanting what's your reluctance what's your hesitation in borrowing it from your mother see if you know what's keeping you from doing that part."
8517.0,Patient,um there's not really any reluctance it's more of the scheduling thing. I know I know I can get this done within. A week.
105.0,Provider,"Okay hold on hold on I think what's happening is you're putting two different behaviors together one of them is, I would like to transfer mom to this account that's that's an event. Right. mom can you transfer it to this account. period it's not it's not. I need to schedule my state exam Those are two very different behaviors you see that right. mm hmm okay so just take the first one let's not think about taking the test for a moment. How would you. Accept the money, how would the money get to you how would your mother be getting you $4,000 How would it get to you from your mother."
8517.0,Patient,um will shoot directly pay it to the school.
105.0,Provider,Okay hold on school the The goal is to pay your mentor is the mentor at the school.
8517.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"Oh OK OK OK, thank you for that okay um. Okay that's great So is there a problem with the getting that debt resolved, which means done. And then let's say waiting. A week a month I don't know how long. for you to take the state license is there a problem with doing that."
8517.0,Patient,"No, no, as soon as you get to be like in like immediately start working on. Getting a completed."
105.0,Provider,I can you also not do it immediately. Can you wait.
8517.0,Patient,"I could wait, I would rather not i've been this has been on hold, since 2016 because of my stay in prison. So it's been one of my it's been actually like up there, as far as my goals. Take you to complete this I believe it's gone on for too long."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so what you're doing is you're holding it up so by saying. It needs to get paid first and then you are talking about scheduling but you've got to do one thing at a time you've got to get one of these things done, and one of them is getting that debt paid."
8517.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"there's nothing preventing you from getting the debt paid except you is that right or is that not true, maybe your mother doesn't have the money, I don't."
8517.0,Patient,Know that's right.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so now there's nothing except maybe something in your mind. Maybe you are afraid of taking that test, maybe you're afraid of saying son I can't go do this with you i've got to go take this test. And somehow it represents, if you pay that debt down that you've made a commitment that you're going to follow through with it, what do you think is going on in your mind."
8517.0,Patient,"um. Honestly, I don't think. there's nothing really holding you back. i've got a lot of different things going on in my life I have my oldest son asking me for help. I do have a. I wouldn't call it a job, but I go help my cousin. The window washing I get paid pretty good money. So that's only thing that's really kind of holding me back is is I do need the money right now. And I would hate to leave him hanging but, but again he does understand. The situation and he urges me to go to go take care of this."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so but. For now fucking separate these two things. Yes or no, there is nothing preventing your mother from today sick paying off the debt period, no other action is needed. You could wait a year and decide to take that test that's your choice. there's no you but you're going to have to tell me because I don't know you do what is keeping you from asking your mother to just pay the debt down."
8517.0,Patient,um well i've asked her and she's agreed i'm. Okay okay like I said I scored a really high test.
105.0,Provider,"She agreed and then what happened. And then she agreed and then what happened, did you not tell her where to send it."
8517.0,Patient,um no not necessarily um. She I guess. From what I take it she's she wanted to see my seriously server because it has stretched on for so long.
105.0,Provider,Okay now we're getting somewhere. yeah So there we go that that is something not in your control so let's talk about that. Do you know. If your mother now sees that you're serious and is ready to pay a checked in to see within the last week. If she's ready to do it.
8517.0,Patient,yeah she definitely ready to do it.
105.0,Provider,So now i'm gonna ask the question again what is holding you to mom and son back what's holding you back from paying it off.
8517.0,Patient,My current job and helping helping my son with his with his newborn child and trying to help them financially as much as I can.
105.0,Provider,hold on. So you're saying. She can't write a check because you're working you see how those two things don't go together.
8517.0,Patient,"it's not necessarily how you're thinking of it. Right. And that's you could write it she can write the check. I just haven't given her the the complete green light, so to speak. Because i'm doing my best to help my son out as much as I can, and if I do this. I won't have the income to be able to support them, the way, I would like to and it's going to be a sacrifice, so I guess, I just have to put my foot down and just go with it."
105.0,Provider,"I think there's still one thing there's two and I was hanging in there you're doing great. My guess is there's still a piece of information that you haven't said out loud anyway My guess is that you think. Once this debt is paid. I have to show my mother within a week within a month within three months I don't know there's a number between you and your mother there's a number floating around and it hasn't been said out loud here today there's a number. that she expects you to be to have taken the test. And I don't know what that is, and I wonder if you know if she has an expectation that she wants you to take that state exam within a day within a week within a month of the debt being paid. If you do know what it is what it what is her expectation."
8517.0,Patient,"Well, her her exact words were, I want to be, I want to make sure that you're serious about this."
105.0,Provider,He said that.
8517.0,Patient,"And I think her reluctance to pay it has been that i've gone to school i've been this close to completing I finally test it out, but it's taken some years i've gone to prison i've relapsed and things like that so she wants to see the seriousness of. You know she she doesn't want. To waste her money, and then I fall back into my old ways."
105.0,Provider,"So I will tell you what keen that you still haven't said serious is a vague word that has no behaviors to it, I wonder if you know what you have to do. When she says."
8517.0,Patient,I just have to go do it period.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
8517.0,Patient,"that's all that's all there is to it, I just have to go get it done and. I believe that she's she's ready to see me go do that. I think that i've been a little bit. Not scared but like. I don't want to let her down. And I don't believe that I will. I feel like she's expect like her, her sister my and which I don't get along with very well. I don't think they're taking very serious. And I know that. That shouldn't matter too much, but she does have a lot of. You know people in her ear telling her well he's just the same guy you know he's gonna just he's just gonna. he's gonna take you on the same merry go round and it's going to be the same thing. And so I have to prove. them, I have to prove them wrong, and I have to prove myself wrong because. You know i've been trying to i've been trying this for so long it's been years and it's getting frustrating, but I haven't given up."
105.0,Provider,"So here's the disconnect between mom and you let's take other family members, out of it for now okay. yeah you've used the word serious and prove. Who, you need to know what the actions are. That satisfy that definition of serious, for example, if your mom was in the room, I would be asking her mom if your son in the work that he's doing with the window washing right. Is that helping you kind of stay alert stay awake."
8517.0,Patient,What that. Is what helping me stay awake.
105.0,Provider,"you're clapping said, helping you stay alert."
8517.0,Patient,Oh no no. i'm doing something.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so. listen closely because this, this is a real focus this has to do with communication with your mother right now Okay, and not making assumptions being very, very clear. If your mom was in the room. Would you ask your mom mom what do I need to show you that i'm serious so that you paid that $4,000 this week. What do you think she would say."
8517.0,Patient,I think you would do it i'm. um but she would also want to hear my game plan.
105.0,Provider,"So stay there we're gonna go with that word game plan that's fine. I want to hear your game plan. I want to hear you game one and nothing general i'm talking about things she could see with our eyes are here with her ears, what are you going to do to continue to follow through with getting the state license."
8517.0,Patient,"My game plan is is be very, very direct very straightforward. I have. dropped the ball on this before, where I where I slacked off. I have in. Given my full potential towards it and i'm more than ready to do that now as."
105.0,Provider,"A lucky lucky, not a game plan. really listen to my question, this was going to make the difference. I want you to tell me what your mother will see with her eyeballs. With their eyes what will she see."
8517.0,Patient,you'll need. To keep it simple it would just be me applying myself 10%. and
105.0,Provider,"applying to what she would see what Let me give you an example because i'm very your first time you're working with me and what we're doing is we're talking about. Being specific so watch. em. How would you know, I was right now, following through with. earning a living. If I if I just said to you I earn a living. How, how would you measure me how would you know if I was doing it. I could tell you, but don't you run the risk that I could be lying."
8517.0,Patient,The evidence would be there.
105.0,Provider,With your eyes what would your eyes see. which you want. You would see what.
8517.0,Patient,I would see you. Taking action. I will tell you. i'm actually doing what you said you were going to do.
105.0,Provider,"How can your mother see you taking action, how can she see it. What would you need to see."
8517.0,Patient,um she doesn't see me studying.
105.0,Provider,"i'm now we're getting to it that's it studying is one good. What else that's part of the game plan, those are those are pieces of evidence that she's going to need to see so that her confidence in you goes up. yeah notice how it took us a while to get to these specifics, this is. Probably what's keeping your mother from believing that you're serious, you need to know what it is that you're going to show her that you're serious. What about saving money, do you think that she wants to see you save money, make money paste something off, do you think she's waiting to see that."
8517.0,Patient,Someone and I think she has. been saving money and i've been i've been paying i've been paying stuff off i've been taking care of my finances and and paying for the things that they need being paid for. I think that me. Myself pain pain pores this would show her some initiative and.
105.0,Provider,"we're getting somewhere now so if your mother was here. I might say. mom. How often would you need to see walking studying and how much money would you need to see him handing over to you, each week to demonstrate that he is following through with the game plan, what do you think she would say."
8517.0,Patient,"She she would say show me. she's very much about academics and bettering bettering oneself. and She worked very hard and in in high school and she achieved the. You know our master's degree in teaching and so. I have some big steps to follow. But I think she liked it I think she believes in me and I think, and I think that she liked to see. She she'd like to see that she'd like to see a genuine. Okay, and doing this, not just talking about it or."
105.0,Provider,"It just happened lucky, I asked you for two numbers and you gave me that response. numbers, I asked for numbers. My do it again, let me just i'll just do one, at a time just repeat it back to me my mom might want to see me studying for two hours a day, just repeat that back."
8517.0,Patient,No longer like would like to see me studying. Or at least two hours a day.
105.0,Provider,"notice that it has a number in it has the number two doesn't it. Yes, great now repeat after me if you're willing my mom would like to see me hand over $50 a week to show her that I intend to pay her back."
8517.0,Patient,Let me.
105.0,Provider,"say it back, I just want to make sure it got in the way I was hoping it would get there something like that just include the $50 part number."
8517.0,Patient,My mom would like to see me. What aside $50 to pay for this.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so here's the difference between what you were telling me oh my mom wants me to show her. specifics, if your mom was in the room. i'll just say my way, I want to know what serious would look like, and it has to do with specifics talking about numbers mom to show you i'm serious how many hours a day, would you need to see me studying. mom to show you i'm serious about my money management, how much money would you like to see sitting in my account do you see how this has to do with things that she would see with her eyes, not the bullshit that she's been listening to you for years. You see the difference."
8517.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
105.0,Provider,"that's why you hear you see me doing things like this, what will she see with her eyes what will she I would even get away from here, because she's been listening to you make promises i'm guessing for years. And so we saw it, we saw it in here today, and so you see me. pushing very hard to get you to be specific, with numbers things that she could actually see evidence that you are doing things differently that test score is outstanding that is evidence and I bet she feels very good she's like he obviously studied. that's why I say things like that that's why I say what will she see she will see in your account of savings, my question to you is, would you be interested in talking with your mother and saying mom could you write down things that you would like to see. Not general do the right thing, because we don't know what that means. What how many. hours would you like to see how much money would you like to see do you want to be able to talk to my. My boss, what do you want as evidence that I am trustworthy."
8517.0,Patient,"that's that's actually funny see that she did tell me, I need to see that I could trust these so. She would need to see. My my effort towards achieving this me because it's my life it's my future we're talking about here, and I think that. She would like to see that i'm actually a man of my word and i'm actually taking steps towards. doing the things that I see that I want to do. Rather than just talking about it."
105.0,Provider,"uh huh effort towards achieving. And I don't think I don't think you know what to show her and i'm asking if it's time to get her to be specific. that's it let's leave it there because we've been talking about basically the same thing this whole time. it's not enough to just. say the word serious say the word effort we've got to be specific. I would want to know from mom what she wants to see with her eyes. and give it to her, so that you can get this paid. i'm taking it just as concrete as I can."
8517.0,Patient,"yeah no one, I mean this is more than anything, I would like to get this taken care of I think this has been my dream for quite some time, and you know i'm ready to be my own boss and. And I believe i'm really talented in. In what I do. i'm excited to showcase those things, and I know it's going to take. Work and show a dedication. To minecraft."
105.0,Provider,"yeah you've got that part and you've got the lingo down what might be missing. Are the actionable the things that you can actually do. To show. So let's just leave it I don't want to keep talking I want this to be all by itself, you will either decide to talk to your mother and asked her what she wants to see. Meaning how many hours of studying how much money might be about study it might be about money, but I would want to know, specifically what equal sign means serious for her I would want to know, and I would want it written down and then see if you can give it to her. So let's leave that there and see you get that conversation done."
8517.0,Patient,Good.
105.0,Provider,"yeah your mom's probably got an answer, but don't let her get away with I just need to see effort you still don't you and I don't know what that means we need to know specific numbers associated with the word effort. To get that."
8517.0,Patient,You know.
105.0,Provider,"If I studied one hour a day would that look like effort she might say no, if I give you 2020 cents, a week is that effort should probably say no, then what is effort what's the number it's going to help me stay structured. Okay, so I would invite you to really have a clear understanding because $44,000 is a lot of money so let's help her feel confident that you're asking direct questions get direct answers write it down and see if you can give it to her."
8517.0,Patient,Good.
105.0,Provider,"Okay um. You want to see if you get this conversation done by next Friday and we can meet at eight o'clock next Friday, unless you have something scheduled."
8517.0,Patient,"No that's fine I will. definitely be the. Thinking about interview, we talked about here today and i'm actually going to take some notes. and i'm gonna put forth my best effort into achieving this."
105.0,Provider,"It will be. Numbers it won't just be talk you see the difference you're going to have a number and you're going to be able to say I talked to her on this day, and she said. Oh. I need to see this many hours of studying Oh, I need to see this much money set aside and where it will be set aside so that she can see it, I will see you in group next time, do you need me to message her doctor anything, or do you have medication to get you to your next group."
8517.0,Patient,"mom no I have, I have enough medication. Okay, well, it was it."
105.0,Provider,was a pleasure to to meet with you and let's see let's see what happens with this this little homework.
8517.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"All right, enjoy your weekend bye bye you."
8517.0,Patient,"You too, thank you."
