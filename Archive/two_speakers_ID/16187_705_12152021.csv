705.0,Provider,hi Jay see how's it going.
16187.0,Patient,"Okay, how are you."
705.0,Provider,"Very well, little chilly for California."
16187.0,Patient,In a. Very good. I had my window open and the breeze was just like it will show like it was a tornado in here.
705.0,Provider,I like the green hair like highlights.
16187.0,Patient,"Thank you, thank you it's actually. I need to die it again, but. Here i'll show you what it looked like when I first read it. But i'm trying to buy it still back on one side to the other side, but I haven't had the energy to do it."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, it kind of looks like to the different way, that the highlights hit the your light sometimes they're almost like a till."
16187.0,Patient,yeah it's there's two different here. there's two different colors of blue and my hair. is to blue on the top.
705.0,Provider,Train job.
16187.0,Patient,Blue base. it's hard to keep.
705.0,Provider,yeah that's the thing with hair does tend to grow pretty quickly hmm.
16187.0,Patient,Especially with my mind to it absolutely. go faster than most people. I think this is my profile oops he's okay. I think this is my profile picture i'm here but it's.
705.0,Provider,Oh cool. yeah wow.
16187.0,Patient,My head there's been several different colors over the US.
705.0,Provider,wow it's it's always nice to have a change upon.
16187.0,Patient,"mm hmm it's a confidence booster. um I don't know what I can tell you I mean I don't have it okay Well, this is boyd but like it's also chaotic, at the same time to me like when of May was like you have an appointment with you, with you, oh I didn't realize how crazy, it was How crazy could have sounded yesterday."
705.0,Provider,"With that Tracy sometimes It balances one another out. And our stress levels we can handle so much and so it's good sometimes to have that not all, not a lot almost on the boring side not too boring. yeah but not too much chaos either."
16187.0,Patient,"No, I do I do it feels weird wouldn't like, is it really gets in patterns, because I guess my life could be like quiet. very long time, and I can hear like I can feel something brewing like oh it's like when people say that range but happened that's why I feel like with like chaos or like bad things it's probably a bad way to look at it, but I try."
705.0,Provider,"it's more like an unsettling feeling for you. You know, part of the the way and I think some of the cognitive behavior therapy, we started talking to in group about how to counter state that the same thing as if you're having. If you're more inclined to pay attention to the negative and be like okay something's coming something's going to happen highlight to when you feel good, and you know that something is feeling like good is there, like okay i'm feeling joy right now i'm going to appreciate that joy too."
16187.0,Patient,yeah I tried to do that and then it's very short lived.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and you know with JC with that then it's it works out more to a balance, because if you're trying to do that and so you're mindful. Of when something is going your way and you're like hey i'm going to pay attention to this to that, then when something else is not you know going your way then you're like well okay."
16187.0,Patient,"Have a good valid added good some days are. better than others. He honestly depends like on home my moms like I noticed my mom's attitude has a lot to do with mine because i've known the interaction here the most well anyway sisters. because she also takes care of me. But I feel like if I again that's where a caregiver would come in handy to where I don't have to handle my mom because my mom could be stressed out about work this that because she. And my current database and i'm trying not to be her therapist but it's hard when i'm the only guy that wants to listen to her, because my other sisters are in their own little world. And i'd rather deal with it myself as elder sister rather than stressing them out, but i'm stressing myself out in the end of the two and then people will because I tend to bottle things up. And then. When I just it can be a one no minor thing and then I can have a meltdown and then they're like whoa where did this all come from, and I said it it, but it comes up after two weeks and weeks of everybody's crap."
705.0,Provider,"haha accumulation. yeah cow, you know there's now that you recognize that JC I mean that's a that's a healthy recognizing that hey something's going on and pairing up. Because you do spend a lot of time with your mom so that makes sense that if she's like not filling us well that day, you would feel that energy. and being able to have some of the other, you know outlets that you can do to to help you know, one of them's called the defusing exercise, I was going to bring it into group, but I also want to see if you're interested in trying any of the coping techniques. Okay quiet diffusion is more of where it's like where we stop and we step back in and we observe our feelings and our thoughts and what's happening like for us into the other person."
16187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"And then, after we then we identify the emotion and then we label any unhealthy the thoughts and then we practice mindfulness and so there's a couple of different metaphors and one of them's the River it's like items like as you having your different thoughts and images. picture, like a river and items are floating down the river and you can even put you know put on like leaves or any kind of other debris all your feelings your thoughts images of that memory and instead of struggling to flow, just like watch it like you're looking off to the shore. You know added and just watch it kind of go by, and so what it's helping when you're feeling anxious concerned worry any of those to kind of. Allow it in except the feelings acknowledge it and then like put it into okay now it's going to go here or no watch it float on and move on."
16187.0,Patient,"mm hmm I think I tried to do the moment because there's sometimes like she's a agree have a sister. or like some for no reason that she's taking something on them one of them and i'm like mom just chill out like calm down and, but I have to yell at her deeply I don't want to yell at her. way she hears me cuz I often times I don't feel heard with my mom and i've tried is like she's like let's go to tempe oh my God I don't want to go to therapy with you, unless you go to therapy by yourself. I don't want I don't want to I don't want, because if we're going to tape it together and you're not going to debut in fixing your problems and that's just going to bleed into our time and then that's not fair to me because, and I don't think we could actually follow through with it. Because she's she's told me that all the time and she's like oh my day he says this but i've never like i'm not saying that I will be your therapist but she I don't know she goes in the morning, I think you would help her. mom is my mom has like bipolar disorder, because our family is very like if we don't talk about it it's not there, so and we have very bad mental health on in and. i'm so like I try to encourage her, but like i'm the only one that has to go, because I have, but according to her, but the only one that has to go according to her, because I have more explosive like. Like when I get angry, I can be angry and turn things and hurt myself I don't do it that much anymore, but that was like so i've always been that's why i've been at a beat those three because. It was more apparent to me that had the quality of people my mom she looks more quote unquote normal so she doesn't think she has to go."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I think that something like the defusing exercises may help you Tracy so I sent you a copy of it, and if this week, you would maybe pick one of the metaphors and check it out. isn't something that maybe you'd be willing to try. And it does come through you know jcs you've learned, because you went to therapy and you've learned different coping skills and that's where that's a plus for you. it's time for like if your if your mom doesn't want to go or others that they're missing out on something that could be useful."
16187.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know, last time we talked to you're talking about things you wanted to do for yourself and you were talking about being more independent and putting things on your calendar to help kind of remind you of when different events are happening."
16187.0,Patient,Oh good I put. Less it takes to be but there's one right there.
705.0,Provider,"awesome awesome so, is it working for you. uh huh okay well hey it's like check that one for the day."
16187.0,Patient,"Here i'm also starting school next month, so i'm gonna be the homework plate, but I think it's easier than not do it like it's been like a transitional way my life right now we're not really like do anything but i'm still doing something. At the same time, because my resource worker from regional said she said she said, like a budget thing she told me that, like she's going to get me on this given try to help me find the caregiver possibly to because I was like my one of my goals. With her and she also thinks I could be in my own apartment to. Be my own, apparently, and once I get like you said, my caregivers and I get a pattern known and like I can prove to myself that I could be on my own. Because i've always wanted to be on my own it just freaks me out it's like if caregivers can flake. And then I don't get help that day, and then I have to help myself."
705.0,Provider,"Okay. That could that be one scenario, what if. I have that plan."
16187.0,Patient,"And then of course i'm going to have a backup manager scary cuz like right now I would call it P, it seems like people do not want to work. for whatever reason, or like list because I need like physical like lifting I probably don't need as much once I go to 30 minutes, but I. i've been trying to explain the people that come for interviews but it's like I need the caregiver to go to therapy, so I need more help in the beginning. Because I could I could do a lot more work for you when I was like going to debut regularly and I had like. I had everything set up for me, and I know everything and all the world can be set up for me, but I just explained to people, if I can get to therapy and I keep on typing I go for like a month or two, I will get a bunch of strength back, but the. More that."
705.0,Provider,"I think Jay say you know you are doing really well, you had shared last time that one of your goals was reaching out to regional Center to find out what resources. can check you did that, too, so you achieve that goal and i'm hearing. That you know she's sharing with you, she does see where you could be independent. Is that something that you would want, then."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah and then she was also talking about I don't know if the main California. Well, I know you live out. Here, but so there's Rachel Los Amigos which is like a rehab Center but it's also like an impatient, she said, I could go there and like she said that she said, other clients that. go there and she also wants to work on me with getting better doctors, because the one I have now kind of sucks and he's not really inclined, where people will CP. So she's trying to get in touch with. United cerebral palsy because they're really big out here. yeah but I like she wants to help me because me I feel like i'm a chicken with my head cut off trying to do this and that. I don't I don't know it's out there some before they have her because other people in the past they have just done what they thought was best for me and but she asked me what I wanted, and I said. I want you to like in and she offered to talk to other CP client for CP like me and so that helps so that's helping me too, because of the say no, I have people that understand where i'm going to do, or could understand and have been through it yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And I think that you know JC some of the things that you're sharing like having concerns, and you know, having those those fears about you know if you need a care provider they don't show up like all those are normal things that. I think, also it's normal to think about wanting to gain some more independence and wanting to get out there and do things you know where like you said with therapy, that you can get stronger and that you, you know this about yourself because you've experienced it. Before so people on the outside can say well you know advice and suggestions and their opinion, but they don't know how you feel and how you think and all those things."
16187.0,Patient,"No on it it's like a explain it to people, but they don't I mean, some of them want to listen to others don't they don't know it depends, who I talked to. having a hard time because my best friend she also ICP too so like I have right now well I love like I said, the group I lost my best friend. That lives in Australia and we were friends for like three years and then all of a sudden, I woke up and I was blocked on every social media. Without an explanation and I was like so I messaged her helmet backup account, and I was like what like so you're just going to block me out of nowhere, for no reason. And then she was like oh I didn't think it was gonna hurt you know it's like we've been friends for three years and you don't know me well enough to know that. I would give her by that, obviously, because I call you my best friend if you're just random person then yeah I wouldn't get offended because people need my wife, all the time, but. You know, like one of my best friend's name just up and left in it and then surely, will you didn't seem very supportive my relationship, and I was like No, of course I don't because I see a bunch of red flag, but I told you, I will always support you. and whatever you do and then she was like Oh, and then we never like talked about it again, because I was like well obviously you can talk to your life like that, then I must not be that important to you and and and Dr sets."
705.0,Provider,"unfortunate and you seem like you were being a good friend, by being supportive but also sharing with the relationship of what you saw as a really."
16187.0,Patient,"High because, like she was sitting money to her girlfriend she wouldn't look like her girlfriend has like told her that because her girlfriend has kids kids she was dating all the woman, I guess. And um she was saying that she was gonna leave for kids what do they live on opposite sides of our show you from each other, like different. and different our show and state, so I was talking, I was like that's pretty red flag flag, you know flagging go like like you don't see where i'm coming from sorry this was sister yes. um. But she was a young lady you don't see that the REPS like she like your girlfriend has literally told you that she would leave her kids with her baby Daddy to go be with you. And she said that she would be a trophy wife, whether she was joking or not she said that with the intent of that you're going to take whatever it I don't want you to end up taking care of someone that's not going to take care of you, because you're 21 and she's almost 30. And I and that's what I told her and I don't think she liked that because she was like Oh, with the PD and stuff like that I said you like I get I don't have the PDF or I don't know if I do if I don't. But like I don't think that just because you have a mental illness doesn't mean that like. You have to use that as an excuse, like you, can be a nice person and still have depression is still. leave your mental illness doesn't define me or doesn't define me but. In there, I think we didn't talk about it after that then that's that's how I got blog because I was like being honest because I told you guys the vicious cycle of toxic relationships and I told her that and that's the time thing before she bought the wife, I know she bought."
705.0,Provider,"That sometimes too if the person, you know, is still in denial that they'll continue to me."
16187.0,Patient,"And I will say to so they go okay. Maybe she'll come back Maybe she won't because for a long term I remember being in denial with maddie. And Linda was like no Why would she Why would she Why would she do that, like she loves me she just doesn't take care of me for the money but it turns out, even though it was only a little bit of money, I feel like it that's the only reason I kept you there are kept with me and then. And then, with my other best friend, the one that lives on here she introduced her to one my other friends, I met online like when I was like 13 and like we we were. She was also one of the people that I dropped that I stopped talking to you when I was with maddie so because there's a bunch of people I saw probably without maddie. And then she turned out to be the same person, she was before maddie like before, when I like this impression that I remember, so I was like no I don't want this, but then Bernadette so kept, which is my best friend she so kept talking to her. And I was like if someone's that means here best friend wouldn't you, and if they ask you to stop talking to that person wouldn't you think to stop into the goal. The thing that happened between you and alyssa that's your own thing, seeing that I have with the list is different, I was like what. How is that different when if the tables are turned our drop somebody for you, because they're going to be, that means to, then you don't need that and. What how do I know you're not talking crap about me behind my back you know, and she was like well i'm not going to do that, and I said was disrespectful to me that. I asked you to not talk to somebody because I don't like them, I don't think that you would need to be treated like that, too, and cheers like why don't see the problem, and then I was like Okay, and then. Her mom called me so we can talk, you know cuz you're wrong i'm like her mom's second daughter like that's how close we are. And she was like talk it out, and I was like I feel like you disrespect to me by because I asked you to stop talking to her. I don't think she's good for you in new you still did it anyway and she's like well I don't see a problem with it now. Okay, fine i'll talk to you later and I haven't talked to her, since that day because I felt really disrespected. Because I know that not everybody's gonna like me because of how one and honest and straightforward as well, like it, I valued late here my best friend like that's like the deepest. relationship, I can have with someone and if I don't respect you and I can trust you then you know my best reading what I was talking to James which is he's kind of my boyfriend but not, I also feel really detached from him to. I don't know if it's me for TIM TIM reacting to me and making me feel detached oh."
705.0,Provider,"Well, where are you JC have. Do you feel the need to talk to him and defined a little bit more of what's the relationship, right now, or do you feel like you're just kind of going with the flow and Sam what happens."
16187.0,Patient,"A little bit of both because it's like he. He lives clearly to me. And he says that he doesn't know me well enough and I was like okay come hang out with me. Like if you don't think you know somebody in love how the heck are you frozen like get to know somebody if you don't like either having our DEMO video chat or you know or come see them and he's like well I don't want to. I don't want to announce it was going home, I said fixes like how we supposed to. If you want to get to know me more than I see the aspirin stuff hanging out, we have facetime or you, but he doesn't want to do that so i'm just like. Okay, but then other times, he told me that he wants to be a boyfriend so, not the other he is jelly semi even mentioned talking to someone else, even if it's just put sonically. So i'm confused because he doesn't like he said they if he's not any means not anyone else but it's like you're telling me what you wanted to be boyfriend off when you want to like do that stuff but then you go on Tony you say that you don't know anything about me. So i'm very confused. I can I get that. You have ish and I get a few minutes or holidays negatives, where they don't want to see anybody, but it's been almost a month now. And I pointed that out to him, I was like look because he's a it's only been a week and I was like it really hasn't like it's it was a week, two weeks ago. um because it was a thing with his grandma so like you wanted to wait so I was like okay that's that's fine like cuz I I don't I don't. I don't i'm. gonna go Oh, I know i'm all caught knows my friends welcome back later i'm. Saying."
705.0,Provider,"you're talking about your boyfriend and being confused and that he says one thing, but then."
16187.0,Patient,"He says one thing and then you also know the and then like I was like okay well. Like it was the week of thanksgiving he said he wonders skip that week to give us grow my chance because. I don't know what it's like to live in a while I know what it's like to live in a toxic household where I don't know what it's like to live in the closet because i've been i've been out as bisexual or lesbian, since I was 12 years old, so i've never had to live in the class. he's like whoa and then i'll come see December 1 December 1 comes around and he doesn't come so I give them another week i'm like Okay, maybe just. Having issues and but it's also hard cuz he doesn't like I was like whoa whether you want a Platonic relationship with me or. magic one, I would like to know inside your head or like to anyway ads like he helped you in his again don't need your help okay. But like i'm i'm going to fix it type of person, so I like where you will want to worry about myself. And so it's very hard, because I feel like we're at this point where like we're talking to each other, but. it's not some central it's not like there's something bugging him and I, and I know this is mom cuz mom is in Idaho right now, and he actually shared with me, but whether it was intentional or not, but he was like. My I miss my mom because she was the only person that Karen and like when I cuz he turned 18 oh here and his dad. Like he didn't he acted like he didn't really care about his birthday, and I was like i'm sorry. That sucks like Oh, but your next birthday i'll be here to make it better, and I know you mentioned mom. Because I can see how close there because I met her, I told her and they really close like he is the current bassist and everything in between and. throw in like she's oh she's also like talking about us in the future, seen that were together, and all this stuff and i'm like, but I just don't I don't. he's there's just things that he does it really bothers me and then I feel like I can't talk to him about it because whenever I bring it up to him, he was like Oh, it was joking. But I don't feel like that's just a cop out. i'd."
705.0,Provider,like to see that you're wanting to move at a different pace than he's wanting to move and it hasn't been at the same level just.
16187.0,Patient,"I just want to know if it's going to my future. But needs to like this weird limbo. uh huh because he was showing me the reason why we like kiss and hug and things like that is that was his way of giving me reassurance, but now he won't see me so it's like there I do something wrong, do you don't want to talk about is my disability for you, oh it's. Like I just want to know, but I feel like I can't talk to him. he's like well with the whole dramatic thing I was like how am I, being erratic when I literally presenting you with the effects that you haven't come see me and almost what. i've been thinking about it and it say anything about my feelings about it, I just told you it's been almost a month."
705.0,Provider,"And that you have a need to see them and it leads to have a conversation about that, I think, without JC that that's healthy you're being an effective communicator. Sometimes, though. Maybe he's not at your level yet feeling comfortable to share and to be really you know, open and honest."
16187.0,Patient,"I get that. So, like when that when he wouldn't you shared with me about his mom and I said, thank you for sharing with me, he was a year ago, so. i'm taking baby steps with that, but. it's, just like the basic they really get the basic level was like oh my God he's done it. And I want to give back to earth, but I don't know how to because I don't want to be toxic and. be like Oh, you have to come see me also I don't want to talk to you for but it's like it's been a month, the same time."
705.0,Provider,"i'm setting a boundary different than then having a threat if people are. Saying like hey if you don't do this, then this is going to happen, but a healthy boundary is hey you know I want to get to know you more i'd like it to be this this month, I mean. What is OK, for you Tracy in a in a building up to a relationship for being in a relationship, what is your expectations, then."
16187.0,Patient,"Oh no I do, because when I was just maddie we literally we met on an APP and then two days later, we made it official and. It was very fast paced insane and I realized that it was very like the stereotypical lesbian relationship where it goes into hyperdrive and I, and I talked to like my other friends and they're like yeah but at the same time it's been a month almost. And when in then my friend or my eggs well she's my she's my friend, more than she is, but she was like well. How like when you first saw him was it back to back or spread out nicely because i've seen him four times and I said, well, I saw him. For the first time and then he came over. Like days later, and then came over the next day and then he skipped today and then he came on Western say the night. And it was randomly say tonight, so I thought. Our relationship, because then the nights like that's like a big thing I thought, so I thought relation, it was kind of more solidified. In a way, like without the title and I actually wrote, something I didn't send it because I feel like I need to like sit on it still. So i'm just about to come in here and let the dog, but if she does. A very good. work. Okay Mike. um so there's that and. Then she was like whoa I guess that's why I get why you expect to see him because you didn't there was no time for you to like miss him or big doors and it wasn't like spread out. And I was like well yeah it's easy to see him because he lives, he lives five minutes away and that's my end that's their problem too, because he he lives, like my. My friend swans, but when he lives and all the way in England and he does in soren doesn't like how he treated me and. Things like that in the he's like he's lucky that you're two miles away with my boyfriend is. 4008 every week I get it, but like I don't know what to say like they're not liking him just all these red flags coming up. And i'm really hoping that is like the holidays and maybe like maybe it'll be better after the holidays, because it's like this month is hard oh me too it's hard and everybody like you said in group was like oh so I have to get wet call shady me."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you know JC to sometimes is setting that healthy boundary where. As you're, taking into consideration the holidays and a person may have things going on, whatever it may be, but taking your feelings and thoughts into consideration also in your you know needs about. hey I need to see this person, I want to get to know them more so after the holiday, you know, do you feel like that would you would be comfortable with setting a healthy boundary of you know, like a timeline hey. i'd like to see you for for at least half an hour, can we make that happen."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah because I would understand it was long distance because long distance like the least spend time with someone on facetime and like it's known that way. Like sometimes i'll just call my best friend so so i'll just call sewing and we'll just spend time together, whether he's watching TV or he's doing some i'm doing some to and it's just like that's what that's what I would understand. it's harder because i've never like had a romantic interest or someone like that they like five minutes away from me before. And they give them my mom has asked like she's heard him on the phone before and she's asked about him and um she's asked about him and i'm like I don't know and like is grandma's boyfriend met me and us so anyone to go see JC and he's never brought it back up again."
705.0,Provider,Ah.
16187.0,Patient,Do you want to meet one of my dogs.
705.0,Provider,yeah sure that.
16187.0,Patient,This is Liam.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, how cute."
16187.0,Patient,Is a little Christmas sweater.
705.0,Provider,"You want to see my cat. yeah i'll see if she doesn't get away hi she's staring at the window it's okay it's okay. She has a heart underneath her goal, this is a heart."
16187.0,Patient,A little tough to.
705.0,Provider,Go back to seeing in the window she's bird hunting.
16187.0,Patient,"my sister, this is my This is my dog he's also always hit low he's mine but my sister's cuz I was 17 when I wanted to adopt him but. I couldn't adopt him as well and wanted him and her name and then he got attached to my sister but he's also very like cuddly and loving my other dog, who is my he say he's not like he's not very in your face like. He can this one is a cuddle and one other one is also on the bed, too, but he is I don't know what he's doing okay how. Are you want to see it here."
705.0,Provider,"Okay um he's he's loving on you he's like okay. You know I think what the to JC is what the relationship you're trying to build something and seeing where that goes, and you know, in the meantime to is doing things to take care of like. How you're doing and I know one of those things you talked about last time was establishing more of a morning routine so doing things where you know you're going to feel good about what that day is looking like for you why maybe your own idle time trying to see what he wants to do."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah I figured that like if I if I get my stuff together that like it'll fall into places just because I don't have anything to do right now, so I guess that's why January is a weird time for me. it's after the holidays like you said it's um it's also my birthday. really odd to me I don't like my birthday very much but i'm is because I just feel like my mom because me and my mom like we have such a weird relationship. And it feels weird because usually this was before coded do what she does every year for birthdays just like she takes us out to them and we get to eat our favorite restaurant and then we get presidents and then it's like back to normal. uh huh it doesn't feel real so like I don't like it a lot of the time because it feels like it was also really hard, because my my mom's. i'm ex husband he his friend passed away on my birthday so every year, you would be, it would be my birthday, but it'll also be the day that he passed away so it wasn't just my birthday, it was always something else. No, and so I felt like I didn't want to be the Center of attention, obviously, but I just wanted. Everybody to. Just pay attention to me for five minutes."
705.0,Provider,"Our birthdays can be you know, one of those times that reflecting and going through that may stir up some old feelings."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah cuz my last birthday, I spent in fighting with my mom because. She didn't want me to move in with her so she got an appointment, this was around this time last year too, which is weird because I feel like i'm in i'm in a deja vu situation because I. I almost feel like i'm in same feelings, the same headspace the same everything just with different people because last Christmas, I also lost a bond with a friend, and I was going through a situation ship again, but with a different person, but if it's the same thing interesting killing. That stage of blue or that system. pattern but."
705.0,Provider,"would be you know repeat pattern JC and, if so, you can you can by being mindful, then you can have an opportunity to change that, if you like. And I know, one of the things you talked about last time was wanting to have a different morning routine did did you have any like."
16187.0,Patient,"I tried with that, but it's hard, because to me my morning teenage to like wash my face, I think it really wash my face. Because I in the bathroom is too far. And it's hard like replicate the bathroom out here, where my bedroom is. So it's hard for me to do that that's why i'm like I need to figure something else out there, like a routine that's why i'm hoping with school, if I can build a routine around school."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly, I want to back up for a moment JC you were talking about so you want to establish where you're washing your face the problem as more of getting to the bathroom is there anything, then, that you can think of, like the creative of what by the bedside."
16187.0,Patient,"Not that I know of because there's like this pairing yield stuff where like they use it for bedridden patients. But that's like not for like. The face and my skin is very sensitive, so I mostly use that for like my hair, a body and whenever I feel like it, because. Who, it is colder it's harder, I could get I could get my charger I wanted to that's also the reason why I haven't died my hostess. I would have like a full blown shower and my hair that's a lot of energy can I can see if I want to do independently I can't sit on my chair. do the same to my hair and diet and process it and then give back in my chair and do it all I can't do it by myself, but yet so it takes a lot of energy to stand there. And then wait for it to develop. la still standing there always."
705.0,Provider,Have you tried any of the like neutrogena products that are just the facial wipes they take off mascara and everything.
16187.0,Patient,uh huh I still I still don't feel things that I do like when I say baby wipes and things like that.
705.0,Provider,yeah now I was so happy wants to neutrogena came out with their like for sensitive skin and it takes. All mascara. Breaking just do a quick. Because it's really good soap and all that into your face and it's just I make a mess I don't know. You make a mess.
16187.0,Patient,"I didn't do if I could make a mess right now. Wait. till yeah we try with that. Oh, I don't know what Oh, but the last year I was so my mom was giving me because she was so in our House. So. She was getting money from that so she was giving me wanting to move into this apartment and I was like I don't really want to move into an apartment and then she got one way, for I don't really we're not we're not not friends, but we're not as close as we were used to be. Because of the shit that we. I mean I didn't mean to cut but."
705.0,Provider,that's before.
16187.0,Patient,"They will because of this crap that we went to while we were living together that I didn't that was very traumatic for her so. Is it wasn't on me, she just couldn't take care of her, she couldn't take care of herself and she couldn't take care of me on top of that, so like our relationships just kind of fizzled and it's it's. we're not not fair but we're not as close as we used to be, but my mom was talking, he was I get if I get if I get JC an apartment we go check on it. Like no i'll just move in with her and i'll take care of her and it's, not the other and then wait cuz. She was going to become my edges as provider, so that we get extra income on top of it was because she had a job to but then she didn't fill out the paperwork in time. Because my mom only gave us three months rent or enough money for three months rent because I told her that's how long the process takes and everything, but then even thought paperwork in time she didn't go get fingerprinted so she never got paid for that. So, then, the financial burden of that fell on her. Her she was like I I literally like it was so depressing and I felt bad because, like. i've been there, I didn't know, but if I didn't know how to take care of myself, I was going to take care of a book. So it's like it was that, too, so like I was with her on my birthday and we did. We didn't really do anything to celebrate because I was fighting with my mom I was like it was so healing from breaking number maddie and didn't really want to do anything special is like. We remember things are soaring like we went to her mom's house to and they didn't even know is my birthday. So I was very strange."
705.0,Provider,"How I be awkward it's like okay. But you know this year JC it's. Maybe time for something. Something maybe different you know people have said before, like break the spell or to if this is how there's usually a pattern of this is how your birthday goes. Is what could you do to mix it up where it's just like you know what maybe i'm going to do a different different on that day."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah it, I mean I just don't know how to do that myself. yeah because I will, if I could I would go and drive places. Good I don't know I have like positive dreams about German and the negative things because I have nightmares you have random nightmares about crashing cars and or or like kids cars that are there late last year mad I crashed my car and then it disappeared."
705.0,Provider,Well there's definitely JC cars that you know you would take training and stuff like that.
16187.0,Patient,"All I have, I have one it's just the fact that it's hard because we're it's on SSI and everything I can't I can't own a car, but how else was it. drive a car, they don't own and then it's that's a sticky situation in itself, and then I would have to I don't know if. I have never been really hooked up the Department of they have but I don't know how much they pay for it, but I don't want to I don't want to ask to get connected to zilberman rehab so i'm serious about it."
705.0,Provider,"You know, and when you're when you're serious about it, it sounds like you've already done your homework, so you know what resources are there. What what's more pressing for you what's priority."
16187.0,Patient,"probably get it Okay, give me, so I can go back to that."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I think that that's something that definitely is connected then also to being more independent, where you're talking about living in an apartment and those kind of things too, so that sounds like a."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no no it's gonna be hard on that today we really starting back at square one. When I was already at. squared 25 and then I lost everything so now, I have to go back to square one, which is scary because. Because like with my disability, you have to keep working on it, or else you're going to lose it and I was in environments where I had no choice but to. To keep doing what I was doing in Los abilities along the way, but that's why my my first priority is it driving right now, because I know I have to. I have to get tested again for epilepsy or I mean seizures because I have a history of seizures have to get my vision tested because I should be wearing glasses, right now, but I don't know where my glasses are so I glasses in probably a good year so."
705.0,Provider,"What action step can you do today, see until we meet again to to explore that a little bit more about getting a caregiver."
16187.0,Patient,"A I have no idea because I tried looking on different like care.com but. karen.com is something stupid, you have to pay to talk to people. Like you can post on there you have to pay to message them and all that stuff."
705.0,Provider,Regional Center do they have any type of forum like care.com.
16187.0,Patient,"And they have one like i've used it before but that's that's like they they call the they called PAC it's for the different counties, they have the county registry, but that's how I keep getting like they come they come out they see me in and like do they act or. They have to positive about it, and then, when they see me it's a different story, but i'm like i'm still the same person that was on the phone. As I have in my mom like interview them and. They just don't like a they give you a list of like either five or seven people and, like you call them and so i've gotten probably like five lists. awkward and like it's not and I told my I don't know if you want I don't know if you would want to talk to my regional Center worker whatever, but you can but I told her that i've used it and it's not been successful because. i've ever had 2025 names, at least. And only five of them came to interview and then. They never showed up."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I think what that JC is is more of than you've explored that and it sounds like then that's not something that maybe you're thinking of exploring anymore. And then see what what then other doors, can you open and being able to see okay care.com, especially if there's a fee to it and that might not be something."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah I know. it's silly Why would you pay $40 a month to message somebody when there's and then people like we could just post it and then P or number but that's able is because a lot of people can't afford 40 bucks a month, just to maybe message one person."
705.0,Provider,"Right right there's no trial basis, they need to do."
16187.0,Patient,"He says no there's no trial, and I was like I was trying and they were like no."
705.0,Provider,it's like charisse in your name if you're gonna have care.com and your name.
16187.0,Patient,Exactly or like maybe have like black Friday sales or.
705.0,Provider,"No, yes, like."
16187.0,Patient,Every message every message is $1 dollars a month.
705.0,Provider,Exactly one time only you get to try us out because we care.
16187.0,Patient,"You don't care much. My grandma when I was younger she had success on that and I met one she's not there. it's funny because i'm still friends with them on Facebook. Because I found them. Because they were I had to be with our carrier, they were they were a couple days lesbian couple and I didn't realize that they were lesbians. And I was like wait a minute. i'm gonna put it to it and that made me really comfortable and how it's been like I was 13 when they want my kick over those 10 years and they have 10 kids and they foster and they live in color I don't know but it's like I was technically one of their first kid. And I still keep in touch with them and. it's pretty cool but it's just kind of sad, it is like how Why is, I know that lifting is a big thing but it's also a minor thing, because as soon as I get to debbie I can help somebody more like this potentially lift myself."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm right and it's getting you there and you've had experience with with good caretakers it's. more like a. Colorado. you're not going to move to Colorado ya.
16187.0,Patient,"know, and I say what they will give them unless they want me to be there again."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I think it would be more of an adult situation is time yeah like hey look. pick it all work on something as a creative team."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah but um that's and then I was like caregivers that like just come in and they're not very like personable. I like it, though there were placement, because they there was an incident or CPS was called and I think it was my grandma's explaining because it was anonymous but, like you could tell it was hard. And so. They had to be fired and then my grandma found their replacement and she didn't really talk to me, she just sat there, while I did my own thing. And I tried to talk to you too, but it was she was just very quiet reserved and then one day she just came in to mccomas because at the time as a minor still so she i'm a grandma sign off on a time she never showed up again."
705.0,Provider,Do you full control then Tracy with your regional Center worker to be like you know what other resources are available.
16187.0,Patient,"yeah it's just the point that she's ready may put my know and she's. Like I know that it's in the works, I know it's just like getting antsy. i'm not tired of what like i'm tired of doing this."
705.0,Provider,"Well then, you know already that the stronger, you are then you're going to be able to do even more things, and you know, and so this is just that waiting period where it's like. Oh."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah like em anxious because I want to get the labs done for bright heart, and I want to do all these things that I can't because my mom she's she's I think she's trying to find a remote position."
705.0,Provider,or.
16187.0,Patient,"A lawyer so like she could there's a lot of that she can do. But it's just the right fit for her I guess she said that she had an interview, the other day, and it went well and like dude that, given her a lot more than her job is right now, because I think her job like when he moved here from when we say county. Like it was a lot more money, but she didn't take into account how expensive la county can be."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that is definitely a factor, what do you think JC about I know we're meeting twice a month, and this would be the second one this month, what do you think about scheduling early January for the next one. Okay, is that okay with you. um should I look at again a Wednesday."
16187.0,Patient,um it doesn't matter.
705.0,Provider,"Well, I don't have. The January 5 is the first week. You want to shoot for the same time, the two o'clock. I have all been go ahead, there."
16187.0,Patient,"yeah it was I like a usually are not the temperature joint therapy groups. But I forced myself to do it because, like I said I wanted to keep faces and I wanted to have something to look forward to every week. Like I. Like I know I find myself getting like to want to want to hear from Jeff or to hear from Emily or to hear from. Whoever. So funny like like wow of letting yourself to do something."
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad that you're seeing the benefits JC and it's nice to know that we're all you know we all need support, we all."
16187.0,Patient,Know like different ages.

16187.0,Patient,"all men and this one, I want to be in what I want to ask you like to be involved more somehow."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you know just see what I could do is put in an increase, for we have different groups, and so one of the things like someone else I work with has pains, and I know you've mentioned that before. Do you want me to see if they could set up a pain consult for you, and then you would go, not only to the group that you go and now, but also the pain management group."
16187.0,Patient,"huh good I liked having a pain management doctor, on top of like my primary doctor. was like he he I missed I missed them actually that's the only downside of moving from La county riverside county I mean that the reverse of what I said. Because I was connected to loma Linda and that's one of the most reputable hospitals and California and I really like my doctor because he talked me like I was a patient not like like just blatantly saying that we like this, so."
