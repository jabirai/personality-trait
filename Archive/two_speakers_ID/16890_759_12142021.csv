To attack it as making new memories for the kids so special memories for the kids and you know, like sometimes you know, all we can do is just focusing. on making them happy right, you know for the holidays and then also just given ourselves from grace and some. A lot of self care, you know, especially the holidays, can be a trigger for some memories, or maybe some unpleasant experiences that maybe that we had from before we're family. So just you know I think this focusing on their happiness can be a little bit of a relief, you know terms of how to approach the holiday season. What some of the do you want to talk about some indie unpleasant experiences around the holidays, you know or. Do you know what that be."

Though yeah the whole the whole two weeks of Christmas were just as bad as it could be. in first place we tried to at least be together, even though we were all grieving because of my dad suicide. And we tried okay let's just make a nice Christmas together, but then this came and we had to uninvite both of my sisters and their families, and we didn't see them, they just dropped food out of our House. You know, and like that stuff from the pharmacy for us. They just dropped it outside and we. couldn't see them and yeah that's pretty miserable without my dad without the cat and yeah so.

759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,And yeah the last one I have together with him was one of the best Christmases in my life. Before the pandemic started. Literally that Christmas before and I we had really good time nobody knew about I mean they were like rare cases of corona and the world and. yeah nobody saw what was one shit we would all end up with them. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah so it's it's hard, around this time not having your dad."
16890.0,Patient,"I just look at his picture and still find myself shaking my head when I just looked at him I just shake my head like how could you do this to us, but I understand him now. mm hmm I was so. devastated myself. That I just couldn't see the big picture anymore. yeah and luckily the the medication now helps me like realize, you know I had this tunnel view."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"That like I couldn't even think anymore of like what i'm doing to my family by doing this because I was the victim myself, you know. yeah but I in that moment I just couldn't. There was all like. Gone you know, I was just in the US."
759.0,Provider,yeah we felt a lot of pain right.
16890.0,Patient,"Now. So now, I think, like. The the good outcome of it is. I understand my dad better now. Because I always blamed him I was sorry for him, but more I blamed him. For leaving us. Now I see how desperate, he must have been to actually carry that out. But I just missed him every day. Now."
759.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard to you know, think about you know him in retrospect now and how much you miss them and and how much you know you're still very much grieving his loss."

759.0,Provider,mm hmm.

759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah yeah I know it's hard to be away from your your family be away from Germany, be here in the States and it sounds like you want to go home."
16890.0,Patient,"yeah so. There is a plan of going maybe end of January, but we still need to figure this out with my material school. OK, so my my husband is now in the talk with the with them, because I just. can't do this myself anymore so. Was big drama because they promised, we could do it, and now they said no, you know that was the whole trigger when the day that I tried to commit suicide like I was just so desperate I like when can I go home again, you know. yeah. yeah."
759.0,Provider,So just wondering were you when you can go home and spend time with your family that seems to be a priority for you.
16890.0,Patient,"that's the big thing for me, a big quality of life thing that I can do my walks there and the surroundings are different up many not too many cars and. fresh air and Nice landscape and all my family and. yeah traditions."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16890.0,Patient,"snow I missed the snow here. Now yeah I must know per imma imma season person, you know I like snow. yeah in the summer in the winter summer."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you big seasons. person yeah. So you know when you're back at home, you feel like I peace, it sounds like a little bit serenity me you're back home."
16890.0,Patient,"All my pain is gone there. Oh wow and whenever and it's been going on for years, you know, and then, when because I usually go for like six weeks, maybe. When the third week starts i'm already thinking about oh my gosh it's. Half is already over. You know now. it's like getting less time here and i'm yeah worry about coming back here so. yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah have we thought about moving back there is that it's definitely possible for you and your family.
16890.0,Patient,"We are, but my husband he opened a dental practice just two years ago. To get this running and at some point, he said, we will move, but. i'm. Just for right now it's not an option."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"In the future, but yeah I mean I told many times like yeah I mean. I we young now you know who knows what's gonna happen."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16890.0,Patient,"In the future, who knows who's going to be still around he's going to be dead. it's i'm just worried, you know my dad already like passed away now so i'm always worried like who's going to be next."
759.0,Provider,"In terms of your family what how far in the future, do you think that might happen."
16890.0,Patient,He said there's a five year plan when he opened the practice.
759.0,Provider,"Oh, but."
16890.0,Patient,"Years ago, however. You know. I sometimes just trust him in the way that maybe he just wants me to be a piece, and just to figure says some numbers. On the other side, he said himself look it's hard to predict, because you know it's a business that's growing but. yeah. I mean here, I am very grateful for him that he you know he wants to make sure we have like a good life, and then we have enough for when we get older and that's definitely something that needs to be done so that i'm here, trying to be selfish here i'm just. thinking. yeah shouldn't the whole family be happy. Like happiness, is more than money right but. Without money it's not good either so."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. So there's like a catch 22 like I. wanna you know by be in Germany with my family, but at the same time, you know, like in order to provide for my family to provider the household needs to work, his business here in the states, you know until I can finally get there."
16890.0,Patient,"So for me it's fine to be here, as long as I get those like visits there."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"And that has worked fine in the past, now with material being at school, like first grade and now it's not online anymore, because of yeah. No problem you know, and I was actually. yeah almost you can say, like the good thing in the bad misery that we could do that and go there."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,spend more time after my dad's passing so my mom wasn't alone.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"We almost started like yeah if it doesn't work out, we can pick a different school or do like some homeschooling. mm hmm but that I figured like he really needs, like other kids around him so yeah. yeah that's i've stepped back a little bit from organizing this and let my husband do it. yeah it's. Too much for me it gets dry so. yeah so I just let him figure it out. yeah hopefully we can go and yeah."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
16890.0,Patient,"Good so I just want them to experience the culture, there too, and my. they're bilingual and whenever they go there, I mean. From my tail he when he's not there for a long time has German like deteriorates a little bit you know and then he goes in and it picks up really well against he's really good in both languages so he really also needs these visits there."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"it's good for his development, I think. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully this get figured out, but if it's school that she hasn't gotten January and continue to figure out, you know ways that she can go, you know, while he's in school and still happen, make up for school. yeah and you know, I think, giving yourself a break from planning, this is a good idea, because it makes you anxious, you know, because you want to get home, you know, at the end of the day, you know, having your husband like work it out with the school I think that's a good way. To do it for right now."
16890.0,Patient,"On the other side I you know I told you last time that my work. Also, like they want to get everybody back sooner."
759.0,Provider,Oh yeah that's right you're flying. To India yeah.
16890.0,Patient,"I kept checking my emails only twice a week because. it's much harder to you know. So so far I haven't heard from them because it's still really not able to do this job, right now, you know i'm just overstressed with them. So."
759.0,Provider,Would you be able to do with the with the kids. hmm would you still be able to do with the kids.
16890.0,Patient,"I would, I did when I was young, so, and then I had like a break, because I had our second son and they got the paternity leave."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"And then the daughter so and then the pandemic, you know, we had to take long term so. I would still be able to do it i'm just a bit over Well now, with this out of the blue, like oh yeah you guys have to come back sooner, I was still like planning like black next year and fall, you know."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"So I had a talk with them and told them about my situation and they said oh yeah so when you actually get your personal callback was more like a generic email first. So when they actually address you, because they go, step by step, maybe Alphabetically I don't know how they do it actually look."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"Now, the only crown is happening so maybe that pushes it back a little bit anyway."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I see how I do, but have right now I couldn't I couldn't do this job so."
759.0,Provider,"yeah just about everything you know. mm hmm. So I think you have a good plan, if you know there to tell you, like say we get the email tomorrow, you know let's come up with a good concrete way of thinking about it put into perspective. You know, like say they called you back in you know tomorrow what would you what would be your response."
16890.0,Patient,That I can't. The moment.
759.0,Provider,yeah at the moment.
16890.0,Patient,"yeah they offered to. Take long term sickness, because they. know about this."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"They would probably like a doctor's note, or something. which you can get yeah if it's like in a few months, it might be different, you know, but I mean i'm already feeling better than at the very beginning."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"When it all started, but just thinking about the stress so yeah."
759.0,Provider,The stress of going back to work.
16890.0,Patient,"yeah. it's like I have a long commute you know, I have to fly to London. And then now with the covert you have to like test everywhere and. So now, at least I got my daughter into preschool. Because that's what I was thinking she wasn't even in preschool you know i've had plenty later. Now I feel like she needs to be adjusted to. preschool a new system before I get this call you know, like so I don't have to do this, like oh now you do this, and so I get her used to it and. But yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Still, is it provoking right."
16890.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah well, it sounds like you're coming up with a plan you know, like in terms of if they do call me back right away, I will let them know like I knew long term disability."
16890.0,Patient,"You know, for a while."
759.0,Provider,"And then you also contemplating both be like to actually go back to work, but it's the stress of the commute of being in London. And that you want to get your daughter, you know well justin to preschool you know so at least you're thinking about in terms of what you what your steps can be you know."

Like right now it's not even just the Community, I mean that can be done, but i'm just thinking of being on the plane, you know you have to look after like lots of things that's the stress i'm freaking out about you're responsible for 300 people. mm hmm and when you're not mentally yourself, you know you they're like emergencies, you know medical emergencies and. If you're just I just want to be like responsible, you know and reliable."

759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"So, like being distracted or something so that's. yeah. that's a worry that's one of the worries."

Giving yourself some time, I think you know you have you know you want to go back, maybe next fall and that'll be plenty enough time to work on your mental health, you know get you back to feeling like yourself a little bit more, I think that would be good for you."
16890.0,Patient,How do I. get to feel myself. I mean i'm.
759.0,Provider,"Step by step, you know, like you're doing what you're doing right now, which is therapy you're talking about your issues and your you know processing through done and. By doing the work outside of therapy and contain take your medication and doing things for your your wellness I think that's how you prepare yourself, you know, to get to have you know betterment to have. When you do those things for yourself. yeah it's a lot, especially with the grief and what you just went through with fear 10 you know, like it's it's a lot. And you're starting to you know feel better you know not back to yourself, but better, which is nice to hear."
16890.0,Patient,it's not the deep dark thoughts anymore.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"which were lingering for a while, for you know. yeah and I kept telling my husband. But my guess you don't get taken seriously, or you know."
759.0,Provider,You don't get taken seriously with your husband sometimes.
16890.0,Patient,Now he's really alert you know.
759.0,Provider,That because of what happened.
16890.0,Patient,"yeah but before that, I mean I told him about my suicidal thoughts."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"And he I think he. thought that, because my dad that he know that gave me the idea that i'm not really a person that would do it."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"or tell. I mean, what do you do with a person that says studying I mean my dad made indications and I didn't take it seriously and look. Well, I wish I had. I had paid like attention, and you know I wish my alarm bells would have run and I didn't like I thought he's like i'm joking, but I thought he's like being theoretical."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"That was a six months before he did it and I, if I had like responded to that you know, maybe you would still be alive so."
759.0,Provider,"it's hard to see, especially if you're not and mental health professional it's hard to kind of like gauge, you know how much of. You know, like when a person is saying to you in regards to their mental hall fergus you know being suicidal it's hard to kind of like. You know, say, like Okay, you know this person needs help, how can I help this person and sometimes it goes over the loved ones had because they don't know what to do, or what to say. You know, so I don't want you to blame yourself, you know, like it's it's hard to kind of know what to do in those moments, you know those critical moments."
16890.0,Patient,"Now. yeah it's just in hindsight, you know, like. He told me. where he would do it, and he was worried it. My sister's took him to the hospital before. Two days before. And they sent him home. And said oh you're. Still wearing Nike shoes like it can be that bad."
759.0,Provider,um yeah.
16890.0,Patient,"He didn't say anything about the suicidal thoughts to them, you know. I wish, he had, because then they would have probably like locked him up there for a while, you know."
759.0,Provider,"Well, sounds like you guys did the best that you could in the moment you know."
16890.0,Patient,we've discussed this so many times. yeah and it's like in a circle.
759.0,Provider,The circle.
16890.0,Patient,"You run in a circle and we say the same thing again and again and make ourselves believe that we couldn't do more than we did and. it's not our fault, but then you wake up and you think this again. That it's your fault or that you could have done something and then you meet again with them and we talk it's a yeah it's not your guys's fault, you know because they were blaming themselves my sister's it's like no it's not your fault, you try to help him. They in the hospital sent him home. We weren't even at a lawyer, trying to sue them but. The lawyer said, you know. They will it's really unfortunate what happened, and he was really sorry for us, but that will not be a case you know. And we finished week yeah we're not thinking about this anymore, we drew the line there."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16890.0,Patient,"It was just something that was a big issue in the family, you know. And the. yeah will never be. yeah it will always be the park I guess so."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,Sometimes it's better sometimes it's worse. Now.
759.0,Provider,"What do you wish, you would have done. could have."
16890.0,Patient,"told me. told us that he is suicidal. And, but make it sound like. i'm miss understandable, you know, like. I mean we were watching TV, you know we were talking about, because his brother did this thing you know he hanged himself. And then we were just theoretically talking about it, I don't even know how we came up with that and then he said Oh, he said to me, I will never forgive my brother what he did to the family, by doing this."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"And then, he said, like it almost in the same sense I would do it in our woods, you know, and I said come on like get a grip on yourself don't talk stuff like that. mm hmm I have taken him seriously and then you know what six months later he did tell me, he would not he could never forgive his own brother So how should I forgive him now I mean I have forgiven him but. Just a family threat, you know. So. What I wish I wish we could wipe the past and relive it. But this is impossible. yeah now we have to just live with it till the end of our lives so. Trying to make a nice life for my mom. I mean, she lost her husband to a terrible thing. he's alone in the House now. Now. yeah that's not Nice. Life."
759.0,Provider,mom traveled to come visit you sometimes.
16890.0,Patient,"She has she's been here in the spring, for three months, and she was about to come here, but then her surgery needed to happen. They cut out a big part of her intestines which she should have done way earlier she left it to the last moment, where the intestines almost broke through."
759.0,Provider,Oh no.
16890.0,Patient,"And I kept telling her mom do this. don't wait, you know my sister's told her. That she's one of those people, she just postpones doctor visits to the last thing you know and. In contrast to my dad he saw Dr like 10 times a week because he thought he had all kinds of diseases and he didn't have anything. that's how he, like he's he was a hypochondriac."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16890.0,Patient,"Now yeah, so I hope to get her out here again, but right now she's still has to like you. yeah um and then with the new ryan's. yeah that worries me too."
759.0,Provider,yeah defer to travel.
