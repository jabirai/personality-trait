So what i'd like to do is just i'm going to basically go over the surveys that. You already filled out in terms of mood, as well as eating disorder behavior and then I will give you my thoughts, at the end in terms of recommendations, but are there any questions or concerns before we get started."

107.0,Provider,"Okay perfect all right okay so you've been seeing your current counselor for about a year and did you, you had maybe a session or something when you were younger it sounds like, but that was. Okay Okay, and how has that been going do you feel like it's been helping."

107.0,Provider,"Okay, how often have you seen your your therapist."
15700.0,Patient,"um I haven't seen her recently, maybe like a month or two, but this year, every week once a week."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Is there a reason why it changed because it wasn't really helping or."
15700.0,Patient,"um because I felt like it wasn't helping and I kind of just wanted to do the treatment Center thing first and then go with her. Okay, and see if, like my thoughts have changed on it."
107.0,Provider,"So, in looking at them mood surveys, do you score 17 on the pH Q nine i'm sorry yeah on the pH nine and 12 on the gods seven so that means that you are scoring moderate to severe and depression and moderate in anxiety does that. It looks like that resonates certainly with how you respond it in terms of dealing with mood on one of the other surveys that kind of resonate with you in terms of how it feels to you, dealing with the feelings of sadness and anxiety."
15700.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,Do you have any coping skills or anything that. You use to help you deal with those.
15700.0,Patient,Feelings i'm. going to walk I crochet which sounds kind of like a grandma.
107.0,Provider,"hey. it's there it's cooler if. These days, I hear all the kids are doing it."
15700.0,Patient,"yeah I read a lot. Okay, so that's kinda like a escape way."
107.0,Provider,So those behaviors kind of give you an opportunity to have a different shift in mood do you feel a little differently after you've engaged in them.
15700.0,Patient,yeah. So the short period of time.
107.0,Provider,"Do you sometimes have to kind of hit it with one thing after another, so maybe you do something for a little bit, then you got to pivot and do something else and pivot and do something else until you kind of have a different shift. Have you tried okay all right good perfect. So a year ago to today would you sell you that managing your mood has become easier better about the same."
15700.0,Patient,easier and better.
107.0,Provider,"and look like there's something else in there, maybe. Anything else for the better. and better okay all right. Just checking no you're fine. Have you taken any medication for any of this. yeah okay."
15700.0,Patient,um I haven't liked any of them.
107.0,Provider,"mm hmm they all feel super strange. Are you taking anything now. No Okay, and I did not see a list of meds did you write down what you've taken in the past. Do you remember doing that somewhere."
15700.0,Patient,there's there's a whole list.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I don't want you to feel like you have to regurgitate it right now i'm just going to scroll up here real quick and see if I can see it. somewhere else, so you don't have to regurgitate and actually your insurance companies should have all of that i'm assuming so. What was the most recent one need to. know just."
15700.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well. Well, via train."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
15700.0,Patient,there's so many.
107.0,Provider,"I know there are a few there are definitely a few options so out of all the different methods that you took did you find any of them a little bit helpful or none of them were helpful, or maybe they started out. On helpful and then they were they you kinda."
15700.0,Patient,"um. one. Was it wasn't, the most recent but it's the second most recent one. Okay, it makes you angry, but it made me angry, but."
107.0,Provider,"Do you remember, which one that was."
15700.0,Patient,"No, I don't remember."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, have you heard of a medicine called vibrated."
15700.0,Patient,"No, I heard of it yeah."
107.0,Provider,"So it's supposed to be. Like the wonder can medicine for people who are MED resistant when it comes to mood. And I don't know if there's an age protocol, if you need to be a certain age or kind of past hormonal changes before you would take it, but you might want to look into that. and see if that's, something that would be an option for peyton just as an fyi it's not the cheapest medication on the planet, but I have, I know people who are who. with everything else, nothing else worked and then this did. Yes, take a little bit to get going, but just."
15700.0,Patient,fyi okay.
107.0,Provider,"And i'm sorry, of course, my dogs have been quiet until right now."
15700.0,Patient,"Now yeah. And, and they have two kids so i'm just waiting for them."
107.0,Provider,"All right, if there's a loud. Noise, I will try and move very quickly, but they may beat me to it so. Okay, all right well so that's definitely something you want to continue to manage, for obvious reasons, have you ever had any thoughts over pretty yourself or a view of actually hurt yourself payton. yeah okay so."
15700.0,Patient,"i've been having suicidal thoughts, more recently, like in the five month range and then I had an overdose a year ago."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and. So any other incident prior to the year or after the year does that sound like after a bit."
15700.0,Patient,And before the overdose man thoughts have never done anything.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you had passed the thoughts have you had any kind of plans or serious ideation. In the last five minutes. No Okay, and have you ever actually engaged in any self harm behavior cutting burning any kind of infliction of pain. No okay right okay. yeah, I think, based on the fact that you've had a past history and have it have, would you identify the overdoses and attempt or do identify the overdose as a coincidence."
15700.0,Patient,It was an attempt.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so I would definitely look into the vibrant and just check it out just because there really is something to. It is a miracle that most of us don't need medicine for some of us don't need medicine, because chemistry is so unique. In our systems that it really does, especially in our you know hormonal teenage time periods they're just ebbs and wanes and things like that and. The vibrant just kind of takes the edge off I should sound like a pharmacy REP but. It just is something to look into and I have found it be very helpful for people who have really struggled with these thoughts so again I don't know the protocols i'm not a medical provider, but just want to."
15700.0,Patient,Lead you to you too. you're gonna talk to her i'm gonna go.
107.0,Provider,Do the dinner awesome Thank you.
15700.0,Patient,"So i'm about the self harm thing. Multiple times before. Okay, I. couldn't say that in front of her, she doesn't."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so it worked out, we had sibling intervention so. We could get the reality of the situation. yeah okay so cutting burning all of the above."
15700.0,Patient,i'm cutting in burning.
107.0,Provider,Anything else. Okay. places that aren't readily seen i'm assuming yeah okay anything where you've kind of gotten to a place where you're like whoa Maybe I should get some urgent care helper.
15700.0,Patient,"No, I haven't much. deeper."
107.0,Provider,"So what drives us to do that behavior is that it's an adrenaline rush, and if you boost lateral chemical boost so that you feel a little bit better about things, and when you're feeling like real crap and everything feels like. Life just socks there's something there's something chemical that happens with that that it's really hard to argue don't do it. But, again, I would want you to do your own research on this medicine vibrated because again i've had patients who have had exactly your history, who have found it to be helpful. And the reason why wouldn't want you to continue that behavior is that you think you have it under control and you do need to actually urgent care something does happen right plus their scars and. All kinds of reasons for why we want you to do it, but i'm not here to judge it other than I get it, I totally understand why you would want to go there, especially if you're not feeling good. It is a release I get that so let's find other ways to do it is there anything else you can do it's not going to have the same delivery system. As that behavior because that behavior is a very specific kind of delivery system, but is there something else you can do when you're really having a temptation to engage in that behavior."
15700.0,Patient,"I usually just take melatonin and go to bed, as it doesn't really go away."
107.0,Provider,"When you wake up, do you feel better."
15700.0,Patient,yeah okay.
107.0,Provider,Well that's good and how often do you do this.
15700.0,Patient,I haven't done it in a couple weeks. I wanted everything to heal before I was sent to a facility okay.
107.0,Provider,"All right, hold on vader. Okay. And how long, would you save in doing the the behaviors themselves."
15700.0,Patient,"Two years. Okay, nothing to where it's super noticeable."
107.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that is part of the gig okay all right well you're probably getting ready for Jones thing of one of said activity again i'm not trying to help you find something else on the line. My gosh these docs This is ridiculous down the line, maybe become a little bit of an adrenaline junkie and you need to learn how to skydive or do something else it's pretty. Big and intense, but you can do it safely you'll do it with the right equipment and that'll give you a way to kind of have that adrenaline push. Without the other stuff so maybe you start looking into things like that that are safe thing I can do now, even if you end up going into treatment or what you end up doing it's just good to know that you have a different way to manage that outward."
15700.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Good anything else, we need to talk about before mom comes back in the room."
15700.0,Patient,"If you asked about me serving up i'm going to say when she's in here that I haven't done it in like a month, but I did it a couple days ago."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's don't feel like you need to keep any kind of order tell me, everything that you don't want mom to know so that I know I have it capture because that kind of information is important for me to gather for us to have good."
15700.0,Patient,um I took laxatives.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, how often how much."
15700.0,Patient,Daily I take little pills 10 of them at a time.
107.0,Provider,Throughout the day or just once a day.
15700.0,Patient,or at night. So that can.
107.0,Provider,Are you taking like duplex or something like that the generic.
15700.0,Patient,I take this off brand pose and then I take near lax to.
107.0,Provider,Okay.
15700.0,Patient,I. don't know I think that's it.
107.0,Provider,"So, in terms of the purging how often you said a couple of days ago, how often do you typically. Do it."
15700.0,Patient,i'm usually four times a week.
107.0,Provider,and yeah go ahead.
15700.0,Patient,"Maybe probably last I would say, like two times a week and then bingeing is a good chunk of the week."
107.0,Provider,Like every day or.
15700.0,Patient,"No, because it it kind of depends on the week, as sometimes i'll start, but then some days i'll binge every day so. I didn't really give me one."
107.0,Provider,that's okay. What about laxatives to use laxatives.
15700.0,Patient,yeah i'm daily.
107.0,Provider,"And what about teas or anything else, like that too."
15700.0,Patient,"yeah there is one that I take. hasn't really worked well, I don't think but that's usually like three times a week."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so you kind of cycle in and out of either restricting. or starving and then bingeing. yeah so what would you say the longest period of time, is that you go without eating."
15700.0,Patient,Four days.
107.0,Provider,And then you'll binge.
15700.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"I mean that makes sense you're starving. Okay, and then after binge to purge."
15700.0,Patient,i'm.
107.0,Provider,"Not every time, maybe."
15700.0,Patient,Not every time.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and then. Do you do any kind of exercise that in see that on here but. No okay. And let's see. Do you ever chew and spit out your food. yeah okay how often would you say you do that."
15700.0,Patient,um maybe like. Not not many.
107.0,Provider,Like once or twice a week once or.
15700.0,Patient,"Twice a month yeah I would say once or twice. once or twice, like every two weeks, like. yeah it's not it's not very often."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. And then, in terms of are there foods that you avoid or won't eat."
15700.0,Patient,"bread potatoes. Cereal. pizza. I don't really like. eggs. and Certain fruits that are higher salaries, like bananas."
107.0,Provider,"And, are there any foods that you like to binge on or that you typically find yourself bingeing on."
15700.0,Patient,All. not really just kind of whatever I see.
107.0,Provider,Okay.
15700.0,Patient,yeah not really.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, give me kind of an example of a recent binge."
15700.0,Patient,"um I had. Typically, when I binge its food that I try to stay away from like when I am starving, like the food. That I stay away from what i'm starving, or what I gave you but you're just been job in john those. yeah like hi i'm calories. And if we have like cookies and they'll eat like a crap ton of those and. Just like anything that'll give me comfort. Like. I think, four days ago I binge and I had like grilled cheese, or just like even tortillas and cereal and eight until I am I can tell, I couldn't. So it was there's a lot of things that I don't really remember. And I was mad."
107.0,Provider,When do you typically binge or when did you bench at this time.
15700.0,Patient,At night.
107.0,Provider,Like when everybody's asleep.
15700.0,Patient,Nobody yeah like 12 o'clock one. Just like really late.
107.0,Provider,And when did you start taking the laxatives and diuretics and all that kind of stuff.
15700.0,Patient,um I started that when I was in like fifth grade so four years ago.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and was that something that you read about heard about from a friend somebody else's doing."
15700.0,Patient,"My step dad told me that I should, and he was already like really big on what I ate so. Much."
107.0,Provider,attention to what you were eating and then he told you what to.
15700.0,Patient,Do to lose weight yeah.
107.0,Provider,What did he struggle with weight or struggle with that behavior.
15700.0,Patient,"No, I was not do."
107.0,Provider,Have issues with weight or with food.
15700.0,Patient,I don't. really know we never connected like that.
107.0,Provider,Is he still around.
15700.0,Patient,um yeah he would tell me I shouldn't eat dinner or that I should skip breakfast and. That was like a big toll and I think that's where my eating disorder started.
107.0,Provider,With the.
15700.0,Patient,"I couldn't bend journey thing cuz he would. you'd have cameras in the kitchen so now, you could tell when I."
107.0,Provider,When when when do you remember him starting to put cameras on and do that behavior.
15700.0,Patient,"So in in fifth grade about the time they said that I should start taking laxatives news before softball practice and I couldn't fit in my pants anymore. and You are constantly say that I was big or. That I shouldn't be eating that are like I was young, I was in like fourth grade and I didn't think much about it at the time, but he would say that I shouldn't go back for a second or the third like. i've already had too much, and I didn't really think anything of it then because, why would I. that's kind of where it all started. And doesn't know anything about that."
107.0,Provider,"So when did you start entertaining the idea of going to treatment sounds like you're pretty gung Ho about it, or at least very open to it."
15700.0,Patient,"i'm very open to it, I. um lately, I was. Just like a couple months ago I was really, really sad and. I don't know about the eating disorder treatment Center place. That was my mom's idea. She doesn't want me going back to a hospital setting but."
107.0,Provider,Were you in a hospital setting when you did the overdose or years.
15700.0,Patient,"I was there for a couple days and. It wasn't really a planned. thing it was like the first place, I could get in so there wasn't any like research about how good it was. like that, so I think that's why she doesn't want me going back because it wasn't the best place. But if i'm would want to go somewhere where it's just focused on eating disorders, because I like. I know it's not all going to be really skinny people, but if i'm in a place where there are people thinner than me. Then I have like a really hard time eating because that's one of my main triggers and. I just don't know if that would be the healthiest thing for me."
107.0,Provider,"Well let's talk about that a little bit, but before we do that, I have a couple of kind of technical questions for you, so when you get up really quickly, do you ever feel like you get lightheaded."
15700.0,Patient,yeah and then it'll my vision will be like blurry.
107.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Does that happen, a lot. or once a day."
15700.0,Patient,really only when I don't be. A dummy.
107.0,Provider,So it sounds like if you are restricting do kind of restrict half the week and then Ben chapter week is that it kind of typical pattern for you or is that.
15700.0,Patient,lesson it's usually often on as. Binge and then i'll feel really bad about it and then i'll start and then i'll get so hungry that I have to eat.
107.0,Provider,"Today you kind of go back and forth a little bit between those behaviors or do you ever have days, where you just kind of have a more quote unquote normal eating day."
15700.0,Patient,"I never really have a normal eating day. Some days i'll. Have like a star and. eat. Like a meal, maybe, but I don't usually count that it's like a starving day. Like i'll just eat one meal."
107.0,Provider,"How tall, are you."
15700.0,Patient,i'm 5859.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Do you do you know your last week."
15700.0,Patient,"i'm not allowed to look at them, but. one. So most recent I think was a couple months ago, and that was 175."
107.0,Provider,"Just to make this note, because this part I can transcribe. Okay, so. In terms of behaviors and kind of overall I feel like I have a pretty good sense of that who do you currently live with."
15700.0,Patient,My mom and my two siblings.
107.0,Provider,"And are they older younger. younger okay and do any of them exhibit any kind of eating disorder behaviors mom or. No Okay, so you feel like it sounds like it, this kind of really all came onto the radar with your step dad. yeah and how long has he been out of the picture."
15700.0,Patient,"um. Two or three years, I think okay."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's talk about residential treatment. i've. i've run a couple of them, we certainly have our telemedicine Program. Yes, it's kind of a mixed bag as to who is in attendance. Do you want mom to come in, or. Okay. So it's a mixed bag as to who's in attendance, it can be people who restrict it can be people who binge all shapes and sizes and they. They do a really good job of talking about that, so they being you're going to have staff they're hanging around with you all the time you're not going to be allowed to hang out your room. You have to kind of stay in out and about if you need to go the bathroom it's going to be monitored, they are going to be listening, you know they they want to make sure that they're keeping you safe and they're keeping you accountable. They want to expose you to eating in front of others and and dealing with that and it is know that you're going to be, you know typically it's six girls to a house. And the other five are struggling as much, if not more than you are. They hate it nobody likes it because the whole point of this is to keep it secret to keep it quiet to not talk about these things, so all the things you know you need to do, are going to be all the things that need to happen, and the first. couple of weeks are going to just suck because you don't want to you know there's a part of you that's really invested in keeping this going, just like the whole. Cutting and burning thing it feels good there's it has done something for you chemically as well as physically emotionally, this has really served a purpose for you, so the idea of not doing any more is like that's just for the birds, no, thank you. yeah at the same time. If you weren't interested in having something happen and do something different, you and I wouldn't be talking. So obviously recognize that this is no bueno and something needs to change, but you know it's one thing to talk about it's another thing to be like oh yeah let's do this. And so it's understandable, is that you know even kind of having an assessment with a program and talking to them you're going to be kind of like yeah no it's great and then the first day you're gonna be like nope this sucks I don't want to do this or. Heading over there you're going to be like let's do something else, this is a terrible idea forget it. All of that is very normal and to be expected, or maybe you kind of get there and you're like no it's cool and then 10 days and you're like i'm out the sucks I don't want to do this anymore. it's totally understandable and I just would encourage you to hang in there, take lots of deep breaths and let them help you because they all really want the best for you. I definitely think that you meet criteria to go into a residential program and the other thing about residential programs for adolescence, is that you can keep up with schoolwork which some people really care about other people don't but yeah no big deal you don't want to be. Out of school and. Get that up on top of everything else."
15700.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And you can make a point to tell them like I need to stay on top of this, I want to make sure that i'm going to have time to do my schoolwork and the Nice part about. You know, when I was running those programs, it was a while ago as long before telemedicine was really a thing, and so, trying to do, remote work was always kind of a heartache, but we can get it done now, you don't have to it's easy peasy. So I think it's going to be a really good solution for you and, yes, it's going to be hard, but I think it will be ultimately really good for you mentally physically emotionally spiritually all of that. You will need to involve your mom at some point and family, it will probably be a good idea for her to hear. Where this all kind of started and what happened, but when you're ready and with help and it doesn't have to happen right away, but just know that that will come up and it's not her fault. Like."
15700.0,Patient,"The only problem that. yeah she has a good relationship with them still because, like she has to because the boys go over there. I see. I don't wanna like."
107.0,Provider,yeah but it's not it you didn't do any of this. And what if he's being an ass to them and some other weird way.
15700.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And and it's not something that needs to happen right away and and quite some time, like that's something down the line let's get you safe let's get you. The care that you need let's take care of you don't worry about that yet, but just know that at some point, it might come up and it's not the worst idea on the planet."
15700.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So. Do you guys have some residential programs near you that you've kind of looked into, have you talked to."
15700.0,Patient,"I don't know if I would want to go to one here. Okay, is there, someone I know or."
107.0,Provider,"find you want to go somewhere else, and you were like I want to see anyone. Again, so what will happen in terms of this information is i'm going to gather it in the next couple of days, and I will this is called the level of care assessments so we'll. Make sure we have all our i's dotted t's crossed, and then we're going to send it to your insurance company and they will have the recommendation for you to go to a residential treatment care and then. Sorry, technically it's on them to find a place or to give you some resources, but if you do some research on your own I used to work with a program called Center for discovery and they have adolescent programs that was that is and was their specialty so and they have programs all over. So I think it would be a good idea for you to look at them and just kind of do a little research and then you can always let your insurance company know where you would like to go and see if they can make something happened like that for you."
15700.0,Patient,"Okay, and you know, like oh Park, how long it takes for me to get into one."
107.0,Provider,"Oh into one it just a matter of timing so some locations have waitlist and some don't so that would be something to ask the organization, you know. I would say within 30 days, hopefully, you know, maybe even shorter than that, I would like to believe that you get into something within 30 days and then, once you're there, it may be that you're there for a few months."
15700.0,Patient,yeah because it takes a.
107.0,Provider,"lot. That part you're cool with okay. All right, well you're just such an easy pleaser when it comes to this this amazing I love that you're open to it, and I also can see that you have some apprehensions so i'm not feeling like you're delusional does so that's good too. I don't want you to be so excited about this them it'd be like all right now that's weird something's going on here. So. But it's it sounds like you're ready to do something about it, which is fantastic. yeah good for you. yeah so I don't know how long it would take it really just depends on the organization, but my hope is that you could get into. Come on people. You may need to talk to your adjust let's see your case manager for the insurance company my mom's not around so you can tell them straight up. here's some things i'm doing like you guys need to know i'm really struggling here, because that will help your case, so I appreciate us having the time to get some nitty gritty details, because all of that is going to help speak to the fact that you need more support. Anything else you think I need to know about be aware of any other kind of this is gonna sound really crazy and terrible, but any other traumas or horrible things that have happened or anything else that I, maybe need to have some Heads up on just so that we can make note of it."
15700.0,Patient,um.
107.0,Provider,"Okay well so that's that's like one of the worst questions I have to ask because it's just so hideous I don't want. anything to happen to you, and at the same time I would need to know about it, if something has happened to you so. That, again, we can argue for the need for support Okay, in the interim, while you're waiting for the finding out where you can go who can you talk to do you feel like you can kind of talk to your counselor and kind of have a little bit of support."
15700.0,Patient,Time me and her really close.
107.0,Provider,Okay.
15700.0,Patient,"So there'll be times, where i'll like just be so like stressed or upset and i'll just like kind of word vomit to her."
107.0,Provider,OK.
15700.0,Patient,"I will have like. Basically, we talk when I really need it. But then, with counseling it was like weird to have it, some weeks when I didn't when I felt like I didn't need to talk."
107.0,Provider,"I think, given the fact that you're reaching out for a residential treatment Center support means that you need regular support so between now and when you get in you should probably have a weekly meeting, if you can get it."
15700.0,Patient,"yeah there was a thing that really started it was I had a meeting my. psychiatrist and. He kind of pushed it on to me. Because he said that I was getting to where I was like i'm. medically concerning and, at the time, my mom didn't know that I was throwing up and he was like if you don't tell her, then I will have to and. Then, my moms like Well then, I told her and then she got mad at me and which is why I don't really tell her anything else. And then she said I needed to go to a place, and I feel like, if I have a better. About positive outlook on it, rather than going in and hating it. And it might be a lesson."
107.0,Provider,"it's going to be a very different experience than your hospitalization hospitalizations are literally just like an er triage kind of experience, like they're just there to keep you stable or get you stable it doesn't really. involve a lot of treatment or program so wherever you go going to go should be much better than that and nothing against those hospitalization programs they serve a purpose but they're not really programs. Because they're limited in what they can do. yeah and it sounds like you, maybe, would like to have a different experience for your mom is not around, and you can kind of have an opportunity to work through some stuff without mom's influence right there. yeah okay. All right, well, I will do my best to advocate for you and to your insurance company and maybe do some research on Center for discovery or other adolescent programs in your area are kind of around that's the one that I can speak to the best just because I used to work for them and. Any other questions concerns thoughts anything else you think I need to know. Okay. Well, please take care of yourself. is lovely to meet you. yeah good luck and, hopefully, you get into program soon. All right, take care of. So I don't really have anything else to add for that one let's advocate that we get the list of medications hopefully we have that somewhere else, just to kind of have a complete. piece on that, and then we are recommending residential care, I did ask her to look into Center for discovery let's not include that in the notes, but we can say look into a lesson programs just to give her more education on what she's going to be getting into and. she's worth a static. forgot to look at her. BMI well i'll make note of the vm die so just kind of have a little question mark next to that and she binge purchase on a regular basis, she is. Cutting or burning yourself so she's engaging and self harm activities and she does not. feel comfortable talking to her mom about these behaviors and so she really does need to get into a residential treatment program for stabilization, especially since her kite psychiatry is concerned about this medically influencing her and, this being a medical needs. Okay, thank you very much."
