214.0,Provider,hey natalie.
13548.0,Patient,morning.
214.0,Provider,"Good morning, thank you for coming on so early so. I know this has been like a tough road and chantelle had given me some information. So what, what is your objective now I mean yeah it's not being facetious but like it sounds like we have some physical health issues. I know we have some other issues, I get that but, like is the physical health issue primary right now. In believes that, if we can love someone the doctors can figure that out, we can address the other focal point and maybe some of the medications are aren't working that we're prescribing for concentration and not being so fidgety."
13548.0,Patient,"The doctors that that's something else that I take care of but I figured, it was important to also mention because it does have an effect on like. emotional mental because if you don't feel like you're doing okay physically you're not going to feel like you're doing okay mentally so I figured, it was important to bring up. But i'm have my doctors trying to communicate with them, so we can figure out what the heck is wrong. um let's read medications shauntel she's twitch me to Ritalin and it's a really, really low dose so it was just that, to start with, to make sure that that was okay. i'm just trying that went out pretty much for the next two weeks to see but. completely different from adderall um."
214.0,Provider,yeah I.
13548.0,Patient,"didn't do a thing. So i'm just being patient and thinking Okay, you know he tried it once right give it a give it a chance and see how you feel the rest of the week, but. Just yesterday, did not make a dent in my focus, if anything, it felt like I didn't take anything at all, I was just still all over the place. And having a hard time focusing."
214.0,Provider,"Without trying to find an excuse, but trying to find facts. it's also very possible this psychologically right you you're worried. you've got concerns. We don't have answers. And it's possible that the medication may need longer. yeah to get through that so I want to appreciate that you actually are saying so i've got to give it a shot before I roll this out. I see that you know this system doesn't even work for me i'm glad that you're you're you're doing that. When i'm concerned with mostly. Is. You know how, how are we supporting you correctly, how is the program supporting you correctly."
13548.0,Patient,Right mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,What are your thoughts about the support you're receiving.
13548.0,Patient,"feel like this is a good way for me to actually. communicate what i'm feeling, so the program is helping it is helping me communicate and it has helped me to. make an effort and not to you know automatically go to negative um I, I know that I need to give things a chance and to be patient so i've been doing that and the. The program has helped me even to make sure that you know you need to communicate, you need to set boundaries, you need to take care of yourself, because my go to is always to take care of everybody else."
214.0,Provider,"Right okay. Right, so what are you thinking that the frequency is good, should it be less should we have. Like what's the balance like because here's where I think we can run into a stall. So when I look at your last survey your depressions extremely high 17."
13548.0,Patient,Oh.
214.0,Provider,"Now i'm not saying that's like oh my God, what are we going to do what i'm saying is this is definitely situational this is telling me something's being impacted. And I think you have. For when you've experienced and told me, I think you have a positive life, I think the struggles are this focus of the job. I think those are really impactful things, but when we look at 17 and that tells us it's moderate to severe the anxiety I get because of what may be going on with the ADHD. Now let's let's say to ourselves well you know what is that really a good metrics let's go to. let's even go earlier let's go to like the very beginning of November. So 16 1716 so you're treading the same way right now let's look at. let's go before that let's go October let's just see so your numbers are basically 15 1617 you're in that mid teens right. And i'm wondering if that is more worry about what's really going on Is this something like i'm not saying you're catastrophic you never talk that way you actually have a great outlook on things but i'm wondering internally if that's not really what's driving up the depression."
13548.0,Patient,"Okay um. The winter is always a difficult time because that's when my husband's Father passed away so. um I don't know why it was so bad this winter, but it was just as soon as the the cold started is when I started to feel more depressed I guess."
214.0,Provider,"And here's here's a good reflection, this is September. you're an eight. October 15 November 16th December 17 you're actually. Describing. Seasonal adjustment disorder like as the, as it turns from more sunlight and more warmth and it gets colder we we start to feel these depressed moods because of the change of the environment, so you actually described, for one, you can see, you scored an eight. In September. and your anxiety was three now you read if we go to today's chronological surveys these surveys tell us. Today, well not today, when you did this for 17 and seven you've doubled in three months but winter has arrived and we saw the elevation as the change of season, we see the elevation of depression. But um I don't think we're addressing depression oh."
13548.0,Patient,"No, I feel like the reason. The reason I get so depressed is because the. The timeframe. Time times it's different for me, sometimes I can't remember. weeks feel longer months faster, but the when the depression kicks in is sometimes it's depending on on the timeframe. Remembering."
214.0,Provider,"think that that's a discussion, we should have to address, or is the overall discussion really I really need more help on getting myself more focus okay I don't want to say let's like let's let's attack all the areas we need to work on so that's a great strategy. And maybe best to. figure out one stabilize that and then move into another, but the depression is quite high."
13548.0,Patient,Sure okay.
214.0,Provider,"No, but I. I agree, the focus is high, but I also you know i'm here to work with you not work against you and say, well, I think we should. it's not about what I think I think like I need to understand you more and it's always been about If I could just get more focus, just like the manuals right we talked about those manuals and it's like. Okay, like I don't absorb it, you know, and I just can't have my fingertips to it to review it, so I know the focus is high, because I think the energy needed for the job is also a big requirement. We think we need to focus on this right now, but if if these numbers continue in January, we probably should address it, because you know why. The depression is impacting motivation if it impacts motivation, it will impact focus it's almost as if we, why do we even need to focus it'll make it even harder so that's kind of my thought."
13548.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"So I think what we do is let's see what the redland does. Right, we got another two weeks. yeah no, we have two weeks before January and let's see if we find an improvement there. With the rest of this right there's probably going to be another step up. And then the next step up will probably be next week, when you have a discussion with Sean time so listen it's not working or. it's really minimum and she may, so let me bump you up and then in that second week we may see the transition for benefit, and then we can say okay so we've seen some improvements let's stay with us, but let's keep depression. We need to keep the pressure on hold, or we need to be aware that it's very present in that."
