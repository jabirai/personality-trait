15679.0,Patient,i'm good. I thought we had a meeting at three.
10.0,Provider,"yeah they messed up my hours today usually. On this one. There on this third Thursday of the month, I work in the morning, instead of the afternoon, so I made a special exception to be able to see you right now. Because I wanted to check in and see how how you're doing and."
15679.0,Patient,"How I go i'm sorry, you had to make that exception because they gave me disappointment when long time ago."
10.0,Provider,"I know they made a mistake i'm sorry about that, but."
15679.0,Patient,"um no. For me, is no issues. Okay i'm glad you're Okay, I was thinking all kinds of there was an emergency or something. So i'm glad you're okay."
10.0,Provider,i'm good Thank you. How about you.
15679.0,Patient,"I am doing okay I. I think if you recall, the last time we spoke, we made an agreement about. You know, limiting how much I drank to a couple of drinks a day. Right. which you remember, which that included pretty much you know sharing a bottle of wine with my husband over dinner. And i've started that Tommy I think has been 11 days since we spoke Angela Thank you there was only one night. Where I was feeling particularly you know Okay, and my husband came down later before doing and drink and I said, make me just a light vodka soda. And he if he did, and I had that and then we had you know the wine and went upstairs and watch TV and I had to be completely honest with you, I came back downstairs that 11 ready to go to bed and 10 1030 or 11. And I. I made myself another vodka soda not a heavy one but anyway that's my confession. Okay, otherwise."
10.0,Provider,"For being honest that's, the only way that I can have really helped you and so that was just one time that you."
15679.0,Patient,"Have. Only one night, otherwise I have been since we met on the 11th of October i'm sorry on the eighth of October and that night and every night, since then, except for the one that i've just recounted to you i've been."
10.0,Provider,Good okay great so how did you feel limiting your alcohol intake like that.
15679.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean it's a new habit for me, a new situation. And my husband has continued to have a before dinner drink but he's he's okay with that and i'm okay with that, I mean it's his life I can't he can't live mine not can't live yes. So we're talking about that. Do we talk about it, you."
10.0,Provider,Do talk about the fact that you're trying to cut back a little bit and how.
15679.0,Patient,"Well, yes he's absolutely aware of this is. really aware and very supportive."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so he he's he thinks it's a good idea for you to or he's just kind of going along with what you think."
15679.0,Patient,"No, I think he thinks it's a good idea. Okay, I think I think over the course of the last since I had this parathyroid ectomy."
10.0,Provider,Right.
15679.0,Patient,"And i've been suffering with this fight or flight and US fright based on something real or imagined I don't know but. I myself know and he knows that i've been drinking more than I had been and should be, and. You know the future is. very much on my mind and he's supportive of what I need to do."
10.0,Provider,"Okay fantastic so when we talked in group, it seemed like the. baclofen not necessarily helping much is that right."
15679.0,Patient,"No, I think i've only taken it once I don't even know i've taken it once I didn't feel anything and i'm I tell you I am weary weary weary of taking so many drugs I don't know what's doing what. I am."
10.0,Provider,Well you're taking the backflip and xanax and the lyrica right and the blood pressure pill.
15679.0,Patient,"The blood pressure, Bill right now, only the blood pressure, Bill the lyrica and the occasional xanax right most every night but only half of a tablet so I mean it's really point 25 milligrams is."
10.0,Provider,OK.
15679.0,Patient,It just helps me sleep if I wake up in the middle of the night or up late last night I was up reading and trying to get into the mood for sleep at.
10.0,Provider,midnight.
15679.0,Patient,"So I took a half of one. And I slept until you know. About five o'clock this morning, and then I got up went to the bathroom came back to bed and sleep for another hour and a half, so it's um. it's helped me and. i'm weary of it, as well as I am of alcohol, because I. I tell you I think my father, who was a binge drinker I think he got to a point in his later years he died when he was 78 years old, and he died, I think, from an overdose. I think he had some guys come over to do some work in his yard lanes and brick, and they started drinking a few beers and. My father at his age, I think he had taken the medication is, this is an assumption on my part because he died in sleep. But I think he had a couple of. beers which he was not very good at handling he was a binge drinker and he would take xanax we think it was an ex I don't even know my sister and says the sonics he called it his nerve medicine. And he'd been taking it on and off, I think, on a need basis for a few years, a couple years and I think what happened was he had too much beer he took his medication. Later, he couldn't remember if he took it or not, and took it again and I have no idea what the dosage was or what happy, but he died in his sleep and my sister. And I assumed that it was an eod. accidentally OD right."
10.0,Provider,"Okay well that's. I can hear that that's a concern for you and. You know, with you, with your xanax I think you said you were taking a four to five times a week is that."
15679.0,Patient,Right yeah.
10.0,Provider,"and So where Where are you at now as far as your alcohol I sound like there's two issues here the xanax and the alcohol are you ready to make another step, or do you want to hold where you're. At now I think we're in a holding pattern right now."
15679.0,Patient,Because i'm holding on to what I have committed to not only you but myself. Right.
10.0,Provider,And then and you're not committing to me i'm just here to help.
15679.0,Patient,"You know, I understand that I know i'm not doing so good i'm doing this clearly, for me, you know. I get that."
10.0,Provider,"Have you noticed any benefits, since you cut back a little bit I know it's days."
15679.0,Patient,"I tell you the night that I had the pre dinner locker the light one, so to speak, but the soda and the. And the drink that I had before, I went to bed, I felt terrible the next day."
10.0,Provider,i'll tell you that that's a good you're listening to your body there and. yeah sounds like your body's. happier without those.
15679.0,Patient,"light and I am seriously trying to convert i'm seriously contemplating cutting out alcohol all together. i'm reading a couple of good books, I wanted to talk to you today. I don't know if you've ever read the book by Alan carr. How to control your alcohol. By. it's the. How God anyway it's another book about by Lady about stopping drinking about being the luckiest people the luckiest people are the ones that can see the dangers and stop themselves and get on a good path of recovery. yeah and. And they are the luckiest people of all, I haven't gotten into that book but it's comes highly recommended."
10.0,Provider,Uniform.
15679.0,Patient,"So anyway, I wanted."
10.0,Provider,To talk about.
15679.0,Patient,"I wanted to tell I wanted to talk to you about my father just quickly. And an experience I had that i've been reminded of that I don't remember. That has to do with swallowing and so forth, and I sometimes I feel like it's not only alcohol, but i'm bringing this anxiety on myself i'm fearing i'm fearing that there's something bad is going to happen my body feels that way. and there's no real physical explanation for it, even if I have scar tissue in my throat, and you know i'm undergoing injections, with a with Stanford university for catalog injections, to try to reduce that scar tissue."
10.0,Provider,I have.
15679.0,Patient,"felt lately that. The dosage I had he gave me my first injection on October 5 and I, you know steroids take a long time to work, and I feel like I have felt some improvement. And then I get anxious and so forth, and I say no, no there's no improvement, but I actually think that there is some improvement and I have another injection appointment coming up on October 26. And by the way, I should tell you I am scheduled to leave the country to go down to Mexico to Cabo on October 30 and I was speaking to another therapist the other day shawn something or other. And she says she's not licensed to practice in Mexico, so if i'm physically in Mexico, she can't talk to me anymore, and I he and I didn't get along very well anyway, we decided we really couldn't work together. But in any case she's at wonder if that's the case with you, Dr practice."
10.0,Provider,"Unfortunately, it probably is because i'm only license in California."
15679.0,Patient,I don't know where I am.
10.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. I think if you're like I think if you're technically you're living in California you're visiting Mexico. Your resident in California, I think we can get we can work with that."
15679.0,Patient,"Well, to be totally honest with you, we claim to be residents of Mexico. We live in California, we have a home in California, we do not pay California income tax because we plan and gauge our time to that we are out of state of California for six months at the time. And that tax issue. And it's I mean we vote in national elections, we could not vote in local elections, and we have no income whatsoever in the state of California, so we pay no income tax here and and that's on purpose."
10.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm I don't need to get into that I think if you. have a job with that we can take it up with the eligibility people at bright heart. But I think. yeah so so What was your question, then you have."
15679.0,Patient,"Well, my question was, I hope that we'll be able to continue I."
10.0,Provider,"think I can continue, and if they tell me otherwise we'll."
15679.0,Patient,Take it from there.
10.0,Provider,"yeah we'll jump through those hoops at that point. Okay, it sounds like you're getting some improvement with the steroids, but then sometimes the anxiety comes and then it. It comes back to you. Know thing that happened with your father."
15679.0,Patient,"Okay, let me tell you about my father, and let me tell you i'll talk as quickly as I can, because I know we're on a time limit. Right, my father was a binge drinker right he was a great guy loved him i'm the youngest of five daughters and we're all in love. Big time with our father, but when he was drunk he became violent. And as many I don't know underachievers, so to speak, perhaps frustrated what have you. In an effort to blame someone for his lack of whatever he perceived he was lacking, and he blamed my mother and when my and he he went after my mother to. yelling at her screaming at her preaching to her in an effort for her to admit her sins or whatever I don't know, I was too young to understand and i'm you know 73 and I still don't understand it, but. My mother would run away from them, she would hide from him, she would go outside she would hide behind the barn we would help her hide sometimes I remember one occasion when he actually engaged us girls to help physically prevent her from escaping so that he could. Be violent right in her face. He never heard her he never physically hurt her, even though it certainly looked like you might certainly like he wanted to, but the next day, of course, he was full remorse and. They separated a few times they always got back together, I mean it was I mean they were married forever and ever so. I remember the time that he made us hold her, and I remember being quite upset about that, but i'll tell you, otherwise my dad was a great guy hard worker he paint he was a painter that's how he made his living, but he had five girls. And he grew up a painter and working in people's homes and making furniture and that's what he was he was a craftsman he works with his hands and he provided a home and a family. We have a daughter. who's now 43 years old, she is in the 10th year of sobriety herself."
10.0,Provider,Okay.
15679.0,Patient,"So she has been in recovery for 10 years. She was only kind of a full blown uncontrollable mess for a couple years. So I think her health didn't suffer too much, but she went into rehab in her early 30s about 31 or so of the."
10.0,Provider,Karen.
15679.0,Patient,"A place up in Pennsylvania, and she did she did find it great she I think she was in a very, very bad stressful marriage and I think they were both drinking heavily and he. Anyway, she got pregnant with twins and anyway, so I have alcohol is part of my family it's part of my husband's family, I mean his mother was born in Ireland, my grant my ancestors were all born in Ireland they say that the Irish you know have that tendency I don't know how true, it is. Anyway, I have. I have been trying, this is all in my effort to find out, I have been pursued by many things in my research to find out where i'm where I am emotionally strong up and where I can emotionally, you know empty myself my body my mind my heart, of whatever it is, I am bringing somewhere. And this is the answer to all my problems. is to find out what I am personally grieving or suppressing but I mean I my my father never beat me never i've never had anything but the most. normal relationship with him. With my mother, with my siblings i'm very close to all my older siblings were all very healthy my oldest. sister is 82 years old, we just celebrated against ones at it will go to another ad is coming up next year, and you know i'll be 73 and a couple of weeks. And we've all enjoyed pretty good health, two of them have had heart valve issues and they've had open heart surgery like to replace the valve but otherwise everyone's kicking and doing still living and working and running their own business driving cars, whatever. Right, so I got a I got a good background and i've enjoyed good. Health I. Since this thing in my throat. Where i've had you know this tightness and this claustrophobic and this obsession, if you want to call it that i've never thought of it as an obsession i've thought about it as something that went wrong and that I have, I have. turned up turned over every stone, I can find get to the basis of it. But I was talking to my sister either. One day, and she and I lived together, we were roommates in New York City. I mean."
10.0,Provider,"This is this happened, more than 50 years ago she says to me one day i'm telling her about my woes of this thing in my throat."
15679.0,Patient,"And she said, Vikki Do you remember when we were living in New York one night. You. At got so upset. And panicky because you said you were having trouble swallowing. And you were having trouble breathing and you were convinced. that something was going to happen, because you have you felt this anxiety this. This feeling that at some point you weren't going to be able to swallow and at one point you weren't going to be able to breathe and you felt this thing kind of coming down, he is so bad that I had to call a doctor. And I was able to find a doctor how I did. 50 years ago in New York City on whatever random night. To come to our House to talk to."
10.0,Provider,examine me.
15679.0,Patient,To see what was physically going on.
10.0,Provider,That.
15679.0,Patient,"I mean I don't know what I would have done today, I mean seems like to keep up, thank you, you can't swallow, and you can't read you go to the emergency room how she got a doctor, to come to the apartment I do not, but anyway, this is the story she's recounting to me, and he came. And he examined me and he said I don't see any cause. For your panic I don't."
10.0,Provider,I don't.
15679.0,Patient,"I don't you. I can see feel nor hear. Any legitimate reason for your concern and he just kept and I said, well, I did what did you do. I because I have no memory of this she said I can't believe you don't remember that. And I have no memory of it. She said he just kept talking to you, and he said, Vikki, what do you think is going to happen to. You, why do you think you cancel, why do you think you will be. able to free and. that's her memory and I. said is that it, she said he just. He just kind of talked you. Out of it, you just kind of talked you out of it and said."
10.0,Provider,reassured you.
15679.0,Patient,"That physically, there was no cause for your concern and. He left. and Never again was it mentioned again it never came up until I was telling her about this tightness in my throat following this parathyroid at me. And how the tightness was driving me crazy and I. And then she said well you do remember that night in New York and, of course. They could be. Absolutely completely totally totally unrelated I mean, after all, they are 50 years apart right but. It just makes me. If my source of. My. If I going to manifest. Any fear concerns."
10.0,Provider,"That. i've been there, done that, before. You know yeah well, I think that goes a long way along with to. connecting the dots with regard to the. anxiety and fear and, and that is very common to have this sense of tightness in the throat."
15679.0,Patient,"And, and the fact that you had that you know you felt like this steroid was helping and then it came back that at least at least part of it is not. necessarily physical I mean it's hard to separate mind and body, because they're intimately connected yeah but there's something there and I think that that story about your dad is really profound and my sense is that."
10.0,Provider,"There was something that you wanted to say this is what's coming up for me intuitively that you wanted to say something to your dad. or some stifling of your voice and what was happening with your mom that you were not able to you know speak up against what was happening and that now, you know all these years later you're coming to terms with it and I told you this when we talked the first time that. Whatever is happening here is a gift for you, for a deeper level of healing."
15679.0,Patient,"Well, I remember you're saying that. And i've."
10.0,Provider,Given that some thought doctor I have given it some thought.
15679.0,Patient,"Let me just tell you one little more short story. Okay. This will, this will go this goes back I don't. even know how old I was. I have an image, I have. I was with my father. And I was taking some pills now my father didn't take pills. If there was ever anything wrong with you, he told you to take two alka seltzer that's what he took. And if you went to my mother, she would take us, you would say take two aspirin and between the two of them is the apple sells it didn't help. You and the aspirin didn't help you if you were. Absolutely, a hopeless case in any case, so there was just nothing to be done. Except ignored and press on but I remember being my father, so I mean we're not appeal taking family and I don't. Remember, under what circumstances I was taking any. pills, but I have. A vision. of memory as big as it can be of me of him happens of me being with him and i'm trying to swallow a couple of pills. And i'm swallowing them one at a. Time. And he gets. He says, why are you swallowing them one, at a time. And I think. I don't know I gave him some impression that I thought I would show if I swallowed more than one. And, of course, my father."
10.0,Provider,He was totally.
15679.0,Patient,If anything ruffle his feathers it was the thought of any of his children having any sort of phobia about.
10.0,Provider,And so.
15679.0,Patient,"I got the impression that he. was kind of thinking me being a little phobic because I wouldn't swallow both of the pills, at the same time that I had a fear of swallowing fear of choking again this kind of recurring theory and. He I don't think. I don't remember him making much of it, except that he thought I had a hang up of some kind, and he didn't like people. That he loved and were you know, having hang ups, so I think he let it go, probably with the assumption that if he pressed it I probably would choke and he didn't want that to happen so."
10.0,Provider,But that's.
15679.0,Patient,I mean what I mean is that a vague.
10.0,Provider,"Yes, it sounds like you're really doing some excavating and there's a strong connection with something to do with your dad around these around this symptom and your throat, and also that it's it's not a new thing that you've. You know, had similar symptoms, in relation to anxiety in the past. So I you know I think the best advice I can give you is to continue. With your. Your processing of these feelings and you're listening deep inside to what's going on and slowing down and using your breathing or other techniques to."
15679.0,Patient,Okay.
10.0,Provider,"to connect with these feelings, I think we need to get you a different therapists if you didn't connect with shawn so well. i'm going to need to wrap up your my kids starting their piano lesson, but. We. We will get you connected."
15679.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, if I can have time just for one more little story. Okay, in my. Efforts to go deep inside myself. To find out what else. Is bothering me."
10.0,Provider,"If anything, the."
15679.0,Patient,Only other incident in my life. That I will tell you was.
10.0,Provider,crushing and.
15679.0,Patient,hurt very much. Was the discovery. That my husband was being unfaithful to.
10.0,Provider,me which I discovered coming down the stairs one night and him being on the phone with someone.
15679.0,Patient,"And my. You know what you overhear you, you know."
10.0,Provider,instantly.
15679.0,Patient,"that something is going on, well, I tell you I he denied it of course he denied it forever and. We eventually eventually eventually. I said, you have to tell me the truth, and if you tell me the truth. And you admit that you've been lied about this, I will try my best never to bring it up again. And we really never. have brought it up again."
10.0,Provider,"And so, so he admitted to it. Yes, yes, he admitted to it is admitted to the line and he got rid of her."
15679.0,Patient,"And I mean I think he. He and i've been married for 50 years, I think that I love him very, very much I loved him grow very much. The cheating and infidelity. which was brief. I do believe it was brief. hurt me enormously broke my heart."
10.0,Provider,But that was.
15679.0,Patient,"You know, almost 30 years ago now. 35 maybe."
10.0,Provider,I mean we've been together for more.
15679.0,Patient,than 50.
10.0,Provider,"wow yeah so wait, so you had the little kids at that time or young."
15679.0,Patient,Oh yes. First grade second grade and kindergarten.
10.0,Provider,At the time.
15679.0,Patient,"So, and we were living well, he was you know working, we will say he and his job was in San Francisco he was always in international banking until he left international banking and joined domestic banking in San Francisco so. that's The only other thing I can bring up in like past that was pretty."
10.0,Provider,"crushing yeah okay well I wish we had more time, unfortunately I need to wrap up, but I want you what I think just imparting we've made it a decision or you've made a decision to continue with the two glasses of wine, a day to."
15679.0,Patient,or down I am i'm seriously enough. yeah so let me know.
10.0,Provider,"If you can wean down the xanax a little bit to four times a week and no more that would be great, but I will just put that out there, but the most important thing. is for you to as these feelings are coming up around your dad around your husband and the situation that happened in New York, just to a notice. How it's feeling in your throat and just really quiet down the mind breathe slowly and listened, because your body is time to communicate something to you. and listen up you're doing a great job i'm really impressed with this material that's coming up for you and I think that the potential for cathartic healing and for really. A. A resolution of some of these things that are still you know. Gathering you on some level."
15679.0,Patient,"Well, I hear you I I do think, two things are going on, I think the excessive drinking was exacerbating the anxiety. yeah, but there are."
10.0,Provider,A few things to.
15679.0,Patient,And there and there yeah. there's more than just alcohol going on yeah you there always is you know there always is so okay let's go Sally with a parting note I wish I had.
10.0,Provider,A.
15679.0,Patient,I wish I had a nickel for every dollar I spent on piano lessons.
10.0,Provider,"Well, I don't tell my wife. Okay, all right, I will see you in are you coming to group tonight, or two or Friday I forget. Friday Friday."
15679.0,Patient,Friday at 11.
