Reviews as if he just texted me how i'm doing, and he says the exact same thing, because I was telling john very honest because that man saved my life but. it's like you know you have to have to you know find something that motivates you get the good not as good as I do, but that'll keep me occupied, but I just keep finding."
480.0,Provider,yeah well and it's hard when you're physically not feeling well because that's the problem with depression is a lot of coping skills for depression will require you to actually like get up and do things and when you're. physically not feeling well that's almost impossible.
9335.0,Patient,And I have zero energy I don't try really hard not to get into that like. A rabbit hole when you start looking at like YouTube in the news and stuff but I was just trying to figure out what am I eight weeks is cozy but there's something called coated longhorn.

9335.0,Patient,"yeah and you know I had I was actually an oxygen only when I get active so like if i'm like you don't want to go to when I went to belly with my kids lifetime or i'm. Fine, but if I know i'm just have around the House they're doing small tours i'm okay um but since coven like I it has on people's thoughts. Because the money. You know how much does it, it was like being on me, but my auction can withdraw since i've coated like if I get active or. yeah and it was getting I was getting down in my dog 50. years now pretty low there in the beginning, after the after God wants me about that, but. You know."
480.0,Provider,For a pulse ox.

480.0,Provider,Oh well.
9335.0,Patient,"my mouth drop wouldn't show up at 6000 had to stop and do like deep breathing exercises and stuff, the only thing is how. Oh that's scary i'm ready for it i'm trying not to let it is. Really in i'm just. i'm, finally, to the point where I can i'm happy not happy, but like I want more on life, and you can I feel like you know. I just have all this stuff but just keep me in the face you. know just trying to take me back and say man it's really frustrating because. The life that I want the wasted, I really."
480.0,Provider,feel like.

I bet I can go 30 days there's no like I called my neighbors. I got that."
480.0,Provider,Listen it's not sad because you're adjusting to accommodate for taking care of yourself that's actually really healthy.

9335.0,Patient,"Now I have seen my probation officer i'm wait because, like i've had, where I was in the hospital and then I just I just been alive, but I really I say on top of with her, so my point is i've been pushed back. So I have to either by Friday or i'll get in trouble. yeah she's like, if I could let you come in Monday, when because, like i've been doing really good ground year and a half, two years now, so and I think if you don't stay in contact with I learned which back in the day, I felt like I can order, it would be make everything okay. it's not. i've come to learn in the past, little while that just answering the phone you know. makes a big difference so. Like really close with on back with her, but i'm said or my dog my judge said today, I got moved to face for so, which is a final phase of my. My my probation Tina rocks i'm assuming that's called a really big deal. To get like the movie before. it's like supervision out my judge. Even said I love you whenever he was done with me he's like. I just want you know i'm so proud of you, you are one of those miracle cases and he's like I just I love you know off the end in January. Oh i'm crazy or just you know what I mean to say that made me feel really good."
480.0,Provider,that's awesome well and it's probably making him feel good to to see you doing so well because i'm sure they get really tired of seeing people just come in and out and then now and so.
9335.0,Patient,"he's an amazing like I said it's so crazy how you think what you active addiction does to your mentality, because I just think he's the devil in kissimmee, this is just the worst. And now I like I like I love it to death, like absolutely would do anything for him, he saved my life, and he his mom his wife is actually friends with my mom but. So you kind of keep you on track on the on the back end do, but he he's not about just putting in jail and hamblen county the county i'm from they don't care if you don't care be dying. To own what is the next county over the one that is he actually does with she has babies, who were born addicted to drugs he actually had an addiction problem when he was in his early 20. Yes, and he is. A man of God, and he absolutely absolutely he'll give anybody a chance that he put me in jail, I need you to be you put me in rehab when it needs to be and the daily as a chance, when I needed it I don't know if you can ask for more than that from somebody."
480.0,Provider,that's so awesome so what were you initially arrested for.
9335.0,Patient,"um well I got pulled over I had pulled over I was out on the road, I had a violation and my original spark was um let's say which one was that. Remember, it was a day, no, I think it was possession, or something within cancer resellers and then I instead of just telling them, who I wasn't only got pulled over I gave him my friends ID because I had it in my wallet. charge I almost got out of it, though. Like he was literally finding my citation to let me walk away and he's like once you start shooting number, and I was like. yeah."
480.0,Provider,Oh.
9335.0,Patient,But I saved my life I was not in a good place.
480.0,Provider,"Well, I love that you have that perspective, because that was something I mean I remember telling people for ever that going to jail saved my life and. People were like no there's no way i'm like no you don't understand when you're in that addiction cycle, you need something to pull you out of it and, for me, my parents could have bailed me out, it was low bail they let me sit there for two months, and it was exactly what I needed."
9335.0,Patient,"yeah my mom sent me before to my mom was my mom's not right with giving was, but she didn't like money, but it was bad because she was an enabler and that way. um but. He I felt like a whole nother discussion, but she. She eventually learned, let me sit there and not let me get out because I could have got out on. My ankle monitor and. She and I had no money, I had to say you for a dress and she wouldn't let me do anything else in there for next month, I was associate that I needed that extra month because. I actually got accepted like two weeks later, I got a really good program that I wouldn't have thought I would have got out of an ankle monitor so crazy how things work."
480.0,Provider,"that's cool yeah. Well, and that's good that your mom actually stopped enabling you at some point, too, because a lot of. lot of parents never get to that point."
9335.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know my mom is just. he's very like you i've most awkward that i've ever had in my life with my mother, which is bad, that should not be mean you shouldn't feel awkward does your mother and I hate that I do. With my kids i'll make them 16 i'll put them on my lap and how much they love on them I don't care and gave hate it, but I think that they need to know that you love them that much. yeah my mom is just never been the one to show that and it's like affected me in my life and my sister also. Who doesn't have problems, but I mean it is. She widely see that also and it just makes it really hard and i've struggled to have a good relationship with her. She left me in the hospital they told them that, when I was in icu and I first got there that might not make it through the night that. That they would just become starts to come in my mom didn't even come because she had a catering she do in the morning and everything and i've really struggled on trying to build that. relationship, but I know I need to learn to forgive her at. Some point. I put myself in that situation, I get that like it was my fault that I was there, but like I have my kid oh if he's got these oh i'd be there, you know, like. down, and so in seven months, she visited me two. Times that was the day I had my surgery, and he didn't even wait to permeate the white to me for wake up, and I even asked her like please wait for me to wake up, I you know I want, I want to know the you guys wake up, I woke up to nobody. And I just my sister was there for me, though, and she I know she's been."
480.0,Provider,My best friend.
9335.0,Patient,"Like he did my best friend. i've heard that relationship, but she's an amazing person and she gives me. I just looked up to her so much you know she could break weather like that I still struggle with. Like a novena good parents, you know, so I try to do a lot of hockey in fairness little stricter than I am waster like I just when I think of being a good mother. I think of my sister first. I mean she's just amazing, and I think he. my sister is a firm believer of Jesus, and I think that also makes her able to forgive me differently, then like I guess my mother. yeah because she she worked on our relationship and and I really thought at some point that i'd never she never talked to me, and you know we're having with like. synthesizes two years that i've been clean she I think about it, you have a year went by she told me, she was brought me the first time, my entire life oh yeah she she's all from like she was just randomly send me big boxes of like. food and drink some sense from a half from Amazon like you know stuff like that, just like little things and it sounds silly but like that means a lot. Because I could do a sale that are returning get my money back when I was younger, you know but or she you know if she if I ever needed money or help with a bill. She just helped me pay my car payment last month and it's $400 because I got behind when school started, because I got the kids. And I hate to ask her but she's like you know because I get a fast paced payment coming soon from disability and i'm going to pay her back, but like that's one of many i'm going to hand over you know. And she it was there, within an hour yeah. Like I she would have never done that here's a couple years ago. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Which is listening to you and how well you're doing. that's awesome about, that is. you're the one that did the work and healed yourself and grew so that she is able to do those things again."
9335.0,Patient,"I weren't important to sometimes it's almost like riding a fan of like okay i've got to be perfect, so that perfect that I mean we start thinking like that you get. Almost overwhelmed. And I try to make sure I don't overthink it too much because, in order to push myself, I can addiction mode, or you know, thinking that way and I struggle with that one still I mean I i'm, I guess, they say, even when you're 1620 years claim that you do so."
480.0,Provider,"The biggest thing is just realizing that just because you're clean and sober now it doesn't mean that you can't still be human. that's The difference is a lot of people come into therapy thinking like i'm going to cure all of the issues. that's not the point, the point is you're still going to be you you're still going to be human you're still gonna have depression, anxiety you're still going to get cravings to use it. What am I doing on a daily basis, though, to treat those things. And so, getting rid of the expectation that you can't be human and you can't struggle is a big part of that."
9335.0,Patient,"I sort of like that, like without like trying to like just just learning to forgive myself was there hasn't it was very difficult for me like. Like when I think about God and I and my saved like I forget I accepted it, how everybody else has given me my son he forgave me immediately must you know all that that was easy for me, except but for me to set that to forgive myself yeah. that's hard that's still I mean it's not, I want to fit us builders, because I think I have entrepreneur myself i'm sitting it's just something kind of a work in progress. But i'm way better than I used to be and I think that you know my spirituality right my beliefs, I think, helped me with that a lot."
480.0,Provider,"yeah for sure. I think, to what helps with forgiving yourself is. A lot of times actions come before feelings, so your actions are proving that you are forgiving yourself because you're doing the next right thing on a daily basis you're staying clean. So that is proving that you're taking care of yourself you're forgiving yourself and sometimes the feelings don't necessarily catch up as quickly you know, like. it's the same with that concept of loving yourself, nobody ever feels like they love themselves, but action show whether or not you love yourself, by how you're meeting your needs taken care of yourself all of that."
9335.0,Patient,"I never thought of it like that. Because I was thinking about that I felt like you know that was the first thing I had to do was learn to love myself. Because I had asked them and so long, I was so codependent and and just like I hadn't i'd been in relation to 13 for a long time and I took a year off and which I have now says cut myself this is way up to like two years ago and. But prior to can I was the first time it was they were not relationships and I had to learn how to love, like the best that's a seat you mean. I mean, I can love a cat that I just meet a person, but for myself that's. crazy or do except that I feel beautiful, even when i'm looking like fit and that's another one that you know I had to take daily work do I do affirmations and I don't really do it say talking in the mirror, but I still do it if I feel like i'm getting down on myself so."
480.0,Provider,yeah it actually works it's amazing how it actually works if you do.
9335.0,Patient,"A gratitude journal that I keep right next to my bed, and sometimes i'll forget like i'll go to along without using it, but when I do remember i'll see it because that's why I keep right next to my bed, I was like no I try to write at least three things down at night. Before going to bed or first thing in the morning and whatever i'm feeling, and that is that's. My judge says the same thing today about it, somebody else about my gratitude or making a gratitude list for the most helpful for one of a very helpful tool they use in recovery, and I agree with that."
480.0,Provider,"and recover from anything even mental illness like depression, anxiety gratitude bliss shift your perspective so greatly and it's such it's such an easy thing to do, you have access to it, and you know."
9335.0,Patient,"And you can think of anything like a lot of air in my lungs, I have the shoes on my feet like when I when I started to like really get into recovery and start talking about gratitude like I didn't think about the way I do now, but. Think about the people in the world who don't have messenger who are starving to death, right now, I. Am like Mr vision, because I gotta walk to the mailbox and get my mail like i'm feeling overwhelmed today or you know i've had an event or day or whatever, the situation is i'm like get over yourself and I didn't before like I was I don't know, maybe to not naive I don't know say. To believe that like I are actually opened my eyes see that, like how lucky I really am."
480.0,Provider,yeah like.
9335.0,Patient,"I, and I think that might have in my surgery in 2017 was like a big turning point for me of me and with gratitude because yeah I."
480.0,Provider,Am learning to love my job so many times.
9335.0,Patient,"I did on the table, like my heart stops that's why I struggle, sometimes like I can have I graduated second my class and I had a scholarship to college and I can't even spell like chocolate today so whatever. I have a hard time. Sometimes, like i'll know what i'm saying, but I will come out right sometimes i'll go to walmart and i'll have to Google my way home. Like and I was 13 years and i'm not kidding and it just it, he said that when I lost often my brain is mess with my motor skills or something else. And then it's authentic practice like I learned to write again and everything like my first writing was so shaky like two year old and now it's better now like it's back to normal, but."
480.0,Provider,So that gives me hope.
9335.0,Patient,"That it's like something my worst thing is, if the remembering. I have a hard time placing data on so."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense, how long were you without oxygen you know."
9335.0,Patient,"I think they said, like a two minute or a minute and a half. minutes thanks yeah and I was open up they had they actually shocked my heart, they had already cut me Open Source open laid it out deflated my lungs and my blood was going through that machine and that's what it saw and so they paddled me while I was opened on the table. and"
480.0,Provider,grey's anatomy stuff right there.
9335.0,Patient,"As I went to my doctor told me about it, like they really. And, first of all I didn't know that you've got your ad for me I didn't think about that correct that was one that freaked me out and then they said they lay you open like a book that I was like."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I know it's not a very pleasant visual I could never. doctor nurse. No way."
9335.0,Patient,And then i'm held together by three wires but the book cartledge eventually goes back to that day I went off I don't go out anymore. No kidding.
480.0,Provider,And everything to fall out.
9335.0,Patient,"yeah they give you a heart pillow to hold while you call because you know it really does it right that's The worst thing about it but yeah that's pretty good I when I that's another thing right starts to get down this other thing about that, like oh you shouldn't be right now got obviously."
480.0,Provider,"wow that's so awesome i'm so happy for you i'm glad, things are going well and."
9335.0,Patient,This one might help to get better I freaking hate coven.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
9335.0,Patient,"But I think i'm going to turn those is Am I get the vaccine. I I not put myself down that rabbit hole sick and you know you're seeing this like whole thing exactly it's just not going to turn people something bad about it, something is going to happen if you were to start your state that's right it's been myself. Wanting to my teachers and my doctors. cares about me like I know she does like show calm check on me like I don't have never had to do that, and my pharmacist is also really good i've had her for very long time. If they're not going to tell me something that I shouldn't do you know they actually are caring concern about health. So she's asking to five months and I no longer have the antibodies anymore my system was like February, she said that I think we're gonna have to get to the vaccine, because she just chooses Ruby sitting on cute cover next time I do not think don't make it. don't think the body can handle it so it's not worth the risk, you know it's."
480.0,Provider,Definitely not worth this and honestly I got the Pfizer one I had zero side effects both times.
9335.0,Patient,"really well. Take a certification two weeks prior to getting that because there were my with my heart and I felt applauding a call back to five clotting disorder and. say that in the vaccine can use blood clot so they want to put me on actually want to look better now they want to have my doubts and I went to the shops in the belly two weeks before I had started so are gay. But that she said, would be the only downside. is only plan and she's like you, and she said, in November, it will have been out for a year she's like you know you need to. know that it's something was gonna happen, it will happen so. Exactly and really at this point with with. You know I mean. it's I think it's probably just give me the best thing to do, but you know how people are the same they judge you and stuff if you get it like a better on certain views like."
480.0,Provider,"You don't tell anybody, though."
9335.0,Patient,"No, I don't but like I said I. don't know I guess i'd I now that I know my doctor she's like I think it's like she really set up a plan with it, and I know she would tell me something that was going to harm me that i'm like you know really I don't care at this point because. My life, but in my son he's like a trump fan and."
480.0,Provider,"The thing is, you have to put it into that perspective, do I do I feed into the fear of others, judging me or do I save my own life like what's more important."
9335.0,Patient,Some stupid like that okay.

480.0,Provider,shirt okay so. It was submitted the prior authorization was submitted. that's the latest on it.
9335.0,Patient,"So, as long as they send it back to that means it should be going through the season we're supposed to mention and marked as urgent that way, the lady at skincare said that they had a mountain it's urgent they have 12 hours to make to confirm it and get it in so. It can take up to four days and I don't know if they marked it urgent or not right."
480.0,Provider,"So, because there's four separate so how we do inquiries. it's the date, and then the like the first request so there's four separate times they've addressed this today for this one increase, so there was when you called and then there was prior authorization What did it say it said. requests, we need to resubmit That was the doctor that said that and then an hour later. There was another one, and then it said MED prior authorization re submitted later in the day and yet so."

480.0,Provider,yeah and they're at least addressing it on our so that's.
9335.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz they laugh they weren't my God it's crazy actually did I miss. Jackson had to help me with that. And when she got involved they got it done quick but. deals with. zoom for the first beginning it took me forever. Well, thank you."

9335.0,Patient,"I know my excuse like eight I guess it was a sudden so you know, like all these lot of these girls have been with since the beginning, and you know that's a long time, but what you know didn't watch your progress. happen it's cool."
480.0,Provider,yeah and that's my favorite part of group therapy is people get to know each other and they like get comfortable with each other and then it's like you see these relationships forming and supporting each other it's awesome.
9335.0,Patient,"yeah i've actually I think I think I think just a little something that they're given their their forgiving any loans or have you have for school and and that they're helping giving grants and stuff that I saw myself to go back to school and I thought about going for therapy. Like work, and I know nothing. thought about it in the back of my mind, the thing that causes me is just the mentality about Tony about like I just worried schools, you know go my school."
480.0,Provider,Like school at all.
9335.0,Patient,um.
480.0,Provider,"But it's totally worth it, and this is the thing we need more therapists who have been through real life shit like."
9335.0,Patient,Exactly what I thought to my mom even said that. You were made to do that talk to people like that.
480.0,Provider,yeah you would be. awesome I definitely wouldn't say that if I didn't think that. I would be like.
9335.0,Patient,"I really does mean a lot to me because my God. it's almost a passion, but it helps me stay clean."
480.0,Provider,"Is my best coping skill i'm not even kidding like work is such a phenomenal coping skill, because days when i'm triggered when i'm depressed. And i'm having bad ptsd like this gets me fully in the moment, so I don't have to think about my own stuff it's perfect."
9335.0,Patient,"yeah I, I agree, I did I was not before curtis that I had over almost two and a half years, clean and after a year I started to be a sponsor and like there were days that I was just having the worst day and then they call me Nick you like i'm sorry to bother you i'm like no."
480.0,Provider,I never bother.
9335.0,Patient,yeah i'm here I didn't think it would be like that.
480.0,Provider,"it's so like. that's what got me into this to was it started off with sponsoring people in 12 step rooms and then I realized how awesome it was to be able to connect with people, and then I went back to school yeah."
9335.0,Patient,"wow that's cool yeah and that's kind of what made me do it just watching people like you know you and seeing people like you, who have done it like gives me hope, like Okay, it can be done."
480.0,Provider,It can totally do that.
9335.0,Patient,"Because when you're an addict it almost feels like all your offices. You know it's both no more, you know that do so much. Like you can't I can't get a job at work In most places, but like when if this if I get some little bit different that's right, you know me no one, no one will get me down there."
480.0,Provider,"Right and that's the thing too is like. In this field, people are much more forgiving of having a criminal record or something, because they know that it was tied to the addiction, they know that's not you as a sober person how you're going to act so. there's a lot more empathy and understanding for people that have colorful past."
9335.0,Patient,"colorful back that's nice way, to put it."
480.0,Provider,is another great. that's what I tell people i've started dating again this past year and a half and people always ask like so tell me about yourself i'm like I have a very colorful past i'll tell you.
9335.0,Patient,are using that I thought. About dating again but.
