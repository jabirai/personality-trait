You know the two weeks since I spoke to you this is whenever I get mad at him i'm just like oh God to do this for Lena for halina You know, as I said that. i'm God he's so he's so inconsiderate i'm going to be by myself i'm gonna raise these kids on myself is going to let them listen to gangsta rap and they're gonna. Be awful kids and as i'm staying in my head i'm like yeah and then after you write that down your to go back and you're like that's not true that's not true that's not true, like so I didn't write it down."
107.0,Provider,i'm working on the process I. want to set yourself and it actually did help for us to go.
247.0,Patient,"about it, because in my head when i'm losing my shit. there's a little part of me is like. What would you go back and have to say that's not true about. That that that that you know, but still on piste you know, so that at least happens this week. And then I did have some tantrums this week. Where like I had one last night when he told me was tight like he kept telling me like I need help with getting the kids have a bath and i'm rushing in the kitchen getting stuff all done for nighttime stuff bottles he's like boring now when i'm like. an iceberg like throwing stuff and i'm like Oh, this is what it's talking about like this is a way overreaction my kid is screaming i'm like what. he's like. And i'm matching his reaction and i'm like lori lori Okay, so I grabbed him take him out of the bath and I was like. You know I see that you're upset mommy isn't feeling so great right now to look want to take a deep breath with mommy like mommy needs to calm down to. And we sat there he's like I want to take a deep breath and like Okay, I know you don't mommy's gonna take a deep breath and just hold you. Because mommy has a lot of big emotions right now too and i'm sitting there and Steve sitting next to me, putting the diaper on Logan and i'm like thank God he's not chastising me right now and. Right letting me like have this moment with him because I had a major toddler tantrum and in my head i'm like. Okay, this is, this is, this is what we need to work on now because i'm like thank you to my head my Thank you Steve like saying advice, please don't scold me please don't scold me. yeah you know um but it's bringing awareness now."
107.0,Provider,Huge.
247.0,Patient,Aware of what's happening.
107.0,Provider,can't do anything if we don't have awareness.
247.0,Patient,"So there's that um. I did call and try to make an appointment with. Your doctor yeah with a new provider here in alameda they used to see. General practitioner. Okay um because I just wanted to have like a doctor I don't have a Dr assigned my Ob for the past three years, because I am pregnant or breastfeeding, or whatever um after getting through to them and they said they're not taking any new patients until April, because of coven. And everything, so I was like okay her and didn't do anything with it so i'm thinking I should probably call my Ob. and say i'm having trouble getting in with. Just the normal normal GP can I come see you guys for this can I come and talk about this know my options um so that's on my to do list here, I was like oh I didn't do that better put on my anyway um so I tried."
107.0,Provider,But.
247.0,Patient,"It didn't get very far with it and then. This morning I realized that I was like what is holding me back with a meetings like I just the last one I went to felt kind of icky. In the beginning, because a lot of retired people, it was people that were very sick to people that are very sick, you know and the earlier me. and recovery like shy away from that, I think I told us about this and I was like Oh, but it's okay like that that's a good reminder of where can get to you and I really feel that meeting, and I feel like i'm just making it a little not wanting to go back. I was like alright sounds like you got to go to one of them, and that those are the only ones that are in person right now. So I put it on my calendar for Monday and then I kept looking through the little a person book and there's actually a woman's meeting on Wednesdays at two that I didn't realize was happening analysis. So I put that on my calendar is that's the one i'm going to and i'm actually excited about that no."
107.0,Provider,Good.
247.0,Patient,Good because.
107.0,Provider,"it's something different, better for."
247.0,Patient,"You before yeah. So um. So yeah it's a lot. This morning, preparing."
107.0,Provider,"well. But I mean. You know, to your point it's a lot of awareness and. This is a fluid process, and as long as you're keeping yourself accountable, even if it's this uncomfortable space of I need to do that, and then you don't do it, or you just kind of staying in that space that is really what changes all about. The the the satisfactory change is the one that you can look back on and go check all that feels good because I checked that box. you're done. You know or you're in a maintenance phase. Life is a maintenance life is all of the grist for the mill. So this is, this is the work right now is having these tantrums breathing through being grateful for Steve. Right in those moments because they're when they're times when you're not grateful, or even being able to see the see them at the same time and kind of work through all of that that's that's all that's all good work, and then we just keep. we'll just stay here and do this until you know and and then, whatever the next steps are they will come the they don't come if you don't allow yourself to be here. yeah so the timing of it, you know, because you you looked at the meetings and you kept pushing yourself, then you found that women's meeting so. Awareness is this weird mysterious kind of fluid thing it doesn't happen unless you allow yourself to keep being aware. So."
247.0,Patient,yeah okay I just feel good to have a little bit of stuff. yeah done or you know.
107.0,Provider,"we're underway. yeah you're underway on all these different things and there's a lot going on and. Then there's stuff that's completely out of our control that becomes annoying and you can use that to derail you or you can go okay that's annoying now what, which is what you've done with a lot of these things."
247.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you yeah i'm. i'm glad I working i'm working on it, because I just."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
247.0,Patient,"I realized that I still have so much resentment towards my dad and like his anger and the way that he lashes out about things like I was telling my mom and my husband this last week you're joking about something like a little tantrum my dad had like during. dinner about something and I was telling them as like I still to this day and I try to fight it. When dads around all these little things pop up that I know that are going to annoy him and i'm like I fix it. Because it's. dead are you okay sorry Okay, so too loud, do you need this do you need that oh my God it's so ingrained in me and I hate it and it ends up making me resent him even more. You know when he's not doing anything now. I just am so hyper aware. His."
107.0,Provider,His locker explosion moment yeah.
247.0,Patient,"yeah or just the things that he's not gonna appreciate, which I wish I could just be like whatever you know my mom was like you know I used to be like that, too, and now just be like whatever that's him, you know. Whatever and then partners be like a mom why why didn't you stop that from us like look at like look at all your kids like it. You know and. I want to like blame her for it, but she was there with us and it, too. And didn't know how to deal with it, and I want to love my dad and feel warmth towards him and I feel a lot of irritation. And annoyance and anger and a lot. It feels crappy. yeah does because he's this great grandpa my kids and he loves them and he's he's quirky and he's he's a good man. He just has no filter. You know, and I know he has good intentions and he's not going to change he's in his late 60s like nothing is. But I want to have love for my father, instead of irritation and. resentment."
107.0,Provider,"Well, and resentment to that you can see, maybe a softer version of your dad now with your kids, then what you experienced, or at least your perception of what you experienced as a kid and it's like dude Why can I have had some of this or. And this is pretty common that we see. different sides of our family members, as we grow up and see things in different perspectives and then it's natural for there to be some resentment and frustration and all of that, and so it's important to. This is part, this is where it's Nice that you have program kind of in your head because. You can know whether or not it's appropriate to say something so it's not an immense but you make amends to people that you know it'll benefit them and not harm them. to your point it's not even so much that your dad can't change so much to say he doesn't have any real awareness and it's probably not going to happen. So you saying why couldn't have been like this, when I was a kid is not going to do anything effectual right he's not going to go gosh I wish we could have had a BA da. I should have been like this right, instead of. just going to get mad and snappy. And same thing, maybe even with your mom although your mom strikes me as being much more aware so. She you know she could be. Maybe engaging in that conversation with you, with a different kind of energy but. I think a lot of this is just going to be about developing the awareness understanding appreciating it and then working your side of the street reason why I have my fingers crossed, and also. I always looked at my library, although my books that I refer not here so it's always funny but. there's I think I can't remember the title of it, right now, but there are a couple of really good books out there about being a kid of have an explosive or angry parent. And just kind of working through that because it is it's not like being in a war zone, but there is a level of trauma that is experienced by people who are in kind of an explosive environment. And it's not or they're worse environments that you could have grown in grown up in yes, at the same time let's not minimize the environment, you did grow up in and kind of how you then. develop this trained response to try and minimize any environmental stressors so that everybody's cool you know and that's exhausting because when you're in a hyper vigilant state all the time."
247.0,Patient,"And that is it I yeah. That always looking out for what, what can I do to make this better."
107.0,Provider,"What can I do and then. matt response, what can I do so, what is it what's out there what's going to cause a problem and then what am I doing. Right, whereas a kid that's that's you're supposed to just breathe in and out and have fun and learn life lessons like you're not supposed to be taken care of your parents are taking care of your life situation on that level. So I think it would be good to maybe even kind of keep your eye out for something like that, and I will. certainly go back to my library and so yeah Would you mind text me."
247.0,Patient,and letting me.
107.0,Provider,I think a reading list. buried somewhere i'll go back through and see what I can find.
247.0,Patient,just want to love my dad and I. I feel like i'm always just like.
107.0,Provider,"yeah well you've been on edge, with him, your whole life."
247.0,Patient,"I really have my whole life. And then he. It makes it halina goddess I haven't seen a lot, it makes me uncomfortable. It makes me uncomfortable when he wants to have like these. Deep talks or not deep talks deep moments of like just so proud of you, or you."
107.0,Provider,yeah. Oh no. Oh there.
247.0,Patient,you hear me.
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
247.0,Patient,Tremendous you are so good at your job or you or did this. Is such an amazing mom.
107.0,Provider,yeah.
247.0,Patient,"You know and i'll have these moments, where he just wants to really like tell me these deep things and then, just like shut up. You know, and I really am. that's my reaction."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
247.0,Patient,"That that's my reaction, but it's just like stopped."
107.0,Provider,Stop because it feels. But is it. No it's not know I know that's the sad part.
247.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,"I know why does it, why does it initially come at you as being fake."
247.0,Patient,snakes be so uncomfortable. Because i'm not used to it.
107.0,Provider,mm hmm.
247.0,Patient,"I remember getting love a lot, when I was very little. from him. And then, it just stopped and I I don't know, maybe it's like I don't know how to. accept anything good from him."
107.0,Provider,"So when we're when we feel that connection. at an early age, and then it stops. Unless you're psychotic which are not the responses, I did something wrong. Like it's a very deep wounds that I did I pushed him away I did something wrong it's my fault. And so, too, be now an adult and still have that kind of response reaction when you know some part of you knows that you didn't do anything wrong, you were a little kid. And so that's the piece that you're going to have to reconcile. Is this was his stuff this was his thing he had nothing to do with you. And he couldn't handle his emotions, for whatever reason, again that's not your Program. And he's now trying to have these connections and you're going to have to reconcile kind of that he wasn't able to do this before and now he's trying to do it and how do you manage that it wasn't your fault. When he couldn't do it before. And that it is okay that he tries to have that connection now right so that's that can be why it feels fake because well where were you when I was five, and now you want to be here and be connected and all lovey dovey when what I needed I needed that more when I was five."
247.0,Patient,"yeah you know it's funny I don't even think about it consciously like that, but that. right that feels true you know, and when yeah when I was five he was still there, it was when. Anything whenever anything teenage started, you know."
107.0,Provider,When I started again.
247.0,Patient,What did the what.
107.0,Provider,"When did the bullying at school, starting in Calgary."
247.0,Patient,Probably around there.
107.0,Provider,So that's a double insult.
247.0,Patient,"Right God yeah and you know, he was going through really bad problems with my mom at the same time, I think I told you, I think my mom cheated. yeah and my dad just kind of like checked out."
107.0,Provider,"So maybe part of what was happening for you, he didn't know how to help you he couldn't help himself and he just checked out."
247.0,Patient,It makes a lot of sense. You know i'm glad I have kids. yeah because it does give me a little bit more of empathy for them as parents.
107.0,Provider,mm hmm.
247.0,Patient,"You know I go back and i'm like this is tough. yeah no. yeah this stuff that I would be like all the rest of it be angry about i'm like. Okay, you know this is hard, this is really hard. um but yeah like he did kind of disappear all around that time that things started to get really bad for. At least that's my perception of."
107.0,Provider,"yeah, but it does you know that's your. percent yeah and that's that's what's internalized for you."
247.0,Patient,yeah. yeah wow I mean think about it that way.
107.0,Provider,"And it will make sense, because of. The picture of that right, because he was supposed to be your protector your dad."
247.0,Patient,"yeah I read it becomes a bully. In my house to. A wonder, I like have this part of me that hates them so much."
107.0,Provider,"Well, and then to add insult to injury, because apparently i'm going to be good at that it's not a mistake that you use his pills. Right."
247.0,Patient,"He was with them, but yeah I know, but at the same time, you know if he was a little bit low and he had to be in pain for him."
107.0,Provider,Not that you were trying to do it.
247.0,Patient,"Yes, you're right, but this."
107.0,Provider,"Whole that's why, and I, the only reason I I need to pull that out right now is because this is a pretty strong layered emotional cake, for you and the only way we can work through it is to really understand how it slices. so that you can appreciate all the different things that come up for you in any given moment it's layered with. Where did he abandoned me. I was bullied. I believe in back. i'm angry. I heard him he hurt me like there's all of that."
247.0,Patient,yeah. And yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Probably that huge emotional cake that you're cruising around with and then, when you get stressed out Steve you serve that cake to Steve because. it's all this stuff that's been kind of sitting with you that you haven't had a chance to really unpack and understand so. He must, he must be the same way. he's going to end in you right he's going to leave you in a time of need. he's hurting you because he's doing all of this on purpose and so you're gonna hurt him it's that same cycle."
247.0,Patient,yeah. That weird that I feel a little bit of relief.
107.0,Provider,"Now it's huge. We just popped the big emotional that say only way, you can heal is to know kind of what's all that stuff that's in there that's been percolating. yeah."
247.0,Patient,I had no idea.
107.0,Provider,"Well, I mean."
247.0,Patient,there's a lot others yeah there's a lot of other stuff.
107.0,Provider,"That that feels like maybe that's kind of the core of it and then. You know other things filled out, but now you can start to really heal that core wound and work through that."
247.0,Patient,yeah yeah I feel a little bit of hope for that for the first time. I ever oh.
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah. cuz you know it's.
247.0,Patient,Lena I have so much anger in me.
107.0,Provider,yeah but I.
247.0,Patient,mean like a lot of that comes from now. yeah.
107.0,Provider,"You were a little kid even though you weren't five you were still young you are so vulnerable, and it was a it just happened to be a double whammy. squealing home. Basically, your whole life. yeah was under attack."
247.0,Patient,"Really, was it really was really, really was. Oh, my God. i'm so glad to be sober."
107.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah."
247.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,So. it's all good.
247.0,Patient,yeah right.
107.0,Provider,"But I think now, you can when you find yourself, you know you're really good at being attentive to your awareness, so the next time you have a surge of anger. You can now probably you might have some you know very interesting angry cry moments where you're going to be still angry and maybe crying too or really upset because. you're going to start finding the alignment and where this all kind of came from and how this all came to be so Stephen the kids might kind of go, oh no she's oh. Oh, we lost her. mom coming back or. She really just kind of fly off the deep end, but I think that's good right, you need to detox you need to match all these emotions. opposite of a side of Angers fears are starting to kind of see that other side of the coin, now, and now you can connect to that on a different level on a level that's really meaningful and understanding for you."
247.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,As a big one.
247.0,Patient,yeah that was. It was a big one.
107.0,Provider,"So. Little sprinkle to this lovely little emotional cake is that moms in there too right because mom had the affair mom has her own kind of abandonment stuff that's been connected all this mom. didn't stay present so all of that, you will work through as you really understand and appreciate where this is coming from. And it's we're not interested in blaming anybody or pointing fingers are getting mad what's done is done, but you need to understand kind of where your young self is reacting from so that you can heal from that and work through it."
247.0,Patient,mm hmm. That makes a lot of sense. You are very good at your job Lena.
107.0,Provider,"Well, you let me be present here, so you know. So I think you know with that huge Epiphany. it's really important to do exactly what you're doing give yourself some time for reflection so. yeah maybe this weekend, or even today, if you can but. You know, take go take some time to. For me it's being outside you know go for a walk in the park or go somewhere and just kind of. allow yourself to just let that soak in and obviously it's going to take a while, but give yourself time to not try and figure it out so much as just let it really wash over you the reality of all of that. So what kinds of things do you have planned for self care, this weekend, do you have a busy weekend, or do you can you have some time to."
247.0,Patient,i'm going to polities on Sunday morning. Nice if I told you that's my new thing.
107.0,Provider,You know.
247.0,Patient,He goes to the gym on Saturdays and I go on Sunday morning. Sorry. didn't really nice. Go and. knock on wood i'm starting to enjoy my kids company now like on the weekend. Good it's not like all work wow.
107.0,Provider,"yeah exactly when they're young, you have to be you know every."
247.0,Patient,Australian hundred percent yeah it's a hypervigilance thing it is it's really intense. yeah but they're starting to get to be a little bit of fun. You know. logan's going to be one next week.
107.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
247.0,Patient,I know. I know.
107.0,Provider,unhealed is Chi.
247.0,Patient,guys two and a half. Logan is in everything. she's fast she's a busybody she's opinionated.
107.0,Provider,Is she a baby Steve.
247.0,Patient,"Yes. it's so funny even like when he puts on gangster rap and ties like yeah like see, this is not appropriate she's sitting there like rocking back and forth it's so loud like it's hurting my ears."
107.0,Provider,"A bully. Probably are a little bit not, this is not diagnosable but that sounds a little add. Though totally totally."
247.0,Patient,need a lot of stimuli. yeah hi. Not these two.
107.0,Provider,"Well, the Nice part about it being balanced and cross cross the gender, if I can say that out loud, you know. yeah I insist that it allows for actually a bigger balance in the family. So allow for everybody to kind of find their rhythm it's not yes. dad was son and mom with daughter it's that Nice cross. Re everybody gets. Totally fine their space. Totally good."
247.0,Patient,"Another good thing this weekend my my younger brother lives my parents right now. Okay, and they bought a House like. oh two blocks from us."
107.0,Provider,Oh wow.
247.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, I have to tell you it's like 200 square feet, bigger than our House. Oh it's if you're gonna die three bedroom two bath and they bought it for $1.65. million yeah."
107.0,Provider,America is very expensive here.
247.0,Patient,very expensive.
107.0,Provider,Oh.
247.0,Patient,So anyway i'm happy for them. But yeah it's crazy but we're so happy that they're going to be around the corner from us. And how to my parents house. You know it'll add another layer to everyone. Having more space a.
107.0,Provider,Little breath.
247.0,Patient,back to normal normalcy whatever.
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
247.0,Patient,um. yeah so they're moving into the new house this weekend good. yeah yeah it'll be a good weekend nothing major plan just dinner with family and. that's about it.
107.0,Provider,"So I, you know as you prepare to be around family and would be important for you to just continue to kind of let yourself have these quiet moments ahead of time in anticipation, this is going to be an adjustment period as you let that realization wash over you."
247.0,Patient,mm hmm.
107.0,Provider,yeah but.
247.0,Patient,"Instead of me. Important, thank you for the reminder."
107.0,Provider,"yeah you just take it slow, because this is a big one. yeah good good i'm glad that we were able to kind of put that, all together, and really see that, because I think that's going to help you have. You know, some really good understandings and really be able to move through that not necessarily quickly, but have things connect in a way that makes sense. yeah feels more manageable sooner."
247.0,Patient,"yeah yeah absolutely. feels good it's heavy but that feels good, I have a lot to just like think about I think. yeah yeah. I wouldn't like to go too long without talking to you again."
107.0,Provider,"You know so. yeah yeah now let's figure that out, I I saw it again. you're the only person who has like 12,000."
247.0,Patient,I know I got an. alert this morning that I invite for September 2020. I was like.
107.0,Provider,"So I saw something in the calendar for next week and I was like, why is that there, so I deleted it so knowing that I was seeing you today is like it's okay that i'm deleting this because. i'm glad you're here, and if I if she gets some strange alert, which is very likely I can explain that, once again, there was a."
