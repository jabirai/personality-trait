17413.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
706.0,Provider,Do you prefer Michael or Mike.
17413.0,Patient,Either or domain.
706.0,Provider,"So today we're meeting to complete your bps. And that's just a bunch of questions that we get some background on you, so we know what direction you know therapy can go."
17413.0,Patient,As far as like what your.
706.0,Provider,goals will be um so first why don't you tell me what brought you to bright heart.
17413.0,Patient,"i'm just tired from one to try some different a big con addiction cycle for quite a few years now, and I just i'm tired, I want to do something different."
706.0,Provider,Okay okay so um have you tried any other treatment programs.
17413.0,Patient,"yeah like I was, I was on suboxone program before. And it was just. It was so far away was hard for me to get there and. that's pretty much what happened."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so um let's talk a little bit about the. Debt cycle, so when did you first start using anything how old, are you."
17413.0,Patient,1415.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and what were you using at that time."
17413.0,Patient,Alcohol marijuana okay.
706.0,Provider,"And then, where did you go from there."
17413.0,Patient,"cocaine crack did that for years and then went to the heroin epidemic started by like I tried EPI in the early 90s whoa in the mid late 90s, but I didn't add one didn't like you know what nobody doing and whatnot so. it's probably like oh way. When I got called into the heroin and bit know thing on."
706.0,Provider,So um when you were 14 and you were drinking and using and then it sounds like it just kind of progressed from there as or can you connect that with any anything in your life any. Any trauma or any event or anything.
17413.0,Patient,That really was just there's the crowded Alvin grew up with that's what we use our spirit man into and it's just kind of like an experimental thing and thereby was doing.
706.0,Provider,That makes sense um so it just kind of started out as some experimentation and then formed a dependence.
17413.0,Patient,"And then, it just now."
706.0,Provider,"So how many how many years, would you say that you have been. dependent any addiction."
17413.0,Patient,there's been 30 years probably 30 years okay.
706.0,Provider,And during that 30 years have you had any times the sobriety.
17413.0,Patient,Let me just times when I go to jail prison.
706.0,Provider,So not nothing out of incarceration.
17413.0,Patient,"No, not really I mean maybe little little lapses, but nothing permanently and nothing."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, what about you, we talked about your suboxone treatment that you were you were before that you said you're having difficulty getting to. um besides that program have you been in any other treatment programs Inpatient or outpatient."
17413.0,Patient,know just when I was when I when I was like 15 I was in an outpatient Inpatient and it was in Atlanta Georgia. My family pay for me to go to protest. That was for six months that's the.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and when you came on came out of there you hadn't um did you have any time of sobriety after that Program. No. No, you just get on me yeah. That tends to happen when you are forced to go somewhere. You and you're in you're not in that mind frame of recovery. Basically, will relapse when you get out because recovery is a choice. Right addictions, not a choice your body tells you now you're addicted it's not a choice it's a disease but recovery is a choice, and so, if you aren't on board with that recovery typically your your brain will went over, and you will go back to us. Right, so that doesn't surprise me i'm all right detox Have you ever been to a detox Program. How many times have you been to detox."
17413.0,Patient,"Three Okay, maybe four."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you did and went back to using or what was the situation with that."
17413.0,Patient,"yeah just. You know, most of detox programs around my area anyways it's like three or four days and you're out and it's just not enough time. I mean it is if you're maybe if you're going straight to. A treatment Center from there something, but just go from there right back to the streets just just not."
706.0,Provider,When you were incarcerated so obviously when you get incarcerated you detox you have to hit you can't get you know get your drugs or any medication. So you probably have detox each time that you've been incarcerated.
17413.0,Patient,Just yeah.
706.0,Provider,Okay um and that was obviously without any medical supervision.
17413.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, I mean they kind of supervising and give you kind of confirm is but. For the most part, is nothing."
706.0,Provider,"Okay okay so did you have any. Any seizures or anything, while you were detoxing."
17413.0,Patient,I mean hallucinating I mean no no booze pacesetter to Caesar but i've elucidated.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
17413.0,Patient,"i'm really surprised like. Last Friday was the last day I use and i'm as much as i've been using i'm kind of surprised it. For honestly that that it was rough for three days but. uh huh it was it was I was able to get through it. yeah and and I didn't have nothing. Like I did a lot of lot of fluids and stuff like that, like but I didn't really have nothing to comfort me."
706.0,Provider,yeah i'm know that that's that's fantastic I mean that just shows that now your head is in recovery.
17413.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"you're making that choice So hopefully this time you'll be successful and then obviously the suboxone will help. Get you there, I mean that's going to take away your cravings it's going to take away all of that, and then the therapy is going to help you, with your triggers and. You know just making those better decisions and re formatting the pathways of your brain so everything doesn't lead back to that drug. Because right now Everything leads back to that drug because that's what you did all day every day how am I going to use where, am I going to find it. How am I going to pay for it, who am I going to get it from you know, am I going to be able to find it today or am I going to be sick and so now that that's gone now you get to reformat your life and your brain to go a different direction. Right so um let's talk about your mental health, do you have any mental health diagnosis. No Okay, have you ever had a mental health evaluation. yeah Okay, and they didn't diagnose you with anything. Okay. Have you ever had any mental health treatment, even as a kid or anything like that."
17413.0,Patient,Well okay.
706.0,Provider,"um any suicidal ideation and your history. What about homicidal ideation. Well, any self injurious behaviors. Okay, what about in your family is our mental health issues or substance use."

17413.0,Patient,I mean that's just yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Coming around a lot of alcohol yep yeah that's just you know that industry in the service industry like restaurants and bars like you're guaranteed to find a lot of drugs and a lot of alcohol and a lot of people that use them and so. If you're trying to recover sometimes that's not the best job to have. All right, so you had mentioned a few times about your being prison jail, so what is your legal history, what does that look like."
17413.0,Patient,Okay it's always like selling drugs or Robin or whatever supply my drug me just what I did and. I got multiple convictions okay.
706.0,Provider,So how long were you in prison for.
17413.0,Patient,"I got probably 17 years and. i've done already 17. I did. I did I did a eight straight Okay, but like this, you know i've been out since I got out in 2019. Is the longest i've stayed out probably ever."
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so how many times have you been to press on. seven seven and your longest stint that you served was eight years or eight years okay yeah so um. when's the first time that you went to prison."
17413.0,Patient,9499 yeah 9493 94.
706.0,Provider,"And how old, are you."
17413.0,Patient,20 maybe.
706.0,Provider,20 okay so you've been in and out of prisons and you were 20.
17413.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,And you're how old now.
17413.0,Patient,i'll be 48 two day three day okay.
706.0,Provider,So for for the last 28 years you've been in and out of prison.
17413.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"So um. That in itself is a trauma that you've experienced because President creates trauma you see things and hear things and know things in prison as prison creates trauma, you know, even if its secondary trauma just because you see it and it doesn't happen to you it's. It can be very traumatizing and then getting out after being in is also a certain kind of trauma, because a lot of things change while you're in prison. You know, because the world doesn't stop it keeps going, and so, then you come out and it's like waking up and not knowing where you are there's so many different things. You know, and so it's you know that can be a trauma and it's tough to that's hard to adapt it's hard to reintegrate back into society. Right so i'm so good for you you've been out what so 19 2021 but two years you're you're out. And now you're in a program So hopefully. you'll never go back."
17413.0,Patient,"Oh, so I hope I hope I never got experienced it again."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17413.0,Patient,nobody's been harder to as I get older when I heard them of when. It gets you know just cuz my age and it's. You know just tired of it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and and things are different to you know, things are different than now than they were in 94 when you go to person, you know. presenter people are doing yeah so um alright So what do you like to do in your free time, what are your hobbies."
17413.0,Patient,"And you know I like I like to shoot pool, but I know it's like everywhere, I go to shoot boys it's alcohol related so i've kind of faded away from that, but I like to do models i'm i'm a bill model cars and. I like to fly drones I got some hobbies I do a sister expensive, but now that i'm sober i'll be able to to do those things more. than I was."
706.0,Provider,"you're not going to be spending money on drugs, so you can spend money on your hobbies and that's a that's a great use of that money because you're going to need something to fill your time."
17413.0,Patient,Because one of.
706.0,Provider,"The biggest reasons of relapse is not just just stressors and things like that, but also having too much time on your hands, because your whole world revolved around that drug. All day. Every day, and now if it's not there, what do you do with that time so that's you know, the first thing that I recommend that. People do when they come into recovery is to get on a you know consistent everyday schedule like you get up at this time, you eat at this time, you do this at this time, because if you can do that, then you know it. Once you get through that schedule. that's one more day and recover, you have, and then you move on to the next day, and after a while it just becomes habit and you have to think about it anymore. yeah you know you just do those things every day um because you have to fill that time that's that's one of the big things so that you don't get stuck in your head. um Have you ever been married or anything like that."
17413.0,Patient,yeah okay married and divorced was.
706.0,Provider,"married divorced twice not currently married. No, do you have any children."
17413.0,Patient,29 and 25 okay.

17413.0,Patient,yeah okay good relationship yeah got one my oldest daughter is in addiction to but. she's she's she's presently in a sober living home hopefully that goes but.
706.0,Provider,"yeah hopefully those those are really good homes, I mean they. They weren't for a lot of people did she have the same problem with heroin. Was that her drug of choice as well."
17413.0,Patient,When I say. Excuse me.
706.0,Provider,"I said, your daughter that's in the sober living house with her drug heroin as well."
17413.0,Patient,yeah yes ma'am.

17413.0,Patient,Oh that's my oldest daughter she's 29. She uses and then my youngest.
706.0,Provider,"Is the twins they're 2525 year old Oh, my goodness, and they don't use anything."
17413.0,Patient,yeah okay.
706.0,Provider,And you feel like you have a good relationship with author.
17413.0,Patient,yeah definitely perfect.
706.0,Provider,"that's great um so on a day to day basis, how would you rate your stress levels."
17413.0,Patient,I mean lately since like lately is probably a smith did like moderate it's not bad.
706.0,Provider,What would you say are your major stressors.
17413.0,Patient,Just just stressing about getting back on my feet and getting everything I need you know as a man should do have your own everything. patient has always been a virtue with me so.
706.0,Provider,You like that immediate gratification.
17413.0,Patient,You know.
706.0,Provider,"For things yeah. that's for so a lot of people that fall into addiction, they have that immediate gratification because if you use a drug, you get immediate gratification you don't have to wait for it. happens right away so that's pretty common um How would you say your self esteem, is how do you feel about yourself."
17413.0,Patient,"I mean, since i've been like the last week or so it's been kind of low, but I think a lot of that's going through withdraw and. still coming into. How i'm supposed to be filling and whatnot but it for for what's going on in my life it's it's okay i'm it's not great, but it's not it can be better, but I know it'll gradually get better."
706.0,Provider,"Absolutely, the more that you like you said get on your feet become more independent kind of get things get stable again and all of those areas of life, the more the better you'll feel about yourself. Right, you know anybody that has spent you know 25 plus years in the cycles of addiction. Has guilt and shame because they've done things and they they've done things and said things and done things to people even that they love that. You can't take back."
17413.0,Patient,Until those on you.
706.0,Provider,"And so until you process through all that and then move forward, it just sits on you and that pushes down your self esteem So those are things will work, work on therapy to is just. Talking through some of those things i'd sit in your head like I can't believe I did that, because talking about them processing them and getting rid of them is going to allow you to be free from them. Right so um alright, well, we are done with a DPS did you have any questions for me."
17413.0,Patient,No ma'am.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what you're going to want to do is continue to go to your groups, you know, every week and then the virtual clinic where you checked in you'll make appointments with them to have therapy with me twice a month. And then I will just start you know chipping away and see what we can do to to get you moving towards your goals. Okay sounds good."
17413.0,Patient,So so use get i'll get an email or something with you you'll reschedule or I have to schedule it or how's it go.
706.0,Provider,For the therapy you go the virtual clinic where you checked in.
17413.0,Patient,Right.
