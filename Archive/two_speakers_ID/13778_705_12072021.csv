And the daily logs are you learning anything new about yourself."
13778.0,Patient,"I am. i've learned that my energy really depends on how much sleep I get. Not just like you know being tired or be groggy but, just like. How I guess motivated I am to do things energy wise so that interesting to know. I also. Playing chess and I thought it was. For yeah I really like keeping the log so far. very interesting."
705.0,Provider,"It isn't just like you're aligning already when you don't get sleep then you're not as motivated and then it makes sense to Where, then, when when you're having those days, is it helpful just to know okay here's what's going on."
13778.0,Patient,it's all.
705.0,Provider,Like a lack of sleep daily routine versus that sleep daily routine. Definitely mm hmm.
13778.0,Patient,"interesting. And so i'm sure you put the diamond dots paintings, where people put little like gems I started doing. that's Hella fun."
705.0,Provider,I had never heard of it until someone told me a couple of weeks ago and I I think it's just the neatest I guess their little. Does it come like with the design and then you put. The little.
13778.0,Patient,yeah it's kinda like a. PIC my number. For a lot less mess. As long as you're careful about you know not spelling everyone.
705.0,Provider,"i'll cry. It seems like you would almost get into a rhythm, while you're doing that that would be very relaxing."
13778.0,Patient,It is it's so relaxing I love it.
705.0,Provider,How about the change of weather where it actually kind of sprinkled.
13778.0,Patient,"I like it, so I like the rain I love this smell right after it rains of the white earth that's like my favorite smell."
705.0,Provider,Okay well that's good and you've had plenty of that today. yeah.
13778.0,Patient,"don't like going out in the rain, but like."
705.0,Provider,"You mean you don't have the the galoshes and an umbrella, and all that to go out something in the rain. appreciate from a window. Yes, okay. Now before it was raining, though, and you talked about maybe getting outside the House and you know, seeing a little bit of a sudden. you're able to."
13778.0,Patient,"Yes, so. It was mainly we're running errands but, once you got home I kind of sat outside a little bit that was nice. enjoying the breeze. That was nice."
705.0,Provider,On those days when you went outside Rebecca did you notice any changes like you know. Thought wise filling wise.
13778.0,Patient,"Really, I noticed, I felt better afterwards, but it wasn't like really like that really like my thoughts right. Like oh that was."
705.0,Provider,"That would be something else to with the logs to see I mean hopefully you're able to keep that up that sounds like a good plan. Speaking of planning, I think your family's planning, I mean your mom surgeries pretty soon right. Oh that's one, two or three weeks away. Well it's the week of Christmas obviously you probably already know that."
13778.0,Patient,"me and my dad are in charge of Christmas so that will be interesting. Like I have faith in my belly. I love cooking and I watched my mom and my mom bake it make it. Make it for like several like a decade, so I have faith in my abilities yeah so."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and then. And then my dad is just like."
13778.0,Patient,it's not hard the festival.
705.0,Provider,Oh that's Nice that the tour here and a team up.
13778.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm excited I love picking i've been in charge of doing them for like five years now. So that's that's my specialty."
705.0,Provider,that's usually the main course. yep okay. And so out running errands is that in preparation to why your mom's able to to to go out and get everything yeah.
13778.0,Patient,yeah we're definitely. Like to stay popping only it's you know Christmas.
705.0,Provider,"well. How are you handling knowing I know you said before you know, knowing mom was going to have outpatient surgery, but just going under."
13778.0,Patient,"so nervous and so. I felt a little bit better I talked to my mom about it, not about her business but, just like what's going to happen has been a hot topic in our House, and I do feel a little bit better now that we've talked about it a while a little bit. You know and. Of course it's happening at scripps it also makes you feel a lot better. and i'm excited for my mom to have it, because I know it will help with. And she won't be in pain, which is slowing down standing sitting walking you know she'll be able to feel more comfortable and that's what's kind of get me through that."
705.0,Provider,"Oh that's good that you have to talk with your mom then. Oh it's the communication between the two of you seems like that, since you got a hospital that. Even more you know. Nice conversations about some of the more challenging difficult things that are going on."
13778.0,Patient,"spin Nice. And i've been more open about when i'm not. doing well. which I I know it makes me nervous to hear i'm not doing well, but I also think it helps it helps both my parents to know right."
705.0,Provider,"Right. yeah, and that makes sense, you know repeating the same thing with both of your parents if they're your role modeling for them also that you know let's say moms having a bad day, especially after surgery that she can share with you to like hey it's not you. it's just what i'm going through right now in the pain. Now. Staying connected with people from the hospital that you met."
13778.0,Patient,"Yes, so we haven't met in person, or at least they met up but I remember right or it's too late at night but we've been testing, like every day in a group chat which I love it."
705.0,Provider,that's great that you kept that. social aspect that you really enjoyed from the hospital.
13778.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's really nice. i'm very happy that we actually ended up so chatting because last time I was a monster we're all like oh yeah you know we're chat chat chat and it never happened. So. i'm very happy to hear that are not here, but you know see that this stuff."
705.0,Provider,"Is there any reason why this time, you know, there was follow through and last time there wasn't."
13778.0,Patient,You know i'm not sure why like. I think it's because this time we were there all together for a lot longer.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13778.0,Patient,And we kind of. Truly bonded you know. So.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it sounds like 10 a different level, this time, where you know, everybody really is like friends for life and wanting to check in with one another. it's nice to because, once you go into you know, treatment and then the aftercare like the social aspect to me is is one of the most important after care and that you already know what to do a group, they already know what to do a group. and taking that out, you know what you're doing in your home life."
13778.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,How.
13778.0,Patient,they're really awesome.
705.0,Provider,I am sure to with with texting and. You know your sense of humor Rebecca i'm sure you're keeping everyone entertained do.
13778.0,Patient,"I think I got a lot more, this time out of being in the hospital than I did last time."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. it's good to the first things that you liked in there is like recreating them at home, where now at home, you of course have more independence in your own bed, and your own food and things like that."
13778.0,Patient,"is still so nice being I know it always be nice, you know. This is. The only downside was i've been having panic attacks at night, and I think that's just me coming down to the wall distress I have. been having nightmares."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
13778.0,Patient,"yeah it was. Nice, I can do without Nice."
705.0,Provider,"And you know so so you're having nightmares about being back in the hospital. This time, though, you were sharing that it was better than before."
13778.0,Patient,"You know, so it was better than the fact that the funds. But there is. I don't know if I showed this, but there was a massive fight. That broke out right next to me."
705.0,Provider,Are you sharing that.
13778.0,Patient,yeah and that was terrifying.
705.0,Provider,yeah okay.
13778.0,Patient,"And then there's also another patient who would not leave me alone waggle his eyebrows happy he kept trying to like touch my hand touch my shoulders, you know, a. dream come. True well. I just along those lines and kind of like bashing my dreams and it's just oh God it's awesome."
705.0,Provider,Are you able once you awake you know you're already work yourself up to say something to ground yourself or thanks something.
13778.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no I I wake up in it. Generally, my dog triggers right next to me, and she kind of wakes up when I wake up it's very odd. Because I off shift and wake up and it's like she knows and she's just like right. So that's very nice and that kind of. helps me. Not it does."
705.0,Provider,"yeah she's in tune with you. Have a nightmarish the intensity lessons, since you know let's say this week. compared to last week. yeah."
13778.0,Patient,And not it's like feeling.
705.0,Provider,"It does, because you just went through, and it was so fresh and your. Brain still trying to like sort it out and process like what happened, and that was out of the ordinary. And times to with you know, having that fight around you. Was it more of the the fear of like what what were some of your. things going on."
13778.0,Patient,"Like going through my head when it happened or. So at first when the guy just got shoved and like fell to the ground. And then it went through my head oh my God he's beating this guy I don't know where to go. So I sprinted and he's a David when my brain just kept going oh my God when he comes up to me, because I said something, but you know. Is he going to come in here is he gonna hurt someone else you know what what's gonna happen because it took stuff what felt like for every rose pay actually 10 second. run out of the nurse's station where it was right next it was right in front of the station. to break up the fight, but it was just like all these sorts of oh my God ready to try some cats. And is he going to say on the word is it you know, are we all going to have to be on high alert because they still keep America there's nowhere else for him to go, you know what's gonna happen. So it was. Like whispering."
705.0,Provider,"And then, and that was going through your head what fillings did you attach to it."
13778.0,Patient,Just terrified. hi if we might it. It kind of the feeling reminded me of when I was assaulted right after it was like oh my God the same feelings.
705.0,Provider,When you think about it today Rebecca like while you're sharing with me what feelings come up.
13778.0,Patient,"Just thinking about it, like my heart rates like up there, I can feel my heart beating my chest."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so not not terrified anymore so you're taking it now to more of an angel state. Yes, cry anything that you can you know, sometimes when something like a traumatic experience happens like that fight just broke out is there anything that you could say that's more reasonable self soothing."
13778.0,Patient,"like to say that. it's not happening right now, you know you're okay you're in a safe space. Not here is a big one."
705.0,Provider,"That sounds like a really good grounding one, two or they're not here and it gets your body connected, especially out of the deep sleep."
13778.0,Patient,So I remind myself that my dad's here.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13778.0,Patient,When.
705.0,Provider,When you were talking about it to Rebecca so you kind of bite your. Your finger now. yeah is that something that sometimes you do when you're anxious.
13778.0,Patient,i'm a cuticle. it's a bath after that.
705.0,Provider,"i'm. Just checking in to see because that's definitely then when you start to notice you do that it's. it's that. Okay something's going on with myself what is bringing on the interest fillings and I know we've just talked about it so it's it's almost like you, you have this in your hands are and he literally like okay let's let's let's let's implement some of those coping skills."
13778.0,Patient,yeah so like to chew my lip. was why sometimes it looks. I chew on the dead skin that's all my login.
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
13778.0,Patient,cannot be.
705.0,Provider,"Anything been successful, especially like, starting with the hands when you start to notice that you're finding your cuticles."
13778.0,Patient,"So, the best thing I find is prevention, so I wear a lot of chapstick in the winter and when it's colder so that way I don't get that layer of that skin. moisturized the heck out of my head. So that way I don't get that those flaky hard skin pieces to even be able to do it so that's what I find works."
705.0,Provider,"I was like a good solution, plus year old moisturized stuff."
13778.0,Patient,yep I don't get those old lady oh. My God I don't. I don't want. I want to be yelling for.
705.0,Provider,Especially for your hand modeling maybe you know how they do the rings and they show the other.
13778.0,Patient,"Yes, you know. The. future career."
705.0,Provider,"Oh so so today and what what mood, would you say you're in."
13778.0,Patient,"mood I feel very happy, you know."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. contented happy, those are both to you know really good combinations. How. Oh, I know today was more of a shorter check in is there anything that you feel you wanted to add to what you're already doing, or do you want to just keep this going with the mood monitoring. I know some of them are being put on the back burner with maybe doing things more locally, because mom surgeries coming up."
13778.0,Patient,"yeah that's definitely been kind of put on the back burner. I bet I think the tech scene with my friends, you know chatting with them is really helping so this. Thursday I have my book club that i'm going to go to. Okay, which I am very excited for kids I missed the past two months, the last much I miss good is in the hospital, but I also miss October so i'm very excited to see everyone down. i'm also looking forward to working on all my little projects, I have so i'm playing with my video game console so."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and to me Rebecca all what you were saying about the book club texting falls under your treatment plan to expand your socialization which you are doing, you know your network has really increased over the last couple of weeks."
13778.0,Patient,Which is really nice.
705.0,Provider,"With the book club, did you get like a heads up this is the book we're reading."
13778.0,Patient,"yeah so we get. to evoke a hot three months ahead, so you know for the next three months, what we're reading."
