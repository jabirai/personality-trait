214.0,Provider,"That Oh, I know I I didn't have time to look at it. So i'm just gonna look at it real now cuz. I always I always go. down is this time is that time in my time. yeah I am i'm thinking. i'm thinking it was a major kerfuffle but I haven't done that."
9959.0,Patient,I wrote down to 30 but that could be an error.
214.0,Provider,"No, I. I put it down right. I did yeah."

9959.0,Patient,yeah good good okay. Well yeah we we usually meet around 330 so.
214.0,Provider,You know what's going on.
9959.0,Patient,"i'm mostly good I did a whole bunch of stuff i've been avoiding for ages, first of all I got my blood work done last week for the the. thing yeah and so i'm seeing her tomorrow, and if they've got she's gotten the blood work which sometimes you know can take ages, but some fences like to this then i'll probably get pelted tomorrow. which will be awesome yeah."
214.0,Provider,i'm really excited about good good good.
9959.0,Patient,"So there's that and I did a bunch of stuff that i've just been having incredible avoidance about in terms of going forward that I just took care of I. made an appointment to get my hair cut which. I haven't i've been meaning to do for ages, but I just have been putting it off it's you know something I really need. And I just haven't called him to make an appointment so he's got to get back to me but i'm not sure when but i'm i'm going to do that and I made an appointment to get my eyes checked for glasses, because I really need that. When they're so far behind because the cove it that I couldn't get an appointment until February."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
9959.0,Patient,"yeah they're really I mean they're the best place in Santa fe and. But and they're worth it, I mean you know I could just go to some place and get my eyes checked, you know and buy glasses there, but these guys are incredible and their medical you know they're really good. Good every everything so it's worth waiting for. and Oh, and I downloaded the manual for my camera which i've gotten like nine months ago but it's a new camera and it's it's amazing I mean credible and it's I was trying to save up for like, but if they just so expensive, I mean. The reasonably priced one was like $3,000 and it's like and this one was yeah exactly and this one was on first of all, it looks like an old fashioned like a but. it's in some ways, better, and it was like 1200 it's a fujifilm and it's got everything and including an ability to mimic film, which is really amazing for me because that's how I was trained with analog and with phil and you know I miss it but. You know, it took ages to learn digital. So once I sort of get the basics of it down because it's very complicated to use it's not just like point and. Then i'm thinking that i'll be ready to take that that's nine month by. Class yeah once I get back from New Jersey. You know i'm excited about it, and you know, so I think and i'll have the money to sign up because it's not very much it's like $50 a month, but you know still that's been you know."
214.0,Provider,"So much for me, and when you go on two weeks before Halloween."
9959.0,Patient,"i'm going the 21st of October, so I guess that's like a weekend or so. And we might go away to a place. up on the Hudson. That like an airbnb or a verbal whatever it is for a few days that was leslie's idea and josh is but. So, and she was all excited it's this amazing house, I think I told you with a tramp trampoline and all sorts of cool stuff and you know so to get get away, and I mean josh and still have to work remotely but you know. it's good yeah very, very, very good, so you know i'm i'm. illogically apprehensive of I mean, on one hand, and I think so good, with josh and with Leslie and the kids are just so frickin amazing. um and part of the month of May is incredibly excited about. Sure, but the last three times that I was there, it was a nightmare, you know that was when things are so bad with josh and my parents were the first time they would die, and then they died. He was. A different person and but."
214.0,Provider,But the major component is gone.
9959.0,Patient,"Oh it's completely gone and. work through that and we've been wonderful consistent. For like to almost two years, so I mean it's that's i'm saying it's not logical i'm just part of me is that he he's gonna ask you know and it's gonna be."
214.0,Provider,A true saw the movie so you're thinking is the same movie yeah.
9959.0,Patient,"Like i'm weren't yeah yeah I get it, but remember that they've already I think there was already a plan."
214.0,Provider,To say you know what let's make everybody comfortable in a new location.
9959.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
214.0,Provider,"And I think that's a great idea let's not let's not have to relive the movie. Because it'll be present, and it may screw up mood, so I think this is a good thing."
9959.0,Patient,"Exactly, so I mean, I know that you know years and years and years ago when I had worked out so much about you know my relationship with my mother, my father that. You know I would when you came time to go to visit them I would be fine for like two or three days, but then and I know that she's common you know I would start slipping into these these patterns of reaction to them, despite myself, despite. No. yeah so you know i'm just. i'm working on it."
214.0,Provider,yeah it sounds like it's all you know manageable it doesn't sound like it's manageable or. we're looking for avoidance it looks like you know we're we're taking on enough that we can handle it the proper pace and it's comfortable and you know. As long as he's accountable you continue to do it. In the fashion that best suits you.
9959.0,Patient,"Exactly and if something does come up with josh things are so good, with us that I could just talk to him I. said look, you know I feel like this is happening and can we talk about this and you know I mean we've always had that kind of relationship until that brief you know relatively brief. period, you know where you know, one of the first phrases you knew was use your words, you know I mean you know he's and I see him doing that, with the babies to you know. stated or angry like that you know. To try and talk it through her instead of just acting out so. I you know I know that will be able to use our words if something comes up."
214.0,Provider,"phenomenal phenomenal. So, again just put you know a little time in a little patience, although you know you know we we want to get a and then the next exam we get a see below patient you go back to an A."
9959.0,Patient,Like can.
214.0,Provider,"You know, look don't don't use, you know this, the the the the coming down the hill because it's too steep, as this is the way it's always going to be. Sometimes it needs to have that leveling out of. You know rocks back and forth, and then eventually becomes you know just leveling so I I am believing right now what i'm seeing is the leveling of like an entire amount of different things."
9959.0,Patient,yeah I terms of taking care of myself.
214.0,Provider,"yeah the whole thing the whole you know you, you know you get you got about seven different spinning plates you haven't dropped them yet so like you know. you're you're now starting to understand, like you know you, you can discuss and talk about why I can't but as long as we keep discussing why can't win on finding out why we can. Right so exactly it gets stolen, and I know I get it, but I think you know you're patient enough to know like you know this won't be the only value fall into, but I think most likely your record time will be much quicker."
9959.0,Patient,"yeah exactly I think so, too, and you know I consistently without any kind of anxiety or avoidance and excited about you know, improving how I look, and you know my health, and you know, being able to see properly."
214.0,Provider,But again see I didn't even mention those things so when we start self care. We know there's a shift. yeah anytime they self care there's a shift. But sometimes we need to be careful that we don't we don't bring it up and then it gets minimized like yeah some yeah maybe i'd only my hair like so that's why I looked I let you run with that to you brought it back oh.
9959.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you now it's that's why I was so avoid know, that is, you know that, like no I don't deserve it kind of feeling and and now it's like I didn't even think of that like that it's just like God, I need to get my hair. done, which is yours. yeah exactly. i'm getting it all cut off it's it's long it's that down here. right because I haven't. Caught it and it grows really fast, but I want to cut it all off like you know very sort of French."
214.0,Provider,And yeah i've. got.
9959.0,Patient,A new start.
214.0,Provider,So this is good so how's the medications been.
9959.0,Patient,"Fine yeah good um. You know I find myself craving. Sometimes, to be numb you know I mean I guess that's that's you know craving. But I don't indulge it, you know I can't don't do it, because then i'll run out of meds but. For sure um you know. You know i've never attempted certainly ticket screenshots or anything like that, but."
214.0,Provider,that's.
9959.0,Patient,that's never been an issue for me at all so. yeah I mean good you know I again some cravings but manageable certainly.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
9959.0,Patient,"This is good yeah yeah exactly. i'm certainly not ready to type it down or anything like that. You know that's I mean, eventually, I want to do that, but you know it's so complicated by the pain to. Well, you know I mean that's yeah that's."
214.0,Provider,For sure for sure.
9959.0,Patient,"So, but I have also actually been focusing more and more on increasing my endurance physically like you know just walking a little."
214.0,Provider,"boom or bust right, you need to know baseline yeah. Point being in pain, no baseline and then. You know figure out from there, how you can increase this that's that's a good. that's a good that's also another very good one."
9959.0,Patient,"Well, the thing is is also, if I don't exercise that my spine gets much worse really fast, you know so and people. Very often don't understand that, because if you have pain and pain, when you exercise the the The thing that people very often do is avoid you know it's like okay well I can't exercise because it hurts, but then it gets worse and worse and gorgeous and. You know so there's. A basic amount that you know level that I want to get to that I wasn't you know because I was in the hospital so much and. My you know I wasn't I got out of shape basically so i'm trying very gradually increase that. You know just by walking and said."
214.0,Provider,"Listen, you know they the idea here is we're not asking anyone to do more than they can. But you know mobility to keep stretching and keep moving. yeah although could be could be painful it could be, I don't want to do it, but the the result of not doing it. is much greater than negative consequence yeah I agree."
9959.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean, I learned that years ago, so you know i'm just trying to up it. No, and you know what you were saying that baseline so it's not like it hurts more and more every time I do it it's still just you know certain level of pain. And then recovery and forcing myself to rest, you know, every day, so you know which is sometimes for it i'm like no I should be moving."
214.0,Provider,yeah I know I know yeah for sure. yeah so. i'm.
9959.0,Patient,Like slipknot it. sounds like New York.
214.0,Provider,New York.
