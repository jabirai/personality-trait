14437.0,Patient,100% because it's terrible.

14437.0,Patient,"Really, I didn't know that."
252.0,Provider,"you've just got to identify that you do first off right before you go to bed. right before you go to bed. You want to tell yourself, I have power over my jeans I can change the outcome to whatever it is that's better. Okay, this is what you want, in your brain. When you go to sleep. And now that you know that you might be able to start changing things in your dream like."
14437.0,Patient,"I hope so, because they're so intense i'll wake up somebody will random awake me I promise, thank God it's so bad like. they're so bad like i'm so happy I woke up."

14437.0,Patient,"Yes, I am in control."
252.0,Provider,I am uncomfortable I have the power. Of the power during. Right.
14437.0,Patient,And what you're trying to.
252.0,Provider,Do over your dreams is you're trying to kind of take your power back mentally.
14437.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"and say you are not no longer control me. and When you go to sleep with that mindset, you might be able to identify in your dream that it's a dream."
14437.0,Patient,I hope so.
252.0,Provider,"What, how do we want this outcome to go. Oh wait. And then you plan it and you think about it, and then you know, hopefully it'll start happening. Yes, right. Absolutely, but I do want you to ask Mary about the nightmare MED."
