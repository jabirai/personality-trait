6685.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And then we get in trouble. And if we have this list of things that we have thought about learning about or thought about doing or think we might like to do or, then you can put when you're getting bored and you can pull out this list and say Okay, what can I do right this minute. yeah i'm. While you're not working. you're gonna have to. bolster yourself against boredom. I mean just. And some of the things can be like like walking the dogs exercise. Possibly learning to cook something. That would be like healthy for you or that your team can handle. You know I mean. i'm grasping at straws here but. You know, trying to pull in some of the different needs that you have. You have to be able to eat. And you have to be able to eat healthy. um. Because when we get clean and sober um we're not exactly healthy. Because I don't know about you, but I didn't eat right when I was out there, doing my thing."
6685.0,Patient,Very little.
741.0,Provider,"Exactly not and and not because I wasn't hungry, but because. There wasn't anything left over. Because I spend everything I had on oh."
6685.0,Patient,that's good that's what we do.

741.0,Provider,hey.
6685.0,Patient,that's a prediction situation. with adults. Okay. From one side or the other but issue so so as an adult.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so you have the dogs there so that's actually a good thing too, because when you start feeling anxious. Animals are great."
6685.0,Patient,yeah.

6685.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"You know, having them to take care of. They kind of gave me purpose. get up in the morning. Because, obviously I lost custody of my son. um. But have I mean it's a slow process but rebuilding as possible. So you will be able to have you been married before. Never married okay. All right, well. At least you you've only got one child Is that correct. So you've got some work to do, as far as rebuilding that relationship with the child."
6685.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"But that's later on. When you're stable. So that's good so, are there any other issues that that you want to talk about that. Anything triggering you that you need help with."
6685.0,Patient,"Not right the second I mean if I do I do touch my sponsors in mind, which is good. yeah been trying to stay with us provide do stay away from everyone know i've been keeping my distance from anyone I used to. Show."
741.0,Provider,Well that's good.
6685.0,Patient,"Not in my face, you know I mean so much. Right and I got a different phone, so I don't even know anymore."
741.0,Provider,Right right that's good. Okay. um what are some of the other things that you're doing to take care of yourself.
6685.0,Patient,"Well i'm eating now, which is good and taking my medication, which now i'm functioning and. we're going to the meetings and stuff and then now Dennis is what i'm being concerned with so. I might have to get denser show some old ones that are broke off and that's what's causing trouble. Right so. Once I can get that done. Think i'll even feel better about myself, I was agonizing pain. And from there are not good, I don't know what i'm gonna do from there, but that's my goal at this moment to get that done."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
6685.0,Patient,"And they think of some other ones, you know. After that."
741.0,Provider,Exactly exactly. you'll get there you'll get there.
6685.0,Patient,"very young in this so far, but taking it day by day and."
741.0,Provider,"that's, the only way to do it."
6685.0,Patient,try not to get over stressed about anything.
741.0,Provider,Right right.
6685.0,Patient,First. About.
741.0,Provider,Are you doing any prayer or meditation or anything. like that.
6685.0,Patient,"I pray I pray. know, but those are used to get my uncle used to send me those two meditations every day and. Since I haven't got my new phone he hasn't been able to but yeah I used to do the meditation with that with prayer that he used to send me every day so. My guess is that. Those kind of Nice quick enough to."
741.0,Provider,"there's a lot of them out there are you attending a or na here okay yeah there's a lot of good ones out there for a. The other one that I used to use every once in a while is asked bill sees it. Little Red Book. And that's a good one, also because it's just topics. And I would just open it to a topic, you know, whatever topic God picked out from today, you know. yeah so um and those don't usually cost very much."
6685.0,Patient,Those little books yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And the other thing you can do is also take your big book, do you have a big book."
6685.0,Patient,"I did, but since I moved I don't think I do i'm not looking to get another one sure much."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
6685.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"cuz I used to have like a stack of them. That I do. And I used, and I would also use that just to open up. And okay read a paragraph okay there's my topic for today. For me to pray about and meditate on."
6685.0,Patient,Do.
741.0,Provider,So it's just until you can get other options. yeah you know. So um I would I would definitely ask my sponsor to help me get at minimum of a work.
6685.0,Patient,yeah well.
741.0,Provider,"um because you'll need to start working on specs. And it's never ever too early to start working the steps. i'm. want to get on those I mean you're you're you do step one before you ever get in the room. yeah you're you already know you're powerless. yeah or you wouldn't be here. So it's time to start looking at team. and see what you can do i'm. Trying to think what else other issues, we can talk about this that might be helpful to you at this particular point in time i'm not sure. i'm. you're not really ready to start working on a worksheet or anything I don't think i'm. I mean you already are one thing that you can do, you said that you've had a couple of things that were that had triggered you. yeah and you might do you have like a notebook or something that you can. write in Okay, I would start making a list of your triggers the things that pop up that trigger you. yeah um because I know for me. One of the things that that kind of took me off guard was um when I was messing around in the kitchen and I was overwhelmed by the smell of endeavor. That it triggered me I like flashbacks. And it surprised me. So you're gonna probably come across some things like that. Are kind of a surprise. and and start making a list of those triggers so that. When we get ready to do relapse prevention work. You can start making a plan on how to handle those things effectively. Not just being triggered by them and going okay now, what do I do. yeah you know. So um. that's an option. To kind of help them get moving on some of your relapse prevention planning. Okay. yeah all right, do you have another appointment. Have you scheduled another one."
6685.0,Patient,I don't think so.
741.0,Provider,"Twice a month. And i'm. Like is this time, good for you or."
