It took two hours, maybe even see a doctor, he was livid because you're here, because you have no gabapentin. Because you can use, you need to go home so i'll give you some for now, but i'm not writing a script so you need to go home all your doctor yeah I didn't give a name I don't do that. And you let him or her know that we only three sick people here and all and so, and there was a bunch of people that does the positive like over in the er. So they weren't too happy, I was there and then because I had a lot of symptoms, the nurse was so mean to me, she took up you know the test they run up your nose. shoved it. I thought I can go right to the roof of the House. And I mean. That was the hydrated and they want to give me an IV she put the IV needle in me, which I thought I should take my arm off. But she isn't connected so two hours later, the doctor says, well, we can give you fluids. And I was so upset and he made me feel like shit I was there I didn't take close I says out is good government I just left, I was treated so poorly I have never been treated like that at any point in my life I understood them, but it wasn't my fault, I mean so then she. did a script the next morning I got a call from bright heart, it was for eight, so I had to go every other day. And it's, on the other side of town, but I didn't care, you know I mean, so I went right away on them and then I felt better, but it was a nightmare it's been a nightmare this month, I feel okay now mentally but I was not good."

10049.0,Patient,"But I wasn't thinking I just didn't know I thought well you know when you're crying and you can't even hardly function. right because you're scared you know I mean it was like I just believe in being honest, so I could have just you know. waited a week to get them and then be set, you know mean and be crying and be anxious and be high anxiety level, I could yeah so. I was honest with her and I sent her an email. But moving to moving on to. You guys you guys tell each other what we've got about right or no."

10049.0,Patient,"At least you were honest I don't talk about the news because I think. that's between me and her it's not there, none of their business, you know at our group meeting you know i'm saying, and I know a lot of them are missing, and a lot of them have. You know relapsed and it's in you, then you came up with well in our program anyone who relapses doesn't get kicked out and I, that was a nice thing to say, actually, but the other thing that was bad about that. was like oh so I can go out and get drunk every night now I won't be kicked out or Oh, I can go out and do heroin my name will be kicked out see what I mean that was the only thing that. And I didn't say anything Julie, because you know what it's not my fault, and I think bright heart saved my life and I, and I will say that right heart literally has saved my life. Okay, literally."
416.0,Provider,"I mean i'm glad that you feel that way. yeah I want to loop back around to the gabapentin. stuff, though. So I mean we talked about every week in group we talked about like different skills and how to manage anxiety and. All of that. Right what. So, moving forward, I mean it happened right you took too much let's move forward but it's important that we look back and see what would I do differently next time."
10049.0,Patient,I wouldn't do it again. Because we're running what we can do and.
416.0,Provider,What would you do instead. How would you manage your anxiety without reaching for gabapentin in that too.
10049.0,Patient,"Well, because I was so sick it's not like I could go out for it. I do a lot of walking in my neighborhood anyway, and I work a lot in my garden now I don't have that because we had a frost and half from guide. So, and the other part, my daughter I don't talk about this, it means because. I don't want them to think it's a bracket kind of singer old and it has that but my daughter owns the House I live in so she bought a greenhouse you know. Like six foot by six foot, you know, so the ones I tried to save as men and I gave floor plans, I went down to see a friend and lucerne valley yesterday and they'll grow great extra tropical plants, so I gave her like to. I best guess into. Like oh. you're the one that look like tissue paper. That I can think what they're called now billion billion. billion alias. So I took I took power plants to her physical great there and they have a lot of heat so it's like 90 Then I come home and it's cold here, so my plants everything some some I saved. So they're in the greenhouse birds they weren't in the greenhouse it i'll be dead, and I mean that I have gardenia plants and they're two of those and I got. I believe I have no my business to make it the ones that I had. And I have some in their gain gain a plant so i'm glad I got to save some but it's kind of depressing a little bit because. i'm so used to working with my flowers, I saw the water and the greenhouse supports, which I already did this morning but um you know, put the heater on at night but um. I miss working in my yard and it's only been two days you don't if we don't even have a so now, I have no parts of my yard, you know it's all beer now is. i'm not depressed I just I don't like see I love summer I love to be outside to work in the yard that's my that's my hobby and my dogs.

And according to Dr fagan who was my main Dr up here said it takes 22 hours on a computer for any doctor to get a suboxone life, but he said, the reason that doctors don't already told me is there's tons of paperwork involved.

The day after they got out a lot of one girl I guess it and getting out of her three hours and she did an overdose of thumb. right when she got out the next day."
416.0,Provider,scary.
10049.0,Patient,"it's really any I was a beautiful place but. I knew those goals we're gonna say we're all there because it got gel three months or one think that oh one rehab and then you get out of jail now and you don't have to serve three months it wouldn't take that right. yeah I mean, and you know, we had to do the dishes by hand which is fine, we didn't have a dishwasher I I did the dishes most of time, but what i'm saying is that is that was, I was told to do. And then Saturday we had to do double scrub until it's stupid and I I talked to the one get lady, you know one camera name was she was willing to counselors because they were all they're all of them had been on drugs that's why their Conference, I mean are they all did something and. I don't mean you, but I mean they were all there, they would they would tell us that it would tell us their story, and when Kim tell me, I went out, and I said well i'm surprised by it yeah because you know how you get attached certain counselors."
416.0,Provider,yeah mm hmm.
10049.0,Patient,"And you know, I was there for 30 days and, to be honest, for me, 30 I was ready to get out of there, but what i'm saying is I said, none of these girls are going to go home. and eat off of China they're not they're going to go home and eat the same way, they were off of paper plates live like pigs, because they live like it's air and you're making them do stuff on Saturdays you know they're not going to go home and do all that they're doing. Because they have to do it as if it wasn't done we couldn't go out and smoke, you know that was the thing it wasn't done you can't go on smokes everyone's like rushed on Saturdays to get it done with some money, and then they come and chat then, but you know what. It would say, and I lived in the modular because I. had to pick cash is my insurance didn't cover any of it right, so they would come over and he say Linda this place is spotless and I said I keep up that every day. You know if you keep up with it stays nights but you live like bids, and it was a modular home and then he was bad what was bad for me when I was there. Because, for some reason, everyone knew if you're in a modular it's cash, so I was known as the rich woman living in particular, it was terrible. You know I mean, and then they take advantage of you, and they all I give them all cigar a lot of cigarettes is it and now and then concerts would say. What we can do you run out, and I said I would you know, because you know my daughter would contact or and Sundays. You know, but we took in tons of cigarettes cartons of them so they kept them in the office. You know there's a B, C and they're all going to be in the all new you know night help them see what he helped me out it's just because he's for girls have nothing so I give some cigarettes is there were, we were told not to give me I thought. You know, and some I was afraid of, there were a couple rough ones in there that mean they acted rough I mean i'm not used to being around health girls tough women, you know I mean. yeah that's a whole different atmosphere for me this little scary."
416.0,Provider,"So Linda with. With regard to that, I mean when you said that about you know, giving them lots of stuff and trying to take it kind of reminds me that you do that that's sometimes that's. yeah that's a challenge for you how how."
