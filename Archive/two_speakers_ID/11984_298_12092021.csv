11984.0,Patient,"See I used to be on when I was in treatment, I was on klonopin and then they switched me to how it all too. Because I would have to have the physical anxiety and then I would have the nervous anxiety in my mind."
298.0,Provider,"Now, did the klonopin help."
11984.0,Patient,Help physical.
298.0,Provider,"It helped the physical have you tried propranolol kind of investing it's a it's a blood pressure medication like clonidine that calms the body down it lowers your heart rate lowers your blood pressure. And now we. We use it for people who you know they we don't want to put them on a benzodiazepine so we calm their body down when they're anxious. mom. Okay, that that would be either clonidine or propranolol would be an option for you to take whenever you were having that feeling like you wouldn't have to be intermittently."
11984.0,Patient,"And it wouldn't I blood pressure, too low."
298.0,Provider,"I would be going with a low enough dose the trick is to find something that lowers it enough to. You know. yeah it's it's you need to be you mean to communicate if you jump up like really fast after take it and you feel a little woozy that's probably the medicine, then you'll know that you know it was just the medicine it's not gonna hurt you okay. um.

298.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's usually something that they do in a detox treatment Center people coming off of things. um where they."
11984.0,Patient,"Well, they had pulled me see I was on. klonopin I was on a really high dose because I had panic so bad, and then they switched me to how they were I had added how a lot because. I had the intrusive thoughts as well."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I gotcha and how they'll can be very effective. So propranolol the top doses like 40 milligrams you know, to the three times a day i'm going to put you on 10 milligrams. But i'm going to write the prescription like take two tablets, but if you if you get the job done with just one tablet that it calms your body down by then, then it's the right one, but I want you to feel like you have enough medication on board yeah. Take two tabs to and then let me know. It works best if you know that you're going to have something come up like if you know you're going to go to court or you know you're going to go out shopping or somebody coming over to the House if you pre empty it, it seems to work a little better. I have a kind of a funny story about propranolol with myself. So I know how it works, I went to my own doctor and said i'd like a prescription for."
11984.0,Patient,pamela.
298.0,Provider,"Right like Okay, and I said i'm really worried that i'm going to be too anxious around taking my boards my state boards right, so he gave me a prescription and I took it at home and I there was nothing to be anxious about So how could I know if it really worked. And, and so I. I put it in the car I went to go take boards and I was getting really nervous in the car thinking well what if i'm sitting in the wrong place. I better go inside and make sure that I have the right room and the boards and then i'll come back to the car and get everything that I needed and i'll take the medicine well I got up to the room where the testing was and they welcomed me and. Come take the exam nothing what I was expecting. I was expecting like this, I totally forgot, but my one chance to use the propranolol for it to work and I totally forgot because, like they. They did that. I do want to try it someday on myself to see, but I have. A I just don't have an anxiety problem as."
11984.0,Patient,"My whole family does and the crazy part was is we all like it's like my all my all my sisters my dad my mom and we didn't realize each of us happenings a problem until we were all together, like each of us said."
298.0,Provider,"have one isn't that fascinating. yeah epigenetics is so real. So real alright, if you respond well to this, I will gladly give you more, but you just let me know i'm giving you 30 tablets try it out, and let me know if it calms the body down I think we're just gonna have to keep rolling out things if this doesn't work. Okay, all right, do you need refills on anything else."
