148.0,Provider,"um did you come straight to my room. And it's gonna let the virtual clinic notes, so you get credit for this how's it going."
456.0,Patient,pretty good. Working a lot. The weather's really windy where i'm at so look outside so it's. miserable.
148.0,Provider,yeah really windy.
456.0,Patient,"start going all over the card at the at the at work, I mean like styrofoam bricks and box or sizes of like you know mattresses that you sleep on there just flying around all over the place."
148.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
456.0,Patient,"tumbleweeds the size of like i'm talking like this size of like bigger than garbage cans that you see on the streets, we got really big ones, and sometimes you get even bigger than that they're just rolling around everywhere bumping into our stuff. it's it's crazy and it's dusty, not to mention that."
148.0,Provider,You were any protection on your face or.
456.0,Patient,"Anything yeah I will. have to wear glasses and to wear your plugs so. I don't wear those things, I mean I work in a loud environment, so I wear that your plugs anyways keep my ears team and I were. Like a bandana kind of thing to keep keep to keep all this concrete in just regular old dirt out of my hair and a mask like a face mask breathe in as I can't breathe, with all that dust in my face. it's so bad get stuck in my eyes still like that I got teardrops but. I stopped for this morning I got a really bad one, I was tripping out, I had to run downstairs not move my eye in a way, because it was just so bad one tiny little thing. And it's like sharp stuff that gets in my eyes to its concrete from balls you know it's just this stuff sure sucks I get over it, though."
148.0,Provider,it's okay now.
456.0,Patient,"yeah it's cool now I got it out like right as as it happened, but I was blind for a little bit stopping at like four in the morning, oh no five in the morning. it's hard to see anyway."
148.0,Provider,Very.
456.0,Patient,scary to see me.
148.0,Provider,So how other than that how it's worked been.
456.0,Patient,"it's been it's been really good well it's been good, but it's been busy kind of. interesting because we got a new work work guy used to work with Adolfo. As his his history, you know caught up with him finally open that live in a crime field lifestyle he's been to prison and stuff but just never changed in. The last week or week and a half ago he got arrested I guess the COPs were waiting room and the street I don't know the exact details but someone told on him or something and that's why the COPs are at his house confiscated all his. Current criminal stuff that's there. And now we're training a new guy which is interesting and and I, like the guy he's really good he's paying attention and he's asking the right questions so that's a huge huge really for me."
148.0,Provider,yeah you usually don't enjoy training new people.
456.0,Patient,"It can be yeah because you can kind of tell with our job at batch plan is only two or three people that work there, they do own a only do certain things, and you can kind of tell right off the BAT. If they're going to make it or not, and it's. And it's not like a judge of character is just their work ethic, and like maybe their attendance as well. You can kind of decide guys not going to work out and. Every single time we've said that they don't work out Adolfo wasn't like that I was like hey he's kind of wishy washy. I think he gets it he understands it. You know he's kind of stuck in his ways, but he came to work, not all the time, where you came to work and he got he got the job done, and you know. History caught up with him and he had no choice but to leave. But this new guy Ramallah is really good and it's a huge trade off my shoulders, because I have to do his job on top of my job correctly and make sure that he gets it done while he's not around me like operating machinery and rejecting. Cement concrete me. and what's funny is we know the same group of friends like. I mentioned. In New someone and he said yeah I know that guy, and this was like from high school days and I said, well, what about such and such and says yeah I know, like, I, too, and I go man, I was like my best friend. And I asked him how old he was he was 30 and I was, like all right man, we went to the same we went to the same school we establish that but we're obviously the same age, so I was like yeah. I think we went to the same like we went to school together and stuff i'm remembering your face and my like when I think about high school, I remember seeing you somewhere. And then we mentioned more names and more history and everything was matching up and there was like. I was saying something that this friend did that was only that guy did he's like oh yeah he always did that kind of stuff like that that means we're definitely do you like we went to the same school, we know the same people. And I showed him pictures and they're like yeah that's that guy so I came home that day and i'm like okay this guy remember his name like you know I remember him man, so I looked at my Yearbook. And I see him there he's like two names away from me, which is kind of funny so i'm like that's why I remember i'm using my yearbooks it's only like a couple of names away because he his last name is Sam last minute."
148.0,Provider,and
456.0,Patient,"yeah I after I saw his face in your book, I was, like all the memory started flooding back, and I know that guy he's be used to be friends, but he doesn't remember that you're. Not just friends, but we used to be friends and Mike he only he left after junior year but we had we had classes, together, we had some friends are you taught. I remember all of this, I haven't mentioned it to him that I remember at all, but I go man he's used to be friends with you like in a way, then he he got in trouble with the law and share nothing crazy but. Something something was like stealing or whatever, but. He grew up he used to be very immature very like just. headstrong and authority, he doesn't like authority and lead one to 80 from what I see now he's very mature it's paying attention. I don't know I just like damn dude Scott and it's by the i'm happy that I get to work with someone I used to know in a way, and I didn't know it at first until I worked with him a little later and it just makes it that much easier, a little more easy. And that's kind of like my biggest stress right now it's really just work just."
148.0,Provider,sounds like it's going pretty well that you've had a little bit of relief around your work situation.
456.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and then Adolfo was showing his laziness I guess before he was leaving he just wouldn't show a be every Monday or every Friday appear the week or every week it was clock when he missed, I think, like 40 days already this year. So it's like do this over a month, you know, and then, so I. mean our calendar. On paper, I get you set up a page and you see you know I don't fall off Monday about for off Friday, but on Friday it's always a Monday or Friday so it's a three day weekend and it's like it's hard not to notice those things dude. right they see these things, and no, no, he just never took this job serious and that the stress me out because I had to do extra work."
148.0,Provider,yeah which is not really fair for you.
456.0,Patient,"That are no no that's kind of gone now, which is nice. Good."
148.0,Provider,Good yeah i'm glad that you're feeling a little bit better about them have more support at work with somebody actually showing up and wanting to do the work wanting ask questions wanting to learn that.
456.0,Patient,"and actually executing it well, as you know, doing the job well you know you can anyone can drive, but can you operate is the question. And he can operate and he's learning. he's learned really he's a good visual learner and I did I when i'm training people I. I explained things and like extreme detail but it's simple, though, and he was telling Bob I for me was like dad was training me man, you know. He explains everything like super detail and I think I can handle it. Once I get out there and try it myself, because I know all the little things that maybe someone else wouldn't say when they're training. I just blurted out and like this little tiny little thing might not mean anything at first when you're doing this every single day at work. That little thing makes a huge difference, so I that's why I mentioned it to him, I mentioned that before even train and why am I say a bunch of things man, but everything i'm telling you it's not a waste of breath it's. Good I didn't know. He understood and then apparently it's showing that right there just makes me so much happier."
148.0,Provider,yeah it's also nice to feel hurt like that you know.
456.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah appreciate it for that, like recognizing it."
148.0,Provider,Totally totally yeah good um do you feel like you're managing your stress from work okay.
456.0,Patient,"I mean I I don't I don't think so. I mean, I think probably handle it and better ways I mean when I get stressed out I just don't talk to anybody, I mean I don't care I don't care, who it is I don't talk to anybody, I just want to relax by myself just. just get over it, because it's nothing against anyone personally it's just I I just don't I I get a very good very, very impatient when I get irritated at work. I don't I don't explode on anybody or yell at anybody or anything like that. I just you know might show a little fucking a little body language or whatever or. I don't know that is sometimes sometimes I mean like I I go to work. I go to web in there for five years and i've missed seven days and that's because my son was born Okay, so I don't miss any days i've been there for five years and. I have worked overtime an hour every single day and five hours every single Saturday. So I don't know how many days, that is, in a row it's probably good for my retirement, but at the at the at this juncture, it i'm still not even making it like comfortably I mean i'm all right i'm Okay, but you know I just feel like I could be a little a little more I. guess recognition or appreciation or something like that, because they got they got these guys that you know they're just making like twice as much money as we are and they they. They don't even have just like the work that they do it's not even it's just ridiculous is so. i'm not saying easy it's. Just like they take it for granted and they don't really apply themselves at work, and I see that because I drive around at work, all the time and I, I can see people I go I see what they're doing all day like I said i'm there all the time, I know who's there. I just see them like man, how are you how are you like making all this money it's not just about the money it's like how are you. Making it like this, mainly see you doing all this work, the way you're doing it we're not saying anything to use all good, because you got the seniority or whatever it is. You know, and then someone like me at the batch planet which. is an extreme, the most important position there because we pour concrete there i'm pouring the concrete there and i'm the only person every size for a male now. i'd offer was gone he knows how to operate the machinery is there, and when Bob wants to go on vacation or he wants to be sick, God forbid, you get sick, you know, like. They don't have anyone else there who've been batch the concrete there which nobody knows you got to go to school for that crap but I was trained on how to do that. And I know how to do it, but they just it doesn't seem like they're really they really even show their like the care about it about me doing that crap because. I got $200 for the week and that's for the weekend or eight days at Bob. After about a month ago I bashed in ran that whole yard doing three people's positions, not just mine and bobs another one, because the guy who was there doesn't know how to draw he's just kind of learning and everything he does with that. slows us down it's at I had like 15 hours of overtime that week was crazy. Five of it wasn't one day so. Instead of getting like maybe $1 raise or getting a raise somehow some way down the line, because I get $200 in these. it's just a little piece of paper with that with the barcode on it that you are a little little numbers that you type in says $25 I get $200 worth of those are just little coupons so you can only use these little. These little $25 cards at the website that it's our company's website, you can only buy they're overpriced crap with the money that they give you so you don't be can buy anything that's you would like are going. To have it, you know everything you buy has either their logo on it, or a different issues but it's all part of the Union, so you're buying three times like. They they charge you three times the price per share so if I wanted to buy $200 with the crack i'm going to get like three items so it's like that's what you guys give me is like oh good job done and out of boy and here's. $200 understanding $200 it's paper with tracking numbers I can't find anything other than anything on that side that that that honestly hurt me when they know Bob gave that to me. He looked at me like hey man, I went up to Steve like trying to preach and save devon's doing all this crap you know, do you want a good job and. You know what what can we do something's got to be done and Steve hands and. He has a pile of them on his desk like out here 200 bucks for the entire week it's like dude you have no clue how hard it is to. Do all this crap and get it right, first of all, and deploy your guys's jobs that cost $200,000 each day. yeah I got to get that right, or the rise I look bad or you know it's but I get it right, and I do it right it's all day all gravy everything's good nothing happens, but I don't get I feel like it will be rewarded for that crap and that's really hurting."
148.0,Provider,i'm hearing a lot of resentment because of how much you're putting in and then how much you're getting back it's not equaling up.
456.0,Patient,"Now, at the moment."
148.0,Provider,sounds like you're carrying a lot of resentment toward the work right now.
456.0,Patient,"yeah. Absolutely. it's just really getting to me because I don't even make I mean I think they start everyone off our job like now like I think 17 or $18 now. When when I started 1615 sorry and after a month everyone gets $1 raise but that's just how it goes so i'm make a lot more than that, now, but the guys, the new guys that are starting now they're starting them off any team and then they're bumping them up a few dollars after the. workers, which is fine that's totally fine, but then you guys you've been in years, who are in the same boat, that i'm in, but they do, they run them for machine which is extremely crucial position. he's been there for like oh sorry 15 years because i've been there for five years there for 10 at the time. he's not making any making less than I am, but he should be making more than me and you should and but. The thing is, like his attendance isn't so good either they've mentioned it to he he's took a lot of time off a lot of coven times off like, how do you get Cobra three times dude. Someone in the family may have got it Okay, so he takes two weeks off and gets paid for it and he's done that, I mean it's ridiculous how much. And he's just one example, this happens all over the yard i've never taken any time off i've been sick with code last year, before I even knew I had it and I still came to work. After two days I love couldn't do it is fucking I still came to work and I couldn't I couldn't even do it, and I still."
148.0,Provider,miss the last time you asked for a raise.
456.0,Patient,I don't I don't Have a nice long time actually. Maybe boy it's been a year since I think I got one.
148.0,Provider,"OK OK so maybe that might be a healthy conversation for you to happen to let go some of this resentment, you know just."
456.0,Patient,communicate.
148.0,Provider,"Your needs and how well you feel like you're doing for this company, how much you feel like you're doing, and then you know what you're getting back just doesn't feel right for you."
456.0,Patient,Absolutely.
148.0,Provider,"might be something to start thinking about and. You know, at the end of the day, the worst thing I could say is no but at least you're using your voice and communicating your needs, and you know standing up for yourself."
456.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,cuz like it's just really weighing on you right now.
456.0,Patient,"yeah it is. For this I don't even get like every now and then like hey like I noticed you've been doing all this crap you know bull banks like a good job kind of thing it's like they're just. I understand they got their job to do too, but it's not you can't stop buying just be like hey I noticed you've been doing good recently man right on. or something like that I don't even get that and I know they're not they're not thinking i'm a bad guy or anything like that and they're not wanting to do that it's just I don't get any of that, and especially recently when i've been doing a lot more crap like. that's just I didn't even get like a thing I gotta Thank you last year, when I was covering for volunteers lesson that was from a different guy but. He was just like yo like I, we want to know we do without you have to hire someone from outside. If they even know how to do what we do here, and it would be just a nightmare for the company i'm like well you got that's fine here man i'm going to be here for you guys, I mean I live down the street. i'm never late always on time I don't call out early I don't call it sick check my attendance, I mean what what. it'd be nice if and get some help I mean I don't care I don't care you guys are hiring like little like 18 year olds like 2324 year olds they need work to but. You guys are complaining that these guys leave work and they don't you know they take time off or time will because you. Do they're probably living with someone they don't care, though they got enough money to pay for their car and their phone. You know they're not paying for rent and be genie, and all this other fucking all these bills. You know, and a lot of these guys done anything live locally locally, right here you're not spend it's $2,000 rent anything around here. For two bedroom and that's if you're very lucky we're talking 23 2500 and where these guys live they live, about an hour me 45 minutes, where their pain around 11 or 1200 dollars $13 and and rent or mortgages i'm paying $2,000 man it's like maybe I you know I live close by. And they're like how he's not hurting for money on commuting and stuff like that anymore so it's over time. I have to work overtime, otherwise I won't be able to make it if I don't work overtime. yeah and do it."
148.0,Provider,well.
456.0,Patient,Like I said i'm not a financial force but it's just hard.
148.0,Provider,"I know I hear that and I appreciate you getting so much of it off your chest, right now, today, with me I think it's important to have an outlet for this and talk. About and then at the end of it let's kind of switch up your mindset like okay i've gotten it off my chest of vented a little bit about it now what am I going to do about it right don't don't keep getting stuck in the negativity around this or. You know, to where it's bringing you down and where your resentment is just growing your anger is growing, we don't want that right, we want you to. get it off your chest in a healthy way now let's move forward, think about how you're going to take care of yourself, through it, how you're going to cope with it continue your deep breathing I know that you do that and it's helpful. And then yeah start to think about is this a conversation worth having for me, and I think it sounds like it could be."
456.0,Patient,yeah. yeah yeah yeah. i'm gonna do that.
148.0,Provider,"yeah good good good Devon I have group in two minutes let's get you killed, are we doing what are we doing monthly or quarterly right now. Alright, so. Around oh my gosh November i'm. Cheese November. November Tuesday November 9 at 330."
