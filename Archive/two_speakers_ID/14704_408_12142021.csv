14704.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, have you had a chance to think about. cognitive behavioral therapy compared to mindfulness based stress reduction therapy compared to Problem Solving therapy."

408.0,Provider,Okay. I can hear you a little bit.
14704.0,Patient,"yeah anything you suggest, for me. i'll try i'll try anything."
408.0,Provider,"So all of these that I mentioned are useful for depression symptoms. mindfulness based stress reduction is also useful for pain management. sleep management. And arousal so stress management. If you are concerned that you're having panic attacks or high anxiety episodes there is a. form of cognitive behavioral therapy. For that that focuses on that in a slightly different way than the regular cognitive behavioral. therapy Problem Solving therapy. focuses on depression, primarily, can you still hear me."
14704.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Can you hear me Okay, but it goes. Through looking at solving problems and daily living."
14704.0,Patient,uh huh. So that's the the differences among the three that I recommend it.
408.0,Provider,"Do you. Is there any one that sounds like more appealing to you, to start with."

408.0,Provider,"it'll be more stable right. yeah so what I was asking. Is what are the most. troublesome symptoms that you've had. Since our last session. to your quality of life. What would you say, are the most troublesome symptoms you've been struggling with."
14704.0,Patient,"Oh boy well I don't have like my like home anymore, we lost our apartment there about almost a month and a half ago, or something and the landlord at the time he wouldn't, let us have all of our stuff and i'm telling we've had to take him to court.

408.0,Provider,here that I think you said. enough to tell her that something. I could hear you very well right then.
14704.0,Patient,Hello.
408.0,Provider,"I can hear you now, can you hear me."
14704.0,Patient,"I can't a little bit it he just keeps going in and out in and out. Yes, I feel bad because it's I know it's aggravating no it's fine. So."
408.0,Provider,"With regard to losing your your residence and your things and having to go to court. Would you say the most troublesome thing about all of that. Was anxiety or depression or. Your pain went up. hello, yes ma'am. yeah so there was. Three of those three symptom areas which one was the most troublesome anxiety. or pain."
14704.0,Patient,"Oh, like Oh well, it I have pain in my in my heart, you know in in my head that a bunch of stuff was stolen, but I would say, mostly I would say anxiety."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, all right and yeah it so all right so let's start with the mindfulness based stress reduction protocol, then. Because that is. Usually most effective for stress related anxiety. Could you hear me then. So I suggested let's start. With mindfulness based stress reduction. Because that is the treatment that usually is beneficial for stress related anxiety."
14704.0,Patient,uh huh. Okay.
408.0,Provider,All right now that Protocol is actually the same one that we use during group.
14704.0,Patient,uh huh.
408.0,Provider,"So during group I introduced single exercises from the protocol. But what we can do it on is the entire. Treatment protocol, which also looks up what kind of stance you take toward stressors things that provoked. Your anxiety, so it takes. A look at some different. Ways of. approaching or attitudes, if you will, and values about specific sources of stress. Did you hear that."
14704.0,Patient,"Oh, my I can honestly I can't really hear you area i'm really don't I think we might just have to wait until the 28 because I just can't I can't hear I can hear a few more rare you know time. yeah and even though, can we just do this on the 28."
408.0,Provider,"That, if I give you something to work on, though, between now and. Okay. So, between now and then. i'm going to pause because I think you lost me. Let me know when you can hear me. Again yeah I can hear me."
14704.0,Patient,"Okay, I hear you."
408.0,Provider,"Good so between. Good. So the first strategy, the first skill to work on. With mindfulness based stress reduction is to take five minutes a day."
14704.0,Patient,uh huh.
408.0,Provider,"And I want you to just sit in a chair or lie down and focus on slow deep breathing while you scan your body from head to toe. Okay head to toe and, as you relax and breathe slowly you're just going to be curious and notice. All the different muscle groups and joints. In your body from. top to bottom. you're just going to notice any feeling sensations maybe you're telling me gurgling but maybe. Maybe your. ankle maybe your ankle aches. You know, depending on whether. And you're not gonna you're not going to criticize it. So the job is to learn how to increase your awareness of sensations without criticism, without judgment. Okay you're just going to notice it and be there in the moment being increasing your awareness of your whole body. Okay, so i'd like you to take five minutes a day and just do that exercise between now and our next appointment. What."
14704.0,Patient,kind of like we did that day and group.
408.0,Provider,"Yes indeed, yes indeed."
14704.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, oh yeah and also you might want to get a little piece of paper and a pencil or a journal. And just knock down each time. At the end of the five minutes what. You notice what did you notice. Okay write me a calendar."
14704.0,Patient,I go to calendar for and I actually it was for you really so I could make sure that I got each one of these appointments written down and circled and all that.
408.0,Provider,"Good so you could use it as a little diary or journal. yeah. For your mindfulness exercise. And this is a body awareness mindfulness exercise cool. All right, very good so that's your homework."
14704.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you, Mr Smith Osborne."
408.0,Provider,Absolutely so i'll see you tomorrow.
