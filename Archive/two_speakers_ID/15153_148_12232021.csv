148.0,Provider,"So we have to do we have to go through these questions today, but if you have an outside therapists what you want to do is go to virtual clinic. will ask they'll send you a form to sign, just so we can verify that your meeting with that therapist regularly, and in that case know we can, as long as we have that form that are that release of information for your outside therapist you should be fine just meeting with them. Okay okay so that's what you can do um after we're done today, but we do have to do this, one appointment together and go. Perfect um so let's start with what brings you to treatment and why now."
15153.0,Patient,"um I think what brings me, is because it i've noticed that, like my anxiety affects my quality of life, a lot. um so and why now I think it's because I guess i've been through college like mental health was not an issue that was discussed a lot in in my family. And it was like I also like very traumatic like upbringing, so I think that. I figured out like I could not grow if I didn't like heal myself and address my mentor ball, they were inhibiting micros."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay good, and do you have a history with substance use. Have you had previous treatment for mental health."
15153.0,Patient,"Yes, I did."
148.0,Provider,Okay i'm just therapy or did you do on a program or what was what.
15153.0,Patient,"About just therapy I haven't done, like any programs."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, and how is therapy been for you."
15153.0,Patient,"Like overall. I think, for me, it has been very important to find like the right therapist. And I think that's what something I had to learn, because I started off with a really good therapist that I could like connect with, and then I got really bad ones afterwards. So I think. yeah so like I think therapy is good, when I have a therapist that I feel comfortable. And I think the one I have right now I really like."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good and how long have you been in therapy."
15153.0,Patient,Like consistently since like October. Oh yeah.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good, and do you have a history of homicidal ideation suicidal ideation or self harm."
15153.0,Patient,"No, I mean I think like had positive positive thoughts, but never like. Any like plants, but that was like a couple years ago."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so no parent. Okay. Thank you um and growing up, but with your family life, like where your parents together, do you have siblings."
15153.0,Patient,"Yes, so I go my parents were common law made but they weren't like not really married. yeah like my dad travels a lot he wasn't really cool. yeah I have like a twin sister and a brother. I think I was, I always had very much like the adult and family and. I have to like grow up like very quick because I had to like. I was like the responsible one like my dad highlight was an alcoholic and there was a domestic abuse. Low income, like my mom would struggle financially."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, what what's your relationship like now, with your siblings and your parents."
15153.0,Patient,"yeah um so I actually live in San Francisco i'm here for the holidays in Colorado. Oh, we get i'm only here for two weeks, and I think I decided to move away from Colorado because, like, I tried so hard to like fix a relationship with my parents. Because like i'm very like my parents like they don't acknowledge feelings like they don't believe in men to haul. And like that's very much something that that's important to me like it was very important to my journey and I like always shared that like I shared my whole process with them through my journey but they I think they're like supportive like a couple of days, and then there were like. Then there were they'll have like only crazy people go to therapy and stuff like that very like like I could see that it was like very. It was they didn't support me the way I wanted they didn't love me the way I wanted. So, and I never felt like growing up, I never felt loved or supported so as a result, I decided to move to San Francisco for school. I decided to go out of state, because I have a friend who was really bad it continues my my earlier because to be very superficial like there's no depth there's like no sharing of feelings mobile mobility. I mean it's just like they're my parents, you know, so I like respect on like I came to be like. Because I don't think like i've ever missed them when I was in San Francisco. Like I never felt like this longing to be here again, you know. I take. I came, I think I kind of felt like an obligation to come."
148.0,Provider,or your siblings and Colorado.
15153.0,Patient,"yeah they are so I think, and I like going back to that because, like my sister just had like Mitchell sister my twin sister just had like a baby and I hadn't like met her and when she was like kind of like making me feel guilty for not like having. A baby, so I think. that's why I came like I was feeling kind of guilty."
148.0,Provider,"You had to do that, to make everybody else happy."
15153.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think I wanted to, at the same time, like, I wanted to like meet the baby, I thought I was like i'll just go for the holidays. yeah, so I think the best relationship that I have is like is what's my sister my sister saw very emotionally they're. All share with her, but she doesn't. she's just listens to doesn't like your feedback or anything."
148.0,Provider,So also feel emotionally distant for you.
15153.0,Patient,yeah everybody in my family feels emotionally distant.
148.0,Provider,yeah.
15153.0,Patient,that's like this very common pattern okay. that's an All I want is like an emotional connection right a.
148.0,Provider,phone or ability yeah I can hear that yeah i'm you know i'm just going to give you a recommendation because I would probably won't meet again. But have you heard of renee Brown.
15153.0,Patient,yeah for her Ted talk on vulnerability.
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Yes, yeah she's a vulnerability and shame researcher. The Ted talks are great she also if you haven't seen it the talk on netflix. The called encouraged by Bernie Brown. Highly highly recommend that one and after you watch it, you might want to recommend it to your family I don't know that's up to you, but I would definitely look into the call to courage on netflix by her."
15153.0,Patient,it's called the call to charge.
148.0,Provider,The call to courage.
15153.0,Patient,"Oh, I will check that out tonight."
148.0,Provider,"yeah that's it yeah great one I showed in a lot of my group, actually. really good um okay so and did any I know you said, your dad struggled with alcoholism did anybody else in your home life struggle with mental health or addiction."
15153.0,Patient,"yeah I think my dad has always just been an alcoholic and very abusive but, like my mom know my uncle's for sure, have also struggled with it okay um. And I think that breaking point was like I got so bad that my dad like tried killing my mom one time. And that was like very traumatic for me. So I was the one actually ended up calling the COPs on him and like. getting them like you know, like my mom not wanting to do that so like getting like all this backlash after. Like um so yeah, so I think yeah my like my dad has been like i've really affected me like where I got that because. Unlike my mom was like not emotionally they're like she would never talk about what was happening about the abuse, I was always like ignore it like ignore him totally everything's okay."
148.0,Provider,painful.
15153.0,Patient,So I was like never able to process it.
148.0,Provider,"You said, and you said something earlier about their marriage, so they they're together still."
15153.0,Patient,Oh no.
148.0,Provider,they're not together and you're not together they were like common law married and then I after I called they're like divorce.
15153.0,Patient,"They have a very unhealthy relationship, right now, like. We don't live together. But they act like children, like my mom gets jealous if my dad is like how she like it's like do you have a girlfriend like even though they're not together so very unhealthy relationship and attachment styles from them."
148.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, thank you for clarifying that um and then what was school like for you how far did you complete."
15153.0,Patient,"yeah um so I struggled a lot in school, especially like growing up in a very domestic abuse of household so like elementary was very difficult for me. And I guess like back then, as like an undiagnosed like learning disability like I just recently found out about it, which is crazy, but it was really hard for me and like there was a like coming like growing up in a. underserved Community like you don't have access to any of those resources. So yeah middle school and high school or a little bit better, for me, and I think it was because I was like determined to be better. So I excelled very well in school, especially in high school like I ended up graduating with my bachelor's my associates and biology from high school. I end up getting like a Fulbright scholarship so that's why i'm able to like leave out of state. yeah so yeah I definitely focus all my energy and school. Okay um which, like which depleted like from my social life, like at the same time, I like work two jobs do college classes, and that was like I was very much in a survival mode."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
15153.0,Patient,"I was never able to process anything. yeah so I was able to get that for i'd I I wanted, but I didn't know what I want like I didn't know what I wanted, and I think I was so busy people pleasing I didn't know who I was. And I found all this out like my freshman year college I started at reaches University in Colorado I was doing like their nursing Program. Just because that's what everybody said right like you come from a low income family, you should get a job that you can like make money right away and it's stable."
148.0,Provider,And caretaker.
15153.0,Patient,"Yes, that's what I was like okay like i'll just i'll do it, you know. And I think like college like that first year was like super hard because, like that was the first time that I didn't work that I had time to sit with my feelings that I had. That I live by myself and I could see how how like depressed I was and how I wasn't OK, and then how much I hated these calls that I was taking there's always something like. Like I just felt like it wasn't right for me like I didn't enjoy it. um. yeah and I ended up like and that's when I ended up learning about mental health because, like I didn't really know a lot about mental health. It wasn't until I went to college and I worked for the diversity office that we had like. trainings on mental health, and I remember distinctly crying on one of the sessions, because, like she was describing like what depression was like and what was like anxiety like, and I think I was like that's what that's what's wrong with me, you know. We are like resonated and I remember like pulling their pesticide and like crying because I was like yeah like that's what I have. And like that's what started like my mental health journey. and ended up taking like a leave of absence because i'm the to have got really bad and I had like undiagnosed like thyroid. So, like getting that diagnosis and then I was like I had no energy, because my thyroid was really bad so it was like definitely like an identity crisis because I academics have been such a central park white was."
148.0,Provider,"A huge distraction, for you."
15153.0,Patient,"yeah so it was it was so painful you know i'm like all I wanted was for someone to be there for me for someone to care about me and love me and support me, but no one was there. And I had to like advocate for myself like, even though I have felt so bad, I had to die advocate to get like this leave of absence, because I would like lost my scholarship like it was a very, very talented time today. And i'm taking a gap year and I worked at a law firm and I was like you're at home, like got a car like really became independent and I needed a gap here because I didn't know who I was or what I wanted, or what I was passionate about. During that gap year I did do some therapy. I worked at a law firm and I, I found out that I really enjoyed like social justice and that's what the part of like. Those are part of like nursing that I liked I liked like working with underserved communities, specifically, like the Hispanic population. yeah um so as a result, like and I knew that I wanted to stay away from home because I was like no one's going to change and, like they're impeding my growth in my well being and I was so unhappy with who I was like and like I. I was like I don't want to live like this, all my life so yeah I ended up moving to San Francisco. To continue my education over there. So I go to the University of San Francisco. small private school, which is great for me. And yeah i've grown so much just winning by myself over there and being by myself and then like I ended up like majoring in international economics, I mean international. international studies, with a concentration in economics and my region focuses, Latin America and I loved it I love it so much."
