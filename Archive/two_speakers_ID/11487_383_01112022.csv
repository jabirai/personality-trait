383.0,Provider,Hello. Good afternoon.
11487.0,Patient,"hi Good afternoon, how are you doing today."
383.0,Provider,Doing pretty well how about yourself.
11487.0,Patient,i'm doing good I was just. I was just reading some notes from our last group meeting.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and and what what was popping out to you is interesting, or was there anything in particular that kind of resonated for you."
11487.0,Patient,"Know yeah I really liked them, I really liked the document that you showed that said Let this be a fresh start in your life so make the most of it. And then you said, we have the gift of free choice and dynamic oil and determination, so I really liked that you shared that document it worked it helps."
383.0,Provider,Good good so have you been sort of reflecting on the fact that you have free choice or that this is like a fresh start in the New Year.
11487.0,Patient,yeah more like a fresh start yes definitely.
383.0,Provider,Good good that's great um So what do you feel like you want to talk about today.
11487.0,Patient,"um. I guess I don't have really the only negative thing that has happened that is stressing me out is i'm kind of struggling financially. Because of the car accident that I got into. So i'm gonna have to. Pay that out of pocket that's, the only thing that I can think of that is that's been on my mind that's worrisome but other than that i've been managing pretty well."
383.0,Provider,Juliana Would you mind stating your name and birthdate just for the record.
11487.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah Juliana say 1119 1995.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great Thank you."
11487.0,Patient,"No problem um, but I feel what was I gonna say I was going to see something important um. Oh yes, I feel like I have a new fear being in the car."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11487.0,Patient,"it's kind of scary now like to be an acquire after two car accidents. Yes, every car that I see like I stopped i'm being extra careful now, of course, but it's still like a parent now it's like a paranoia like. Does that make sense."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, so I think it's really. Good you can acknowledge that and recognize that that you sort of have it's a bit of a to ptsd response. Heightened anxiety related to when you're in the car so are you. It just happened when you're driving and also when you're a passenger."
11487.0,Patient,"Yes, books."
383.0,Provider,"So I think that it's really important to. affirm to yourself, when you're feeling like safe and, if not safe just relatively. secure in the car and if that's zero percent of the time. That you want to really practice, some of the breathing exercises while you are driving or while you're a passenger meaning you just take when you breathe, then you really feel the sensation when you breathe out you feel the warm sensation and you just. You don't. You stay with your breathing and don't multitask when you're in the car meaning like don't have the radio on don't. be eating. Maybe in you know kind of invite your passengers to kind of be quiet when you're in the car, because when there's when you're being distracted mentally that's not going to help for you to calm your nervous system down. So being alert and. Trying to build your calmness, while you're in the car through breathing. and staying focused on maintaining your safety meaning like I see you know i'm aware of the. You know all the wind, the the mirrors and i'm keeping track of things and if you're too anxious driving that you reduce the amount of time that you're driving for now I would suggest."
11487.0,Patient,"yeah I have I don't go anywhere really. I just come for work from work and then. If I need to go to the pharmacy to pick up my refills that's all that I will do really. But other than that I won't really go out anymore, ever since the car accidents. I mean, yes and saving money, but at the same time. The accidents cost money. So. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"You might choose one place to go that's really simple to get to like a park or something and just say you know. i'm going to work on my my breathing when I take this drive to the park and maybe don't don't take any of your has your partner's kids with you and, just like do it when you know there's not much traffic, just so you can practice staying calm, while you're you're driving to a safe place. yeah you might want to. Just when you feel ready to do that."
11487.0,Patient,"Okay yeah Thank you, thank you for that suggestion that definitely helps. I feel I feel I feel like it is getting better. But it did, but it was very bad at the beginning, like, I felt like very, very anxious. When driving. And even just being a passenger I would be like like that you know, like anxious anxious. But it is, but it has reduced so that's a good thing, and I feel like i'm getting better and. i'm getting better it like it will be it's not going to be here forever does that make sense, like i'm not always going to be afraid of all. Right, I can I can overcome it. Does that make sense."
383.0,Provider,"yeah but the first part of that is to acknowledge that it is that that's something how you feel, and if you. I think it's important to just say you know I do feel scared when you actually feel scared of being in the car. and take it slow, you know take it take it easy with. yeah yeah. I wanted to ask you, as the start of the new in the start of this new year, a couple things are you taking the medications as prescribed the trials done and the abilify still."
11487.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm still taking them every single day."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great and the 100 milligrams at night. Yes, okay good. and What What would you say are maybe to long term goals that you have, for your mental health for the next year, what would you say those might be, if you could describe them."
11487.0,Patient,"Oh yeah um. I would like to build better communication skills, I know that for a fact. that's something that I want to improve my mental with my mental health and my self care, I want to improve my self care. And my exercise I need to I need to get back to that because I haven't been."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11487.0,Patient,Does that answer those two questions.
383.0,Provider,"That so you want to work on building better communication skills and then improving your self care, and that includes right now. Exercise getting back to exercise. Okay. And so um some of the short term goals that I had written down for you like in the last. You know, four months or so. Are the following um you're going to attend your group therapy sessions two times per month consistently you're going to get to your appointments yes and. And then also attend your individual appointments consistently, so I know you're working on that and I just encourage you to continue, because I think that that you've been still missed some appointments so. let's have you still working on just being consistent and attending your appointments Okay, and then you are going to work on the STOP skill, when you were triggered in your interpersonal relationships like Do you remember us talking about the STOP skill."
11487.0,Patient,"Oh yes, I wrote it down it's in my first journal."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Have you how have you been feeling in your interpersonal relationships how how is your communication and just how are things going with regards to. Getting maybe a little bit triggered. When you're with other people."
11487.0,Patient,"So I I do feel like it happened. yeah However, here, I feel I feel like I do stop and take a take a deep breath now and kind of just. Think before I speak, especially with everybody that i'm around i'm a lot quieter now i've noticed um so that's a good thing that was one of my goals as well. And I feel like i've been able to manage that. is like at work for Craig sample at work i'm focused a lot on my work now. Okay, so that's something that has helped me. That has helped, for example, today, some students, they got into an argument and they started hitting each other. Oh wow like like brulee they started hitting each other punching punching each other, pushing each other and. And of course I intervened and I made them stop and and I. Was loud with them, and I was you know strict. But that's when I need to be Now I know when I need to be. Like in control of the situation and when it's okay to be a little bit more relaxed and not not be uptight or get. angry about certain things does this make sense, like, for example. there's a little sound that one of my one of my Matthias mice my boyfriend son. I feel like he's I feel like I can call her my step by step, child. or even my child, sometimes, but he there's this little sound that he that he's been making and he likes to make a high pitched sound because he's copying a cartoon character. Okay, and it's like chalk on a board and it's so it's so annoying but he just keeps doing it, and I just have to control myself and just tell him nicely the thought is please don't do that just tell him. And if he even if he doesn't listen, I have to I just have to be okay with it. And i'm not the only one that's annoyed by his dad is also telling him not not to do that or maury you know it's it's not just me. it's a thing it's it's not nice see shouldn't do it. But things like that I stopped first and I have to. not get irritated by it, you know it's it's the little things."
383.0,Provider,"So um you feel more in control of your communication. In in inviting him to to not do that, or are you choosing not to address it at all."
11487.0,Patient,"No, I told him I told him I have to tell him hey i'm so sorry that I don't like that sound I tell him that's like a very high pitched sound it's it's almost like you have a dog doesn't like the sound or. Like the the gnashing of teeth, like the not the gnashing of. teeth with the screeching of teeth that's not a nice sound either."
383.0,Provider,You know what I mean yeah no definitely. To communicate it without getting were you wanting to not get angry would have been an old way that you would have dealt with that that like an old way that was not helpful.
11487.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I would have just I would have just yelled. yelled at him or something. I would tell like, for example, with my siblings I would be that way I would tell them no don't do this don't take my stuff know this know that, like, I was like that, before. I said I changed I did change. And as a and i'm not that. tidy clean freak anymore that once everything in order. So that. That has also changed as well."
383.0,Provider,So you're working on so you're being less a little bit less controlling. And you are trying to just control yourself.
11487.0,Patient,"Yes, correct that's a very good way to put it."
383.0,Provider,"Well let's define maybe some goals for you, for building better communication. What is one thing that you know about communication that you'd like to do to improve upon."
11487.0,Patient,"i'd like to improve my. My communication with God, again, I feel like I haven't been praying enough. I feel like I haven't been doing enough and that aspect of my spiritual life Okay, I feel like I kind of lost the connection to my to to my religion, you know I don't really go to church anymore, and I used to so that's also something that. I would like to to improve reading the Bible. that's something that I would like to improve."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, should we put that kind of in the domain of self care because self care. So do you want to say you can commit to what, what do you feel like you can commit to right now in terms of building that for yourself."
11487.0,Patient,I have a passage that sent to my email every day. So I can commit to reading it.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. So, reading the the affirmation spiritual affirmation daily. Yes, okay. And how about communication. Since that was one of the areas so let's just put the spiritual under self care about along with exercise, you said you wanted to exercise, do you want to, maybe, what do you want to do in terms of exercise Maybe you can commit to for the next month."
11487.0,Patient,"to eat better to eat healthier choices and i've been sticking to it to to eat, vegetables and fruits."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, every day."
11487.0,Patient,"yeah every day. Oh example, yesterday I made I made some fresh rice and fresh shrimp and some vegetables and beans."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay good so you're going to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables and daily and then do you want to add an exercise component.
11487.0,Patient,"Yet, to take a walk."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Do you want to take a walk every other day or every two. day or how do you feel it, what do you feel like you can squeeze in."
11487.0,Patient,Every day that i'm not working on my second job.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so how many days are we doing that would be or."
11487.0,Patient,"Maybe like once, maybe, just like once. once or twice actually."
383.0,Provider,One I can squeeze I can squeeze.
11487.0,Patient,"to walk to bake walks. per week I can do that, I know I can do it."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, two walks in per week and then healthier dietary choices and then reading your spiritual. affirmation once a day now, what do you want to do in terms of communication, do you want to stay with the STOP skill and just keep keep that remind yourself with that is the STOP skill. yeah which is really. A go ahead."
11487.0,Patient,"No go ahead, go ahead."
383.0,Provider,"I mean the STOP skill is more of an emotional regulation skill if you're going to get technical about it because it's about stopping and observing the situation and then mindfully proceeding forward once you have paused. And you have stopped and that's that stop part can last for 24 hours it didn't need or it could be for five minutes or five seconds. But it's really about pulling back. When we feel like we're kind of overwhelmed and we might say something or do something that could make something worse. So do you want to work on that or do you want to work on something else, for your communication."
11487.0,Patient,"No, I want to stick with that I want to stick with the STOP skill, it has I have it written down here in here."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great."
11487.0,Patient,"That is. that's something that the three a very useful tool, I haven't had any problems in the past. Since April May, June, July August September, October November, December in the past, almost 10 months I haven't had any. want to say. I want to say i'm going to call them episodes. Because they are episodes that I have. That i've had throughout my my time. Throughout my since i've been 15. And I can recognize them as manic episodes since I am bipolar. It will be, it will be in a very high end excitement. and the need to do something, and that I have stopped doing it, I have good I don't feel that way anymore and that's ever since I started taking a rubric purposeful."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11487.0,Patient,"So that so I want to say that's been a very. useful tool, of course I wouldn't be able to do it, of course, there's the medication, but I wouldn't be able to do it without the therapy."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good good i'm glad you're seeing such a change in the last you know number of months. That that your episodes that you are not having those episodes with the frequency that you did before. yeah yeah and that nature of the episodes from before were involved, you feeling manic and then impulsive. So what you're working on is instead of. Instead of sort of following those impulsive tendencies that you just stop. And you pause and you let yourself just take a take a break. Which is part of the stuff skill is just not moving forward and just pausing it's like putting yourself on pause for as long as you need you know to kind of re evaluate what you're going to do. Okay, good so we'll continue with that for. And then maybe thinking about if you want to add another goal, but I think you got some you got four basically do you want to name them to back to me so that it's clear that you know what they are."
11487.0,Patient,"Yes, I have my communication skills. My self care."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
