Work on it next year, so then i've been calling them knowing answer texting them, knowing the answer and I was fucking and I would find myself thinking about it, like. For two three hours at a time just cooking like I wanted to go over and beat his fucking ass so bad, and it really it was. very tough. You know, for me. it's not about the money it's the principle."
206.0,Provider,So what stop you from acting out on those emotion.
4298.0,Patient,"One day it was a Sunday. Then I find myself thinking about it again and i'm talking. and I was going to go over well what had stopped me is because I was going to send them a final text like. you're going to have to see you know you're going to have to see me over this for the money. You know you're you're you're you're going to be at least be a man for five minutes when I took over and. So I was going to send them that this text or something like that, on Sunday and then he texts me out of the blue. hey brother get with me, you know, let me read you the. Get with me tomorrow, so I can get you some money. These. Are you want to get with me tomorrow, so I can give you some money I get up orkut 333 330 so, then I call though me you didn't answer he did some shoe or whatever, and then, finally, he um. He called me the next day and sent me $100 I mean I know it's. it's only $100 but. you're 1700 dollars now but."
206.0,Provider,i'll call so he made an effort.
4298.0,Patient,"that's not paid off by any means, and I feel like there's going to be an issue down the road with it, but at least now he paid $100 and he said. i'm going to get you together on that money on the on the money to I appreciate the start."
206.0,Provider,Okay.
4298.0,Patient,"And that's really all I was. You know, when I do these things for people i'm not looking for, thank you, you know what I mean like."
206.0,Provider,"If you have a. certain type of agreement, you have to on I don't think."
4298.0,Patient,"i'll give you a reason or something communicate. If they can't, then you go sorry I had blocked your number, I went black crazy."
206.0,Provider,Oh OK.
4298.0,Patient,said you blocked I didn't even get into for what I know what I mean. And so anyways he paid me $100 and you know I got him into brain hurt to bury her. You know that for him to you know what I mean.
206.0,Provider,Okay. So he's he working so.
4298.0,Patient,"He said, a new company, and you know he's with somewhere where I think he needs to be there's more structure. My company is kind of like you work with the boss, and we bust ass and we may work till for today or say you know there ain't no set lunch, we may work to learn and take lunch."
206.0,Provider,Whatever the Dan had a job goes.
4298.0,Patient,"So he's at a job, where he gets he gets benefits taxes taken out. Okay gets off at a certain time, every day, you know I 1099 I 1099 nine guys so. He he needed more structure, I think, and that's where he's at now and I hope I hope that. That it works out, you know."
206.0,Provider,So hasn't made any arrangement in Toronto had a payment on the barn.
4298.0,Patient,yeah I was gonna give with me the next day to. Give me some more money if you turn it and.
206.0,Provider,That was the one.
4298.0,Patient,"That was he yesterday so. Oh, so why pay me two days in or that was two days ago, so why came two days in a row, you know just get with me next week, you know. So. But no snow but reach out."
206.0,Provider,You know.
4298.0,Patient,"I did reach out to him to buy him a fucking car and he reached out to me, so I am I reaching out but i'm going to reach out next next week, like a what what. what's The lesson plan yeah."
206.0,Provider,There was a fair question.
4298.0,Patient,"And I don't mind if shit tons of, and even though I am and uh. You know money's not getting tight, but. money's not getting tight, but I have been having a lot of vehicle issues and spending a lot of money, my wife's transmission I just been spending a lot of money, and I was paying off my credit. In the 1800s of would have paid off a lot on my credit, you know, so I. understand if she comes up just Community you know."
206.0,Provider,"yeah and I think that would make it easier, so at least you know where he stands and then you move from there, but if he's telling you lies blocking people that doesn't make it feel any easy So even if you know things happen, but say something don't use."
4298.0,Patient,or something.
206.0,Provider,"Okay, but you are doing, out of the goodness of your heart. And i'm sure you know. Those things don't go on with. Your life like that might not but."
4298.0,Patient,"I just wanted him to be able to see if it wasn't for his whole fucking life with differently, and I think that that's what that text was was, I appreciate the start. Okay, I think that it's worth the because you know he's renting the place from one of my customers and all that shit. I think that was his what he was saying."
206.0,Provider,"He has knowledge that you are happening. Inside but you know, sometimes and it's not always the best approach some time when people don't eat I probably have the money they know how to where to you, so he ignored, but that's not. The way to resolve the issue because there's making it on your end that he's ignoring you, but at least not a he's in that text that's give you an idea, maybe he's not trying to. avoid you from paying the money, maybe just trying to get things together, who eventually pay you off, but it would be better if there's an actual plan, and you know Okay, this is how often and then eventually for him to pay it."
4298.0,Patient,"off anyway so. You know, you can only do it like that, with certain types of people because. Excuse me. So yeah so so some people that puts pressure on them, you know every."
206.0,Provider,"Okay, you."
4298.0,Patient,know what I mean.
206.0,Provider,"But if he's in a regular job, where you get a paycheck, then that should be part of the expense."
4298.0,Patient,So I was happy that he called it.
206.0,Provider,"takes. me and i'm glad he call or reach out before you send that text you know, even though I know it's frustrating, but sometimes certain things you don't put out in things I can make it feel like making any type of threats that's that."
4298.0,Patient,You know.
206.0,Provider,"that's not the best approach, either because you know that can come back and. If you to paint up."
4298.0,Patient,"I was caught, you know, I was calling to say to say it in my head, but you know he's just like sort of them Dudes who thinks is fucking car and I know there's."
206.0,Provider,So what's the other $1 supposed to 10 himself and his dad his mother's house.
4298.0,Patient,"yeah so so here's the numerous do as. I probably worked in the past two weeks or whatever, but i'm. Supposedly supposed to take him tomorrow we'll go. To jail. Okay, I said i'm not what. The heck have this has been supposed to happen. And then."
206.0,Provider,Like November.
4298.0,Patient,"Last week it was i'm going to take him after work and then he texts me in the morning. My mom's just going to take me after you drop me off, and I said dude book or I didn't even saying I said i'll do it. myself that day, he was forced to come into work, and I was forced to take him.

4298.0,Patient,"i'm for because I, we have to, I have to pay him as money a and. I don't mind I didn't know what friends do."
206.0,Provider,"Like you said that's his responsibility to make those arrangements and, yes, your friend."
4298.0,Patient,Taking your. Or take me and then bullshitting once that day terms you know.
206.0,Provider,"Okay, so then. Obviously he's not really making that commitment, so go ahead, so why get frustrated when you already know. A lot of time these flattery going on, get."
4298.0,Patient,"frustrated about it anymore, I was. On."
206.0,Provider,I will just remove yourself out he'll tell you when he goes in there and call you one.

If I pick him up which there's no issues with him at work ever he's a great worker I pick him up, and I know what i'm good."
206.0,Provider,But it's still as a limited because you don't know when he may get picked up if it doesn't happen so it's really not fully elaborate.
4298.0,Patient,or by being his when you say they're.
