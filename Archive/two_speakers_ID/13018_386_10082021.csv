386.0,Provider,"perfect and James I see here that you were sent over to us from the prescription triage vc as you missed an appointment and are requesting for medication renewal for your buprenorphine naloxone Is that correct correct. Already, what happened wedge in this group."
13018.0,Patient,"Well, last week I didn't one in the group, she said, I need to talk to the admitted to admittance or something like that and I didn't have a number so barely got a number for you and I called in. OK, for the family member. pass away."
386.0,Provider,"Oh no i'm so sorry yeah alrighty um I have your medication listed as buprenorphine suboxone, and that is in the. strength of the eight over two milligrams. In the form of the sublingual tablets, and I have you currently dissolving. What tablets have legally two times a day is that correct. Correct Okay, and is CVs pharmacy located at 1411 lexington avenue in mansfield the correct pharmacy for you. When is the last time you use this medication."
13018.0,Patient,Oh. Almost two weeks i'm really sick. stay. there.
386.0,Provider,What type of withdrawal symptoms are you. Still haven't.
13018.0,Patient,No energy code words can't sleep.
386.0,Provider,"Are you having difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep or both. No energy leg pain that with them, you know that restless leg sleep disruption anything else. Any nausea vomiting."
13018.0,Patient,Will this story. Okay.
386.0,Provider,Any sweating.
13018.0,Patient,I mean yeah yeah the other.
386.0,Provider,"yeah. let's take a look here, so I currently have you enrolled in our program what is currently set for you is that you are. Currently what's been instructed that you just attend group two types of months Okay, and then individual therapy on a monthly schedule that's what it has been recommended for you up to this point i'm currently with the excessive no shows and missed appointments that have under. That you've encountered now what it's recommending is that you'd be suggested for group therapy three times. A week so it's. What it's doing is is requesting for you to basically. Go to some additional care group appointments. Long with like your normal weekly group assignment, which is on Thursdays and that's with Julie kane. Care groups are not going to Julie keep those are would be separately it's a completely different type of group it's not with prescribing the prescribing physician in there it's more so therapy based. What your prescription recommendation is right now is that due to the know showed multiple multiple appointments in the last 15 days. it's requesting for us to reduce your prescription order for a two day supply, with no additional refills until you can be seen so basically needing an appointment within the next two days it's Friday, a little difficult to do so. I do see here that we don't have a completed drug screening for you, they did send a message over to your care navigation team requesting for a new Cup to be sent out to you. And, and then it looks like you're PPs evaluation is due for scheduling which does look like it has been rescheduled to October 18 for you and then your next."
13018.0,Patient,Group will get to that twice on me.
386.0,Provider,"yeah so I I could see that, actually, so it looks like it's actually been scheduled like four or five times so is originally scheduled on 812. And it was cancelled because of new group assignment on Thursdays, so that took over, for your group assignment and then. On that rescheduled it to the 25th of August, and that is marked out as a no show, and then they scheduled it on rescheduled it to the 30th after the no show on the 25th and that was marked out as a no show. And then they reschedule it to Sep tember six and that one was cancelled due to the providers availability, you still haven't been there luck here. For that, and then, once that canceled cancellation happen it rescheduled it the 20th of September that one was marked out as a no show. And so, and then it went up to the 15th and that one was cancelled and reschedule to the 18th of October so. I do see here like I said that it's been rescheduled, not just on your account and that doesn't go against you when it's a cancellation versus a no show. what's affecting those prescription recommendations in that Karen sensitive recommendation is the know shows that have accrued on 10 seven for group 923 for group."
13018.0,Patient,"Really, I didn't try to join those. Okay, she would let me and last time like this week. Last week, she had the black lady told me to contact somebody which number four. Okay yeah. Somebody for you guys."
386.0,Provider,Okay um what i'm going to do is I will send a message over I can't do anything about what they've marked out as a no show um do you know who you spoke with on those days when you try to check in.
13018.0,Patient,Last week I spoke to the Howard lady it's in our counseling appear name. George glasses. Really oh.
386.0,Provider,that's okay there's a lot of people but um what I can do is I can definitely request for them to kind of review for you. To find out exactly what's going on.
13018.0,Patient,And then just a drone and missy and I and my groups i've been trying to get to know.
386.0,Provider,"yeah do you know. If it was Rochelle. No shows. doesn't look like this on here case at all, but it's a possibility i'll double check it um but what I have done is because there's been so many no shows, and the care intensity is requesting to adjust so. So much what I did is on your last prescription written on the 16th it no tate's that buprenorphine suboxone. In order for additional refills it says must attend group Thursdays at 4pm for refills so I sent a message over to Julie keen on the physician who writes your prescriptions, to find out what her Directive is. I will, for the. information that you attempted to log. In per your account. But we're advice to go into it. i'm assuming a different room. To discuss something else is what happened. And, but. Right now, with you, not having medication for almost two weeks it's more so, along the lines of basically doing a reintroduction because you haven't been on the medication for so long."
13018.0,Patient,megan or not you they do I mean.
386.0,Provider,"yeah it, I think you just got really bad luck here, James I don't. i'm looking at this, I don't know exactly what's going on, but I mean what i'm showing per your entire schedule starting back on. August you've only been seen three times and so what's currently what is current recommended is a minimum of bimonthly schedule. But it's being recommended at three times per week, so let me see what julie's thought processes on getting medications out for you, would you be able to attend care groups, if we set something up like that for you."
13018.0,Patient,yeah I can but you guys got realize you want me to work with you guys you guys need to work with me to hear. Not you there. yeah I mean i'm not no kid I don't need punish too smart in the hamper time I did sweetie.
386.0,Provider,yeah I.
13018.0,Patient,don't you. I definitely more. Excuses neither. Do you sometimes oh.
386.0,Provider,"Honesty honesty is the best thing that we can do right now and that's why I that's why I was straight up with you are telling you what i'm looking at. And if honestly, if I had any control over some things, things would go a little bit differently in my head, you know, in terms of what i'm seeing what I did you were you previously seen by Julie at another office prior to coming over to bright heart health."
13018.0,Patient,Are you.
386.0,Provider,"That was kind of like what I was thinking here, but if that's not the case, let me see what we're able to do, I do have a message out for Julie i'm to kind of touch base in terms of. Getting some type of directive on on medication for you, but again with you being out for almost two weeks now, I don't know what the plan of care is going to be she may send a message back to me and say, I want to see him today and that would be perfectly fine. um I have let's take a look here."
13018.0,Patient,That I can understand you don't they don't yeah I mean we don't medicine and don't get contact me I don't see that being a good firm see a doctor at all.
386.0,Provider,"yeah so Julie actually that's what those groups appointment those the group appointments usually review medication therapy and make sure that you're kind of on a standstill so. that's what those weekly group appointments are or bi monthly group appointments or four. Depending on what's going to be the recommendation here for you, I would rather you know move forward from what seems like to be is a bad experience i'd rather move forward and see what we can do to get this situated for you. and actually get medication out for you appropriately where you're not having any type of medication disruption and taking it."
13018.0,Patient,or.
386.0,Provider,"yeah um I have i'm going to i'm going to go over the care groups that I have that are available um so I have Monday care group, and that is at. 4pm Pacific standard time, excuse me 4pm Eastern standard time I have, on Tuesday Tuesdays at. Four Tuesdays at 6pm Eastern standard time I have Wednesdays. At noon Eastern standard time Thursday you already have your group and then Fridays, I have 4am Eastern standard time so that's not that great unless you're early early bird so. Do you have a preference on what day you would prefer to go."
13018.0,Patient,"I like to keep it like in a row so Wednesday and Friday or Wednesday, Thursday, Friday do what you said three."
386.0,Provider,"We could do Wednesday yeah so Wednesday, Thursday, Friday would work, but the Fridays for am."
13018.0,Patient,"Oh no then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
386.0,Provider,"Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, so I have Tuesday, and that is at. six. And then I have Wednesday at noon and then your Thursdays are normal group. What i'm going to do is i'm going to reach out to your care navigator to get you scheduled for those they'll send out a confirmation to you with the meeting ID number so because the meeting ID numbers for every day is different for that particular for those groups. So I will have them send a message out to you for that, I do have a message in regard in regards of your bridge prescription order um let me get that going for you, they already are taking care of the uds collection for you to see if we can get that out, I have your phone number at 419-961-7917. Yes, Okay, do you mind if I give you a phone call back once Julie gets back to me. know you got it um one last question for you, James have you relapsed using any illicit substances or opioids."
13018.0,Patient,Really. nerve cells by that a lot. Last week.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, so any opioid usage in the last week, though."
13018.0,Patient,No.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, no opiate usage any methamphetamine use. Any heroin usage. And this is just this again this isn't to divert or anything like that I just we want to make sure that we're giving you appropriate information so when we do get you back to being medicated yeah there is a risk of if you're using any type of opioids. If you don't wait a certain amount of time frame, then it can put you into a precipitated withdraw, which is actually worse than regular withdrawal. So I just don't want that to happen okay so that's why we ask these questions um last dose of medication I have almost two weeks ago, having no energy leg pain. muscle aches sleep disruption and najah no vomiting which is great. And then we're going to go ahead and see what we're able to get you scheduled for for Tuesday, Wednesday cure groups and then you'll have your normal Thursday. appointment for group therapy and then bps is already scheduled for you let's see what i'm able to get going for you, I do already have a message out to Julie requesting. For medication bridge if it's okay to bridge for you, and then I will give you a phone call back once I have some type of answer okay."
