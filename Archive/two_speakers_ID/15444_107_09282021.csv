Is there anything that you need me to be aware of, right now, are you working with the clinical team at this time, do you have a therapist or psychiatrist or anybody that you're working with right now."
15444.0,Patient,I do have a therapist that I see every Thursday and she's currently helping me to the anxiety that's worse me my depression and my ptsd.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long have you guys been working together."
15444.0,Patient,"I started seeing her about three years ago, and that was just for depression Ben can be anxiety. and, more recently, I was told by my doctor that I might have some form of ptsd."
107.0,Provider,"and i'm sorry, did you like fish married."
15444.0,Patient,So she isn't enough to to.
107.0,Provider,Oh OK so i'm your therapist then was thinking that you might have some some ptsd as she's kind of listening to your your history and all that good stuff.
15444.0,Patient,"Well, this came from my my my actual doctor word. I mean me fill out a form. Like my childhood and my experiences and they're like. Based on this, you know you do have some form of ptsd i'm like. Oh."
107.0,Provider,"Was that the ace childhood example any chance, or the advance of some it's called the ace."
15444.0,Patient,"OK, that one."
107.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, if you have a score for more than typically That means that you have some form of trauma your background."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah so. through some of my childhood traumas right now. And my triggers because some of the triggers that I do have that, on the way. When i'm being verbally attacked by people. hmm I got triggered. So that's what we're working on which it seems to be working because you know now it's not as bad as it was a couple months ago. And then the anxiety and depression, have been an on and off thing. But."
107.0,Provider,It was hard to.
15444.0,Patient,"get inside know mostly cuz when I was younger my mother's physician, who would see me wouldn't really ask me is patient he'd asked my mom and when I would try to express to him my my feelings my depression, anxiety. He would just automatically tell me it's because you're fat."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, great."
15444.0,Patient,"So that kind of messed with my mind for multiple years where I would not eat at school, but as soon as I would get home. And there was food available, I would just kind of start eating. My emotions eating my feelings and. All that stuff. Goodness on it yeah and um and my family, at least from what i've noticed it's been taught to us that you know you don't talk about your emotions, but oh if you're upset here here's a cheeseburger here's up on Wednesday here, you know eat it. And it wasn't until about a year and a half ago to to basically around the time I was a diner like I found out, I was pregnant with my second child. I had gestational diabetes, but then I would want to use food as comfort, but then I couldn't because I was under strict diet and then I realized that every single time that I wanted to eat something. I might my husband would realize this, too, I would want to eat my emotions, instead of talking it out. So."
107.0,Provider,Well that's good awareness.
15444.0,Patient,"yeah that's when we we noticed that you know, there was something wrong and then now whenever I feel a little bit upset or stressed out I I try so like. Try to figure something else out to do, but sometimes it doesn't work and times I don't even know that i'm doing it until after where i'm feeling. Like grossly stuffed. And the best way I could describe it to my husband is I honestly feel like if you were to give me a drink of water, it would just stay in my mouth because there's no space at all. that's health stuff I feel. And he's just like yeah so then we, I had to start mentioning it to my my doctor which. Now, like honestly say I do have doctors, I listened to my concerns and they listen to what's going on, I. I was told I wasn't crazy because I thought I was just crazy for thinking, I was depressed but no, I was actually depressed I actually was dealing with anxiety, I am actually dealing with my own body like try and figure out what's going on, I thought. So once I found a doctor that would listen to me I started to dig more into that once I found a therapist that would help me with like. Just my anxiety and depression it started to come out Warren Warren Warren Warren until I realized there's actually a problem with me just trying to always eat something when i'm feeling like anxiety or depression or just a little sad or irritated. there's an issue there."
107.0,Provider,there's an opportunity for you to do something different.
15444.0,Patient,"yeah. But other than that yeah you know, I have a blood sugar issues which. are also associated with years and years of. overeating and indulging and stuff that overindulging. Then I take antidepressants okay."
107.0,Provider,Women medications are.
15444.0,Patient,"Currently, I am taking metformin for blood sugar control and. My depression i'm taking. group open."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
15444.0,Patient,And it's the 300 mg with the slow release. yeah So those are the two that i'm taking and then I take melatonin sometimes to help me sleep at night. And currently for anxiety and not really taking anything which i'm okay with i've been able to manage it a little bit better.
107.0,Provider,Have you taken medicine for that in the past.
15444.0,Patient,"No, I think I took her from what I understood. After I had my first kid a year, or like I was eight months into I was diagnosed with postpartum depression and they gave me. I guess what they would tell me, it is a two in one. Okay, so they gave me that one and that one was a croc cities i'm not sure if that one's also. An anti anxiety. And anti depressant but that's what I was given and it works. When I was pregnant with my second kid I got off of it and had to go to a lot of therapies, make sure that my depression wasn't kicking up again. And I was able to handle my baby blues for about like six ish month and then we realized that you know I needed to go back on medication so, then I did."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good i'm glad that you have a team now that's helping you is your current therapist educated any eating disorders are working with. Yes, Sir okay."
15444.0,Patient,Now she's more of anxiety trauma.
107.0,Provider,"And ptsd which is. so important, you need to be able to take on those issues for sure."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so a lot of the things like we dealt with my anxiety and depression, but then. When i'm open and honest with her about it, about how to face test and how I I scored high enough where they told me I did have ptsd inches like. Okay, so when you're ready we'll start diving into that and we've slowly been like diving into that where i've been able to talk about how one of the biggest awful memories, I have are when my older sibling would tell me that it was my fault that our grandmother passed away. When I was 11 at the time. So, because of that, you know that kind of messes with your mind and, in fact, where you just automatically blame yourself for everything that that happens for years and years and years. Until, to the point where I know I now know better and i'm kind of like. That wasn't my fault that was an own spot that. was a very unfortunate circumstance that we weren't ready to deal with because. You know my mom This is where the other part, comes in, she was to catch some when I was 11 to the time I was 17. So she kind of checked out she would do the bare minimum. have to do, that the House kind of get exposed every year. Make sure that we were at least going to school and take us to the boss or once a year, and to the dentist maybe once a year, she would do the basically the bare minimum. But emotionally emotionally like my mom wasn't there physically she was there, but mentally she was just not. And at that point my father wasn't sent living with us until the time I turned about 16 he moved to Los Angeles, I ran the time I turned nine to you know make more money over there. You finish the baby, you can have some traffic if you'd like. I gave. You three."
107.0,Provider,"No, no worries. No worries it's suddenly fine take care of the kids. I have an office, full of kittens So if you see a cat face you're not losing your mind I just have this random group of kittens in here right now so anyway, no worries. No disruptions. Okay, good."
15444.0,Patient,"um but yeah so my dad moved out in the time I was nine and then that also kind of was traumatic and itself because. I wasn't told, he was moving out, he was just one day and then i'd say he was gone."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
15444.0,Patient,"So that did you know mess with my mind, because automatically because it'd be like it's my fault it's my fault my dad left. And that's just how the brain works it's automatically your fault, because no one is telling you anything. Right, so my dad was absent from the time I was nine to the time I was about. 1619 he he tried to be as present as he could but he's never been the best father, he didn't know how to be a father, he tried, but you know he didn't know he wasn't around us enough to know. And already at that point when I was 16 I was already very painful eventual like Alice just awful and want anything to do with my family because. When I actually was actively turning out for help, and I was being disruptive I was being like you know the superbowl teenagers that do all the bad things to stand out to get help. I followed in that Jenner like General quota, where I would do things at school, to get called out I would do things outside of school where sometimes COPs would have to like stop isn't it oh you guys don't do this stuff anymore, I came home. I was that generic kid but my family wasn't paying attention to that so. I was just like oh God, I was desperate for help it's just my family wasn't at the point where they could acknowledge that I needed help. So that was about there and then. Those are like the kind of traumas that I do know that I have you know my dad just getting up and leaving my grandma said i'm going up and dying and no one. explaining to us the situation and. You know. It happens, these are the reasons why it had to happen and it's going to be okay, there was no one to tell me that. And because of that, I actually ended up getting partially raised by my older sister she's 13 years older than me. Okay, and she was kind of the one that would. Tell me it's okay to indulge when you're feeling crappy. Okay, you had a bad day Oh, I was maybe let's go get some McDonalds oh. i'm sorry for calling you a little bitch here's a slurpee you know. It was constantly always that. And, to the point where I was like I want to say 16 I got my feet up shop, but I refused. To go to the doctor. Okay refused. And when I started. going to the doctor it's because I. was pregnant with my first kid at 21."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
15444.0,Patient,"So that's when I slowly started going to the doctor. And well you know that's that's how I got here, where I felt comfortable with my medical team where they're helping I have a therapist who's helping you with things it depression and ptsd but now we're noticing that there's this other issue of I do tend to eat my emotions, you know."
107.0,Provider,Do you go to Ole meetings.
15444.0,Patient,No.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, is that something you've ever explored or looked at just doing just out of curiosity."
15444.0,Patient,um no. No cuz I. I wasn't sure where to start with that.
107.0,Provider,"i'm i'm not necessarily a fan, but I just thought I would it popped into my head, so I thought i'd ask."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah and there, there are times, where i'm okay and i'm just like eating normal small meals. Okay, but recently i've noticed that it has become an issue because i'm i'm doing it subconsciously where i'm not even noticing it and sometimes my husband has to like tiptoe around that to like mentioned it to me because I go no, no, no, no, no. None, you know, eventually, like you have to look at and go. yeah. there's definitely some type of problem here."
107.0,Provider,"Well i'm it I love that you're talking to your husband and that you're working with him on that do you feel like that's been something that's been helpful to your relationship, it certainly sounds like it, but."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah I just I always tell him that I feel bad because instead I hit the lottery lottery with me, but just in a bad way you know, like I have anxiety and depression, I know about diagnosed with ptsd you know we're noticing there's an eating problem with me. And you know he goes it's fine because that's still not going to change who you are it's just going to make you a better person it's fun, I know, but it's just irritating for me to have to do that and have to drag you down with me to get help. And he doesn't make me feel belittled about it, and he doesn't even feel bad about it, which is good but. I still feel bad about it because he didn't ask to for that he didn't sign up for that. But he's always been a lot better at rolling with the punches, then I."
107.0,Provider,don't like you spend a lot of time beating yourself up.
15444.0,Patient,"yeah. it's just a constant ongoing thing, since I was a kid."
107.0,Provider,And is that something you're working on with your therapist to I hope. Yes.
15444.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, good."
107.0,Provider,"So, based on what you shared in. The previous surveys, it looks like you're both your anxiety and your depression or at a moderate level. i'm really glad that you're seeing your therapist and that you're working on that weekly that you have medication. it's really important that you manage your moods and you learn how to manage your emotions, because you already have the awareness that one of the ways to do that is to do is to hide and food or and and that's a strong connection because it feels good. yeah you get that biofeedback that says this tastes good this feels good i'm. Good yeah so it's not like you're making that up you're not you know, imagining aliens or something, this is a chemical thing that's happening. So it's about learning how to manage that in other ways, and also kind of accepting that maybe dealing with the emotions isn't going to feel as good but ultimately be better for you to manage it in different ways, and to have a different kind of relationship with food."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah cuz i'm I told my husband and he knows, and he could kind of see how I stopped wanting to snack on stuff like the last two days, because I know this appointment was coming up, and I still carry a lot of is trauma from being told. you're crazy you're just fat there's nothing wrong with you you're just fat. So I still carry that into every doctor's appointment that I go into so I I knew that I was talking to my therapist about that, and she said it's Okay, for you to feel anxious just. Sir, you know Emily stranger danger over here."
107.0,Provider,With one two wild animals to my office.
15444.0,Patient,"yeah and she was basically telling me, you know stand your ground, you know you know your symptoms, you know all this stuff you know what you have been dealing with for years. and years."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
15444.0,Patient,"And I was like yeah and that that's the constant reminder that I have to give myself, but the whole whole like me trying to snack and stuff I was doing this subconsciously. And there's another thing that I do subconsciously, which is why I never have no Polish on or nails because I always bite my nails so consciously. Okay, I. don't know why, but I do when I get anxious nervous or anything I bite my nails. Okay, and I don't know that i'm doing it until you know my husband goes poetry him down, and I say. I was doing it again. You know that's kind of the same thing with food like yesterday. My kid had her first birthday, a couple days ago, and she had candy bags, and you know, I was going through the candy bags and picking out the smallest candy. But still I was picking up the smallest Canyon up in my mouth and walk away and trying to forget about it, but then I would come back like an hour or two later and get another one, I was like. Okay yeah. Okay, so, then he sat me down he's like are you still nervous about your appointment and I told him yeah I mean you already know what my mom structure put me through and how I basically felt crazy for seven years. Because you saw me you're. Fine you're just fat. But I would lose weight and gain everything back and I wouldn't know why I was still following everything. And you know in my brain it didn't compute that I was just eating my emotions, because at that time I was, I was still fairly young adults, so not a lesson on time and I didn't know what I was doing."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
15444.0,Patient,"So you know after I talked to him, and you know kind about it and acknowledge that I was feeling a little anxious and a lot of like actual like fear just because i'm afraid that the doctors tell me you're hallucinating this you're imagining this you're fine. it's just a lot of fear that you aren't gonna, believe me, and because that's That was the case for many years."
107.0,Provider,"Well, I believe you. you've got a lot on your plate and you're used to managing it in many different ways, one of them being."
15444.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,And you also probably have a biological predisposition to this behavior and and you know genetic one to you know Kim you're.
15444.0,Patient,Culturally.
107.0,Provider,"You know from your family dynamic mate like you said, your sister was like hey let's reward this or or ignore this food. You know, probably all kinds of messaging you got that food is OK to medicaid or food is OK, to do this with."
15444.0,Patient,"well. Like my mom is home, so no river with my kids and go to the room where I know the wife, I said."
107.0,Provider,All right.
15444.0,Patient,Well i'm gonna hang out but I came in the. notes okay she's getting groceries and then on cheese and all tied to the room she just told me to keep going and then move when she's done.
107.0,Provider,Okay um well that's very nice except we're going to get into some stuff that you may or may not feel like sharing with her around.
15444.0,Patient,"Let me just tell her that i'm going to go into the. malware and. she's like oh go go handle your life, thank you. Now she's been a lot more accepting because she realizes that there was a lot of damage from her being absent and from my sister trying to take over or rule she wasn't capable of handling. mean my sister took responsibility for me when she was I was 11 so she's 23. All right, we're in my room and it's basically quite."
107.0,Provider,"Oh yes, I can hear the difference. Okay well go ahead and get comfortable and kind of continue on."
15444.0,Patient,"All right, good. Okay me sitting on my bed."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good so again just to connect to the fact that I would like you to hear from me that I am not here to judge you i'm sorry that you've gone through those experiences in the past. i'm here to. To just understand a little bit about what you've gone through in the past i'm under no illusion that in one session i'm going to be able to kind of get it all. But I want to just give you huge kudos for the work that you've been doing in terms of your emotional management and working on developing skill set talking to your husband. allowing him to give you feedback, so that you can have a sense of understanding and develop awareness, I mean this is not, this is really hard work. You know this idea about i'll just stop eating. that's just that's just NUTS I mean it's just a ridiculous thing to say or stop chewing on your fingers or just stop it's like. it's not that simple people yeah it's there's so many more things to it, and I really believe in the unconscious process and that there's parts of you that are just. You know you just don't have that. Awareness so you're building that awareness and that's huge."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's the hard part because you know, for a long time I just automatically thought no it's okay i'm going to stop. But then, you know. I wouldn't because I couldn't I didn't know how to stop. You know, and when I was a teenager and I remember the specifically from the time I was probably about 12 to the time I basically kind of ran away from home when I was about 1818 almost 19. But. middle of the night I wouldn't be able to. Go and I would be eating for like an hour every week every other week and I remember me thinking, but I can't sleep, so what else, am I going to do. And this is like when we were kids I want to say, an old school, I was getting bullied every day, you know. it's kind of, sad to say, the whole generic things but yeah like girls with pushed me girls would pull my hair they've mess with my stuff one point I remember the worst part of that was. A couple of girls grabbed me threw me into the showers what me will cold water, and I only me my backpack my PE clothes and my regular clothes, so I was just wet all day. And I didn't want to call my mom. because sometimes my mom wouldn't answer if I called my sister that would have been. A bigger shift show them my mom showing up, so I just take it. And then get home and feel crappy but then remember that there's. A bag of hot cheetos and some ice cream in the freezer. And i'm going to be fine. And then, when I got into high school that was a whole nother thing my mom stopped paying for my bus pass fair, so I wouldn't be able to go on the school bus, I would have to walk about three to four miles to get to school. She wouldn't pay for public transportation and she would only give me $5 for school lunch which out of my school one day of lunch was $2 and 50 cents so me getting $5 was only two days worth of food. And that was all the money, I would get for like the week I wouldn't get an arms and just get here, so I dollars. So, then, I would have to choose between eating or trying to save up for something that I might need like a notebook or a pencil because my mom would not believe that I run out of notebook paper again. And it was this constant never ending cycle, where I would start myself at school because I didn't have any money. And I knew I would need school supplies like even just like extra letter if I was going to research, I would notice that i'd be like okay let's $5 and get me erasers this weekend. And I would start myself from six in the morning to about 4pm when I got home. and your by that time you're already just hungry that you're kind of just going to overstuff yourself. And I remember that kind of got worse because then I just started to eat more and more and more and more and more, and I would get a big project I would be working on my project but next to me, would be a bag of chips or hot pocket. Or you know basically anything like that, just because okay i'm stressing out Okay, let me take a break. And that's basically how I cope, no."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
15444.0,Patient,"cuz I didn't really have. My mom to tell me it's okay that you're stressing out over school project. or make me feel like it's okay for me to run out of notebook paper. Because, then, to have to go out of her way to go, buy more. And I just try not to be a burden. Alright, with just cope in any other way that I could, so I wouldn't. be a burden for anyone. It got a little bit better after my sophomore year. I found friends who knew that my parents weren't giving me money and they started to bring the lunch on their houses, whether it be just like a peanut butter and jelly I was very grateful to that because I wasn't stopping in. And I still talk to some of these people too, so they know that they meant a lot for me, especially since i'm as soon as I graduated high school, I was 17. I wasn't allowed to leave my home because I was still under aged I had been accepted, to every art school in our local area from San Francisco to San Jose or even Los Angeles, I was accepted into film school and I was basically told. No. By my parents, because my oldest sister didn't think it was a responsible idea to let their youngest child just up and go to school. And that kind of destroyed me because I ended up going to a college that I absolutely hated it was local I wasn't allowed to study what I wanted to study. And you know kind of every pad that I wanted to try to get out was crushed in a matter of months. Because I would bring home acceptance letters from every college and I was like okay we'll figure something out for me to be told literally a month for graduation. No. So, then, I started a college I ended up getting a job at mcdonald's which was not the best thing for me, because you. know now I had access to food, when I was. At and I had my own money and I had. A place to. discount and I was like oh God. I looked back up and I go oh God, I was literally a storm, it was a shit show. The only good thing that came out of me working at mcdonald's was that's where I met my. husband, we started off as friends for a couple months and then ended up dating. And being in a relationship and now we're eight years into our relationship we have two kids and we're married. So in that aspect something good did come out of that but. But he was actually part of the reason that I felt comfortable enough to leave my family, I was about 18 or 19. My my parents would were just really overbearing we controlling you know wouldn't let me out of their site. They would get mad at me for when my sister would abandon my job, since I was still a minor and I didn't have a license I would wait for my. Older sister to pick me up and sometimes she would be waiting there for five minutes and then send me a text message saying. I went home good luck. And then I would have to figure it out and that's how me and my husband ended up becoming friends, is that he would give me ride home because he would see that my sister just kind of. Left to be there. And it got to the point where me and him. Were noticing that I was just being very controlled in a very unhealthy environment and it wasn't even my parents that were pulling the strings but my parents needed a wake up call. And I just told them I just couldn't do it anymore my frickin or sisters and awful literally telling them to stop me at every frickin corner. And she's just an articulated to them and said she is literally their golden child she is the firstborn. it's just hard to get them to assume things so what I ended up doing about I slowly started packing up all my belongings and taking them to my boyfriend's House at the time, my now husband. And we talked to his mom and she knew. And on the last day I had a loss to my clothes, I had for my parents. Well i'm leaving. And the number here's a lot of money for my phone. And I will call you when i'm ready to talk to you guys. And my husband was like i'll take care of her, I promise but. You know this is our plan we eventually plan to get married we're just moving in now, because it seems like the easier thing to do work wise and school wise and you know i'll take care of her for the rest of her life and she'll take care of me, which is obviously the truth now. And I just kind of laughed and I didn't talk to my parents for traffic here. And then, I have a year I do remember that kind of felt like this eagle rock. let's take it off my shoulders and I didn't feel the need to want to eat as much, and I. You know I just felt like I had somewhat of freedom and I was able to. Do. and make a nap then that's the hardest part for me is I can never let go and i've thoroughly plant, something I don't want it to go that way I fall apart when it doesn't. Man that just kind of leads to me relying on food to feel better or. figuring out some way to feel better. So I should probably say this a little bit about my family I have. My. Older sister Martha who is parents golden child. I have another sister named Jeanette she is kind of like the outcasts and my family she literally does everything to the beat of on her own dress. And we use. It and now we actually had a long it's kind of like that generic sister relationship, you always want, we can tell your sister anything. And she's not going to go right to your parents that's the relationship we have now which i'm thankful for. You know, with her it's it's a nice story which it's a kind of long one, you know she told me, it was Okay, that I got pregnant with my first we were going to figure everything out that I was going to be okay. And she's the one who plumbing no it's Okay, for you need therapy at this point, if I had known when you were a teenager I would have fought for you harder to be taken, the therapy. So, very grateful to my second oldest sister Jeanette. And then I have my older brother Francisco we call him people, but his rollins Francisco and. We also had kind of like a weird relationship, because I was the baby of the family i'm the baby, so I was always really bratty and he was my older brother, so I would always somehow get him in trouble. Now our relationships, a lot better where we do have an open, communication and we do tend to be kind of brutally honest with each other about certain things. And for us it works that way, because we also know that. For us, communicating it's. going to be a lot easier in the long run than us just being quiet. And then I have my mom and dad who we currently live with, I were helping them with the House payments and. We live here with my two kids and my husband, and now we tend to get along a little bit better my dad and I have always had a kind of. mess up relationship after he had left. And they got significantly more harder when he would take me to my cousin's house in the centers where my cousins were kind of. mistreat me and even realize about my father no and your dad has another family here that's why he he doesn't want you guys to come, often you know your dad does not want you guys hear. All that generic kind of mean girls stuff or. They tell you Oh well, your dad doesn't want to. He has another lady here he's starting a new family he doesn't need to. And you know internally, you know, for me, it was this constant thing of woman my family i'm going to believe them they're my cousins they're not going to do anything to hurt. i'm older now and I now know. that's bullshit a lot of family members will mess other family up. remembers my mom who. She stopped with postpartum depression and real depression for years on and off and I wasn't made aware of this until I was probably about 22 yeah i'm. With my mom we lived with my her brother and his wife and two daughters. And my two cousins are my uncle's kids I am actually fairly close to them, but it's kind of like a sister cousin relationship. And they currently know what i'm going through they constantly check on me at least like three times a month. which you know, even those like 30 minute check ins that I get with them and they know that i'm trying to figure out with my anxiety and my depression and the ptsd and eating and they're like. we're sorry that we couldn't help you and we were teenagers just because we kind of thought strange when I was a teenager and when they were teenagers, we got a strange just because I was going through my own shit and I just. I just didn't want to drag anyone's done with me at that time. So I just you know did me. But that's a little bit about my family. yeah."
107.0,Provider,And I know.
15444.0,Patient,"You know I have my two daughters now, but this is like, before I had my kids."
107.0,Provider,"Right right so lots of just surviving adversity, it sounds like a lot of just kind of uphill battles."
15444.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"In food it been kind of the mainstay in one way or another, that whole time. But obviously when your mom wasn't giving you enough money, then it was not, it was a main focus, because you didn't have access to it, you were forced restriction. So it became it, the more important to have it or to stash it or to store it so that you wouldn't starve."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah that's actually very true. Because. The kind of way that I put it to my husband is that. For the longest time my life has been so unpredictable, especially since my grandma died. that the only constant thing that I ever had to like have it, I didn't know that it was going to be there was some type of food. That was the constant thing I knew I had in my life. But you know, when you say it out loud kind of go like oh that's that's like really that's like that's the only constant thing you have in your life that's. Pretty messed up you know."
107.0,Provider,"I mean it is what it is, you know if that is the reality of where you that was your perspective it's important to acknowledge that and and just know that you can't you can't work through it, if you don't kind of own that piece of it."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah and you know now I I told him I have a lot of different classes now which i'm very grateful for like I have my two daughters which. they're always going to be there i'm always going to be there for them until you know they don't want me there which i'm still gonna be there after that. And then I have my husband, who knows that I have his back, and I support him and he has mine, which I know he has mine it's just really hard yeah it's just really hard to like except that I have someone having my back. Yes, for the longest time it was just like survive and figure out how."
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah totally.
15444.0,Patient,"And now, like a lot of things are different."
107.0,Provider,So yeah which is amazing i'm glad for that.
15444.0,Patient,"yeah and that's how I know that I now tend to fixate. On different things where if I want to eat, I will separate."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean that's great those are great you know moments of kind of doing something different to give yourself a different type of."
15444.0,Patient,"Experience yeah and. Sometimes i'll come in my room and if the baby's asleep will kind of just sit on the floor and just. Basically, sit there and think about it, and try to come to terms with what i'm feeling and you know, try to identify why i'm feeling that way. And you know, like 80% of the time it works, and I can figure it out."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
15444.0,Patient,The other 20% it's kind of just like me being. Like. i'm too out of control and stubborn in my own way that I can even take five seconds to relax calm down and figure it out.
107.0,Provider,Well it's a process right we can't just snap our fingers and everything's different.
15444.0,Patient,Man if that would be flows would be that easy.
107.0,Provider,"I have it, then you snap and again and you'd be on a yo yo in a different way, so that's not great. Well let's spend kind of the remaining time we have we have about 1520 minutes let's talk about. behaviors in the last year to six months that you have engaged in in terms of food so i'm just going to kind of folk go through a list, if you will. So early. So family circumstances, you had to restrict food because you didn't have access to food, basically, the financial situation and situationally didn't have access to food, and then you probably over eight as a result of that. Which is a very normal I mean it's a survival skill right if you restrict and then you're starving and then you need to eat and you want to you know kind of build the resource tank if you will. Do you do any kind of restriction now do you take any time during the day, where you don't allow yourself to eat."
15444.0,Patient,"I wouldn't necessarily say that I do that now it's kind of more I forget to eat, but no I don't I don't restrict myself."
107.0,Provider,it's not a bad word. kind of thing just get busy with life and.
15444.0,Patient,"All of a sudden, you are hungry. Okay yeah."
107.0,Provider,"All right, okay. So, then, we do so, it doesn't sound like you go like eight hours or more within without no okay. um, are there any foods that you exclude from your diet is there anything that you say or I can't have that that's bad for me in terms of like. You know, you were on a very specific diet, with the gestational diabetes and. yeah and i'm talking about you know. Like quote unquote bad foods or foods to you identify and safe."
15444.0,Patient,"So the only one that I technically don't allow my diet currently is just regular sugary soda because I did have an issue with my blood sugar. Okay, other than that no I eat kind of a little bit of everything we still eat fast food, but in that aspect I do try to go for the healthier option or you know the smallest burger and the smallest try. So there is that but I don't I don't try to restrict myself from foods, you know I always try to eat Greens, I always try to eat veggies the only one, I don't try to drink as regular soda. Okay, I do. I drink juice. With water in it and I drink water."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, do you find yourself counting calories or or being on certain calorie limits anything like that to influence here."
15444.0,Patient,We are.
107.0,Provider,"Do you ever have a desire to have like an empty stomach or influence the way you eat your food is to influence your shape or wait. No Okay, have you ever taken any diuretics things that make you pee. never lose water, have you ever taken laxatives something to make you have a bowel movement. No okay any other kind of substances that would somehow credit make you change your shape due to. fluid change."
15444.0,Patient,No okay.
107.0,Provider,let's. Do you find yourself kind of thinking about when you're going to have your next meal or what you're going to eat next and just kind of. always looking to consider the next time you're going to eat like you're kind of always thinking about it like a little ticker tape in the back of your mind.
15444.0,Patient,"Sometimes, yes."
107.0,Provider,"um and then in terms of your shape do you find that it's hard for you to focus on life because you're worried about your shape. on a regular basis, your body size."
15444.0,Patient,"I mean, yes, just because I am pretty overweight it's a little bit hard."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so just as a kind of natural life situation you find to kind of reminded that a little bit. yeah okay. Do you ever to and spit your food out."
15444.0,Patient,No.
107.0,Provider,And do you have a fear of losing control over you're eating.
15444.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have a concern that by eating you're going to gain weight."
15444.0,Patient,No.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have a fear of feeling fat, or do you ever you know have that ongoing kind of thought process of i'm fat or, I feel that."
15444.0,Patient,yeah okay that.
107.0,Provider,"makes sense, given your history and everything that unfortunately everything you've been told. Do you have a desire to lose weight."
15444.0,Patient,"This is where it's hard because, yes, I do, but I want to lose it in a healthy way."
107.0,Provider,"Okay well good I appreciate you kind of making that clarification. Okay, so in the past have you let me just take a minute to make sure i've kind of checked all my little boxes oh i'm missing, I always miss the fun. well. calorie count in a day average."
15444.0,Patient,No don't really count my calories and their average like that.
107.0,Provider,"So if you. Have any kind of sensitive, do you think it's Okay, if you don't."
15444.0,Patient,"know, I have no sense. Okay calories i'm not gonna lie."
107.0,Provider,"No worries um What about in terms of your body mass index, do you know what your BMI is or like a recent weight or anything like that."
15444.0,Patient,recently lost my weight when cellphones about 307 pounds.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and how tall, are you."
15444.0,Patient,"i'm five six it no that's a pretty high on the BMI feel. My husband did it for me one time, he was like yeah you're a little higher skilled at BMI."
107.0,Provider,"Unfortunately, the only reason I even have to ask and I typically stay away from numbers is just because, for the level of care assessment, I need that information so so just get. Your five six. And then i'll figure it out from there okay perfect all right, thank you very much, and then. So no sense of calories because that's not something that you have any kind of preoccupation or awareness up okay. No, no worries and would do you do any nighttime eating, you said that you, you find yourself eating when you're not really aware of it to you know if you ever wake up in the middle of the night or eaten middle of night you don't."
15444.0,Patient,"know I don't necessarily tend to do that sometimes around 10pm before I go to, but I do get a little like. hungry and that's where it's hard for me to distinguish Is it because i'm still breastfeeding, the baby, or is it just because I. didn't eat enough had dinner, and when that does happen, I tend to go for like a slice of toast with peanut butter or Greek yogurt with granola and then just be like done."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah if you don't mind if you could give. me kind of a. Generic example of a day of food, so that we can kind of."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah so a generic days for me to eat like breakfast time I normally would start off the day with you know eggs, sometimes bacon sometimes not. A form of carbohydrate so my favorite currently right now is sourdough bread. Okay, either too small slices are one big slice and then eat them sometimes i'll add avocado in there and make like an avocado toast situation and eat to avocado toast. drink water with breakfast. Then some i'm not even gonna lie I don't really have snacks through the day it's rare when I do just because I, you know stop snacking sounds good. So. And for lunch normally it'll be something like something super easy like today, I had a phone where it had Turkey and chicken ham. Okay, and then it had a slice of cheese a had avocado mustard Mayo lettuce Pickles on there, then I had a small baby bag of chips. A Mandarin orange and okay diet Pepsi. And today, surprisingly, I did have a snack where I had a kind bar. Okay, and for dinner today it's going to be a low key kind of dinner where i'm just going to make a soup for the kids. Okay, and add veggies in there, make them some Cassidy is and I normally just tend to eat soup."
107.0,Provider,"OK, and then sometimes you have an evening snack some."
15444.0,Patient,"Time so sometimes i'll have an evening sad, sometimes I don't. Know kind of depend on the day you know I feel a little bit more hungry or then it'll be like. A half a sandwich where it'll just be one slice of bread, with a little bit of male ham and some cheese in there and that's it other days it'll be like. Greek yogurt with granola or peanut butter slice toast and sometimes it'll just be something very basic like Oh, let me have an apple and go to bed."
107.0,Provider,"Okay perfect well i'm super, so I think that kind of checks, all my little detail boxes, if you will let's go through a little bit of treatment options and see if I if you have any questions for me after I kind of run through that a little bit, so I you know, unless your. blood pressure is really off, meaning that you have well actually I should ask this when you if you get up really quickly, do you notice, if you get dizzy do you ever notice, if you get dizzy or lightheaded from either sitting down or getting up."
15444.0,Patient,No i've never had that happen.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, great so that, so no suggestion that you have kind of an ortho static blood pressure issue you are working with your medical doctor on a regular basis, so it doesn't suggest that anything I don't see any indications that you would need a hospitalization or 24 hour care. You have two kids young kids so you need to be able to be home and take care of them and be around for them so then if we're not looking at a residential care, then we're looking at the next step potentially could be a partial hospitalization which is 20 hours a week. I don't think that that's warranted in this situation, because you haven't tried an eating disorder program or treatment per se, so that seems kind of. Like we're jumping the gun again because I don't see not to dismiss everything you're going through, but I don't see anything major medical that would require that level of care, but I kind of want to run through these options with you, because if you're like what do you. All. feel that, but I want to be really cognizant of the fact that you have children and that you've got your breastfeeding like there's a reality that you need to kind of be around for them. So, then the next level of care, would be an intensive outpatient program and that's anywhere from 11 to 1516 hours a week, and that I think that you could probably work that out in your schedule pretty easily. Most of that is going to be group so you're going to get a lot of group education on how to you know, be aware of your body, how to develop. Awareness nutrition eating in front of other people working through anxiety management of that developing life skills all around just kind of what is it like to deal with food in a way, and really not. Just. Have and managing food as a result of that, so a lot of just education and it's intense I outpatient because it's. A significant part of your life it's 11 to 15 hours a week so that's a lot of time that you're now spending on that, but. We actually have a program that's an online telemedicine program so everything's at home so that's something potentially if your insurance company covers that that we might be able to advocate for but, at the very least, and you know, maybe there's an iot program in your area or or another. You know organization that offers that you could continue to work with your therapist and then you would work with a therapist in our program and a dietitian. But I i'll just use our program as an example, but in any program you would work with a therapist and a dietitian once a week individually. And then you would have anywhere from like I said nine to 12 hours of group a week, our program is 11 hours summer a little bit longer than that. So that gives you an opportunity to get some really good education, develop a lot of really good awareness about what's going on for you and kind of take. All your stuff that sounds like you've really been working hard to develop some really good understanding about this, but just kind of take everything to the next level. yeah and and and the goal is not anything about weight so matches the numbers, give us an indication of kind of how you're doing right and it gives us an objective place to land on how you're doing. with everything else, so we don't set like Oh, you need to be at this number we just want to have a sense of where you're at, and how are you doing in terms of managing your food. We do recommend a meal plan we do recommend meals and snacks just so that you don't have that feeling of hunger, that you have the opportunity to kind of have a more stable state. sounds like you're trying to do that now, maybe with some nutritional guideline that is not my forte it's not my scope of practice, but with nutrition is."
15444.0,Patient,Something I wish I was taught yeah.
107.0,Provider,"yeah you can always right, so you can always get some extra information there. So at this point, given everything that you shared and all the hard work that you're doing I would advocate for you an intensive outpatient Program. Something that can work with your family's schedule with your schedule and will give you the added education and support that you need to kind of take your. Hard work that you've already been doing a lot of really good work to take it to the next level so that you can develop and support what you've been doing to the next to the next level of awareness and understanding and hopefully improved health as a result of all that, yes."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah I think that might work a lot better I think they were telling me that there's a couple of places in Santa Cruz county that they do do that. They just wanted to. get me basically. evaluated by certain who. Sure Oh, then yeah. Okay, would be the best thing is an. Intensive outpatient."
107.0,Provider,"yeah okay perfect so that'll be my recommendation is always based on with the caveat that your health records don't indicate a higher level of care. I don't have your health records in front of me so that would and really at this point, given your scenario, it would just be where you would need to be medically supported more. And it doesn't sound like that, based on what you're sharing with me, but I just want you to know that I don't have that piece of information so aside from anything coming up there, it sounds like the intensive outpatient program would work best for you and give you a good place to start. Any other questions or concerns for me, before we wrap up today."
15444.0,Patient,No i'm will kind of yeah so after today's session i'm pretty sure the you're going to have to send out some information to my clinics. If I do get told that you guys are able to continue my care for the intensive. For the intensive outpatient would this be also through zoom or would it have to be in Barcelona.
107.0,Provider,"Our program is it but. They have other programs in mind that are in person and they're recommending that, then you should certainly try them out and i'm sure they're fantastic and I wouldn't want to spare Saturday, but yeah. If you're going to do telemedicine, it would be that way, and if you, you know that in person is great to there is there's value in being eating with other people right there in the room, with you, you know I can argue both yeah."
15444.0,Patient,"yeah all right. I just wanted to know, just in case you know, like leaders know what he and yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Sure absolutely. So I typically it takes us about a week turnaround the sea and it's back and they're, the ones who were asking for those so we'll give it back to them and then they will have that information to be able to make recommendations. Moving on from there."
15444.0,Patient,yeah okay.
107.0,Provider,Any other questions or concerns for me.
15444.0,Patient,"That was about it, thank you."
107.0,Provider,"Well, thank you, it was very lovely to meet you and to hear your story and i'm just amazed at how much work and effort you have put into things, who have a a wonderful sense of awareness and understanding, and I hope that you can get that next level boost. awareness and understanding, so you can get that much healthier and happier but you've done some really incredible work so far and good for you to do that."
15444.0,Patient,Thank you.
107.0,Provider,So it was lovely to meet you have a fantastic evening.
15444.0,Patient,"You as well, thank you so much."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you take care."
