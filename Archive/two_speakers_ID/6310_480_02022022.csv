6310.0,Patient,yeah i'm.
480.0,Provider,"pretty hard to maintain, though."
6310.0,Patient,yeah. I mean.
480.0,Provider,"Maybe not hard, but you do have to like maintain it consistently."
6310.0,Patient,"yeah well we don't do too many trips during the wintertime anyway, and I guess that's pretty much so anytime we'd have it up yeah one of my buddies had. He showed us a. 120. whoa. Just plugged into a regular wall outlet. Oh, like a it's like a plastic version of them, but it pretty much does everything."
480.0,Provider,interesting.
6310.0,Patient,"Everything that you know, a bigger one would do so."
480.0,Provider,Well that's cool That would be good.
6310.0,Patient,Hopefully we can find one.
480.0,Provider,"For last time you were talking about wanting to save money. that's gonna do a whole saving money idea. Is that kind of issue for you is like. You find something you want, and then you spend the money and justify spending it instead of saving."
6310.0,Patient,"Well we've been trying to find one for a while, but she's really been bugging me about it. And my friend found one he found his for like 500 bucks. So i'm hoping well actually it was like 300 bucks. But i'm hoping we can find something for that, if we find a good deal will get it, but. i'm not trying to spend a lot of money."
480.0,Provider,"Lots going. On know. here's the question I should have brought up last time, do you have a savings plan as far as like a percentage of every job you do goes into savings."
6310.0,Patient,"i'm. pretty much just try and do the work as much as I can, and. You know, whatever. Is that the end of the month, whatever. Over for my bills and stuff. I usually just take that and keep what I can. use to like maintain. and take the rest and just. Put that."
480.0,Provider,that's.
6310.0,Patient,"Good I got one of my one of my accounts is like 16,000 roster. So it's it's coming along."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that sounds like a good way to do it, I know some people will put like even $20 out of every job into even like something not even a bank account, but just like a jar or something and. they're. Like the spending money or the vacation money or the fun toy money you know."
6310.0,Patient,We have changed our that we put dollars and change and. So. High for that stays up good and then Andy one day. We. wedding.

480.0,Provider,Nice so there's no wedding for you in the future.
6310.0,Patient,I don't know we'll see.
480.0,Provider,But that's totally what I thought you meant I was like wait when was there a wedding planner okay. No you're. Not in the works currently. No got it. How does she liked her job does she still Hannah.
6310.0,Patient,"Yes, she. She doing she doesn't really like it all that much. She ended up. She got COPA, then. ended up or good ended up getting Kevin and she pretty much said I. right way off because of taking care of him and her being sick but she's working she's back in school already again and trying to get her cyber security certificate. here's a. friend has a job opportunity that she might be able to take advantage of, and that would make her pay. Right. per year, the about like 30,000 more if she has that certificate, so it would be. I think it's like. Four weeks or something."
480.0,Provider,Oh that's not bad.
6310.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, and it's free at the College too so that's good. Well, they pay they actually pay your money, I guess, for the. She got some kind of scholarship or something or something yeah that's good. that's all. he's the. You know transition."
480.0,Provider,yeah for sure. So what else is new.
6310.0,Patient,um I. went and worked on my bike some more.
480.0,Provider,Is it done.
6310.0,Patient,it's almost done. They everything's pretty much done but for some reason he hasn't been able to get the vacuum to vacuum yet so it's running but it's running off of like a little clear gas tank on the handlebars so.
480.0,Provider,What does a vacuum do for a bike.
6310.0,Patient,"it's because of the type of bike, it is the carburetors like instead of being standing up it's up it's like laying on its side. So it's on it's kind of weird it doesn't make any sense really because you know the gas tanks above it so it would flow down to it. But, for some reason it needs that kind of backing to get it out of it, saying yes. But."
480.0,Provider,You might have it.
6310.0,Patient,"yeah and. I just got on master when again for my cpr the chain on it broke, so I had to. had to get I gotta get that fixed for my my insurance right, you know you gotta get it inspected and all that stuff that's it's almost about the lab so i'm trying to get it fixed I can get it inspected."
480.0,Provider,what's this Dr.
6310.0,Patient,My crap tracking.
480.0,Provider,Oh okay got it.
6310.0,Patient,"yeah it runs it runs and nothing's wrong with it, but it just doesn't matter, because the chains brick."
480.0,Provider,yeah so if it doesn't move you can't drive it at all.
6310.0,Patient,"yeah hopefully hopefully the chains, not to. stretch from one at bro."
480.0,Provider,"hard to replace change, though, are they expensive."
6310.0,Patient,"Right, it was yeah I was like. I want to say the setup was. About $200 oh okay so. It probably be another 200 or so, to replace it. It should be under warranty which. One to do are usually never what it is right right."
480.0,Provider,Like there's always a reason why they won't cover it kind of thing.
6310.0,Patient,"that's frustrating but yeah. yeah. At the get a new battery for the. bike that i'm hoping to get back and then for my. dirt bike need to get in a battery for that hopefully. Hopefully, hoping to get the bikes back soon and then take the. dirt bike and put that in the shop somewhere find a husqvarna shop and put it in there. Because it's it's a pretty expensive by our guests it's probably the most expensive like I have."
480.0,Provider,Because you've talked about three already.
6310.0,Patient,yeah. Probably have by nine. I got rid of a few of them.
480.0,Provider,I had 1414 snow between dirt and motorcycles.
6310.0,Patient,"yeah it was way too much to try and keep up with. Well, it still is kind of but."
480.0,Provider,Is that like your main hobby is writing either dirt bikes or motorcycles.
6310.0,Patient,"Dirty much that and video against going out on the boat to. I usually don't have it well lately it's been hard between you know her job and my job, and then now it's just code itself so, but it would be nice to go and get like oysters and stuff. Because of the weather, it just it makes the boats drag out longer because after wait till the temperatures a certain degree to do the work. When you agree."
480.0,Provider,"And because it messes up the boat, if you do it lower."
6310.0,Patient,"Well, they can the right compound and wax and stuff won't work. Oh interesting. I guess it just doesn't it gets too cold and. paste or something. doesn't. Do what it's supposed to. that's interesting. huh yeah."
480.0,Provider,"But it makes sense, because if you think about wax like it's ideal when wax is hot right because that's when you can like if it gets too cold obviously it's gonna mess up does make sense. Just don't like think it through."
6310.0,Patient,yeah yeah. Cut layers down and if it's not getting warm enough to you know burn through it and it's not doing what it needs to do.
480.0,Provider,That makes sense.
6310.0,Patient,Because you can get it too hot and it'll turn the boat yo.
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
6310.0,Patient,"yeah you can really mess them up kind of and it's because some boats it's like it's hidden. Like beneath the surface it, this is super porous or something. i've ran into a boat one time that that I I couldn't even touch it with a buffer or it would turn yellow. and It really sucked you know for the customer, you know but. It just is what it is. There anything about to gamble anyway."
480.0,Provider,Was the customer really mad.
6310.0,Patient,"He didn't really he didn't really notice it so it didn't really make a difference, but. If. You know if you knew what you're looking for it, you know what it is."
480.0,Provider,yeah i'm glad he didn't notice.
6310.0,Patient,yeah there was like a 220 500 Our job is to. Present present good.
