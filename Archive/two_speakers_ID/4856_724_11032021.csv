4856.0,Patient,Not much just waking up.
724.0,Provider,Like nine o'clock.
4856.0,Patient,it's 1115. today. Maybe keep them.
724.0,Provider,late hours.
4856.0,Patient,"I didn't know I didn't even stay up late, I wanted with Leo last night I don't know why i'm so tired, I think, just it was a big weekend. With Halloween there's so much there's so much hype, I felt like. It was it's bigger than like a birthday, no."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I made four trips out and literally. 10 minutes in the handing out candy I was like we should probably go get more candy and I literally had to go eat candy at like 630 at CVs. sold out, I was like we're probably gonna need more wow. yeah so I mean multiple trips, I could understand what you're saying about it being a production because it definitely was a production."
4856.0,Patient,"yeah just like, no, no, it was just like so it was social and everything else. But it was good i'm glad it's over."
724.0,Provider,yeah did you take a trick or treating or did you pass or candy or both.
4856.0,Patient,"We even trick or treating around our neighborhood was really cute it was nice because, last year we didn't do it, you know well, last year we did something else but. It was we this year, we also handed out candy but there weren't that many trick or treaters by the time I got home at like seven."
724.0,Provider,"Years it seemed like there was a lot more people, for I was at this year that obviously last year it's coven ironically like that, so the one day out of the year were wearing a mask is like encouraged and nobody came out so."
4856.0,Patient,"Right, I know. They were eager to encourage us not to come out last year, we did like a cute somebody in our neighborhood organized like. Like she had everybody paint rocks and then she made a list of all the rocks that were hit around the neighborhood so we all went on, like a scavenger hunt for these rocks it was pretty cute. yeah but this year was it was fun to see the neighbors own stuff."
724.0,Provider,"yeah some places, do you like the trunk or treat were like they go to a parking lot and fill up their cars with candy and shift and just go from like car to car."
4856.0,Patient,that's Q i've heard of that but I didn't know that.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so there's there's people like they either have like the. Like the candy like in their trunk or like people just sit like the back of the top of their car pass on candy on the parking lot so it's safer, more controlled."
4856.0,Patient,Interesting yeah you can let your kids run around.
724.0,Provider,"No, I don't know if I let my kids run right, it seems like it'd be like a it's almost like a Ted bundy or. Right, where it's like hey man like yeah the candies in the trunk and you push man shut the tree I know. that's what like john Wayne gacy and Ted bundy that was like their tactic was like you know kind of like a. I think it might have been Ted bundy were like he had like a cast on his arm he looked like he was struggling to like move or couch into a van you know and then people like all help you to be like now get on get on the other side of that he would push them. Like the open van and the furniture and he would push them and then shut the door the drive off."
4856.0,Patient,that's crazy.
724.0,Provider,yeah I don't throw us.
4856.0,Patient,stuff like that i'm I know right you're like. yeah and they don't like yeah it sounds like a like a field trip for a sicko right.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah I never understood, like the irony of Halloween it's like don't don't go don't take candy from strangers don't talk to strangers, except for one day out of the year it's okay to go do that kind of like a mixed message for kids."
4856.0,Patient,hey I know so true.
724.0,Provider,So.
4856.0,Patient,"I think. We live close enough to a school that I don't think there's any sex predators aren't a red. Because they aren't they I was led by schools, at least not registered."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah yeah they're not allowed within X amount of yards. used to be an APP and I don't know if it got shut down, but it was."
4856.0,Patient,yeah megan's law.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and you could you could type in like your address, and like sometimes it would look like chicken pox and then sometimes it wouldn't you were like holy shit I live in like a real bad."
4856.0,Patient,"yeah no I looked at that everywhere i've lived, although I don't think i've looked at it here. You found about it."
724.0,Provider,"yeah well there's a. there's somebody out there everywhere, for that type of stuff so it's hard to escape."
4856.0,Patient,Hopefully. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"how's how's everything else how's the how's the medication and I, we talked a little bit about. Like future goals and tapering and stuff like that."
4856.0,Patient,yeah it's going good my dose seems perfect for me right now eight milligrams a day. um I haven't been taking my second dose unless I really have to but it's not very often.
724.0,Provider,So your second dose would be four milligrams or is it is it a so it's eight milligrams a day twice a day or.
4856.0,Patient,"40 milligrams. it's a well. it's for four and four, but I take a in the morning and then, if i'm feeling like like i'm yawning a lot or my stomach hurts or anything when I take another half at night. Okay, and it's not very often that I need that second."
724.0,Provider,"Good. that's a good thing and and theoretically you have stuff left over to ride so there's like shortages and. I think we talked about like supply chain issues too so. As pharmacies they don't order enough or if they run out or kind of this stuff like that, at least, you have like a safety net."
4856.0,Patient,"But yeah I do every once in a while somebody will. Ask the first song that I do have several like backup if I need it. Hopefully, I don't. yeah it's been here in the US, at least well it's actually was where the ingredients come from right."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean there's a little bit of that too, and then like the. The the excise tax has been placed on like shipping and truck errs you know, like the I guess there's been like a pretty high. trucker tax place on the drivers and a lot of the drivers are like self employed and they're like I can't really afford to get in tax like this now so they've seen like a huge uptick in their their out of pocket costs so that's kind of slowed down that process, a little bit. So it's definitely much trucks on the road, so, even if it is you know you know made here and shipped here the so called going to be like a potential delay like bottleneck down the road so."
4856.0,Patient,scary to think about. It is.
724.0,Provider,yeah I think people really need to start paying attention to some of that stuff like some of the little blurb so I come up in the news where.
4856.0,Patient,yeah the.
724.0,Provider,"Day, and you know that, like if you missed it you missed it but there. I mean i've noticed shortages like grocery stores and stuff that I go to where stuff is typically there and it's not it hasn't been there for a couple of weeks now so it's like."
4856.0,Patient,"yeah no. Yes, I work as a personal assistant for a family and they one of their cars has a broken windshield. Which is, which is a subaru and like this it's been months and i've been calling subaru like to have their windshields and yet. there's like this crazy back order and now the guys the guys at the parts department are like everything's l like there's nothing we can do there's a huge shortage of like filters and all of these car parts anyways at least I was able to get wind chill. There was one with my name on it. it's crazy."
724.0,Provider,"yeah there's there things. out imagine that are probably going to be slowed down steel products, all that kind of stuff. or so, like all our manufacturing overseas and now. there's a huge delay and yeah it's. it's it's crazy. um any upcoming doctor's appointments anything, how do you feel any issues."
4856.0,Patient,"No, I feel good I just had my flu shot last week. Other than that, I don't have anything coming up."
724.0,Provider,"Any side effects, a flu shot I know some people get. There, to make it last year too, I felt like shit and this year, I felt so sick, I felt so achy."
4856.0,Patient,"But I always get my flu shot and I have never felt sick before, but I felt so sick this year I went to work and I came home early I was like i'm not, I have to go, I feel so sick. And, but Leo seemed fine the last year and made him sick. yeah but two years ago we actually skipped it and then he got pneumonia and had to go to a hospital and it was really scary so I was like i'm never gonna skip the flu shot again."
724.0,Provider,"yeah um. Yes, it's hit or miss with the flu shot."
4856.0,Patient,"I know, like it only covers like for flus when there's like hundreds out there is. There in the right one."
724.0,Provider,And it's like I don't know like it was like rolling the dice and then picking off like a whiteboard their.
4856.0,Patient,way down.
724.0,Provider,These four top.
4856.0,Patient,"It also like. it's also supposed to make your symptoms, a little bit like less severe no it's not covered for that flu anyways this pneumonia scare the shit out of me, and I was talking never skipping it again. I don't even know if that's why he got pneumonia but it's enough for me i'll do everything I can everything that doctor told me do that I can."
724.0,Provider,yeah I recently my my daughter to go get her her annual checkup and she ended up with two shots cycles it's like the usual mumps rubella and she's going through the list and she was like she's gonna get the flu shot today see I was like no no she's not.
4856.0,Patient,yeah even when.
724.0,Provider,I was like.
4856.0,Patient,yeah you don't have to.
724.0,Provider,Like I don't want to keep. popping this kid like constantly what should every year and it's like.
4856.0,Patient,hey now.
724.0,Provider,"I was working I was like we're gonna hold off a little bit and. yeah muted because literally she's been sick every every week so she's been Back to School you know what I mean. And I was like so she needs this and I don't think have the flu shot is going to you know stop that from happening, and she ended up sick anyways you know she ended up running a fever. Like like that day she was super hot to the touch and wasn't feeling good for like two days after her shots like a one I was like well that's typical. that's what they say happens and then. He got super sick and I was like waiting to get shot, so I don't know I just gets had a fever for two days honestly."
4856.0,Patient,"This is scary right now, too, and you know, like the smallest school, it is so scary."
724.0,Provider,"Well, my my son had a what they call a febrile seizure when he was like a year just over a year."
4856.0,Patient,My fever.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and he was like incoherent like super scary so like my like we had had them out during the day it was fine no issues and then put them out for his nap and then, when he came out of his nap. You know my girlfriend came and she was like she was like something's wrong and she had them like we talking about and he was just like this, not responding so like I grabbed. A sort of external rubbing up and i'm like hey come on Come on, like a pigeon is as pitch buzzfeed i'm like hey trying to get that funny just like. Just incoherent. And we tempt them, I was like call 911. We had like a paramedic like the town that I live in the paramedics was like the first one scene like dude Laden, the fire chief lives in my neighborhood so like he was here instantly and. If they tried tempo and we have, like the like the electronic monitoring it's like 9696 I was like this is weird they really feel for the touch. And then you know even the paramedics electronic one was like he's like this isn't right and we put them in the back of the the ambulance bus and they've you know record tempo and it was 104. So now like when I see people like hey Can I take your temperature like that OSHA don't work."
4856.0,Patient,"That one yeah I like that you're one is the one that we use here because you're one I feel like pretty honest but or the rectal temperature if your kindle sit for it. that's so scary well that's looked up like that's so fucking scary so what happened to Leo last year, like he was sick and he was out of town and I, and I kind of think I should have to take him to the er but he's like wheezy. Any wasn't breathing good and I just like stayed awake and like watched him right. He was like to he must have been too well, it was it was like two or three actually maybe he was three. But like I just watched him and then he got better three weeks passed and we went out to lunch with friends, we took bar we have like a super fun day we always like a little bit like more quiet than usual. And we got home from lunch and like we're sitting on the couch with a blanket over him he's like shaking he can't get comfortable he's like shivering and he's like i'm so cold so cold. But, like, I felt his hand and he was super hot, so we drove to the er we didn't he didn't even put them in his car seat he just held them in the backseat like we were terrified but it went from like zero to 100 so fucking fast like. after he had been sick, which I was like once they started talking about Kobe like people are sick and then they're fine for a couple weeks and then they're sick again and I was like this, this coven. But sustained I didn't get sick, then I assume it wasn't but anyways it's fucking scary when your kid gets sick it's so scary."
724.0,Provider,"Because they can't they can't really communicate like what do. We have the suppository tylenol now for the fee reduction like because now, now that he's had a febrile seizures."
4856.0,Patient,"he's right, you need to get it down."
724.0,Provider,"Well, no he's just prone to him, so you could add those users, they said X amount of years old."
4856.0,Patient,Oh that's so scary.
724.0,Provider,Every time the kid was a temp were like. Oh.
4856.0,Patient,yeah cuz even cover down so fast you don't have time to like for. Telling kick in.
724.0,Provider,"yep so we keep that like on hand it's part of our like our little bug out kit form and stuff like that and. But the previous year, right after he was born really. This is right before coven, so this is like in November in November, December before coven kicked off like in March, April for us right, even though it had been around kind of like in the background, a little bit like in China, and all that kind of stuff."
4856.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"There was a huge case of what they call our P, which is a respiratory infection that's prone with little kids right and I don't know if the rpg was coven because they weren't testing for coven back then they were testing."
4856.0,Patient,"Right at the same time, we were sick because they weren't testing for covert yet, but you could tell the nurse was like. fucking scared she is like. not touching my kid."
724.0,Provider,"When I went to, so this is in December right because because I had to take a we had to take him to the doctors every day for a week, right up until Christmas."
4856.0,Patient,So we were going to.
724.0,Provider,"Be address office every day or so this right before Christmas, I think, December 23 was the last time that we had to go so. A week before or maybe two weeks before my daughter was two years older than him at the time had like a nagging cough like she was coughing so bad like to the point where I thought she was faking and I was getting like frustrated with her, and I was. I was lucky to stop with the bullshit because I thought she was playing it up because that's like that's how bad it like it was so."
4856.0,Patient,Great right.
724.0,Provider,And then. yep that my ex got sick and she had a call for like through three weeks that she couldn't shake. And then my girlfriend got sick and I got sick and my son got sick. I think so like I think so because I don't normally get sick and my girlfriend doesn't get sick ever either.
4856.0,Patient,that's like how contagious it is.
724.0,Provider,"Right and we're all the same household so it makes sense, but my son, you know he he started developing a cough and we're like all right now, it made sense because, like my daughter, I was like Maybe she wasn't faking it now, I feel like a dirtbag for being upset about I. know he was coughing so bad, so he was a little kid so we take a man and a doctor. She was so stressed out because literally she's like she's like sorry guys every every kid that i've seen in here they're all sick they all have. Respiratory stuff going on she's like it's rp we're going to test him because it sounds like that's what he might have to I will know in 15 minutes if he has it and she did she looked like she was like being pulled in a million directions like when she came in. Before mass before anything we're. we're like hey what's going on she's like it's crazy in here today, you know what I mean we were like okay. So that they test so she came right back and she was like yep he's got it to something to come here every day if its temperature gets to us or another. Another level, you need to bring it back to the hospital immediately, you know, like this is the stuff that we're dealing with and I was like she's and then know, three months, four months down the road code started like kicking off and a. Even in the household the guys that i've worked with it like like the social worker that I used to deal with, he was like he's like he's like I think I got it back in like November, December."
4856.0,Patient,I know it was definitely here longer than they are yeah.
724.0,Provider,"He was like I was super run out and and I was, I was like I was sick to for like a solid week like I was like like out a."
4856.0,Patient,"long time to be sick a week is a long like a three days fine, but a week is a long time."
724.0,Provider,"You have kids to it you're just kind of like. you're like. 60% operations, we like just just enough to get by and then. yeah yeah but I didn't have a call like I mean the symptoms are all no fur coat or like flu like shortness of breath I didn't have any of that. about his."
4856.0,Patient,name.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know I mean so like like I don't know what it was, but I was definitely torn down like not feeling good."
4856.0,Patient,"wow that's wild that's really crazy, I had the flu, like, I had the flu that year, in December, which is why I thought. That it was February with Leo got sick and I was like the reason, and you know he's like sleeping with me he's breathing on me i'm like I felt like the reason I didn't get sick was because I had just been second know, in December. And I felt like my year immune systems just a little bit better afterwards, but. yeah that's so crazy."
724.0,Provider,"So we'll never know and i'd never, never got to work in the er. And we would like we are the webmaster. We weren't mandated in the House and start wearing masks until like the summer, you know what I mean so like when Kobe was here, and it was crazy and shit like that we're just we don't even know about asymptomatic people like. He just wasn't there and we were just operating like, as is and not."
4856.0,Patient,"You don't need to wear a mask like that's the dumbest thing because, like nurses wear masks during flu season like it's totally normal."
724.0,Provider,we're all that if they haven't been vaccinated event it's by choice it's not it's not mandatory for a nurse to wear masks if they if they don't get the flu shot.
4856.0,Patient,"not mandatory, but recommended like. that's."
724.0,Provider,"That that's how. You and I, you and I think, but when you. When you're wiping like adults acids and you're doing all like they're like they're like whatever they they get over it so fast and then even with the people with it during coven I couldn't tell you how many doctors and nurses were just like mask down when they were talking to you."
4856.0,Patient,"You know what I mean I know. Well, I fucking hate him so tired of worrying about like I don't have to wear it all the time, but like I had to when I went to leave school on Friday to volunteer and I had to wear a mask i'm like it to have to wear this thing all day is so fucked up I heated."
724.0,Provider,About imagine the kids that.
4856.0,Patient,"I know, will the kids are pretty resilient like that Leo doesn't fucking mind, but like I just thought so i'm just like so hot I feel like. I mean. The kids are pretty good with it because I can serve so used to it, but I feel so bad for the teachers, like the sauce yeah well my like my daughter speech delayed so she is also added like another barrier to. moodily because she can't see people talking, I know I can't see their teachers emotions."
724.0,Provider,"like this is like yeah we work on stuff and i'm like. How, how do you work on. stuff like this racist as a speech pathologist. So yeah I mean it's frustrating, and then I can't imagine what it's like like across like all levels, you know for like for the developmental for portion for kids at this point."
4856.0,Patient,Are you going to get your kids vaccinated. nope you're not.
724.0,Provider,i'm not gonna get a five year old vexes. know the numbers don't support you know that age bracket you know they've been far more resilient than that the all of the population that that is receptive and the ones that are high risk now if the kids like super iris that obviously yeah but.
4856.0,Patient,Oh interesting yeah. That makes sense.
724.0,Provider,You know that that some of the numbers at the CDC has that like 75 to 75% of the people that had coven and dive were morbidly obese.
4856.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So it's like like how and that we know that, like in this country that that that's a real problem so like how skewed or the numbers, you know what I mean, so I tend to go off like what I personally saw firsthand."
4856.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"My experience with it, like in for kids you know if it was like if it was wiping kids out Left and Right and obviously i'd be concerned but i'm more concerned that it hasn't and pumping them up with other shit that we just don't have enough longitudinal study with like. 10 years down the road and we've had enough information about it and yeah for sure, but i'm not. i'm not ready to. Start poking my kids at five years old that's bullshit."
4856.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"that's that's. there's a time and place for that stuff I would, I just want more information i'm not opposed to, I just want bore. yeah it's gonna come out like cuz even overseas there so that they have like a war that their Freedom of Information Act stuff right. That you can request information and these overseas pharmaceutical companies are asking the big the big ones here magana Pfizer and Andy in. Johnson and Johnson that give them access to the research so and the to make it generic so that they can make their own vaccines and these companies won't do it and they've recently signed like a bill that that releases them of all liability for future events."
4856.0,Patient,So interesting.
724.0,Provider,"So, like it's like 1020 years from now we've just like like San tags or zero attack, whatever that stuff was really supposed to be good for you now causes stomach cancer it's killing people and it's like they're not liable for that."
4856.0,Patient,and see.
724.0,Provider,"Recently they've been they've signed like a bill that protects them from any long term liability, which is spooky right."
4856.0,Patient,"what's funny is the attack is like the only drive that worked when I was pregnant, I took so much of it."
724.0,Provider,"yep so so. there's that little bit of weirdness to it and then there's the fact that they won't release the information about their about their studies. to the public, and if you mandate everybody if you force everybody to get the vaccine than that even helps them even more with the liability because it's like you can't you don't have a control study anymore."
4856.0,Patient,or control group oh.
724.0,Provider,"Let haven't got it to compare them to the people that have got it if you make. A sudden they're like who knows it wasn't our stuff you know it's like I don't know I got what college taught me and writing research papers was like critical thinking and then like. Peer reviewed stuff and make sure that that that stuff is like sourced out and, like all their all their studies are not biased studies or lopsided or like so i'm just i'm a little concerned about it."
4856.0,Patient,yeah I hear you yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I feel like people don't like having conversations about it, but you know, we should be challenging like our government constantly because it wasn't like you know hundred years ago, we were giving. You know, like a cancer and pesticides, like certain communities in this country to see what would happen, you know we did it with."
4856.0,Patient,"You know, in a yeah for real I know it's like that yeah I mean you shouldn't."
724.0,Provider,Trust her government 100% with your life that's what it's there for.
4856.0,Patient,So.
724.0,Provider,"Far that that file cheese copy the the NIH company has been doing cannot function research and in China at whoo hand which gain a function means that you take a. A known disease and then you put in bias, because my side, like a closer DNA to us to see if it and if they become like more human resistant and then you work on a cure for it so it's called Ghana functions like taking the plague. yeah making it stronger and then figuring out a way to deal with it so like if. Those breakout what day we know how to deal with it well guess what foushee who was in charge of that shit said that that we weren't doing Ghana function research, because it had been banned other Obama right. He was lying about at the NIH recently came out like two weeks when they were like yeah we we haven't do again a function researcher who had with coven because everybody says. Oh, it didn't come from the lab and it's like literally that's what they work on and then."
4856.0,Patient,It came from a fucking lab so.
724.0,Provider,"When Jon Stewart came out and he was on like a Stephen Colbert. who's not like a total show you know for the for the corporate media thing Kobe was like it's like going to the. hershey like what are their hershey farm is and then being a giant chocolate outbreak and then be like cool, I wonder what they're. Talking about their care and it's like. let's go ask the chocolate form where it came from is like and he's like literally he's like the name of the lab is too hard coded virus buddy lab. So. everybody's like oh now that's it's like for sure that's that's for like it's called octopus razor it's like keep it simple you know it's like the most obvious answer is off the time the correct answer it's like. So there's a lot of creepy that's going on here."
4856.0,Patient,yeah. For sure.
724.0,Provider,"We caused it, you know part of our money causes problem."
4856.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Anyway, anyways so what else a cracker work is going good."

This so feel rested and why i'm so tired I just like a like I can't go to bed. season, I feel like i'm caught up on my sleep I probably just need to exercise I haven't been exercising because i've been so. busy but."
724.0,Provider,So what do you do for this family.
4856.0,Patient,"Well, I service their cars, they have family office, and so I were they push all their invoices through because they have like three properties and projects going on on the properties, so a lot of invoices come through that I pushed to the accountants. My God, I do so much random stuff for them, I run I run errands for them, they have six cars, so to service their cars is like a lot takes a lot of time."
724.0,Provider,yeah.

I don't know i'd like luckily i've only ever had to work for this one and it's been great but i've heard stories about working for like some monster some monsters people. yeah that's wild I know, sometimes they make me do stuff that i'm like not qualified for. Like not going to any events that's for sure, like, I will not go to any events i'm like no. No way."

724.0,Provider,"Like they divide people like like. Like for whatever reasons, because so fanatical. You know what I mean."
4856.0,Patient,No and it's like well and it's just like so extreme like everything is so extreme and people are fucking getting off on it like it doesn't have to be so fucking extremely it doesn't have to be personal like.
724.0,Provider,"Have a conversation and tell people to to like like I read the news, and I source my news for like everybody I don't just go to like one I go to like. wait to see what's truly going on, because if it's if it's the real story you'll be able to like discern kinda like what's going on and and make your own. opinion based on that, but it's like you just see like all the craziness and i'm like that's not my experience at all like when I go outside and I go to walmart and I go like into the city like. I see like like city living like traditional like low socio economic shit like I see that right, I grew up in that like I grew up poor so like I know what that's like. I know how the other side live CDs i've been around like like wealthy people I by no stretch of the imagination and wealthy at along. Like like I work in social services so i'm like."
4856.0,Patient,hey.
724.0,Provider,"I got a lot of body man i'm not doing this for for the pay scale, you know."
4856.0,Patient,So that broken systems.
724.0,Provider,And it's like you know I go to walmart and I and i'll go to the ball and I see all that shouldn't it's like I don't see any of the true divide that I read about constantly.
4856.0,Patient,"If that makes. us see some true divides. Yes, it's because I think it's because my family is so liberal, but they know I totally see it make my cut my husband's family just came well this was like a couple months ago, but they came from Texas and. There were some really fucked up conversations that."
724.0,Provider,Have that are.
4856.0,Patient,inside it was like. It was terrible.
724.0,Provider,People from Texas can be pretty Richard.
4856.0,Patient,"Well, even my husband, like my husband had too much he has he sometimes can have a little bit of a drinking problem, but he was like I mean I put my headphones off for part of it, because I was like this is so fucked up like I don't want to hear it. Then I took my headphones off and I had to like go downstairs and intervene like what the Fuck are you guys doing you guys are being problem like stop having this conversation was bad."
724.0,Provider,For they go like full or.
4856.0,Patient,"yeah yes, both sides well, they were like shouting at each other, and it was it was crazy I had like I was like i've never seen either one of them like that it was my my it was my husband's uncle and it was like that next day was like super fucking awkward. Also wasted and I was just like. Shame on you guys it's really nice being sober."
724.0,Provider,feel yeah you can have a conversation with like shouting your head off and then getting into a fistfight it's like.
4856.0,Patient,"Yes, leave your family about we're soda but, like our core beliefs and our value systems are so polarized."
724.0,Provider,"Like I don't I don't believe in I don't think people should be fighting over lightly, like the two political party system because it's they're both equally flawed and they're. Literally hedge their bets and then there they contradict each other right so like and I always use this example is like the Republicans don't want you to have abortions, but they want you to have all the guns. democrats, why should have all the abortions, but none of the guns. that's. Right like. i'm going to. upset these people and whoever i'll take 50 i'll split the difference and that's holly bolt doing it's like nobody can be so black and white, you know I think most people that I deal with or somewhere in the middle, with like. Is what it is what it is it's not up to me per se."
4856.0,Patient,If you feel so strongly about one of these issues like you don't need to talk about it to somebody that you know feels differently just don't. Like.
724.0,Provider,So.
4856.0,Patient,"I just it doesn't need to be taught Not everything needs to be talked about just getting your vote. Honestly, like."
724.0,Provider,"So Dave chappelle had a skit right, and I think it's less out his most recent special but his, especially for that and he's he's a pretty progressive. Guy and liberal guide the spotlight, and if you see this new specially he's getting a lot of hate, but as new special was very. heartwarming was very touching like like the whole yeah it's real like it's sad because, like he's really screwed up about, and you know, the Community is really upset with him, but like when I watched it, I was like. I don't see why they're super upset he was truly affected by it like this situation, I will spoil it for you, but you should watch it maybe."
4856.0,Patient,"I should watch it it's so funny name my husband loves chappelle he wants to go see a movie for like. I don't know how much the tickets are like $600 i'm like treat yourself and you really want to go, because she was going to be there, but i'm like just buy one ticket like I have no interest i'm not a huge fan. he's always wanted to talk to chappelle he's had a couple. Opportunities because she spends a lot of time that's in Francisco. But yeah anyways I guess i'll have to watch it putting it off."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's like when I when I was watching it, I was like like I don't see why there's there's so much hate if anything like he's coming off like quite supportive like."
4856.0,Patient,Like yeah like in his own way.
724.0,Provider,"yeah but I don't know like like I was watching I was like I don't know why people are like hell bent on. You know I mean, he says things, but like like pointing what he gets preachy about things it's coming from like like like a genuine place so like like part of the issues that like he he met a person. Who transition for male the female, and it was is open, he was like cool he's like you could be my opening act he thought he thought she was funny and he called he called a buyer name that you prefer, and all this kind of shit. yeah and then, as the story progresses like, but he had her open up like this big show for it like she had all this confidence and she bought it so part of the thing is like. He keeps on things like I don't know why is she was awful that night but like they have like this story, because after she bomb she sat down with the front row and then like during his comedy show. It got to a point where he was he in her were just communicating back and forth. So then, like the show turn like like a totally different direction and that's like that, like, I guess, like the metaphor for like what he was getting at was that, like it through their conversation that the two of them had on stage like changes perspective on things. And he would always end he's like, despite the fact that she bought like the show. You know what I mean like don't forget, and she bombed everybody was like it was just like he's choking on me, it was like a reoccurring thing is like. And unfortunately I won't spoil it because it's really touching like at the end you know what I mean it's really sad. But he gets through, and I was like I was like I was moved by it, I was like he didn't do or say anything that that some people might not think what he was accepting he was like you do what you want to do."
4856.0,Patient,You know what I mean he was like right right.
724.0,Provider,"It was cool his previous special heads. The same thing about abortion, he was. Like he's like look he's like he's like I don't have a horse in the race, you know what I mean it was like dude you want to do with your body your choice he's like he's like well I got a problem with these like is if the man. doesn't want you to have the kid you decide to have the kid and he's like it's my money by choice that type of thing, so he was like it's got to work both ways."
4856.0,Patient,yeah right. Right right.
724.0,Provider,Like I don't want you to have abortion and the chick does and it's like Well he doesn't it's her body's her choices like that's fine it's my.
4856.0,Patient,Mother she expects all those of you like that's totally.
