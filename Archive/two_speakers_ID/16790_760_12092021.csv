You know, to work on in your life. Before we can we get started, though, Michelle can you let me know what you're looking to get."
16790.0,Patient,"from high you know i'm just not. i'm just not functioning, you know day to day. Every day. Basic. daily activities, I guess. So that's been very difficult and i'm a business owner and a single mom."

760.0,Provider,"Well, not always, but they can be combined. yeah so okay so. If you could rate for me your depression on a scale of one to 10 just generally you know, maybe in the last couple weeks, you know, can you. I think."
16790.0,Patient,"I would probably say that I mean this is the worst it's ever been for me and i've experienced it, you know some. Previous and I think i've been in it for quite a while now, but it's the worst it's ever been so I would probably say. Like eight or nine. Okay, on my on my spectrum, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and how long have you experienced the symptoms."
16790.0,Patient,"it's probably been it's probably been a few years now. Okay, what about level."
760.0,Provider,351 thing that you had maybe in a milder form earlier on. it's gotten worse.
16790.0,Patient,"It probably it probably was, but I would say, in the last five six years. I guess yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, are you currently taking any medication for anything."
16790.0,Patient,"Yes, so I spoke with Julie. Things her name. Last week. exactly a week ago, so yeah she prescribed medication so i've been taking that."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, has huge I think oftentimes it takes a few weeks, for that to build up in the system system. But have you noticed any improvement in the week you've been taking it or you."
16790.0,Patient,"Around the same, I think I think you know i've noticed some improvement um but I don't know if that's like a. Mind over matter kind of thing."
760.0,Provider,Like okay.
16790.0,Patient,"So it should be. Okay, so it should be able to do these things so i'm doing them I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so maybe a little early I asked you that question."
16790.0,Patient,"yeah and she. She you know gave me some supplement recommendations so i've been taking the vitamin D3 and my magnesium is should be here today, so I will start taking that. Which i'm in the fitness industry so anything any supplements, you know I would definitely prefer to take over the medication, but i'm, to the point where I need something that's I know it's not going to be immediate but I need like to get this under control now kind of thing. Okay yeah because I was to the point where i'm. not going to hurt myself like that's not even. Like on my mind, but just. there's the times when i'm like Maybe I should just drop my daughter off of her dad's and just I just want to go, I just want to run away. So can I would never do that to her, but OK."
760.0,Provider,OK.
16790.0,Patient,"But I just know I need to. get it under control i've always procrastinated but now it's. Really really bad like it is i'm like down to the minute I need to pay that bill, and I, you know barely get it in on time or or I might be late now with a deadline or you know that kind of thing where before. You know I I wasn't."
760.0,Provider,"Alright, so what is your business, you said you have your own business, so what I."
16790.0,Patient,Do i'm a gym owner. Okay yeah.
760.0,Provider,So you own a gym and you have staff that operates the gym.
16790.0,Patient,"Yes, pretty much."
760.0,Provider,"Is there. Is there things that you're kind of putting to the side that need to be done, as the owner that maybe the staff is not our can't. Oh, are you think you're procrastinating on some of those vital. functions."
16790.0,Patient,"um yeah yeah they do handle you know the basic day to day operations. Which is great, you know, I have a regular gym manager and trainers, so they take care of the basic day to day. stuff but I know that I don't want to put everything on them, so I will say Oh well, I will handle that but then I don't end up handling it or getting it done very late or. That kind of thing."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, is is the is the business doing, how would you characterize the business is doing is it doing well, is it doing okay. it's I know it's. You know yard with cold as last last year, so that might be kind of a loaded question."
16790.0,Patient,"yeah exactly exactly and that might be part of my problem too, because of the full. I was supposed to open in March of last year 2020 so not only did I go through you know finding a location issues and construction and permitting issues and then i'm like oh my God Finally, you know the day i'm going to open and I can't open, and so I think some of that is definitely. played into. All of you know my condition. But. um we're increasing numbers monthly. So."
760.0,Provider,"You know, was getting better. yeah it's getting better now. And everybody I struggling and 2020, especially if you own. anything resembling a gym. yeah yeah. So it's."
16790.0,Patient,"Getting it's getting better but i'm you know it probably could get better quicker, if I were you know 100%. kind of thing okay yeah."
760.0,Provider,Is there any family history of. Mental health conditions that run in your in your family.
16790.0,Patient,"um you know, not that I know of but probably nothing that has been ever been diagnosed."

You know I moved him in thinking that you know, this would be you know a great hope you know a little support you know, so I could leave my daughter, you know here at home with him, you know with, I have to go and work. kind of thing, well then he ended up having. He ended up having a stroke and yeah and he can he can care for himself his basic. pretty much his basic you know daily needs. But you know now. He he kind of lost function in his right leg, so he has difficulty walking he can walk with a Walker he showers he can make himself a meal sometimes refuses to so I feel like I have to prepare his meals for him. He can't we haven't let him drive we just don't think that. would go so well. he's losing a lot of strength. i'm pretty quickly he's at. 80 yeah he's at, and so you know doctors appointments my sister also lives in the area, so she had them, you know with doctors appointments."
760.0,Provider,Good.
16790.0,Patient,"And that kind of thing, but you know I take him to the to the market, and you know."

With you know after school activities and that kind of thing um I think. You know I say they were pretty supportive they were supportive but. my sister and I we we had to care for ourselves. A lot you know we were kind of like. You know, we would get on the bus and go home and mom and dad might not be home until five or six o'clock in the afternoon or evening, but you know, there was always you know food for us to prepare, or you know that kind of thing I remember being. Like go and having cheerleading practice after school, but then I would have to wait for an hour, so you know for my mom to pick me up after work, you know that kind of thing but. But never you know put in danger or never our basic needs, you know we're always met. Okay yeah okay."

760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16790.0,Patient,"So I did like mommy and me classes and. I did, that for like 18 years and then moved on to this, but so fitness was kind of my hobby but now you know not. So much that I don't know if it's because it's my business now. I don't enjoy it."
760.0,Provider,You don't enjoy.
16790.0,Patient,"As I used to. yeah working out and that was like kind of like my my therapy like that's how I. I think that's how I was able to function and I don't I don't do that anymore and. i'm. You know there's really nothing else spend a lot of time in front of the TV, a lot of time on my phone. And I find it. You know anything to I think it's anything to keep me from having to sit there and think about you know, whatever you know the day to day. You know stuff is or. concerns that i'm you know anything to take my mind off that stuff."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you mentioned that you're divorced. How is your. How was your relationship with a difficult divorce."
16790.0,Patient,"It was it really wasn't a difficult divorce, the you know the situation for getting divorced was was bad. I met him through. When I was buying this other franchise my gym. The children's thing and that's how I met him and because he worked for the franchise or. and So that's how we met and we ended up in a relationship, and you know getting married and. he's very, very. Type a personality."
760.0,Provider,perfectionist stick.
16790.0,Patient,"Yes, and if you didn't do it. The way you know we would come home from camping and I would be unloading the equipment from the the truck and it wouldn't be in a way that he wanted me to do it and and. And so, he would just get angry and you know tell me, you know just go in the House and you know i'll do that, and he would be angry and it was always kind of that kind of thing always like walking on eggshells kind of thing you know help me back the truck up to hook, the trailer up. I would just dread that. Whole. As soon as you say it, I would be on edge, because I knew that I wouldn't be doing it right, according to him, so it was that kind of thing a lot."
760.0,Provider,And how long did you stay married with him.
16790.0,Patient,"We met. We were together in total for 15 years. And we were married for nine. And it's just like when we got married like it was it was his wedding pretty much he picked. The colors he picked the and I was Okay, with it, I was like I was working I also ended up working for the franchise so I traveled a lot to other. franchise franchises and so at the time, like that was great to you handle the wedding you know you handle the planning and. Basically I showed up with the dress but he would have had that with their had I not picked picked out a dress he schedule the photographers he did he did everything and every event was like that. We weren't going to have kids and. It was kind of like Oh, we thought a match made in heaven or I did like you don't want you, you know you don't want kids oh I don't want kids either great perfect match and that's not all we based the relationship. But and then next thing you know he's coming to me and he's like well, maybe we should reconsider and I understand you know all of our friends at that point were starting to plan and have children and. You know the dynamic of our friendship relationships would would change i'm sure and. But he also brought it to me. You know, three months before my 40th birthday, and I was just. I couldn't even. We didn't even talk about it again for. A good six nine months. After after that, and I think I I never thought about. You know kids were never like part of my plan ever, not that I ever said no, I don't want kids but you know you think about that thing about being a mom or."
760.0,Provider,Changing should I. Changes your priorities and yeah.
16790.0,Patient,yeah that I think I think a lot of my depression started with that.
760.0,Provider,With what with being.
16790.0,Patient,"With knowing how much. My life would change. By having a child and. I feel like you know, it was my choice, but I felt like I don't know if I felt like I had to or. And he always said, you know this isn't a deal breaker you know if you decide that we don't want to do this, but. I think like I knew like that that's what you wanted so. that's what I did. And I think yeah I think it has changed things so drastically for me. And then even I mean our relationship wasn't great I remember being pregnant. and telling my mom. You know, he talked me he pretty much talked me into this baby and I know i'm going to. be a single mom I said that when I was pregnant to her. And then."
760.0,Provider,So you saw the problems. you're holding. Prior to the pregnant pregnancy.
16790.0,Patient,yeah and I and i'm like well Maybe it was you know let's have a baby to save the marriage kind of thing and. yeah I I think that's when it when it all started. And then we got divorced. Just before her fourth birthday yeah just right before her for the.
760.0,Provider,"Day so she was super young. yeah. Okay, so. yeah So do you feel that there's things that. You wanted to do, back then, or all the way from them to now that you didn't get to do."
16790.0,Patient,I don't think anything specific. I think I just liked. Being able to just pick up and go if I wanted to or.
760.0,Provider,pick up and go take a vacation pick up.
16790.0,Patient,"Right, where."
760.0,Provider,Day trip or.
16790.0,Patient,"What yeah yeah. The freedom, yes yeah. yeah I think that's a lot of what it was."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and your outlet to cope with that stress back then was exercise."
16790.0,Patient,"yeah more my for me it really started. My degrees in fitness anyway so i've always been in the fitness industry some way or another, but i'm. The fitness like I because I became like it was you know four to six days a week after I got divorced, is when it really when I started really working out, it was just a casual thing before, but when when I got divorced, it became regular pretty much daily. And before that. I think just she she was you know I wasn't working and she just became. She. became my life, you know, like that's what you do, but but yeah. She was my hobby there really wasn't any."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so doing things with her or maybe enrolling her activities and those kinds of things. yeah okay. Okay. So. Where do you can you talk to me about your your sense of self or your self esteem. What are your thoughts or feelings on that or how would you rank yourself with that."
16790.0,Patient,"it's super it's very low it's. You know I always. You know, I was a I still am, but I mean it was a business owner I you know i'm the mom that you know makes every single Halloween costume you know if i'm going to take something on i'm going to do it 100% and I. I can't do that right now. I don't take things on because. i'm scared i'm going to disappoint people and I realized that. That. You know and do all that stuff. i'm for me. Even though I should be doing that stuff for me and not worry about what. anybody else. thinks or. or or thinks of me. I guess is what i'm trying to say. So it's it's I would say, like three four. And then even I got into two relationships after I got divorced so we've been divorced now for. six and a half years. And so I got into two other relationships and both of them ended up having a full time living girlfriend had no idea and so that I think just. Has. not helped. With my self esteem and my self worth."
760.0,Provider,"All right, um talk to me about your stress level."
16790.0,Patient,"um. it's it's pretty bad it's been bad. You know, with the gym and even though you know we are growing and building. And just kind of give you the back story, you know, so we we couldn't open when we wanted to. yeah and. So then, all these government programs come out the PPP and the the idol loan, and so I apply at the at that point, I really didn't have any employees, nobody was on a w two everything was kind of per task I just paid as we went along. Without having an actual payroll. and And so I applied for these programs and and because I wasn't actually open um I think you had to be open February of 2020 like February 15 whatever it was I did not qualify for. Any of that government assistance. And you know, even if I had owned my my gym in. I could have you know submitted, you know those numbers but I had sold that business in. i'm. Like August of 2018 but it took me forever to find a location and then my construction and. I mean even. With the money that I made they also said that because it was so little it was only like five or $6,000 that I made in. We were kind of in our presale membership, you know pre opening membership phase, and so it was very little, and they said that it wasn't a significant enough. to qualify me for a loan, so I didn't get any of the government assistance and i'm. We finally opened I didn't pay rent for I just started paying rent a couple of months ago in before that, a few months before that I was paying just kind of partial paying what I could, as I went along. So I still can't meet the day to day. operating expenses. And uh we're getting so close, but it is just a constant stress like where where, am I going to get the money i'm doing everything I don't have a lot in my savings but i'm trying not to. You know dip into my you know personal savings, or you know ISAs that's my daughter savings to fund the gym and I think just being so close to you know, being able to cover everything. I feel is right there but. yeah just my unemployment check went to pay for. My payroll for the gym. So i'm. yeah i'm constantly stressed."
760.0,Provider,So that's.
16790.0,Patient,yeah and my daughter's in therapy right now i'm just because she's she's got. Like separation anxiety and. yeah because of the.
760.0,Provider,Because of the divorce or because.
16790.0,Patient,"I don't. know it happened, like a little bit later. i'm just before coven it was just very strange but they've come. You know we've discovered a few little things about you know she's very concerned about me because I don't. Because I don't have anybody I don't have a significant other. And so she's always worried. she's always worried about who's gonna take care of me. would be there for me. And so."
760.0,Provider,"Is that something you worry about, too, is it only your daughter worrying about that."
16790.0,Patient,"If you're like oh my daughter because i've never. You know I. I talked about dating a little bit with her, because I feel like this is a real like learning opportunity that most kids don't get to see they don't get to see you know how to date properly and how to pick the right person. You know they don't get to see that that you know typically their parents are already married and you know that's nothing that they get to experience but I never i've never ever. You know, said Oh, I need somebody to take care of me or I need. To tell her like Oh, you know, yes, I would like. Somebody to you know share my life with. An experienced things with. But never like this is what I need, and you know I can't take care of myself without having somebody else like I never want her. To ever think that she that she can't take care of herself. You know or be without somebody and you know i've been single for six years now, you know and there's really been nobody in. i'm very would be very protective of her any way to introduce anybody. So I don't know where that comes from. You know, when I do I do want her to know that I, you know that I missed her when she's at her dad's and."
760.0,Provider,Did you do tell her that.
16790.0,Patient,"yeah I tell her oh i'm going to miss you, you know when you're at your dads are, and I have said, I have said. You know i'm going to be so lonely without you, you know what am I going to do you know kind of things so maybe that's where it comes from, and I don't say that all the time, but it is something that i've said before. and But she's constantly mommy are you sure you're going to be able to your you sure you to pick me up are you sure you're going to be here on time and I never even in my condition like i've never not showing up on time or have not remembered to pick her up or anything like that so. I don't know where that comes from and she constantly wants to make sure that I have my phone on me 24 seven she's like mommy if I call you. I I need you to answer and then. Finally, one day, she said, I said, you know what you know, sometimes I might not be able to answer you know I might be working or you know somewhere where I don't hear my phone or. And she's like I know mommy but you need to call me back right away because i'm always scared this something if you don't answer i'm scared something's happened to you. So in that doesn't happen at her dad's house. I have 70% custody and he has 30 but like when we went to therapy and the therapist was like Oh well, you know you know what are your thoughts on you know what's kind of happening, you know you know with her. And he said, you know what honestly if if it wasn't what Michelle was experiencing with her we wouldn't be here because that stuff doesn't happen at my house. and So, so now, there are a few things that you know happen at his house, but she doesn't. She doesn't discuss them with him, then she brings that home and i'm dealing with. With you know her anxiety and her stress about being at his house and what's happening here. At at our House. So that puts a lot of pressure. on me."
760.0,Provider,"All right, and how well do you have any health problems. No physical health."
16790.0,Patient,Okay. And don't me talk to me about your health habits your sleep.
760.0,Provider,Your your. Exercise level you're eating.
16790.0,Patient,"So exercise i'm i'm like once or twice a week at this point i'm trying to really push myself to get in there more often. Eating right now is bad it's bad i'll just eat whatever I want and, of course, you know I weighed pretty much the same that I did you know, a year ago, but just my body composition has changed, you know my lean muscle mass is not so much, and you know i've i've gained more fat. But weight wise, you know somebody may not really even notice that you know that stuff has changed. Because it's not like I put on a suit and I know. That that that's how my body has changed, but so I pretty much eat whatever I try to stay healthy, especially with my daughter, you know I don't want her to get into those habits and I want her to be able to make the healthy choices. So typically when i'm by myself, like that's when. i'll just be like whatever. And I I stress eat. as well. And then sleep wise um. I go to I I could go to sleep at the same time, my daughter does, which I typically do. So, like nine 930. mm hmm I might be awake until 1030. And then up that. You know, seven o'clock but never really that's a long time it's like nine hours of sleep and I never feel rested like i've never ever. And i'm just probably not a morning person I don't ever remember being like you know jumping out of bed when I wake up and you know ready to face the day i've never been like that, but. But yeah I don't feel completely rested there are times I will wake up in the middle of the night to three o'clock and be up for you know, a couple hours I don't get out of bed I try to I try to go to back to sleep and I try not to get on my phone or that kind of thing. And you know, after an hour, you know I do I grabbed the phone and and then i'm up for another hour and a half or whatever. And I typically go back to sleep but, and that will probably happen once, twice a week, maybe. And there might be times, you know that I can't fall asleep until you know 12 or one. But. So i've been taking melatonin Julie said to just take it, no matter what right now. Whether I feel like i'm going to need it or not."
760.0,Provider,"alright. last question, I have a do you have any history with substance use or abuse. No Okay, and not in your family whoa okay."
16790.0,Patient,"Not my parents didn't even have alcohol in the House or drink too much, when we were growing them okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, um so. Just to kind of review a little bit, thank you for being so honest with me. Sure kind of covered all the questions that I had many of them without me having to ask. So I appreciate that. So what i'm understanding is that the overwhelming feelings of depression and worry anxiety. or zapping maybe that's what's causing you to feel so. Like I can sleep nine hours, but I still don't feel rested because that constant emotion is that something that you're experiencing from the time you get up till. We me fall asleep kind of thing. yeah managing those symptoms, so that would be the area that we would want to work on, then going forward correct. Yes, okay all right well. Have you started your groups."
16790.0,Patient,"Yes, the Monday I started this this past Monday."
760.0,Provider,And how did that go.
16790.0,Patient,"It went well um I didn't know, of course, what to expect to there were a lot of people in the group I was shocked. Okay, there were 25 of us and. It was good, we talked about the acronym glad, so you know being grateful and you know thinking about. The day and what you're grateful for what you learned that day what you accomplished, and you know delight, so what brought you joy that day and I have a hard time with those activities i'm like oh geez you know I. You know this is so cheesy it's exactly what I thought it's going to be honest. I have a hard time with that stuff I don't know why but um. But it was good, I actually you know we all, we all had to go around, and you know talk about those four things and. At first I was like it's it's only you know nine in the morning I haven't learned anything, yet today, but you know you, you find something but um, but it was good, and I was actually very productive that day. which I was shocked. yeah, then I actually sat down I didn't sit in front of the TV like I actually got a few things. So I thought okay."
760.0,Provider,"that's that's. awesome yeah well we'll talk about that a little bit more next time. i'm i'm thinking about. talking to you about what's called cognitive behavioral therapy. Because I know that when we have. Heavy feelings or you know negative thinking patterns it causes our depression or maybe anxiety. or worry fear kinds of emotions and then that can drive behavior or lack of behavior you know, lack of motivation kinds of behaviors, and so I appreciate your honesty about the the Vlad ackerman being cheesy. But there is a science behind that and I would just you know just as like a little bit a little bit of introduction into cpt or cognitive behavioral therapy, there is a science to that. yeah to continue to. put up with the cheesiness and go. Through the process right where it takes you. In addition to the medication that I know you've been consistent with taking. So we can work on that the other thing I would suggest would be finding you know you don't have to exercise. Full on and these the other thought I have that maybe finding a place to exercise that's not your business because maybe the the emotion of walking into my business with the intention to exercise is triggering some of that anxiety some that worry and, of course, avoid that. So and and then plus you you're going to have the energy of all the employees oh there's the owner kinds of thoughts that are going to be going through and that may not be the environment that's going to give you the peace of mind to. Do the exercise that's."
