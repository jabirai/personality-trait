I mix them together and because my sciatic nerve I couldn't walk I couldn't nothing, it was so bad and I rub them together on my back and then I have this massage thing to play rub the knots out."
148.0,Provider,Good.
13673.0,Patient,"So i'm like going okay i'm ready for surgery get this thing out whatever it is, because I may ask them next time I go because. it's been years since it's been there it's not getting better or worse, so it maybe they can. laparoscopy. They do it laparoscopic take it out. Okay."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good. All right, um. We haven't talked about thanksgiving it right, did you want to process that at all, because I know that was emotional for you leading up to it."
13673.0,Patient,"Oh, I was afraid you're gonna ask me about thanksgiving."
148.0,Provider,and Talk about anything you know we're. Talking about Christine I don't want you to feel triggered or uncomfortable.
13673.0,Patient,"um. I learned a lot about myself this time um I can't see my kids anymore. it's time to cut it. they're very cool. And I did not see and my oldest daughter said, the most nastiest mean things to me i've never heard. Anyone say this thing, she said to me. And I asked her. Where is this, I mean this is like severe anger. mission, where is this coming from it's she just hates me and then. When she behaves this way my other kids won't talk to me so and then it was also my son's birthday and um I slept. In I was really tired, so I had gotten up that morning at about 915 year, so I went back to bed, and I woke up at two it was a birthday, and I will get to my ex husband texting me to call my son and tell him happy birthday. And my son just turned 22 he's not a little boy. he's a grown man, and I know that it's my son's birthday, I gave birth to him and he does this to me every year. and And I told my person I just woke up, I was in pain and they don't care they just start nailing to me a hand and then he, like uses his ex girlfriend. Not his ex girlfriend his current girlfriend that that that's the only the only people that told him Happy Birthday was him and April and bethany and i'm like why aren't you doing something for his birthday. Why are you calling me and and i'm and. i'm complaining to me when he's with me. I don't call you I get him a cake, please or go out to dinner or I tell him we don't want your favorite meal I cook your favorite and I think his favorite male or go to dinner. And then I get him a cake and birthday, I mean it's just what we do for everybody's birthday in in the House and. I mean we even have pictures and videos of it and i'm like the whole time you're right here ragging on me about my son, you could be doing something for him, where he feels bad okay go make him not build that take him someplace go to dinner go to lunch go. I mean do something, instead of making this whole drug and and you're making things worse, you know it has some time as an adult, we have to realize that. we're not always going to get a phone call from our parents or anybody else and say happy birthday, you know some at some point, I mean I don't know, maybe you get happy birthdays but I don't all the time, and you just have to go Okay, you know but. That happen and. I tried calling him he wouldn't answer to me. i'm. tried calling bethany she wouldn't answer me. i've i've called. I left test messages I let him know, I have a birthday gift for them, when I send them. They won't answer i've text messaged him and he says okay mom. Why don't talk about this another time right now i'm but i'm. tired and going to bed, and I said okay that's fine, yes, well, I have not heard from them and it rips me apart when they do that and. I was like I mean I break every time that happens, I break down. and And then, and then this time I realized, something that i'm doing, and that I probably when they were growing up, and maybe that's why, just like I neglected or is I do a lot of like obsessive rumination. And I usually. Because I do like even on this I sat and I replayed it over and over and over and over my mind everything I said everything they said just over over and over I mean all they go stay up all night thinking about it and. And I remember when the kids were growing up in order JESSICA was growing up, I mean it was just me raising them and I had to work and everything, so my mind was always thinking and I was always busy so maybe that's why she feels. The way she does but it doesn't work."
148.0,Provider,Right.
13673.0,Patient,"Basically, my kids abuse me, I mean they just try, but she. She didn't but bethany has physically assaulted me and gone to juvenile Hall for it before. Too salty me a few times, but basically they abused me and. that's why I usually. When you talk to you asking drew want to talk about boundaries, I guess, just yes, yes. Because because i'm even when I say no. I mean i'm just scared to set a boundary with anyone because I don't know what you're going to do now, you know my experience with my kids and with my mom and dad and with my ex husband has been if I say no, it gets very violent. And, and so I don't say no, and when I want to say no, I don't want to do this or or no. i'm not available. or you're. Crossing my boundaries and asking personal things that I am not comfortable you know it's like I feel like I have no right. You know."
148.0,Provider,"So, Christine you have felt abused by everybody in your family."
13673.0,Patient,"My parents and my siblings. And I know i'm not i'm not being oh poor me. i'm not trying to have a pity party, but you know the dynamics in my family are pretty strange. And then my ex husband really know what abuse was I didn't. I mean I grew up being hit and yoga and called names so. me was nothing compared to what I grew up with, so it didn't dawn on me that he was abusive you know, and I also I was 16 years old. When I left home and got married so that's a kid 16 years old you're a kid and all I was looking for was to get away from my parents, because I knew I mean the night I love I knew a beating was coming, and I was like nope, no, no more, no more. So um. And my sisters, you know they have the survivor family too, but for some reason. I think that, like my mom. Because the dynamics. um. She. I was more outspoken and more of hey there's an elephant in the room. kind of person and. I think that my sister's chose the side that's going to be the safest. You know, like in my home with my parents my oldest sister she left home when she was 16 two. Men, she was there, she would come running in. get my data. So he wasn't there anymore to to get between yeah. So he was 30 I was 13 when she left. Oh so. My other older sister my younger sister all they did was self preserve you know they. You choose the side, where you're not gonna get in trouble. So that's what they did so basically have kind of like. i'm not i'm not. Doing that corny pity me i'm just. there's something about me. Nobody like. me. Maybe i'm doing something. I just got some good I. Maybe i'm doing something. And it's causing people to. steer away from me, you know."
148.0,Provider,"Well, Christine I just have to say there's nothing that you could do that would warrant this abuse. Right there's nothing that you could do. That would deserve. To be abused."
13673.0,Patient,"Well, maybe they don't see it as abuse. You know they see me as a problem they really, really do. So, because I was like I I found out that my my older sister has an autoimmune disease also and then my younger sister has Ms so when they told me about the lupus they wanted to call my sister that has Ms and asked her you know because it's kind of almost similar. and her and I are the only ones that have the same mom and dad. So. I asked my older sister Would you ask for see if I can ever phone number. and Leona it said yeah I don't see why she wouldn't and. And she text me back you said i'm sorry it's it's taken so long, I just haven't heard back from rosie so it's like I instantly think. me, you know. cuz we ever taught. Even since my mom died in 2018."
148.0,Provider,"wow. So, Christine i'm hearing that you feel like you're playing a part in this, and how you're treated in your relationships, what do you think that could be."
13673.0,Patient,People.
148.0,Provider,"Do you know, can you tell me more about that, like how."
13673.0,Patient,"know. beliefs, I don't have the same. kind of. Believe it or not, I am probably outspoken you know not like loud obnoxious. But when when I see something's not right. I say that's not right that's that's not right that's. or. I don't know I. think there has to be something i'm doing. Be logically. whoo would just be mad at somebody for no reason you know. So in my mind if I say, well, and because you know. I really carefully before there's. there's always a my part right there's always my head straight that I need to stay on it to clean up to take responsibility for. It so I try not to blame and I everybody for everything else, I tried to go okay obviously there's gotta be something i'm doing, and you know, maybe I don't know right now wouldn't doing. It maybe I need to figure it out and then that I can have better relationships."
148.0,Provider,"So I wonder how you could go about doing that I wonder if you could maybe sit down and write in a journal, you know. What you feel like has happened in relationships and then take a look at your part, that I wonder if that would be helpful and then you have that you know looking right back at you, so you can't kind of twisted or right does that make sense."
13673.0,Patient,yeah like like what write down like it when something happens.
148.0,Provider,"Right right right yeah and when you feel like you're being mistreated and you know going back and looking at Okay, what was the situation that led to this."
13673.0,Patient,yeah I think that would be really helpful to.
148.0,Provider,"be able to find a pattern there that might be helpful and healing this and in repairing your relationships, I also want to ask you. Do you feel like there are any healthy relationships that you have in your life currently."
13673.0,Patient,No.
148.0,Provider,there's not. there's no support that you have.
13673.0,Patient,"Well, so support, but I wouldn't say I mean he gives me supportive, but when I say it's healthy. it's the most healthy what I have. Because I don't believe lying. And and being sneaky healthy. And you know. I mean i'm smart enough. And i've been I was married to the master manipulator so. I can have my glasses on they can't see you. I was married to the master manipulator so I could pick it up. But you know when you live in those environment in that environment you pick up coping skills coping mechanisms they become a way of life for you and you don't know you're doing something when you're doing it. You know."
148.0,Provider,Would it be do you mean coping mechanisms or Defense mechanism.
13673.0,Patient,is maybe both. Wait I.
148.0,Provider,"thing is good right we want you to cope, we want you to take care of yourself when you're feeling. This pain that other people in your life are causing you like, I want you to be able to take care of yourself and cope with that unhealthy ways, such as maybe journaling to release some of the emotion or meditating or practicing positive affirmations. Right Those are our coping."
13673.0,Patient,i'm not doing any of that.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe we can start to incorporate some more coping healthy coping and self care into your daily routine to help to manage the stress around all that, because it is a lot of stress that. that's being caused by your your relationships right."
13673.0,Patient,yeah and I think that's what caused honestly. The my body imploded from that stress.
148.0,Provider,Right right and.
13673.0,Patient,"that's what happened Ashley it my body held every signal, I did not say."
148.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah and what happens yeah."
13673.0,Patient,"In a in a trade, so my body can't take any more, please throw. Because. I mean it just out of the blue it's like for years, my body so much pain and. anger and frustration, I never grieved by father's death My mother died, and not one person can be consoled me. They I mean my daughter was happy to baby it when my mom died or her. Her dad couldn't get there, my Greg kids I had to hold it for days. When my mother died."
148.0,Provider,see your body is having a you're having a physical reaction to the pain sharing and sign of you.
13673.0,Patient,"Much as it's like. It doesn't help with my daughter goes it's all in your head you just psychosomatic just get over it. and tell your site your your therapist that you even have one, and I make your nasty. nasty mouth you just stay away from people don't be a social worker, because that damage somebody really bad. But yes some things are psychosomatic that my body imploded. This dress. I that's where this all started for this injury it started for the back of my head, I think that. I was under so much stress and they and i'm the type of person that can't have too much stimuli going on at one time. So, like it's either the tv's going to be on it's not going to be too loud or the you could have the radio on from your phone and then the the babies running around playing, but it cannot be everything at one time for me it's like pick your. pick what you want to do and cuz it over stimulates and I can't handle it like I can't handle loud noises loud music i'm sudden sudden. Things dropping falling I mean I can't handle the sound of babies current I mean i've got i'm a trigger i'm a walking trigger. And I and they're going. So I guess it doesn't affect them, you know."
148.0,Provider,"Well, I wouldn't technically categorize that as normal and i'm honestly, not a huge fan of the word normal, but I would just say it's feels different for you and that's Okay, you have to take care of yourself where you're at."
13673.0,Patient,"yeah that's why I really want to go like I wanted to I bought a book about you know. Who I do with it about it's basically the obsessive rumination because that's what I do you do that, I used to be talking to me. And I. I have, I don't know I think he said. That you know that, because i'm off."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13673.0,Patient,"someplace else and it's on. And I need to get in trouble, when I was a kid for daydream all day in class, I would just sit and look out the window all day long you know do my work and. So, because i'm like Okay, this is going to stop because it started even drive me crazy."
148.0,Provider,"And, have you ever been diagnosed with. learning disability or a dd or ADHD."
13673.0,Patient,"nobody's ever cared chuck. I. With my son was the baby. In the head start they had a therapist you would work with the parents and he he did it. He offered free therapy for the moms with the kids and he did tell me at social anxiety which, in which, when he did explain it to me I light bulb went on, and I finally went oh my God that makes so much sense and. Why i'm alone, all the time, you know I will literally read the opposite direction of people. Just that's it but. You know my son has ADHD and learning disability so maybe it came for me me."
148.0,Provider,I hear that you've. So disappointed. So disappointed and neglected your whole life. And that's causing pain it's causing emotional pain mental pain physical pain. there's pain i'm. This pain is real for you.
13673.0,Patient,yeah. People are tired I don't talk about. they're tired of your pain.
148.0,Provider,"And if other people aren't beating you up you're beating yourself up. With those ruminating thoughts thinking of worst case scenarios and your your mind just thinking that. Even if you're not hearing it from another person, but thinking that. No one is accepting of you."
13673.0,Patient,And I also can't forgive myself. it's my fault.
148.0,Provider,holding on to a lot of guilt and shame.
13673.0,Patient,"I wish I. know better, every time they say sorry i'm sorry I just. it's a. it's still there they're holding on to it, they know, everybody forgives in their own time."
148.0,Provider,I must wonder if anybody else can forgive you if you haven't forgiven yourself.
13673.0,Patient,Like yes please.
148.0,Provider,"i'm. Christine I want to give you a couple things today, first of all, I feel like today you're breaking through a little bit more than I have seen you. break through in the past, like you're really in a place of I want to figure this out.
