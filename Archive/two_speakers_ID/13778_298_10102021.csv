I want to teach either kindergarten or third grade and i'd like to teach kindergarten because I had an amazing kindergarten teacher and i've worked in a kindergarten classroom for five years. When I was younger and I also want to teach or third grade because I had a pretty awful third grade experience. And I went through two teachers and then my mom homeschooled me. And it was it was awful I had one of my peak. Just right before I switched it was at Christmas we're doing some kind of craft if it were, it was, but I remember her whipping around because we're all talking and having fun and she told us to shut up and call this little insignificant jerks. which sounds outrageous fish, it was exactly that and then my second teacher constantly sent me home with notes and I was about kid I couldn't sit still I talk too much, and then I got evaluated for a dd and ADHD. And that, and when I was evaluated they had to get a note from the school and the teacher said I was perfectly fine in a wonder in class. And my mom was like i'm done and I got homeschooled."

298.0,Provider,"Good. My cousin my first cousin we're pretty close she teaches us third grade in the sacramento school system okay. awesome she has inner city kids she tells stories i'm like wow. So I put in abilify. A 10 milligram tablet and I went to go put in a 7.5 milligram and realize they don't make 7.5 milligrams which means you need to have a 15 milligram tablet and a half of a 15 million. yeah and so. When you get to the pharmacist if they try to give you a. 10 milligram tablet. I tried to cancel the order but it didn't go through so.
