Okay, but the thing going on hold on just try something. cuz like i'm really just you know the depression color anything I really like. I was more looking for trying things for each day but. I remember, was that a lot before the depression, I really go unnoticed. But the anxiety and the uja filling Those are two problems that i'm like. They kind of affect me more than a depression, probably has. Okay, so you would."
760.0,Provider,Like to you would like to try something to see if that helps to reduce your symptoms.
16794.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, because, like with school, for example. I leave everything. I can never be too. So, like. I do like my application I applied for ucs Ray. And it's long like know the the like personal questions I wrote them like I wrote, two of them in one day today there was two. Because they kept postponing and then zander Dooley, it is a deal and i'm like oh. Like my homework and like to do the. to sit and watch something. I like I can't and i'm like you gotta do this like part of my brain like you gotta do is the marines top trainers look at your phones so nice. And just tough to like keep up with everything. Like I."
760.0,Provider,scheduling time budgeting your time. yeah.
16794.0,Patient,"I do my laundry carry the the the clothes, like a take them out of the dryer like a fold them like a week later.

Like I remember my mom being mad at me because I like pick projects that I, either by virtue of materials, like the day before the day I was like mom can we do this. You know, and I was like whoa.

16794.0,Patient,"Like Tommy. So I talked to a terrible like I feel two miles from the like the adrenaline rush. That kind of pushes me to do it in an hour. Because I was doing I was taught to be my boyfriend. Like you get a lot of adrenaline rush. I noticed when I started doing it, and I know it's like it's almost like a similar feeling i'm close to doing an assignment. So, like i'm. Just like my brain stops me like to it. Really boosts me."
760.0,Provider,That adrenaline or another word for adrenaline is stress hormones so you're beating anxiety. relying upon that.

16794.0,Patient,"Okay, I feel like for some people might be like really helpful what I personally just feel kind of uncomfortable."
760.0,Provider,"Maybe maybe a group. Maybe you could think and it's just a suggestion, but. Being a group with other people who struggle with Depression and anxiety and not substance abuse be. Maybe more beneficial. For you."
16794.0,Patient,is probably like.
760.0,Provider,struggling with the same things that you're struggling with.

Like a few weeks ago and I went on bar with friends, they meeting new people I talked to everyone, like I don't have a problem meeting people in person, but I feel like when it's just that kind of saying like. yeah I tried to be biased because I also like I did at one time was like a bunch of people that couldn't really at all, but I just like I don't know ever known, and I might have a job seems like scheduling wise i'm like.
