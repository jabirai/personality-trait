760.0,Provider,"Okay, does that help you, with your anxiety."
16788.0,Patient,"It does it actually helps me, be a little bit more clear yeah I get up some, no matter what time I go to bed i'm up around four o'clock between. Four and so typically you know i'll do my fire breathers to do some yoga and kind of get my day started."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and who are the people in your life that support you Bridget."
16788.0,Patient,"And I am an only child um. I recently moved back to my parents um so i'm living with my parents, however, I bought a trailer a travel trailer, and so I live in a travel trailer in your backyard. Okay yeah."
760.0,Provider,But you have your own privacy and they in your in your trailer right now I can.
16788.0,Patient,"Right absolutely I had somebody to jail, if I have this trailer, let me tell you right now."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds to me that your parents, on one hand. support you, but maybe, on the other hand, emotionally, or perhaps with mental health or perhaps dealing with stress or life situations it's not a support."
16788.0,Patient,I think that's.
760.0,Provider,fair to say.
16788.0,Patient,that's fair to say this.
760.0,Provider,Okay. All right. anybody else that you have in your life that can you pick and support you with like you know your strengths and your upsets and you know. Those kinds of things.
16788.0,Patient,"I do, and I do have a few elder seniors you know seniors I have a lot of older ladies. who are friends and i'm part of a few sister circles, so I you know, have a member of sisters, but I did not, I see, I think I think I share with you know each person individually, I don't think I share everything with everybody."
760.0,Provider,"that's not that's no I wouldn't I always think you mentioned boundaries, you know and people can be either you know wearing all their emotions on their sleeve and tell people. Maybe things they shouldn't take tell that that come back to them in some kind of negative or destructive ways. Then other times people don't share with nobody it's always about balance, you know, so the point of the question is, do you have people in your life like say there's some kind of an emotional crisis or upset that you need somebody to talk to. Do you have somebody to contact support you that's the question because it doesn't sound like your mom and dad or that you. know so that's why I was asking you that."
16788.0,Patient,"Question yeah no they wouldn't be there, but I do have people that I click you know when it came to that when it gets to them didn't call."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, great okay sounds like you have quite a few circles and sister circles, so that that implies. You may not have lead siblings but maybe you kind of adopted some. siblings sisters so that's that's positive."
16788.0,Patient,"Yes, I do have to have sisters, but you know i'm the oldest and when we're we're close I guess is you know ones in another State and the other ones, maybe about three hours away so we talk every couple of months."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and as far as professional support you're just starting with the right heart health have you been in therapy before. when no one kind of treatment when for the alcoholism, perhaps, or anything like that."
16788.0,Patient,"No, I want to lose my desktop i'm willing to cook accepted a 30 day challenge and then just extended it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I do want to let you know, because you didn't have that incident many, many years ago. I just want to share with you that you know, should you need it, or even if you should know somebody who might need it, there is a nationwide hotline. is similar to 911 but 911 is more geared to like you know I don't know fires and break ins and all those kinds of things this hotline is more geared towards mental health mental health prices, and that is 988. Okay, so just should you need that or know somebody who needs that I just want to pass that along to you. So you're safe environments, on which is my next question, I think you kind of answered already that you shared about your camper. Is that one of your safe environments yeah. Do you have any other places outside of your camper that are safe environments for you."
16788.0,Patient,I spend time at the park I do go to the park.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all right um. Okay, so so you're saying that you're not really struggling too much with depression right now. No, no okay. All right, um okay so talk to me about your history with substances let's start with alcohol, how long and how much did you drink, you said you were sober for seven years that's what you said right."
16788.0,Patient,"Yes, seven years, so I, so I so real estate in our earlier 30 so very stressful. height, so I definitely closed transactions over martinis. First Come on, I think it was it was a bookkeeper to for claim jumpers so i've always been moving and making money and partying and kind of mixing them together and so um. And then I was a functioning alcoholic On top of that, because I did well and so everybody just thought it was cool I did chew um you know until I started getting duis and tearing up cars and going to jail and that type of thing, and so it became really bad. And I was nasty I mean, and I just recognized that I was being an ass, and so the alcohol was really. That was with that that's how I cope, that was the only way I cope, and then, of course I smoke cigarettes probably smoked a pack and half a day. drink lots of coffee and Red Bull yeah yeah That was my big of looking back on it now total stimulant day that was my day."
760.0,Provider,Okay.

You know that i'm not a kid but then i'm living at her house, I mean your property so there's that so it's I get that you know if you're such an adult, why are you here type of thing um so it's always that so i'm always kind of on guard with them real because I don't know what. your nose."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you don't really feel safe. And let your in your Pamper them. yeah mentally emotionally."

16788.0,Patient,"So, with the childhood I grew up in a very religious and like one of those religious. Families my stepfather's father was a pastor of a church looking at freaking cold almost, but you can tell them that i'm. So there was a just a lot of when I think about this growing up my mom marry him when I was six so just hearing that like this big rapture the end of the world was going to kind of concerns always just. Is gloom and you know doing that God is gonna come in from heaven at any given moment and sweep you up you know, and so it was always that type of. Energy around with grew up with me so and then, but my mother. Having me. And being married my stepfather his family weren't very accepting so they weren't very nice. growing up, and so it was tough, it was rough and so it wasn't a lot of. I can hear twin brothers, they will do it would just do stuff to me, she couldn't really nobody could really see it, you know I think HP the mother would pinch me they would just like to do stuff to me um. You know they like, who was really you know, nobody would really believe me, I was like six or seven but they would always say do stuff to me, so it was always that type of like getting emotional now i'm. thing around them, you know, I was always leery."
760.0,Provider,like it.
16788.0,Patient,always learn. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
760.0,Provider,So that brought up triggered you a little bit.
16788.0,Patient,"Just a tad bit just a tad bit you know because that's their others family i'm here, so I have a lot that you know they call I see him, and these are people who are really mean to me, and then, who I am an adult and when I see how much ready to pop."
760.0,Provider,Okay. So it's kind of the memory is just kind of always in your face.
16788.0,Patient,God was there. yeah there.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, um. How would you describe your stress level."
16788.0,Patient,well. I don't think I really stress that they come okay i'm managing them when I do feel stressed out walking again and i'm actually making stuff so i'm managing my stress level so right now it's like bottle five. Right now.
760.0,Provider,You have a hobby of making things are our work or something what What do you do.
16788.0,Patient,"I make a lot of I make candles and make these I just recently started making. This ancestor staff. Oh so yeah. Thank you i'm as i'm always making stuff. It just really helps me to unpack a little bit, so the more I made stuff the better, I feel."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right good good good okay talk to me a little bit about your self esteem."
16788.0,Patient,"You know i've been thinking about that because I always feel like you know I am just very you know very understand who I am but. I think i'm just now accepting that i've been studying and kind of looking at you know your energy chakras and I was looking at the solar plexus, which is a yellow one and it's developed between the ages of. 14 and 21, which is where your self esteem, is that and thought about growing up, and you know that kind of household and the self esteem was developed there and that pressure cooker. So it i'm learning to be more comfortable with my weirdness and who, I am and because it hasn't always been that way."
760.0,Provider,weirdness I hate that word. I like I like. The the. I think everybody's kind of I don't like the word weird I just think your uniqueness.
16788.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Who makes Bridget Bridget.
16788.0,Patient,You know.
760.0,Provider,yeah what is it that makes Bridget Bridget is. Probably what makes you interesting.
16788.0,Patient,"It makes me, you know as i'm getting older it's i'm accepting it more wasn't. yeah. yeah."
760.0,Provider,"yeah we we typically struggle with that early on, so yeah you're right."
16788.0,Patient,"Lisa i'm getting better at. Like saying Oh, this is, who, I am not really explaining it too much sometimes."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so it just feels a little bit awkward and uncomfortable, perhaps because you never knew. You had this kind of dual thing going like, with your with your mother and your stepfather emotionally you didn't know what was going to come out of come out of that emotionally to be emotionally hurt and then the combination of the finishing and. that's kind of like another level, so you know kind of makes sense to me that you want to that you develop the habit of wanting to avoid conflict because it's just a reminder of lack of safety. I like to say there's you know there's different types of safety, you know, obviously physical safety is crucial, but we also have like. emotional safety and and and. that's also important to look at. So kind of want to throw that out. Are you."
16788.0,Patient,"dreaming, I do think too like when it when I try to avoid conflict with something that comes up this year three women, I had three different friendships with women that. dissolve because I mean I thought they were doing some stinky shit, to be honest with you and I felt it and I. I just didn't feel like addressing it is, I am both of them all everybody's called me and I just have I feel like they know. What am I what am I doing I don't know if that's avoiding conflict or."
760.0,Provider,"Well, if it's I know I think. Sometimes, like our family we kind of have to deal with the blood relations or the family, a little bit more, but if if there's like a friend who's toxic, you can decide this person is not is this person beneficial to me in my life or not. You know and somebody who really does is toxic in their interactions are in there, taking I don't know. You know, maybe, maybe, if you think it would be good for you to. learn to assert yourself, it might be worth your while but, at the end of the day, with a person who's not related to you like that that you don't want to have that kind of relationship with anymore it's kind of up to you. To say something or not, because the fact of somebody being toxic kind of tells you who they are. Right."
16788.0,Patient,This is where i'm at with it.
760.0,Provider,"yeah so I don't know. yeah and are you are you going to expose yourself to potential issues if you open your mouth, you know, so you have any kind of have to assess it all comes back to me in my view, Bridget with what is my intention. Right, am I doing this from a place of strength. Because i'm set because you know that's a hard boundary right or am I doing this from a place of weakness, because I can't handle this and if it's the other one, and that would be something that we should look at. sense."
16788.0,Patient,"yeah makes a lighter because I will I will, I think the way you broke it down and make sense, because i've been thinking like. You know, is it the ego of mind, or is it my intuition, because my intuition, is telling me keep going, or is it the ego said I you know you don't need to do that so i've been trying to really filter. These three relationships, because I don't want to be it where you know i'm trying to self regulate here I don't want to be this ego driven person cannot have relationships, because you know I have this big old head. But on the flip side I gotta trust my intuition as well, and I know what my intuition, is telling me so i've been really. Mindful I should say, really, really, when you set the intention it spoke to me because I really have been really trying to be mindful of having you know I tend to. friendships right."
760.0,Provider,Okay. And if it's not that then it's not that. You man you're not gonna you know not going to fix anybody.
16788.0,Patient,You know.
760.0,Provider,So and other than yourself you're you're already working on that so okay um. let's see So where are you living right now.

So maybe I am a little have a little stress, because I seem to be buying a little bit more of the stupid little knickknacks stuff that I don't need to buy this stays in my car, you know."
760.0,Provider,"yeah cuz I think. We can develop habits, I like to call them like compulsive behaviors like if i'm struggling emotionally or having depression, maybe i'm feeling anxious, I can turn to like a maladaptive coping which would be the drinking the too much coffee the smoking. But also spending can creep into that kind of ecstatic worried because when I do my shopping that dopamine rush, maybe, maybe i'm getting that little. thing through this process it's not about stuff with the 99 cent starts about that. That little poll."
16788.0,Patient,"Yes, that little. Though yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
760.0,Provider,"So that can be an area, you do have a lot of really positive coping skills to replace that with. So perhaps there's something unconsciously that's still bothering you."

760.0,Provider,"what's uh yeah well you, it seems like. I it's. In a lot of ways, it looks like you had a difficult time in childhood and then the fact that you're still here you're still there, I mean living with your parents.

And it's specifically for people who have either substance use substance abuse issues which I know you that's in your past and then also ptsd, but I also it's very useful for even people who have dealt with traumatic things. And so maybe there's some things in here that I can pull out and we can work on, in addition to the boundaries, actually, I think there is an issue a whole section on boundaries in here. But we can do. Because that sounds. Interesting to you."

But I said okay I just understood that everybody's progression is different, but I understood, where I was at a little bit more. Clear. In the Chris Fisher to."
760.0,Provider,"So I enjoy yeah. Well it's good because group in my experience. You can learn things from others or or maybe somebody experience reminds you of something of your experience and then even just the. On the flip side of that if, perhaps, maybe you've done had a chance to do more work than maybe some of the other people in group, you get that chance to. give back what you already know and kind of backed up with your own experience with other people so. there's there's. value in both of those experiences with broke."
