15029.0,Patient,"I had a bit of a slip up last week, unfortunately. I don't know I just. Having kind of a tough day of work and. Unfortunately, went for it, I think the the feeling was a little different I think the soon as I think as soon as I kind of felt that the. Like the pressure of like maybe getting in trouble it's gone away, then the fear went away, and unfortunately I just kind of went for it, I don't know what else to say it was just a bad decision."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but let's let's just rewind the tape a little bit there were times, where you called me before i'm like I need to talk to you why why didn't we do the LIFE preserver last week."
15029.0,Patient,Why didn't we. um. I don't know I just didn't think I could. I just didn't even think of that I don't know why exactly but. I just didn't I didn't think I could maybe even get Ahold of you quick enough. And it just I don't know I probably should do that next time.
214.0,Provider,"i'm not looking to make you feel bad. i'm looking for you. The question really lies in you, I just want to say when I heard you just say something you rationalize possibly why you didn't contact me like. Well shit ain't gonna be available, so what the hell i'm not saying that's what you thought, but in my mind i'm thinking that because there was a point when you were in your car, you were struggling one day. You email me we got on you felt better and we kind of got over it together and you said something at the start of it, where you kind of felt like. You know people ain't going to come knocking on your door to come get you you've got comfortable."

214.0,Provider,So what happened at work that stressed you out.
15029.0,Patient,"um well it's hard to explain, but there is I set up these events for Microsoft and nothing was working. That day all of our systems were down and I had like. Four or five different people contacting me and it. kind of overwhelmed me a bit. And I hadn't had a day like that, at work in a while I just kind of riding a hot streak. and have like just good things happening and it just. It was just kind of caught me off guard because I didn't expect it. And that day also it was like just really like shitty weather to like just pouring rain and cold and. In Seattle and I just didn't want to get out I wasn't feeling good, and I was trying to do battle this thing and then I then unfortunately I just kind of went for it, I couldn't do much at work that day, because everything was kind of down. not functioning properly. Then that happened so that's kind of the that's kind of I think why. It happened yeah."

15029.0,Patient,"It was it wasn't it was like what I do it's hard to explain and talk about, but like what i've The other thing that i've done is like you listen to like noises, I guess, and it just it I guess it didn't block it, or something you know any mean I don't know how to explain it."
214.0,Provider,Nobody else you could call What about your friend.
15029.0,Patient,yeah I should call them.
214.0,Provider,"Again i'm just i'm trying to get you to the the next tsunami what you're going to do when the tsunami hits like what are going to be the tools you're going to take out the bag real quick. and hopefully they all work and they're all going to be present, or at least one of them be president, because we have to believe this will happen again. This this in decisiveness, should I should I not should I should I not it's going to happen again, so why not talk about how to prepare for it. And I don't want to dwell on what happened, I want to really be better prepared in preparedness toys really cultivating a plan to not let that happen. Are you tell your girlfriend."

15029.0,Patient,"um. There was a lot of guilt and kind of I felt kind of bad dirty. um. I haven't done it since I think because of that kind of guilty feeling. um. There was kind of a guilty just overall feeling for the next kind of day or so. And then it went away and I haven't had any like major urges since then, which I think is kind of good. I did have an urge yesterday, but I was able to kind of squash it because I was, I was I had an opportunity to leave, and I did. I took it um. yeah so that's kind of where we're at right now."
214.0,Provider,Was that the only stressor work.
15029.0,Patient,"I think the other stressor to and my life is, I just have not seen rachel's much and not that we've grown apart, or anything bad, but she's she teaches at a school and it's a first year teaching and she loves to be there and prepare. She gets home kind of late every day she leaves around five and wakes me up around five and i'm not mad at her for that she she wakes me up around 5am and then I usually go on my phone for 2030 minutes and just like. talk to people or whatever, and then I. Then I go back to bed. And then I wake up at like seven or 730 and I start work."
214.0,Provider,Who you talking to a 530 in the morning.
15029.0,Patient,"Oh, I friends on the east coast. Okay mm hmm."
214.0,Provider,"Do you think that's a pattern, or do you think that's. inherently a habit you picked up."
15029.0,Patient,What the the.
214.0,Provider,530 Texan.
15029.0,Patient,um.
214.0,Provider,Could you could text at 12.
15029.0,Patient,"You don't have to talk yeah yeah yeah yeah. And I think it's just because I can't fall asleep right away, so I just like. They don't always reach back right away, but. I just kind of say hi and whatever."
214.0,Provider,"yeah my my my not my concern what i'm what i'm seeing is the attachment to the electronic device. yeah you know it's like oxygen for somebody with COPD you know, like if i'm up I gotta be touching and I got to be used against like you know if you see me shaking it, although you may not be shaking it's kind of that thing that cause you to use it. You know, so I mean I know you got to work and you got friends, but like we need to be careful, like we're not. we're not mixing signals like you know I want to reach out to my friend of 530 in the morning and then, if I have a shitty day do I go on a porn site already use the phone like there's this in one hand was saying, the phone is access. Unlimited Lee safely and then we we throw that caveat that this is safe right now anyway nobody's here like i'm just trying to get you to see like. You know it's like haven't been in the fridge and I supposed to be drinking and it's like Okay, if you don't get rid of the be in the fridge is going to be a problem. I know you can't get rid of the phone, but you got to look at your device more like a a mechanism. For either work or communication, but it doesn't it doesn't do more than that, it doesn't have more purposes than two purposes don't give it the power that like it has over you in that vulnerable moment."
15029.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I agree.
214.0,Provider,"You know it's it's tough, I mean I get it i'm just trying to i'm trying to figure out something happen before work because I you don't seem like the guided internalizes stuff. mm hmm so you know when Microsoft isn't working all that we've all been faced with horrific technologies that it has nothing to do with us. But I don't know if I would say to myself this kind of sucks I hate this and then I would go do something, because of Microsoft i'm just trying what made you think. What made you internalize it like you know you can't do nothing, nothing will get done it's like yes."
15029.0,Patient,"Oh, my so it doesn't matter. I didn't explain that well, I mean it was a little bit more than that, it was just I had a lot of people kind of contact me at once. And that kind of just blew up in my face, I mean that that's it's unexcusable what happened that that shit can happen at work any day in our I mean like it was just. I think it was just that I was riding like this, this really good wave and I had really good things happen and I thought, for some reason it's going to continue and then and then kind of it was just a bad day at work in general i'd gotten into an argument with somebody. To like just about this situation they said that it went that that our messages kind of went through, and then I said it didn't and it's just it was it was just kind of everything at once, I don't know how to explain it."
214.0,Provider,"let's go. Again, my concern is what what what what's the action plan going forward that's all we need to work on, we don't need to work on this kind of identified I guess you, I want to say that it was one of those phuket days and that's what happened basically. But like we gotta Be careful like. You know where's the bar being said that."
15029.0,Patient,"I don't. Have any more fucking days like I need to. discontinue to dig deeper, and I mean. I should just reach out immediately if something bad happens, I think."
214.0,Provider,"Is it in an email i'll I can reach out, I mean i'll be able to talk to you that moment. But you could have a moment of distraction, maybe all i'll send you something i'll send you a poster i'll send you a link, you know anything that to get through the minute. Of that hot desire to do it, maybe we can put it up pretty easily with a small fire extinguisher don't need a whole fire department coming on saying i'm just. i'm trying to give you a way to say okay so i'm in crisis, what do I do okay I i'm going to do this first i'm going to do this because you could always do porn. But you can always utilize your tools, because once you do point the tools are useless, but if you have the tools before the point is okay. i'm going to try everything I can but I don't know how that's gonna work if nobody helps me, I understand that, because that's usually what happens in a slip. slip happens, you know you're supposed to call the 10. The 10 most important people view there's gonna be a few they're not going to be there, everybody needs to stop with that. They have their own lives and I just waiting for a moment for the text to come in, but in the other hand, I know, certain people when I see the emails come in, I know it means like I need your attention right now I get that and i'll give it to you, I would say let's try it right what's. The worst thing I fail you it's possible it's very possible I fell you, but at least you went and did something before you did something, and maybe that's enough to say you know what. I don't need this guy screw him I you know i'm now my now i'm pissed off myself let's go get a coffee, maybe that's enough to and heavily change your direction."
15029.0,Patient,I can see that yeah okay.
214.0,Provider,"let's go back over here for a moment. let's see what's going on, oh whoo. All right. Okay, so. Now wrong there many. Today Okay, here we go now let's get to you. So you still haven't gone for lab so."
