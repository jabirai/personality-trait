The tablets okay so for you we're going to have to work on what the correct dose says, for you, I would suggest, when you pick up your medicine you start with half of a tablet okay. and make sure that you don't have precipitated withdrawal you're pretty sick now, and I think it's gonna be okay um. Before you went to prison Todd like when you were in more active drug use, like what What was your general like amount per day."

505.0,Provider,"Okay okay so we're gonna try to figure out the right though his son your suboxone I don't know exactly what it is, but we'll work together and i'm a goal a say you don't have cravings. it's very important with your suboxone when you take it you let it dissolve under your tongue right. You know that if you swallow it if you don't absorb it. Right. don't eat don't drink don't smoke, while it's in there anything will interfere with his absorption and you need this medicine, so it needs to go all the way okay any questions about that. Any questions about suboxone."
