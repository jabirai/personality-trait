480.0,Provider,How are you.
13808.0,Patient,i'm doing all right i'm a little bit frazzled the moment I just arrived at my place of work so i'm i'm in my car.
480.0,Provider,"So why are you frazzled are you supposed to be working right now, or do you just are."
13808.0,Patient,"I am and i'm not I did delay my start time to work but it's not ideal, the job that i'm doing right now is kind of my post work work i'm helping out at a theater we're setting up a I do i'm a technician so we're setting up a Christmas show."
480.0,Provider,The Monaco wait so you're real work you're also a technician.
13808.0,Patient,"Well, no, well what i'm doing for my main job okay great now is i'm working as a an attendant for disabled woman. yeah. I started, I was working as a technician prior to the pandemic and then, when everything shut down, I went to care for my grandfather in hospice care and then and actually really enjoyed the work and loved it so after. He passed. I went to work in a senior care facility, and that was. A not sustain it was really hard. yeah and then I got into in home care and i've got a really sweet thing right now. But i'm also as things begin to open up i'm working i'd like picking up additional things here in there for different."
480.0,Provider,Here is what you like. want to build your career in.
13808.0,Patient,"Possibly there was a lot of time to reflect and think about it, I mean i've been on the fence, I think, because I love working and they're performing arts and it is a passion of mine and but the nature of like the work the lifestyle itself is. Something that I have I is hard and. And I think. And not always like super sustainable so i'm still exploring whether or not I feel like that is a sustainable option for me and still doing projects and shows that I care a lot about and then also just in a place in my life right now and i'm trying to figure out. i'm trying to think longer term than I ever have and. that's yeah. that's a big shift. yeah yeah."
480.0,Provider,"And it's also hard because, like. A lot of therapy is staying present right so it's like working through learning a bunch of coping skills and ways to deal with life, a lot of that is staying present think about the moment stay in today. But then it's like Okay, but at some point you do still have to plan for the future which then is going to heighten anxiety and all of that stuff which then it's kind of a spiral. yeah yeah it's a tough spot to be yeah."
13808.0,Patient,"it's definitely something I struggle with, and it is a way that I kind of like jump out of the moment, I find myself doing that a lot it's like really like yeah forward thinking and kind of I don't know that I I probably spend more time in the future than I do, the past."
480.0,Provider,Because i'd rather it be the future than the past.
13808.0,Patient,yeah. I did yeah I tend to like get really caught up in these like thought loops these like really unproductive sort of and I talked myself in and out of things a lot i'm really good at that.
480.0,Provider,So. Do you have that trauma history. So a lot of trauma reaction versus. Just anxiety.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah that's quite possible, you ask um I. um there's some things uh yeah I mean i've gone back and forth on. um. yeah like hat like. I went through a period where I was with a with a yeah I don't know man, it would be a lot to get into all of that there is some in my history. I don't it's like. I wouldn't say that there's like a specific like recent kind of event that is like prevailing are on my mind, a lot um. I do kind of wonder about yeah again certain things here. I mean i'm transgender so that's. relevant to things that's relevant to my day to day life. And I think like. My route in terms of childhood and everything and growing up i've always kind of presented as like non binary and so and. kind of gender non conforming and that was something I really struggled with and and I, the way that I think I would, if I look at the way that I kind of respond to. authority and, like other kinds of rules and says like there there's there's things there, but I think like the biggest thing for me related to that has to do with like my social anxiety. And my avoidant behavior around like i'm a pretty social person and I love people, but I have a lot of avoidant patterns, where I get extremely overwhelmed or I don't quite, I think, where I go in my head is that I talked myself into thinking that like I never quite fit in. anywhere and there's like. And that kind of it's a it's a form of like how I kind of isolate myself in my own. You know. yeah yeah so that's that's definitely a pattern for me. and"
480.0,Provider,"Let me ask you this, do you feel like you said, the big part of your social anxiety is. All this like talking yourself into are out of things are creating stories in your head that aren't necessarily true. And you don't always feel like you fit in so that the social anxiety, do you feel like that's a trauma response to the fact that growing up you didn't feel like you fit in because of the non binary part."
13808.0,Patient,yeah probably and like yeah that maybe.
480.0,Provider,That like overthinking what people are thinking of you are how they're perceiving you and that's.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah a little bit obsessive about it, and I think like the more time that I spend. Not actively in my relationships, but in my head around them, or like anticipating new ones or new environments like I can get. You know, like, I know that, like, I can spend a lot of time, anticipating even when I just like see my friends, and then the reality when i'm there is very different than like anything that i've like oh. yeah and I also have I have maybe some stuff related to like I guess, I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, so I think. I have some. Some things around just like. In terms of thinking about my future and kind of moving forward and the things that I feel like accessible to me and options like I definitely struggle with like education and sort of like how to find my way through, like me, I don't know."
480.0,Provider,A traditional school college is not necessarily.
13808.0,Patient,"I have a bachelor's degree, but I think the one thing that i've been really like has been for the past. Three or four years now i've been thinking about going back to graduate school and i've gotten into like two or three different programs and then like run away and not done it and then continue to find myself in similar cycles and patterns, where i'm like. I don't know i'm like afraid to go back to doing that and then. Also, not feeling happy with not doing it, and maybe anxiety about like opting out of it, I mean I love learning, but I just like really struggle with in that system."
480.0,Provider,When would you go back for like what were you accepted in for.
13808.0,Patient,I was accepted into a social work Program. which I had because I was interested in like counseling. and social work. And then I was also interested in this like. A therapeutic theatre drama therapy expressive arts therapy Program. yeah and then the other was an architecture it's like it was architecture urban planning and environmental management it's called like a. public interest design so.
480.0,Provider,very different from therapy.
13808.0,Patient,yeah I have i'm kind of I have a lot of interest but there's like yeah there's things I mean I was really interested in sort of like kind of merging the two in some way but um.
480.0,Provider,you're in California right.
13808.0,Patient,In the bay area yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so all right so let's table the whole feud. let's talk about now so in group the little bit I did talk to you. You said drinking is one of the things that is an issue it's become kind of a habit you don't necessarily. want to continue but. yeah okay so talk to me a little bit more about like do you have any other addiction history, have you still have you been sober ever before Is this something new that you're just realizing that I think I want to try being sober."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah I don't have any other prior addiction history um I have tried, other things I. But no yeah I mean the only other thing that I felt like I had like was a problem for me was like I was prescribed adderall and I was on ADHD medication. And I mean they kept upping my dosage I don't think my doctor at the time, who is prescribing and managing I don't think he really knew what he was doing, and it was like. That was the I never abused it in any way other than what I was prescribed but it just it worked for me, but I guess, I felt uncomfortable at the fact that I felt like really dependent on it. Like at the time it was really hard for me to imagine not being on it, and then there was just the like fact that you're taking a stimulant every day so disrupted my sleep patterns and it affected like basic bodily."
480.0,Provider,needs internal like you. hi. yeah yeah yeah. yeah those are hard hardcore match for sure.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah they are hardcore and it's been years since i've been back on them, I mean that's one of the things about going back to school was I was like shit like I don't even know like I would need it, I mean I don't know yeah just but as that aside. know my. Maybe I don't know that I would. That maybe. I don't know if I would call it a trauma."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's something that people get really caught up about is this word trauma right. Right doesn't have to be something huge a drama is literally defined as anything that exceeds your ability to cope at the moment, so. Anything can be traumatic depending on your situation your circumstance or state of mind any of that and we can have trauma reactions that's what like honestly I believe most addiction mental health is all. At the root is trauma, because those are all trauma responses to try to cope with something that you didn't know how to cope with."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah yeah thanks for that that's a nice definition and i'm kind of hold on wait sorry distracted because I really don't my phone to die on me. um. yeah my in terms of alcohol. For me. So my mom got sober before I was born. And my dad supposedly was sober most of my life and started drinking again after my parents divorced, but that was after i'd moved out of the House and gone to school. And I wasn't around it, or it wasn't something that I like consciously was aware of is like an issue or was impacting me."
480.0,Provider,"growing up, you were raised. By both your parents in the same House and neither of them drink in the House. yeah okay."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah and then my dad I think he had some sort of private. usage going on that link later my mom shared with me the thing that happened my mom you know shared a lot about her life with me, we were in a really close relationship. And not always a super boundary the one. I was kind of like a surrogate partner and and my mom and a lot of ways, my parents weren't super close and, in turn, you. know, I have a younger sister. But when my. I just remember like from before I ever tried any kind of drug or substance. Like my mom shared a lot about things, and it was just like like I remember thinking that like. I. Like it would be like the worst thing ever if I like developed like a. problem with them and that like it would be a total failure and for the longest time, as I told myself I would never even try, I would just never drink. And I tried to tell my mom that which wasn't really reasonable and obviously I reached an age where I did drink and, but I think like that is one of the biggest issues that I have related to alcohol, too, is like. My emotionally what comes up for me and just some of my like while i've kind of like. That thinking is still those patterns are still there, whether or not they're like as like over as they were when I was younger and it's still like the kind of like shame and guilt that I have around just like drinking it all is like."
480.0,Provider,Oh for sure.
13808.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,"No then and that's the problem, because we all know that addictions are fueled by shame and guilt, so if you feel shame and guilt or even taking one training then you're never going to know if you have if you can have a healthy relationship with alcohol."
13808.0,Patient,Right yeah it's not really from the beginning.
480.0,Provider,"yeah exactly it's kind of like people that are raised in purity culture. Right so everything sexual sexual is shameful and then they grow into adults who in healthy marriages still can't have a healthy relationship with sex it's kind of the same thing is like when you're. When you feel so much shame for even like thinking about or considering a subject, then the baseline is totally skewed so you don't even know because, like when you were talking to me right, I can see, obviously. You want to control it right, like, I see that. desire. for you to want to control it, but at the same time as somebody who has you know, been through all the stages of alcoholism like you're drinking at this stage is not super concerning from a clinical standpoint but emotionally speaking like that's where we need to look. Right, because if. Even one drink is emotionally going to mess you up to the point of dealing shame and guilt and like a failure than that's going to be a problem for you."
13808.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah it's become an it has been for a while now, like. an obsessive kind of yeah the relationship that I have to it and to myself around is not healthy. and"
480.0,Provider,"Part of it too is the we're taught from, even if they didn't say this directly knowing, you have to alcoholic parents you're taught that you can't trust yourself around alcohol."
13808.0,Patient,Right.
480.0,Provider,"So that's a big issue, too, is then that bleeds into other areas, and then you have this trust issue with yourself, which, when we don't trust ourselves that causes a lot of problems mentally."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah that's definitely a big one for me, I mean talk about like inner child it's like the like, whether or not there's. i've i've gone back and forth around like whether or not there's like. A trauma thing related to bed time for me or it's become that because I just struggled to cope with the fact that, like it's hard for me to regulate when it comes time to like going to bed at like I have. Prior demon alcohol being the most commonly used thing for me around that like i've had other things that I do at night that like are like habits and kind of like. Things for self soothing that are kind of strange and don't necessarily like. they're kind of like anxious habits and. And that's where it's like as long as I can really remember."
480.0,Provider,in childhood.
13808.0,Patient,yeah um.
480.0,Provider,Do you consciously remember something happening at bedtime or is it just like that's when your anxieties most prevalent.
13808.0,Patient,"No, no, and i've talked about it in therapy before like the most recent trauma I have around this, though, is, I was in a relationship with someone who is like. I don't think like. tried to convince me, I mean it's complex, it was not a healthy relationship by any means. And this person had a lot of their own trauma from like early childhood, but like they wanted to constantly kind of like comb over my memories. and brought up like. I know, at one point, like kind of had was talking as though, like they knew and had like a dream that like somebody like my friend's dad had like sexually abused me and I was like. I don't even have remember memory of that. yeah so the way that like that relationship sort of like play with my memories it actually took me a couple of years to kind of recover from that. And, but I don't think that anything like that happened if it did I can't remember it and there's a reason why."
480.0,Provider,And then we're gonna leave it there that's. yeah listen that's my. theory with stuff that. doesn't naturally come up it's not supposed to so don't go digging.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah i'm fine with that I will say that, like my mom you know I don't remember, obviously, when I was super young like. Much about a bedtime routine or what that was, but I know like as for like at least back to like even like says third second grade, I would like go to like bedtime was like hanging out with my mom was she watched TV until she fell asleep, and then I kind of put myself too bad and like."
480.0,Provider,"So you parent yourself from long, long time, especially time."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah. So that was sort of like. and, should you know be like sometimes scary things on TV and I would have a really hard time with that, and then I then she just like fall asleep, and I, you know would kind of like yeah so I always remember to being like the last one up in my family. And kind of like turning all the lights off and like. going to bed. yeah so. And it's been really hard for me to since I like lost my dogs, I mean that was kind of like my That was the thing that I always had is like a. companion like self soothing a bedtime. And yeah since since college like i've been without yeah early yeah post college, the first time, my life have not had like a dog to like."
480.0,Provider,"Do you live alone alone, no roommates."
13808.0,Patient,"No well right now is especially hard, because I am my i've been I had it i've had a roommate who was subletting for my sister, who I lived with and have."
480.0,Provider,You did mention that yeah. And then.
13808.0,Patient,"And then she decided she came back and I wasn't a big fan of living with her and her partner, so I just said i'd love for you to move back in. But like basically you're it's not okay like I just had to set a boundary around like your partner can't basically basically live with us without paying rent right he'd need to have his own place and like he could be over three or four days a week, like three nights a week, but like. yeah so she decided to move in with him so that's cool we live close by each other, and we are close but. I have a roommate now that it's been easy and great there's like I can't I mean, in that way i'm you know I can't complain, but it's also not somebody I know super well and. Like we don't hang out. it's feels pretty lonely in the House yeah now. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so I have obviously a lot, I could ask you, because. it's the start of therapy i'm not going to do that to you. So two very important questions first do you like to do 30 minutes or 60 minutes therapy sessions."
13808.0,Patient,A 60 minute. me.
480.0,Provider,And second do you want to do weekly. yeah.
13808.0,Patient,I would prefer weekly at least grilled a while. yeah if that works for you.
480.0,Provider,"Yes. Okay, so. continue on and just have to check time because we're."
13808.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,I didn't know if you're expecting to leave at 30 or not.
13808.0,Patient,"No thanks for doing that yeah i'm used to like 1516 minutes. Okay, so. um."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's a couple things that I feel like is important, just clinically for me. When did you come out as trans to your family where they accepting was that traumatic at all when did you start transitioning all of that."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah um Okay, I will I first came out to my parents is gay bar by. In like probably in high school party my sophomore year. they're actually like very like my dad had his own way, like just kind of figuring it out, but I mean both my parents are really like accepting and like you know will love you, no matter what, and for them and supportive. In a lot of ways. And then. I went to an all women's college, which is mills college. And, which was a little bit strange for me and i've like as my earliest baby for us like I had like swim trunks on and was just kind of like. Very boyish. And there was like there was trauma like in terms of like if it was really traumatic for me, I know as a kid. Being like asked her for us to like wear a dress or wear clothes, or like I mean I didn't quite feel like I wasn't a girl per se, but I was just definitely like I just wanted to be kind of like we've made up and and. So I went to women's college and. It wasn't until after I graduated that like I mean it was really on my radar like I didn't really have I don't know i'm like in terms of I didn't really know what trends was non binary stuff and. and change my name it took me a while to come out to my parents and to talk to them about hormones like that was like a process. And they have been supportive, I mean it's complex it's not easy. And like so there's been I think loss involved. for everyone on some level and but also thinks gained it's just it's a it's been a process, I mean there have been moments without like through it, that I. Have. yeah maybe not fully supported or seen in the ways that I wanted to be and then other times that like I couldn't be more grateful for the ways that I was supported, and so you know. I think that it's it's still definitely a process for me in terms of like the things that come up for me around transitioning. Which is also now like I I knew I went on hormone replacement therapy. And i've had top surgery i'm like in a lot of ways, like that it's been. i've never felt more affirmed in my gender and also it's been socially a. kind of like. I also don't I wasn't socialized also like as a man. yeah like. I don't really feel like one and so. being more like I think that that was like a That was a really and has been since that i'm adjusting to a lot of things, but like that has been really hard thing about my transition was like adjusting to like. That shift in terms of my environmental like you know, like how I move about in the world and i'm seeing and I don't know I mean I it's still been hard, I mean there's a lot there's like."
480.0,Provider,"For me, the hardest, just like. Is it the expectations of what a stereotypical male says does at stuff like that or."
13808.0,Patient,"um no, not because I don't. feel that like I don't put that pressure on myself. I mean there's awkward situations like i've definitely like when i'm being perceived that way or i'm in like a kind of a. With like an environment with a lot of men or there's work situations it gets awkward. And there's thing where i'm just like I kind of know like they pick up on something, but they can't tell like I pass pretty well at this point."
480.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13808.0,Patient,"Before I before. When I wasn't passing, I had a lot more anxiety about that. was back that you know I mean like that caused me a lot of anxiety so even though i'm non binary like it was like there's pros and cons to like passing it up. there's some ways that like yeah I miss the like socially out in the world like the way that women interact with me is completely different and like that has been really hard and I think a big loss because. I just yeah just different than. Now accustomed to, and have been most of my life. And that's all. I thought it has felt like lonely in a sense, in that way and Mendel. offer each other, the same thing, socially and emotionally. or anything close yeah. So, so I mean yeah when i'm around people that know me I don't really have that issue, but. They have a hard transition, I think, like. Just didn't like the greater larger context."
480.0,Provider,Do you have any really good support that are also trans that have been through. The hormone replacement therapy the like. yeah people you connect with that you can kind of lean on or share stories with.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah I have. I had a lot more of my attended meetings and like was connected and more so, like involved in like events and different things. Like earlier on kind of through my transition, I think that less I i'm doing less of that now, for various reasons. there's a pandemic, being one. Also, just like feeling like I have the time making the time and recognizing that or."
480.0,Provider,yeah I can imagine you probably get to a point where you get burned out on constantly talking about it.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah there is processing it, but I think I do need to I think it's important to ignite like when I think about how much time I might spend still in my head processing it. You better to do that and space to other people, as opposed to myself. I mean yeah and. But yeah it can still be hard and mean and then then there's like in terms of social anxiety there's the fact that, like a lot of my friends, since i've moved back to the day, like I do get kind of caught like I know my friends love me, no matter what and don't really give a shit but. um. But there is part of me that feels I just noticed a pattern where. A lot of my friends are like women and non binary people and having transition in the way that I have, and I think that there's like. I don't know if that just is that feeling that stemming from my childhood, where I just feel like oh I don't quite really like fit in."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13808.0,Patient,yeah or yeah I don't know like that feeling. has never really gone away for me. yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so therapeutically because I know you've had a lot of therapists Have you ever done like inner core work."
13808.0,Patient,And their childhood.
480.0,Provider,"No, no, like. inner core meaning Okay, so I hear you talk a lot about this feeling like you don't belong, all this like how people perceive me all of that so. Basically, like our core beliefs about ourselves, or something that generally get formed because of the way we're conditioned and then we get to a point in our lives, where we realized that all of that conditioning. is not working, needs to be undone, because if I am living my life, based on who you all tell me, I should be. that's going to cause issues for me right so most of the time what that looks like is people pleasing not setting boundaries all of that, because you get your value and worth from how you show up in the world versus. Just being human right, and so you're supposed to have value and worth just for being human. Most of us compensate and do things that we think gives us value and worth, and that means that, whatever we do, to give us value or worth if other people don't receive that as valuable than we have no value. So the way to change all of that is to start working on your basically your inner core belief so who am I, as a person, without anyone in the world, telling me who I should be. And so that's what I want you to work on this week, as far as homework and my condition for homework is because i'm such. A believer in not shaming or guilty people as all homework is optional, so if you don't do it don't feel guilty or bad about it, but if you choose to do the homework, this is where I want to start is figuring out like who am I without all of the conditions, all of the. Objective ways we can measure okay So for me, it was a lot of like i'll just share with you how this process went for me, it was a lot of like making lists of things that. I know to be true about myself right so i'm honest i'm kind all of these things, and then I had to physically write them on sticky notes and put them on every mirror in my house. Because I didn't believe those things about myself, even though, like logically I knew them to be true, the world had told me for so long that. Those things weren't true because of either things I had did maladaptive ways I had coped with trauma or other ways right, so it takes a lot of repetition and habit to actually believe these things that we want to be. And that we already are we're just unlearning everything else right so it's I mean start with basic things like. characteristics that you know you possess how you show up, and I mean even things like I had sticky notes that said. You deserve to have your needs met because that was such an issue for me like I could never ask for my needs to me back and so things like that can be on your list to like I deserve love and affection, because i'm a human being. I deserve to have my needs met. needs met I deserve to feel like I belong in the world."
13808.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"So I feel like that would be a good starting point, because for me clinically speaking everything builds off of that right, because if you are somebody who questions, who you are, as a person right So if I tell you you're a good person. And you, deep down don't believe you're a good person and the person in the parking lot when you get out of your car tells you you're a bad person. Then you're more likely to believe the negative about yourself than the positive right so until you have a healthy core belief system anything anyone tells you can challenge that belief system. Once you have a healthy solid core belief system it doesn't matter what other people think or say because they're not getting through right like you tell me i'm bad all day long I don't care, because I know, deep down i'm a good person. mm hmm and also a while we're on this train I don't believe in good versus bad."
13808.0,Patient,Right.
480.0,Provider,"Any of that right versus wrong, I believe in what's the healthiest decision for me at this moment. Because I. Think conditions and labels like good bad right wrong all of that is a great way to structure society but I don't think it's a great way to. internalize and like evaluate a life. Right. there's a lot more to it than that."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I feel like on some level that has been a huge part of my life trends my journey, I mean like it had to be yeah. And, and also like I still like I think i've asked like like there's the part of me that really is like i'm used to sort of just like having know who I am and really stand firmly in that. And that was something that was pretty like supported, and I think like my my you know my parents like I was an i'm pretty supportive environment growing up, but i'm really grateful for that and there's the part of me that was like constantly like. battling struggling and then like not feeling like it was like. On some level not feeling real if that makes sense um."
480.0,Provider,Well yeah because if you spend so much time hiding who you are. Not even intentionally like part of it was you didn't know who you were at the time right you didn't have exposure you didn't have a way to name it so anytime you spend a significant time in hiding it's going to be difficult to transition to living authentically.
13808.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,yeah. yeah So what do you think going forward what would your. Top goals be for therapy.
13808.0,Patient,"um. I. Would well, I mean, I think, for me, it's just kind of like. i'm. i've been like struggling with, and I think like. well. Like show like I mean I think like changing some of my more maladaptive behaviors. And I think like coming up with kind of. I struggle with organization or like a way to like sort of I think practically think through, something that would work for me and like making that transition like I feel like I get stuck. And I know that it's not like something that i'm going to like change overnight and it's going to just be like the frank, but um yeah. I know that, like it's not as simple like for me with the alcohol like I mean maybe I don't know and i'd be interested to like hear from you what you think about it. I. Like the totally obstinate versus like. Last or progressive I mean either way the relationship itself is unhealthy and like I need I also need better things for myself at night, and then I think, just like sort of regulating and like sort of. Self soothing and self care, I mean, I have a partner right now who's doing a lot of that stuff as well, so that's great it's been like really supportive thing, but I think I. And I go back and forth on like you know it's not okay to like be like that's the kind of avoidant part of myself is like it's not okay to be dependent with another person in this way you're now i'm or to like ask for support in these ways and then. And also, knowing that like I need that my own space to be, and I think I have in the past, my had more codependent partnerships that really didn't work for me in a really long term one that like. It was hard for us to establish new patterns, after having spent four years in a pretty codependent relationship, dynamic and so since then i've. Really struggled to sort of I don't know like find my way in new relationships, I find myself like being really kind of like having my guard up and being a little bit more like. avoidant like how figuring out how to approach intimacy and not overthink kind of like also the like fears that I have around codependency."
480.0,Provider,"Okay here's something that will tell you about codependency just because this is something that helped me. Everyone the codependency gets thrown around a lot. Right, where it's unhealthy is, if you are meeting someone else's needs in place of euro. Okay, so that's the unhealthy codependency that we don't want to happen, partnership and accountability is not the same thing as codependency and. I totally hear that, like you have your guard up because of the past, but I also want you to hear that humans are innately designed for connection. So this whole like you have to be perfectly happy and confident and everything on your own before you can be a healthy partner is bs because it doesn't like. me at my happiest is when i'm talking to other people because i'm an extrovert and I highly value connection. So i'm always going to be happiest talking to someone else i'm fine being alone, I can sit with myself all day. i'm not happiest when i'm by myself, like yes, I do have moments of pure joy when i'm by myself but they're not as often as when i'm with other people and that's Okay, because that's how humans were designed, so I think like. A lot of what we say, with codependency is for people that aren't quite to the level where you are emotional intelligence wise and knowing that because a lot of people like can't fathom. Where they would even draw the line between someone else's needs and my needs right someone who's in tune with their needs and understands. Healthy relationships and understands coping, and all this stuff that you understand because you've gone to therapy, like those are the people I can have these conversations with of the like okay well it's okay to be. In a relationship with other people and to have codependent looking tendencies, but what codependence actually means is that you're abandoning yourself to take care of the other person. So, as long as you're not doing that. you're not being codependent."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah yeah well that's good. that's really helpful because it's also looking at. yeah the pattern. of self abandonment to that's like hiding new there, whether or not i'm in a relationship or like in a dynamic with another person or partner or whatever, that is. And that's kind of yeah because yeah that's helpful. that's helpful yeah thank you because that's a lot of. cuz even. there's like where like I think specifically about like nighttime and what that's about for me and sleeping it's like. If I get into yeah I think about like oh how often i'm going over to my partners and, like staying the night there, or like you know. are not spending time at home or like having troubles many time at home there's I can still be sort of like whether or not it has anything to do with them or their needs, like be abandoning my needs."
480.0,Provider,At night right.
13808.0,Patient,Right in terms of yeah in terms of the out taking care of myself and that's just like a pattern that i've had for a long time and.
480.0,Provider,"Also, you do have to remember that. Those. Your any tricky age range for all of this to be happening to right. Because that's The thing is the older you get the less. And this is not true for everyone, but the older you get the less you're willing to abandoned certain things you've gotten into your routine. For other people. Right and it's just across the board, and I know this because people as soon as they get to like mid 30s and 40s they're like oh there it is that's the magic number where it's like. i'm not sleeping at your House, because my bed is comfortable and I have everything that I need at my house, you know. So part of that is life stage that makes it more difficult to."
13808.0,Patient,"yeah that's funny, this is the first time, like i've lived with partners in the past, so there's that but then yeah, this is the first time, when my partner is a year older than me is 30 and."
480.0,Provider,30 class.
13808.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm like. i'm just now literally my space, I think, in the for for the first time ever in like in a different way where i'm really thinking about and allowing myself to also make decisions where i'm not like you can't have any of those things are just like I don't know. Ray and yeah and then my partner is also really settled into their space and for the first while at our relationship, it was like they never wanted to come over. nicely, and I was like that's fine because my beliefs, is actually way less comfortable than you. have now. Now i'm like hey I want you to come over to, but I also like wanting to be comfortable for both so. That that's funny yeah it's the. yeah um. I can see that happening for sure. um. yeah. um."
480.0,Provider,"So wrapping up. um. Okay, so you're gonna work on core identity stuff. And then also do you smoke weed."
13808.0,Patient,"Not much. No, I like I mean it's kind of been a thing in and out in my life, but I doesn't go it hasn't gone while with my anxiety for some."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's not a good option as far as cutting back with the alcohol and replaced, because I know you're in California and it's legal there, and a lot of people do that, to help them sleep."
13808.0,Patient,"I know. I do. I do take hydroxyl mean. So, like on nights that i'm tired or there's not like specific stressors going on i've been okay actually like not drinking. If I didn't use and and taking that and then like, and you know my partner i've been really open and honest with them about just kind of where i'm at right now and what I want and so and they're supportive so like yeah that helps witches are so like co regulating. But."
480.0,Provider,"I, they also trying to stop drinking. or they just supporting they. Have oh okay."
13808.0,Patient,"Oh that's also that's Nice, I mean I was. For I mean that's always been the case for me, I mean since wow not always but the relationship that I mentioned that was like kind of had a lot of codependent patterns, I had been living with that partner for four years. And we were close. And so that was just a really difficult. separation, but we also had a lot of patterns of like kind of using together like we were young and that was just kind of. So instead of instead of actually like showing up for. each other when we were struggling with our own individual things we also like kind of like yeah. and using or just like not being emotionally available, it was just like there was a lot of loneliness even even within the relationship, and so I. yeah and emotionally I just felt it was really like they didn't want to sit with emotions like at all ever I was really hard. So I was just sort of like I don't want and for the most part in my relationships and, in general, my social life, I don't like. Alcohol or drinking isn't really a part of that for me."
480.0,Provider,that's just been know that.
13808.0,Patient,"If I show it really new social events right I don't know anyone i'm really anxious like I will drink but speaking of like trauma in the past, like I don't like. Be in social situations where I feel out of control. or like. yeah i've been like i've been like drug to boo for. So i'm actually a little bit more hyper vigilant social situations, and when I go out. I don't I don't really like."
480.0,Provider,yeah that happened when you were drugged.
13808.0,Patient,"um no luckily not. happened twice and the first time. My friends intervened. And, before anything happened, but it was kind of like from what they told me, was it was kind of I don't know there's not much I don't have any any recollection of it, but I just remember the feeling afterwards it's like what the Fuck happened and so. That being really terrifying and then also feeling really embarrassed like I was like you know. There was like I woke up at my crushes house and had no, you know, and it was like didn't happen. yeah exactly I remember just feeling really embarrassed and really like horrified by the whole thing and then kind of unpacking it later um but yeah so I have yeah I generally just don't like crowds make me a little bit nervous. You know their situation, so I tend to like kind of avoid them and. And I mean, even though I love the performing arts, so I will go see things but yeah that's not generally like a way that I like have used alcohol. And even though, if I am like trying i'm out and about like oh definitely have a couple of drinks, because it like it's it's it. makes me less anxious."
480.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13808.0,Patient,um.
480.0,Provider,"here's something to do. Is pay attention to your anxiety triggers is it all the time, is it more anxious like when something happens because it's easiest to work on. Coping skills for anxiety if we have specific examples right because there's different types of anxiety So for me if you have specific examples, then it's easier for me to figure out Okay, what are we dealing with and what kind of coping skill works best."
13808.0,Patient,"Right i'm trying to work on the one where I like the anxiety that is related to things that i'm avoiding or castigating like actually addressing matters because, like you know I think it's where it's if I just like avoid it. But then yeah there's also the ones that are just like they're like they're triggers of some sort or some kind of or just like or just like also normal i'm getting everyone to some degree of social anxiety, but um yeah. I will guess be paying attention to those and like also like. yeah when I get kind of. My family always called them like thought whoops that's what my mom always called it was I was just getting these kind of like obsessive thought loops especially I get bedtime and around that time at night. And so I would always go into my mom's room and I would be like really whether it was like something that was going on in the world, or something that like it happened, and I would just be kind of like in this state anxious state and. That was the other thing that my mom did is my mom was always like. Not now Gray, like, I see that you're like really stuck on this and that you're really whatever if it's still something in the morning, we can talk about it, then, and instead of just like kind of like I think comforting me and, like in that moment, like. It was just sort of like I remember as a kid like I always felt just sort of like well what the Fuck do I do with this now and you're just going to like. Go to bad and I don't know what to do, and that was like a consistent thing for me growing up that I still struggle with the thing is, is that I can recognize that happening. And I. kind of get overwhelmed and like I feel like I don't know how to deal with it, hence the like the the alcohol and then of course the shame associated. With doing that."
480.0,Provider,So are these thought loops every single night.
13808.0,Patient,"If it can yeah I mean I be as I become more aware of it, it has gotten a little bit better like it's less intense and i'm able to kind of like recognize it when i'm in it. But sometimes if it's already escalated like to a certain point before i've recognized what's going on that it's it's a lot more difficult for me to like regulate like down regulate from there it's like. And so it's kind of like catching it before it kind of yeah again reaches a point and then becomes like physically, you know. A real like in bought like physical thing that's when that's when yeah."
480.0,Provider,"So when it becomes physical grounding techniques or when it's physical. Name things you see touch taste smell. Here, do you know all that stuff. The box all the fun grounding techniques okay. yeah okay good. So I know that usually at night and i'm on the east coast and you're California, but you can always email me when you're having thought loops because I have some clients that just. venting to me via email helps stop the thoughts because they'll get it out and then it's not even necessarily they're waiting for a reply it's just the act of venting on the email. To someone they know is safe and is not going to like go tell people then that helps a lot, too, so you can always do that, but my condition is i'm in bed usually by like 1030 my time so. On the next day."
13808.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,Great guys do that too.
13808.0,Patient,"that's interesting if I think to do that i'll give that a try wonder how I feel about that, but and I don't really yeah I think I can understand the value of that without needing a response and I say explicitly said that, I would like what."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and most of the time I do respond unless like. I have one client that will then email me like five times a week very long ones, and so always at the end she'll say you don't have to reply because it's a lot to reply, but then we'll always talk about it in session so I generally reply, unless you tell me I don't have to reply. yeah you can try it doesn't hurt. You get into work i'm gonna go feed my children because. they're probably I don't I don't even want to know what the House looks like right now."
13808.0,Patient,alright.
480.0,Provider,"Thanks okay. appreciate welcome Thank you and I will see you at group, maybe."
13808.0,Patient,Right that's Wednesday morning yes.
480.0,Provider,Wednesday morning at 10.
