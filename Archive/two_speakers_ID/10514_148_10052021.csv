148.0,Provider,how's it going.
10514.0,Patient,Oh good still a little stressful at the moment.
148.0,Provider,"yeah what's going on, did you start your class on Monday."
10514.0,Patient,"yeah I started everything's going great it's just that, like I say, like my schedules just talk for. Like i'm not liking it like that's like not the only thing, but everything is great, you know I had a great first day you know everything went well, I mean. You know I like to you know it's a lot more things have to learn, of course, you know it's a little more different than expected, but everything is cool. And it's just a thing i'm struggling with now it's like just managing going to like work and school, like every single day like that thing now to like Besides this, like today, like. I had a class again like from four to seven but look right now, like, I have to be like, and I wanted to get this fast meeting you know the way, so I had to comb and you know be on the meeting right now. But even then like I can go to class after this because I go every Tuesday I go to the other classes for thing or management that are like required as well. So those are from five to seven so that's taken away and I kind of don't like it today kind of makes me feel like like bad because. Now today like it's my second day of like my school and i'm not even going to be able to be there and I know i'm missing some pro tips are missing out on some stuff that I need to learn. So."
148.0,Provider,"um the thing about that is going to be your communication like there's going to be a huge difference Mario if you just don't show up and don't let your teachers know what's going on versus if you say hey i'm in this program. That i'm mandated to do, I have to do this so i'm going to be having to miss every other every other Tuesday."
10514.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I told him, you know this week and then it kinda and then it kind of sucks for me, because then like. Alright, so now like i'm not getting the hours for today, so now be behind you some hours and then they're going to be there we're going to go over another section today that I need to learn as well. So now i'm not going to be missing out on my hours now i'm missing out on the section and then being it sucks to on Fridays, they close at three o'clock. So now, that means I wouldn't be able to go with Tuesdays and Fridays and that's already two days of the week so then that's already like 30 like you know eight hours, as we see a whole leg day and other missed. So, like that it's kind of very stressful so now like now what i'm thinking out to solve this problem i'm going to have to like. Now tell my job that I can go to work on Fridays, or something, because I don't want to fall behind in school so unfortunately i'm willing to do like four days a week. which I don't like which I kind of like it's not like it's a bad, but it's me kind of sucks because that's a day less for my paycheck. Now then i'm going to do that."
148.0,Provider,"For days is so much more than what you had two months ago right. See you're making huge progress getting this the schooling done is going to be huge for you, too, and it's going to put you forward in your career and those are the things that you have to keep in mind with. You know everything you're juggling right now has a purpose, and I know that it comes with stress, but it's just going to be about communicating. Communicating your needs advocating for yourself like what do you need if it is taking off Fridays that's great you just need to figure it out right now right. Just so many different things, Mario from going and not working, not being in school. To go into work being in school doing your anger management right, I mean after today you'll be done with bright heart but. that's huge to right that's something that you can give."
10514.0,Patient,You.
148.0,Provider,Or that you. need is that you did really well you've made a ton of progress.
10514.0,Patient,"No, yes, I mean it's very i'm very excited and i'm happy, you know, for it is that I don't know it's, to my mind to kind of like messes with me when I know like you know i'm supposed to be somewhere and then i'm not over there and i'm missing like saw you know I don't want."
148.0,Provider,"When you start thinking like that remind yourself that you're human right, you can only do so much and you're doing. A lot you're basically extending yourself so far it's like you literally can't be in two places at once right you can't expect that of yourself."
10514.0,Patient,"yeah you know and that's exactly what I was telling my dad like yesterday and stuff you know, like I like and then I kind of got into with them a little bit like because then like. he's like all like you see like I told you like i'm venting TIM basically and then instead of him being like cool dad and everything like. he's saying Oh well, you see, like, I told you like i've always told you to like and all like, be careful and now you're just suffering all the consequences of everything like you've done and. i'm just like dude i'm fucking venting to you man like I was like you're calling me right now and i'm studying and I told i'm just telling you like i've just had. i've been I go I wake up every day like four o'clock in the morning i'm up for four o'clock now is like all the way till seven hours ago, and then I have to come home and then I have to study on all my tests and after study like on my books. And I was like I have to prepare for them after make my lunch, I have to make sure I have my uniform for tomorrow. I was like that it's a lot on me man, I was like and I don't need someone right now going to tell me like scolding my ass like you know, basically, I was like telling me that all your. Consequences I was like dude like don't tell me that shit man i'm sorry, but like if you're not going to be not nothing nice to say don't don't say it. Because like I don't. I don't like that, like, I was like i'm going through a lot like and you're just telling me stuff that isn't relevant like you've already explained this to me before you don't need to go and remind me every damn call like. It gets too much. So the hour that's why i'm saying so that's why it became like. The you know all the time remember to relax and breathe, you know it kind of sucks. I fell off. Like on the gym I came to go to the gym anymore, because, like I am so damn tired, like every day that I come home like. Where I can't even find the energy now, especially since i'm options like I say four o'clock to seven o'clock. You know, like you know it's like straight I gotta get home I barely even I didn't even get to change really just got to get home. I started just take off my boots and go in my regular shoes and just like head out to work, and I mean head out school, you know, but like it like I said it's it's just the laurie now and I it's not like i'm all for it, I knew it wasn't going to be easy and i'm down for the task you know. Well, I should."
148.0,Provider,"be great it's just you're still adjusting right it's different, this is a whole new schedule for you. So just be patient be kind to yourself, give yourself some grace, you know if you have to miss a few days gym that's okay um one thing I want you to work on right now is time management right. What how much time, am I, setting aside for myself how much sleep, am I getting and I want you to keep. Your self care in the forefront of your mind, because all these other things going on, if you continue to take care of yourself you're in a much better position to deal with stress, as it comes up as if you would be if you weren't doing that self care does that make sense. yeah I really want you to remember, even if it's just 10 510 minutes of deep breathing before you go to bed at night, I want you to be incorporating some type of self care, especially on the days, where you do have to miss the gym."
10514.0,Patient,"yeah and honestly it's been so much I haven't been able to go in like now, we say because i'm telling you I come home, so I dreamed and then like it's just like Oh, how the hell do I."
148.0,Provider,"Am but again be kind to yourself, right now, as you're adjusting into this new routine and schedule like you saying it's a lot, you know and listen to your body if you're too tired that's okay you're doing a lot, right now, Mario and you're juggling a lot of different things so."
10514.0,Patient,"Like I go to sleep at like nine o'clock now like it's crazy way. i'm like. Oh, my God i'm just so like. done like lazy yeah like I say late today and then sometimes I have to stress that I have at work like you know I, like my job, and over like I say like these are like just today, and maybe like one of the other like maybe just today, like. was just one of those days was a little rocky not there, like I got into it with anybody or like I say anything but i'm not gonna lie in my mind, I was talking to a lot of shit I was just like ah you guys are pissing me off, but like. You know, like whatever like as you get sometimes like with the people that don't work like you have the guys that are down to work, and you know, like. And then you got the other frickin retirees that are just standing there just like audiences like do not do anything and like it's not in my power to where I can go and be like hey. Like are you guys going to get to work, or are we all going to sit on our phones, like all day like. Yes, I you know, like you, guys are getting paid, you know really well like to what sit on your ass all day like i'm sorry like. If not, like a home, I need like I was like you know we're like on the slopes take it out, like all these like big old like. it's like homeless encampment and stuff that's what they call them like where it's like a bunch of homeless like form like on the side of the freeways and times. And they build their whole hype of all the trash and needles and all kinds of shit you could see. And then afterwards, like you, you're busting your ass and then these guys they're all telling what to do and then afterwards, like they're not working with you and it's their job to do that. you're like oh so that's why I started working me like lately in the beginning, you know, I was like a happy camper and I was like yeah let's get it, but now i'm just kind of like no you get like you guys are like. Like you guys are out man like you guys are pissing me off like not that i'm going to snap on anybody or do anything like that. But it's like the end of the day, i'm not going to let them get to me like that you know i'm gonna do whatever I can in my power, but you know, like i'm not gonna let them like going to take over my like. A whole like being you know I got everything going good for myself, and you know i'm not going to ruin it at work, wherever tell them they anything you know I always just. When i'm like feeling angry like that I just focus on my work and then like I just freakin start forgetting just being happy start taking notes on big old trees and shit and like you know start lifting that and the thing out of my anger, but like. And then it's like some teams like mandatory Halloween time to still hot sometimes I don't. play. i'm like what the hell happened to these clouds like come on like get a kid cloudy. Things like that, but just add. One of the gym."
148.0,Provider,"Mario what would I tell you, when you start feeling that anger rise from what other people are doing what would I say."
10514.0,Patient,"Well, take some breaths and you know relax and you know just."
148.0,Provider,"take a step back, think about the I would tell you that, to remember in those situations, you cannot control other people, you can. On to them. Right you can't control them you control you and the way that you respond to them. is huge right, you can either lose it or you can take a step back, take a deep breath use your tools walk away have a good rest of your work day and just do your work right that's what's important that's what you're going to be acknowledged, for your work."
10514.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. that's like oh that's right now, like i'm so fucking I mean that's i'm solely focused now on getting my class a even more because I I don't want to stay in that position where i'm at right now, like, I was like no, I want to move up where I could be your guys's bosses."
