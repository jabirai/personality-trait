6157.0,Patient,"Oh. yeah I had a big appetite i've been put on a few pounds and I feel I feel even better than what I did so. I don't know I guess it was all those panic attacks and stuff I kind of heard that and I don't have those much anymore, and I just felt my whole self calmed down a lot more."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, do you find that when you're calm you eat more. yeah Okay, some people completely opposite all right, then, and do you find that with the buprenorphine i've had people notice that they did gain weight part of it. Is because they're more stable they're not trying to go find a drug, they have a normal appetite things like that, but then, a lot of people notice that ink actually increase their cravings for sweets. Oh yeah."

191.0,Provider,"Okay, now, when I look at you, you don't look like you're obese but everybody's different now, when you say you're eating more engaging way are you in a healthy weight range, or are you concerned about excess weight."

191.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so he has a PCP to address wait wait okay man. Alright, then great great so we've got that. All right, then alright, so we got your weight and height and all of that looks good all right. Okay, so I still have that your chart is still in the black okay. And I know you think about some comes compliance, so we look at your. recommend that your care intensity is still has a shows 12 plus discharge to higher level of care so john and I have been overriding it because we don't think that's necessary reflection of who you are. And how you've been performing in the program okay so we've been overriding it, but your refill recommendations are still four days, plus one refill, and the reason it's showing it is on 920 there was a no show appointment for your individual therapy. For john yeah uh huh."
6157.0,Patient,And I know I missed that too I he said when was the last time we talked he's like well I don't need to see it anytime soon. stretch it out a little bit. But then he made the appointment like a week after. So it kind of it kind of messed me up I should have looked at it.
191.0,Provider,Right.
6157.0,Patient,"When he first scheduled it, but I thought it was going to be longer and it ended up being real short right, you know the next one. So that was why yeah I thought it would. Be law. That was."
191.0,Provider,That.
6157.0,Patient,"comes with john seeing you and get my Wednesday group so that's pretty I can do that, you know."
191.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and you've been doing that, so let me go ahead and do that over right here, I think we already have your you override but let's go override it again because. periodically, we have to do it. every few every few months it looks like. Okay yeah and that's fine while i've got you on the phone here."
6157.0,Patient,"yeah it's I. don't know I just been being happier lately because i'm getting my car fixed and. My daughter's going to start coming over and hanging out with me a little bit, so I think that's a good start. she's been wanting to ignore me a lot and I want to know why. Okay basha."
191.0,Provider,been a little go so padian.
6157.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and now she said, I can go get her tomorrow and bring her home and spend some time with her so maybe just maybe this maybe start to what I always wish was that a daughter that wanted to talk to it at all time."
191.0,Provider,"Sometimes I think they appreciate parents more when they finally become parents and I think that's usually later in life. yeah cuz I think about you know, like I love my parents I don't think I realized the sacrifices they made until I am on key it's really I didn't understand it yeah."
6157.0,Patient,"And they're all my folks are at almost 80 years old and. boy they when you look at things back then, and you look at things now. They really had a fam. II II. unit and nowadays, I think."
191.0,Provider,yeah it was it was different wasn't it.
6157.0,Patient,yeah yeah I.
191.0,Provider,"Think, in some ways a lot closer."
6157.0,Patient,"yeah I wish I I wish I had that with my daughter, but I think that it's not going to be an easy thing is i'm going to have to work at so and then that's fine with me. mm hmm so i'm hoping that changes soon."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and I hope she realized how important the difference day is make, and you know there's so much research so. Just encourage you, I don't believe you don't give up at all, but look at some of the research is, if you just get a chance to look at look at the value of a dad and a daughter's life just having that Father like can decrease the potential for a lot of. Like abuse it really having a father's I would say, and I totally agree because my father was very instrumental in this is so important for self esteem, I think you can get that from a father in a different way and you get that from a mom. um you know and the time you spend talking to her listening to her disagree with her it's not wasted it's all. it's all mountain nothing to something positive for her even though she doesn't see it, but if you get a chance just Google it see the value of Father and a daughter's life and see what they get surprised I like to read that. Information because I had six brothers and i'm only girl and it's really close close to my father and I actually yet lost my father, about two, three weeks ago."
6157.0,Patient,And sorry to hear that.
191.0,Provider,"Here, but the thing is when you in a lot of times people don't realize things to they get older, you know. All I know is amazing. So I just review that information so yeah."
6157.0,Patient,i'm just just even more aware. more conscious of even things in my life so. yeah you definitely get smarter.
191.0,Provider,You definitely.
6157.0,Patient,mentioned a lot more when you're older that's sure.
191.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah it's going to come back to it, and I think the other thing as parents, we love them so much sometimes I find myself saying when they get mad, I say to myself, I don't want to give you opportunity to say I wouldn't dare for you. Right, you might give. them in your face to face."
6157.0,Patient,"she's never gonna say yeah she never gonna. say it around that's and she can ever say that to me, because every single day I text her. And so, she she's probably like oh here's another text from my dad but at least he's going to know that I was constantly burner phone up trying to get her to talk to me."
191.0,Provider,He knows she's going value that she's gonna look back on that she you never know she's probably enjoying it now because she knows that you love her. And they it makes a difference when they know they're low. It makes a huge difference.
6157.0,Patient,"And and she's just struggling with teenage she is she's dealing with hormones, and all this other stuff and and I realized that they don't she can't and I think she has a little bit of ADHD. almost like calm. down for a minute and just think about what's going on. Right, but I think what she's able to do that, then things are going to change for sure."
191.0,Provider,Okay.
6157.0,Patient,that's good yeah.
191.0,Provider,"yeah I think sounds like from what i'm gathering if we looked at it now, as opposed to. Two three months ago is better. Is that the correct understand."
6157.0,Patient,"Oh yeah oh yeah. Okay, it."
191.0,Provider,"So progress in the. right direction, better. Your interest rate on that 25 positive reviews and I know our time shoes by so quickly deep and marijuana and my understanding, you will come back. On the marijuana I know it takes a while. To get out."
6157.0,Patient,"With I haven't smoked any and it's been about a week. yeah it's quite gonna take about a month, but yeah i'm curious to see how quick it gets out of there."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, I tell my patients, at least at least. At least, a month and, and you know it likes to get in the body, fat and i've had some really obese patients they start from a place for up and down they stop and you could look at their levels but. It takes a while, for it to come out. I tell people at least a month, but i've seen it last longer mm hmm."
6157.0,Patient,"And I can tell, because I i'd be. Like you know how you always say you take you take it now you take some off the back end I can kind of feel a little bit of aggravation and that's just normal when you stop that. Because I had before. But it's not terrible it's just you know. it's like nothing there's nothing out there that doesn't have a side effect to it almost it's like."
191.0,Provider,"Even asked for positive and a negative. yeah and I think you and i've talked about it, every time you take a medicine, we gotta say. Does the benefits outweigh the risk there's a positive and a negative there's an exchange and you gotta kind of weight goes to like yeah. You know, and so, when we look at your medicines here if I look at your face shape, because I know we got to wrap up in a minute if I look at your medicines like your adderall. The benefit of that has outweigh the risk, and I remember where you were like before you had the adderall, do you agree with that. yeah okay look at the suboxone because I think I did your intake when you came and I looked at your selects and you were on a lower dose and we took that dose up so. I can still look at your medicines and look at I can recall you before these were part of your system or were stable in your system and how you felt so from our communication i'm seeing that. The benefits deal outweighs the risk. Right yeah and you know we've tweaked them to we've made some adjustments to. yeah."
6157.0,Patient,And I feel I feel good I feel almost like just completely normal with this dose and everything it's it's pretty good.
191.0,Provider,"Yes, right, so I really so. Are you on Okay, are you okay with continuing at our current doses for adderall suboxone."
6157.0,Patient,US alexa. yeah yeah.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and how are you what's your anxiety and depression."
6157.0,Patient,"I haven't had any after all that with my daughter it's like that was a real bad time for me and then after that i've noticed that I haven't had any it's like. it's like. it's like I sat down and took a big old load off and ever since then I just haven't had any Okay, and I think it's probably because i'm. i'm. A little bit more how to say it i'm spiritual so I say a lot more prayers plus. I just look at everything as it's not that serious anymore yeah."
191.0,Provider,You think faith allows you to kind of put it in the right perspective.
6157.0,Patient,I do.
191.0,Provider,"yeah and. that's what i've. heard you say since how long you been with us now it's been a year, you can have on here."
6157.0,Patient,close to a year yeah I think. So.
191.0,Provider,I think yeah you've always spoken about your faith and how that's made a difference. In terms of how you filter life yeah yeah.
6157.0,Patient,"I can't believe how anybody would not believe in something that when they die it's just the end. I refuse to believe that so. You know that's what keeps me, going so. And are you still doing your song yeah. Yes, oh, I was gonna tell you that I got a call from Webster Center in Columbus. And they were looking at my chart for my esophagus and they do want to get me in here soon for a the where they go down in and do all that i'm."
191.0,Provider,A biopsy and they may have the stretches that what you said you had to do before.
6157.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, so I definitely need to get on top of that, and i'm supposed to get Ahold of them this week to try to make a solid commitment appointment for that. that's really and. what's cool is is the reason I couldn't do it before is I did."

6157.0,Patient,"No, no."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan, and the sooner, you get the stomach situation taken care of the better, because if something's going on, if they can find it earlier and address it the better off you'll be okay, you should. get something early and address it better. How just stomach been feeling, overall, are you having the acid reflux or what's."
6157.0,Patient,"going on here. not as bad not as bad if I can go about two or three days without taking the map resolved and then it'll just start coming and it's really hard to get it to go away so that's why I try to take one every day. And I know they don't want me to do, especially now and they're like we don't want you taking it all the time, so that's another reason why I gotta get back down there so."
