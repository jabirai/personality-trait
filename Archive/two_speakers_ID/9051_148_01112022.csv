148.0,Provider,Good okay yeah. you're gonna have to catch me up a little bit here.
9051.0,Patient,"Last week was hard i'm. Very little. Hope you know left. and Just in a very low place but you know I talked to Julie, on Wednesday in a one on one session like this and. She really went above and beyond, and put a lot of things in motion, including you know this session with you as well as a doctor a short of on as well as. Suggesting tanya as my new psychiatry is to replace the previous one. And I. You know, hear nothing but great things about tanya you know she's she's passionate um you know both Dr C, as well as Julie confirm that, so I really look forward to that next week."
148.0,Provider,"yeah tanya is great, and who are you working with prior to her."
9051.0,Patient,Mary. Okay yeah.
148.0,Provider,you're just switching over now um.
9051.0,Patient,yeah it. wasn't wasn't the best. Experience working with her so i'm glad I have. Someone new to look forward to.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good i'm sorry to hear that yeah it's important that you're working with who you feel comfortable with right yeah um Okay, and was there anything that you wanted to process today check in about get support with."
9051.0,Patient,"um nothing came to mind I think Julie just wanted to make sure I had someone to talk to you know, given that she's out this week um and then, I have a run along with her on Monday and then my first group session with tanya and Julie, a week from today on Tuesday. So yeah i'm. The session with the with Dr Sean Yvonne. Was way way more. beneficial than you know I thought it would be, and it was much longer than I thought it would be, which was a surprise, I truly appreciate it that you know, almost two and a half hour session versus you know 30 to 40 minutes you know which i'm used to it, but one on one so yeah. really take the time to get to know me and. understand you know me my struggles past the present, and you know what I would like the future to be."
148.0,Provider,Good and what did you take from that i'm talking to him.
9051.0,Patient,"Well, I mean. You know. stand alone. Victory or success from that session yesterday it's just knowing like I really have someone. about someone multiple people, you know that. care about me care about my quality of life and are invested in helping me improvement improve it and finally start seeing some different results, you know that. that's I feel has been the core of my depression is you know, looking back. The last 22 years and. there's nothing to show for this just planning and dreaming and failing planning and dream without failing, year after year after year and I have no clue ADHD was behind my core struggle until a little over two years ago, I came across. A thread on Twitter. And it was very insightful and it was a. One What was your own my God I didn't know that was ADHD moment, so I started reading through all these experiences of people um and like like I told. The doctor yesterday, the first 10 things like that's interesting you struggle with that I can relate to that and then after the first 10 things the next 3040 things you know tweets and replies. It was dead on to how I felt how I thought, how I acted what I struggled with like non stop and I just buy ice just hear it up and i'm like oh my God there's a there's a reason I am the way I am i'm not just some. default loser, so to speak. You know, and so that was very. Not to sound cliche but a very life changing so."
148.0,Provider,"eye opening. for you to understand you know this is what's going on with me i'm not what society wants to tell us a lot of times is, are we making this up in our own head right, I will eat me know no, we would never make this up in our own head right. This is not something that we choose. We don't choose struggles are these challenges. are really, really hard."
9051.0,Patient,"And i'm you know I have people in my life that i've opened up to about it and most i've been receptive and a son or like oh that ADHD stuff that's just made up and it's like. And i'm still trying to process, how to go about handling a. House how I intend to handle like dealing with that person to. try harder to you know show them or simply just cut them off with their you know tunnel vision thinking. that's that's to be determined, but uh. yeah so that was September 2019 that I came across that info and then I made a lot of friends and like turns out a lot of people I was already. Following you know, had it and then with me tweeting about my experiences people got that followed me got curious, and then they got their own diagnosis and turns out, they had it so like me being vocal help someone else, and that was a beautiful thing and. yeah and she. She was saying, you know what a difference, you know the meds make for so that's what i'm i'm looking forward to. The new meds i'm hopefully being effective being that the last three didn't didn't have the effect, I thought. I thought they would. What else you're gonna say something."
148.0,Provider,"Oh, I was just gonna say trial and error and it's. So frustrating right when we're taking something and we're not where we find that it's not helpful. So, what are you going to be starting to take for ADHD."
9051.0,Patient,"Mary started me on wellbutrin when she was hoping would tackle both my depression, as well as be helpful for the ADHD. So she kept that as a base and then added on Ritalin and adderall and then finally concert a and adderall was the only one that had an effect, but not the one I hoped it it gave me this feeling of feeling. Sorry for two dogs gave me the feeling of. Just feeling panic like having to be on guard or prepared for. Any event, you know, like it's just weird like like I like I couldn't relax like. something's gonna have that you know this, that feeling like oh something's gonna happen, I don't know what shape or form is going to come in, but I gotta be ready and i'm like yeah this medications weird so."
148.0,Provider,90.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah yeah definitely but like anxiety, but but convert it to that exact thought process of something you know. probably going to happen, I need to be ready for it versus my usual terrible daily anxiety of just worrying about all the things that can go wrong. You know, specific things versus that feeling what the adderall of some unknown, you know thing to occur."
148.0,Provider,With you could we name that as some paranoia.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah sure absolutely that's that's a great. label or tag for that feeling um so yeah I was like after two days of that um I stopped and let her know what the effects are she's like yeah let's not continue taking that and then the concert had no effect. And a lot of people I talked to they you know. What a Raven and rejoice over how effective I Vance was so that's what's next. And i'm hoping that's my you know miracle match. to wear like like like I told him yesterday my my core goal. For years, you know my backgrounds in tech so in tech you're constantly having to learn new skills. And I like learning and I like to challenge, but I have a brain that doesn't let me focus, you know clearing out my schedule, no distractions quiet room, you know all the things you would expect to. configure or put into play to have the ability to focus and I got a brain that reads paragraphs and pages and because every time I read something. A key word is since my thought process off into a whole nother direction or i'm opening up Google to oh yeah that's right, let me Google this and then you got this rabbit hole like branching off and. very frustrating so yeah that's that's just that's my goal, you know, some people can order a book on Amazon. And then spend you know. Sorry, and then spend their a. weekend learning the subject you know eight hours a day of studying and boom, you know they have a new skill and then now that they have the skill, they work on you know practicing that skill. And that's general expectation and workflow um you know in my field, and I have I don't have the ability to do that consistently. And really at all now if I met up with a friend who already knows the subject, and he says come over we're going to spend eight hours and i'm going to show you what I know about subject I absorb all of that, with no problem. Okay yeah because you know when when when I have a live interaction. The inability to focus was gone because it's a live interaction like by default, I have to pay attention so my brains able to tune out the distractions. As well as confirm things in the moment Oh, you said that doing this process is like this is that kind of, like the other process where you do the thing yeah it is oh Okay, I get it, you know so like that live interaction is really great and. You know i've learned that about myself i've looked at. scenarios where there wasn't a problem to. You know, get through something, but like what were the conditions that allowed that so you know, again with. Sorry, we have been intact like there's just this expectation to. stay up to date to not become obsolete to you know always level up and you're always learning new things, because new technologies coming out every three three to six months. And in January, you know people barely heard of product X and then by November, all the companies are wanting you know their their people to use it and you know migrate over to it, or whatever. So yeah. I just I just feel so behind you know I have people that i've mentored and taught, you know the basics from computer repair to. Setting up a network and and you know installing software removing viruses, you know just just passing on all the knowledge, I know, as their foundation, and then I have to two different people that i've mentored that way, and they had their a wildly successful they're doing great. And you know the shame and and and. Of."
148.0,Provider,insecurity.
9051.0,Patient,"Ah, you said insecurity. well."
148.0,Provider,purity coming up.
9051.0,Patient,"Well, I was going to say the shame of helping them get to deliver their ad and i'm still way back you know, like every Every teacher wants their student to surpass them absolutely you know or Every teacher should have. And I am glad of their success, but I just wish all of my other goals and ambitions and dreams, I was able to you know the the trajectory that I was you know, trying to be on I wish I I got there so."
148.0,Provider,yeah feeling yeah like you're not making the progress you'd like to see yourself make.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah i'm i'm I have nothing to show for you know for i'm going to use a you know high school as a as a starting point, you know graduating high school as a starting point for your adult life, you know that was 22 years ago I turned 40 in August of this year graduated June 2000. So it's just. You know, like like that till like I told Julie, last week I just I need a I need a win you know I need to start winning and see something different, and that obviously would change my whole. Confidence quality alive self esteem, you know, whatever you want to insert. There it's going to convert over to a positive, you know fill in so."
148.0,Provider,And what would that win. For you.
9051.0,Patient,"Being able to study, because, if I can study I can learn new skills and then, once I have those skills, I have people, excuse me i've had people for years. That have offered to you know help me but I didn't have the skill I can't apply an interview for a job that I don't know how to do and I can't learn how to do that job if I don't have a way to one get access to the software technology, which you know I do most of the things that. I learned a need to learn our our our open source and you know freely available. But the inability to focus and actually make that knowledge mine and to make that skill set mine. You know it's it, it would help me so much you know to be able to get my brain, to be able to to focus and to set a goal, you know. Okay, I bought a course you know online it's 30 hours long i'm going to put in, you know, three hours a day for 10 days and I will have gotten through you know that course. Now I have that skill and I can practice that skill, I could put it on my you know resume I can let people know that I have that skill and ask them do they have any openings for that skill. December December I tried to. Complete that 30 hour course it was a course on Python programming. And you know I got four hours into it, I understood the instructor I understood the information I wasn't lost it wasn't over my head, but I didn't have. The focus to stay on it after that first day you know I would say man, I really would love to to to do that course today and I will open up the course and. You know, I will start to play the video and then i'd like posit in like man my mind just not into this right now I can't. i'm as as a reward rewarding and enjoyable as it will be to have progress in the course and to learn, you know the next thing, because it is truly a skill, I want I can't get my brain to to to. accept that this is priority and that this is what I should be focused on you know and that. is just oh man, I hope you do not have ADHD I don't wish it on my worst enemy, it is such a. It the, the best way to describe it is also kind of the silliest way to describe it, it feels like a magic spell husband put on you and things that are easy for other people to do are much harder for you to do if not you know impossible, depending on the day and circumstance and. and I don't know it's it's On one hand it's great interacting with people who have it, they get it and that's really great to have that support. And then, for everyone who doesn't have it doesn't know about it doesn't understand it it's so soul crushing to like try to explain it to them and they're like. Wait that doesn't make any sense you just need to stop being lazy you need to be it needs to get determined, you need to get you know you got to decide, you really want it and it's like you have no idea."
148.0,Provider,How bad you want it.
9051.0,Patient,"Bad i've wanted, how many times I failed gotten up you know scrape the the dirt off my knees and try again, and here it is 22 over two decades, and to me existing as an adult. And there was always a plan for the last two decades there was always a plan, a plan for success, a plan for bettering myself and i've never been able to execute those successfully so. yeah."
148.0,Provider,"What are your tools, what are you coping, what is your self care what are you doing outside of medication. That might help you reach your goals, or what have you tried in the past that maybe didn't work so well for you."
9051.0,Patient,"So prior to knowing I ad about ADHD and and that I have ADHD I always thought I was just bad at time management So what did I do I ordered books on Amazon on time management. And then those books sat with other books that I bought you know impulse bought that I was excited to buy in the moment but once they arrive I didn't have the you know drive to to you know start them and follow the advice and complete them. So it's just a crazy. cycle, you know what I mean of just of of. excitement planning and then failing, you know the the. The goal or objective um. So with with that background information um oh yeah without too. So. One hearing it all like."
148.0,Provider,That it's lacking motivation for you i'm hearing that it's really about not being able to focus and follow through.
9051.0,Patient,"yeah and one thing that's really helped me that I started using the beginning of 2021 and it's embarrassing that I haven't used it this whole time is the calendar feature and outlook, it is so helpful it's, the reason I can get anything done, including like. You know the because i'm on my computer i'm awake i'm on my computer you know, especially you know quarantine unemployment. So i'm you know, I have two screens and i'm always on my computer you know if it's where I watched my movies, my netflix my spotify. My Twitter, you know all of my like my phone if i'm home this thing to sit, you know I only use this if I leave the House, everything is done on my on my desktop. So I say all that to say. Having something that pops up in front of me hey in 30 minutes you have you know that appointment with Ashley bright heart okay cool. remind me 10 minutes before it starts and then you know at 11:50am and 10 minutes okay cool that's right so like you know, using the snooze feature and constantly keeping it on my mind, you know with whatever distraction so that's been very helpful and there's so many. Different. Apps to help you stay organized and and you know ever know to travel and notion and. They all look really impressive and also really intimidating. So um there's one that was recommended to me by a close friend and she said it really helped her you know, in combination with. Her meds working and using that she's been you know able to stay on top of stuff and her goals so i'm going to give that a try I can't think of a name, but I have it in my notes. I also have a. Note taking system that i've been using for years it's just a it's a it's a notepad but it allows me to. You know press f5 which, in search the date current date and current time automatically and then I hit space and type whatever might notice. Or you know make different blocks of different reminders that I could scroll through and look at I say oh yeah there's that thing so that's kind of my own DIY system that i've been using. But I know there's there's much better ways of going about stuff so. Those are the. tools in play, and soon to be in play now attached to your question."
148.0,Provider,You sound like you're really organized Those are some great tools that you're utilizing.
9051.0,Patient,Thank you.
148.0,Provider,"um. I think. Coming up for me as i'm listening to you today. Exercising the mind strength, you know how we exercise our body to build muscle to be stronger exercising the mind is something that we have to do to stimulating our mind. How can we do this. One of the number one place and i'm actually going to pull up an article as i'm talking to you. Oh, this is you've probably heard this but meditation. meditation is a way i'm going to show you one of my favorite articles on meditation because people are like breathing how's that kind of helped me right, what is that going to do for me Okay, so I found this article, a while back 20 scientific reasons to start meditating today. i'm so This shows the research on how meditation can boost health happiness and success so i'm just going to read through this quickly. I can send this to you after two after we're done today, so you have something to. I feel. As I started meditating student after 911 I was living in Manhattan and already chaotic place at an extremely chaotic time. I realized, I had no control over my external environment, but the one place, I did have a say over was my mind through meditation. When I started meditating I did not realize it would also make me healthier happier and more successful. Having witnessed the benefits I devoted my PhD research at Stanford to studying the impact of meditation I saw people from diverse backgrounds from college students to combat veterans benefit. In the last 10 years hundreds of studies have been released in here 20 scientifically validated reasons, you might want to get on the bandwagon today. So boost our health increases immune function decreases pain decreases inflammation at the cellular cellular level. boost happiness increases positive emotion decreases depression decreases anxiety and decreases stress. It boosts your social life, you think meditation is a solitary activity, it may be, unless you meditate in a group which many do, but it actually increases your sense of connection to others. It increases social connection in it and emotional intelligence makes you more compassionate and makes you feel less lonely. boosts self control improves your ability to regulate your emotions improves your ability to introspect it changes your brain. For the better increases Gray matter increases volume in areas related to emotion regulation positive emotions and self control and then increases cortical thickness in areas related to paying attention. improves your productivity up by doing nothing increases your focus and attention improves your ability to multitask improves your memory improves your ability to be creative and think outside the box any thoughts so far."
9051.0,Patient,"um. it's. Very positive the the features. But my question is um. Is this advice for. The Non neuro divergent brain or what's referred to as the neurotypical brain. Or is this proven to be applicable, no matter what your. Your your situation as the individual situation, and so this is what i'm thinking, right now, if i'm honest."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah good question, yes it is it doesn't discriminate. So i'm good at what i'm can do is because we don't have that much time to go too deep into this, but. i'm going to I can send you this article, and you can see, where it says click here see here, you can kind of look more into these pieces may be the ones that you might find really beneficial like. paying attention improves memory improves focus and attention might be like a big benefit for you, if you started practicing this tool and found hey you know i'm finding some and what made me think about this was a part down here to um. let's see. There was a part oh here, this is what sticks out to me meditation is quite simply mental hygiene clear out the junk tune your talents and get in touch with yourself. Think about it, you shower every day and clean your body, but have you ever showered your mind, so I really feel like this is such a way to cleanse and exercise our mind, you know i'm going to stop my share and. To improve these different aspects of our life, you know a lot of people, we hear meditation we don't understand what it really does for us. This is outside of medication outside of therapy, this is something that you can do anywhere anytime. Focusing on your breath right really practicing mindfulness because what I was also hearing from you is those racing thoughts, you know excessive worry. Thinking worst case scenarios everything about those thoughts, the one thing that those thoughts have in common is we don't have control over them. what's going to happen in the future what's to come. What we have control over is this moment. That you know, even if it's just our breath in this moment that is a huge tool of ours."
9051.0,Patient,yeah that does make sense.
148.0,Provider,"And you know what if this doesn't work for you, you have to tell Julie, to let Ashley know because i'm curious, you know how this will be for you what your experience will be. You know one thing about this is it won't hurt you and I promise you that it will do no harm. Be you know it's a great great practice."
9051.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay, do you have the i'm looking at the chat do you have the the link."
148.0,Provider,"Let me send you yeah I put the link and. here. And this is just you know, one of many tools right, and if we. You can never have too many tools in your toolbox and that's what I always tell everyone we're. Building on these tools, you know i'm combining meditation with your therapy with Julie, with your medication that you're taking right and see what kind of relief all of these things give you."
9051.0,Patient,"well. i've been trying and failing, for you know as long as I said, I have, so I am with that I am very open minded so. If it's something you're recommending i'm willing i'm willing to try it."
148.0,Provider,yeah good yeah I really hear that you are open and willing right to make any positive changes that you can. yeah to get to where you want to be and I hear you have a drive inside of you that you are not going to give up.
9051.0,Patient,"like that to. You know. Where I was last week I want it to it's like you know I got tired of pretending that I don't have a limit on on. On suffering, you know what I mean it's the best way to put it. So yeah, but I am feeling much better since yesterday and and that's been boosted, you know with our session today, so I appreciate that."
