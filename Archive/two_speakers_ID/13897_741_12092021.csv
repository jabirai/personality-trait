My urine screen in group, and even though yesterday was it rather upsetting day or i'm sorry Tuesday was a rather upsetting day because of my anxiety and stuff and. They were supposed to fix it, because when I click on it supposed to have a link to go straight to you like, when I hit the directory when I go to login for groups and things like that.

But I don't like to be seen on camera like that in front of a bunch of people it's hard for me. Because I just don't like. I just the anxiety and that trauma and stuff that I went through and i'm which the more I talk to you one on one i'll be able to talk to you more about that and feel more comfortable just talking about in general um. I just I didn't want you to think or Mr Lee to think because I always attend my groups, even though my husband test. I still logged in to tell you guys because it's important to me and I thought, Miss Ellen is going to hate me she's going to think i've been ignoring her and avoiding her. But everything I got was for Mr john and that's why I was glad I was able to I was proud of myself to get that out. and be able to stay. In group."

741.0,Provider,up there.
13897.0,Patient,"it's very cold up here I don't like the winners at all that whenever it gets dark my body like in the winter time my body clock it's out of whack because I feel like it's time to go to sleep. And I have insomnia, so it's all it gets out of whack every winter, but um I i've lived in Ohio all of my life, except for after I was molested the first time, and my mom and my dad we move from West know in Ohio to Georgia for two years and then my mom and dad. separated, then I went through and more sexual trauma. From a friend of my mom's. She wasn't aware and it took me a while to be able to tell her because I just was young and didn't know but um so we moved back up to Ohio um and. kissed her and my dad separated, while they were in Georgia and my dad came back to Ohio so then. When I, and then we moved yeah we moved a couple of places around Georgia and like to a little over two years that we live down there and. I thought, from the time I was nine, and so the time I was 11 almost yeah or like eight almost nine I want to say, because it was a little over. Two years i'm getting my memory is not the greatest because my therapist that I see on a normal basis, once a week and i've been working with her for years and. He told me that, because of the trauma your brain walks out part of things so that way it's its way of protecting itself, so I try to. Remember, some things but I can't see."
741.0,Provider,i'm a timeline gets all messed up.
13897.0,Patient,"yeah and yeah. I tried to remember, I just have problems sometimes, but I still try it anyways i'm determined i'm not a quitter. And my i'm mills being moved back to Ohio i'm. About. Three months before. My it was three months before our birthday, I know that much and and then my mom and dad had gotten another place in Troy Ohio and they were going to try to get back together in you know hash things out and because my dad passed away 14 days before my 12th birthday. Oh yeah so it was really, really traumatic um. And then I lived in Ohio ever since I live in Troy for about. Two almost three years we did a lot of moving around. Because my mom was a single mom and she worked two jobs. Then we moved. Of broccoli. To I don't remember why we moved we moved to hipper heights Ohio and I was. Probably we stopped in date and my mom just got a little half a double there for about eight months, and so we could the House came for read. that she was trying to get in heber heights but so it was just a pit stop there, but and. Then I moved to Huber and i've been in heber heights while i'm 38 now so i've been in. Huber I grew up in paper heights the rest of my teens and early 20s the name of debian dahlia when my son was too yeah when he was two. And then stayed out there until he was six and my daughter was about a year old because I got pregnant with my daughter, when my son was about. Five five and a half, and when she was about eight nine months old is whenever we move back to Cuba heights and. So i've been in Huber heights Ohio pretty much the better, part of my life and It just seems like home to me like i've been other places, and even tried to. I like familiar when I know like I know mcdonald's is on brand Pike and no kroger's is if I need to it's like 20 minutes walking there in 20 minutes walking back so I have. You know other places that i've moved it just it isn't familiar, and I think, with all the trauma that i've been for just having something familiar and so comfortable makes it feel like home. This is where I feel the most at home is in heber heights. and"
741.0,Provider,with you.
13897.0,Patient,"my daughter, and my son and my mom has her own place that he's here with me i'm out of the week, like. three to four days out of the week she'll stay the night and how we, and we do game time like game night and movie night and he will come over on. Like a Wednesday or Thursday and stay till Sunday night and then so she has the weekends with me and the kids because it's really just all my mom's family is deceased except for. Three of her nephews and one of her nieces and the rest of my mom's family is deceased and I don't really know them or know that much about them, because they lived out in. wyoming in utah and we never really had the money to travel out there, growing up, so I just listened, a little bits and pieces Whenever she talks to me about them. So pretty much my mom's here, the majority of the week. Although she doesn't live with me. it's just me in my son and my daughter. and"
741.0,Provider,"How old, are they."
13897.0,Patient,"my daughter liana is nine years old, she just turned nine November 28. She is amazing, well, I cannot tell you more about that and but and then, I have a 14 year old son named aiden. And he will be 15 in January. they're my whole world anything and everything about them from the breath a taken to the smiles on their faces I. Just i've always prided myself on trying to always stay on I can use this as a little bit, please. Thank you. and Even when I was in use of prescription pain medication and even when I was in use their my struggles before I found rehab. I just so always tried to make breakfast lunch and dinner in Georgia football games in Indo cheerleading practice in gymnastics things like that. indulge myself in them because. Being a mother. Even when I was in addiction was very important to me, clearly addiction is more important than anything but I mom whether I wanted to. Admit that my addiction was more important or not it was. And I just I knew I just needed to make a change in my life and. Change."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, can you tell me about your medical history, have you ever been hospitalized overnight had surgery. Chronic medical problems."
13897.0,Patient,"um. I was hospitalized spent one night in the hospital when I had thyroid cancer. Excuse me. and They did. Back to me. on me. They thought they might have to take my whole thyroid but they didn't have to thank God, thank you, Lord. And so they just did. I think it's a lumpectomy or partial back to me I can't remember the name of it, but I have half of a thyroid and."
741.0,Provider,came here.
13897.0,Patient,"Oh, so you went through. That. Oh wow. The drain inch tube was the worst part, for me it was held in there by one states, and it was just so sorry and irritating I didn't feel the tube it was just the stitch that. Earlier, that was. That. And I was. hospitalized with my son. My mom's opening a bag. And um so I was hospitalized with my son and 2007 I was 12 days overdue. i'm sorry not 12 days i'm thinking of my daughter's first year I was six days overdue with my son, he was the only 11 I hadn't 17. And my water broke, but it was just like I felt like I kind of keep myself a little bit it wasn't like the big explosion that everybody talks about I never had never. done yeah I didn't have to go ahead, Sir really funny story i'll have to tell you something um but they had an emergency C section of very push for 17 and a half hours i'm in my body started to set down. Because the pain was so intense. They stuck me. seven times to get my epidural and right because I have scoliosis and they didn't tell me any of that. And it didn't take right because the anesthesiologist was in a hurry. And so it was just I felt everything. yeah and I, my breathing was so rapid and so shallow and me my blood pressure was really high and my heart rate was really high because the pain was so intense but. They pretty much did that. An emergency basis because i'm my son Ted was stuck in the birth Canal. Because he was told me i'd be lucky, if I had a. Eight pound baby, but I was 120 pounds and my son was nine pounds seven ounces and 23 and a half inches so yeah and my first child, so they said that. That they didn't expect him to be that big, but he was. Young so I did have to do that and then with my daughter, they were going to try and let me have her naturally I mean well you know with the epidural but. without having to do a C section because back then, if you only had one C section, they would let you try and give birth normally your second time and see how that went but. It didn't work out too good for me, because my daughter was breach so they didn't try to manipulate her movement to flip the other way around."
741.0,Provider,And kind of just took her house.
13897.0,Patient,"yeah they did they took her out and. She was a really healthy baby as well, and she was seven one and 19 and a half inches i'm sorry 28 and a half inches. And, but she was a scheduled C section they knew ahead of time that she was breached in. yeah so they I was hospitalized again Oh well, I was with my son, I was hospitalized for three days the seven it's mandatory it was for 72 hours. So they could monitor me and, since they have to cut you in half, to make sure that you have a bowel movement and things like that. With my daughter, I already knew what to expect, so I made sure I got up and did the exercises, I was supposed to do and. Then I also i'm kind of bowel movement, so I kind of force myself, so I was able to leave after one night in the hospital after having her with a C section. um and my midwife weren't happy about that they kind of wanted me to stay, but the doctor on call and said that I would be okay to leave, so I did. The doctor on call told me to do at the time, I could talk to a midwife."

741.0,Provider,Daily year.
13897.0,Patient,"I wouldn't say daily just it's just periodically in it it'll last sometimes for an hour, sometimes for two hours, sometimes for five minutes, but I just still keep praying about it and i'm just a naturally bubbly full life person, so I just try to be optimistic and see my glass half full."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and and how many days, would you say that you're experiencing anxiety in the last 30."

741.0,Provider,and have a serious thoughts of suicide.
13897.0,Patient,know my life is too precious no.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and and have you ever attempted suicide. No okay."
13897.0,Patient,"And I believe and I know you have to say, a higher power and group, but I believe in God and you're judged you you can't act like your God it's just not okay. I hate it he brought me into the world and he's going to be going to take me out."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, why would you say your strengths are for recovery what's going to help you succeed."
13897.0,Patient,"i'm a strong support system with my mother and my brother, the keep my my friends, I can call and talk to them anytime. I can attend groups which I have outside of right heart and sometimes just prayer support for another friend. Or you know for myself just because I want to pick me up in a refresher sometimes it feels good just to go to groups. And I pray a lot I. have filled my life that void, where I used to do, drugs, I do yoga with my daughter now. I do gymnastics with her, which helps my relationship with her. And it helps me stay as young as I can, because I feel like i'm getting old no. i'm just and I I write in a journal as well, so I keep thoughts on paper. And just so it's a way of letting the middle and expressing them and if I feel, something I say it out loud so it's never a secret. So I don't have to live with that burden of having secrets anymore, and I feel a lot better now that I don't have to lie about anything I can be honest and it feels. Miss Ellen that's probably one of the best things I don't have to lie, I can I don't have to tell why and hide i'm honest about everything I smile, a lot more and i'm learning how to fall in love with myself again and love to for ta again."
741.0,Provider,cool that's awesome. What would you say some of your. challenges are.
13897.0,Patient,"And some of my challenges are um I with fibromyalgia and there were admitted arthritis sometimes I do have that pain that just won't go away. And I take ibuprofen 800 milligram prescribed by my doctor. And I try to push myself through those days and I just remind myself to. I mean, I tried to do everything I can so instead of self sabotage i'll leave myself little notes for each day positive quotes poetry. verses from the Bible i'm really God, I have to give it all to God, because he really has gotten me through everything, and when I say a lot of my strength comes from him. I know, during the darkest part of my storm or I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel god's carrying me, so I always I always remember that just having faith, sometimes I know it's hard for me um but I again pray I pray a lot. yeah very important to me."
741.0,Provider,"yeah all right and okay i'm gonna have to go here pretty quick but um i'd like for you to think about what goals you want to set for us to work toward What would you like, for me to help you with. We might consider alternative methods for dealing with chronic pain and we could talk about I mean the sky's the limit, what do you want to accomplish what are your priorities okay. Okay, so between now and the next time you and I me, I would like, for you to think about that come up with a couple of goals that you want to work toward. Obviously, and you know you're not in the same place where a lot of them are where I have to work on, you know thought processes and removing the negative thoughts you've already done that part. But relapse prevention is an obvious one we always need to do relapse prevention. Because, like it or not, something's going to come along and sweep us off our feet um. But the other option, I mean the sky's the limit, what do you want to work on, because I, as it relates to substance abuse, I can I can help."
13897.0,Patient,"I would like to work on quitting smoking, that is an addiction for me."
741.0,Provider,And it's a hard one.
13897.0,Patient,"Yes, that is, by far, one of the hardest things like I was like I was able to quit doing drugs. But cigarettes. But that was always that's been my out kind of in a way, when I was filling those boys, I have to be honest with you, I have to be honest with myself first or otherwise I can't i'm not giving it my all and. I do something I have to do with all my heart, so my conscience won't bother me and i'll be at peace about it but. I would like to definitely quit trying to work toward quitting smoking. Because that's very stressful to um and."
741.0,Provider,it's not good.
13897.0,Patient,"No yeah and for my health, I mean especially yeah I like to eat."
741.0,Provider,disease and stuff yeah.
13897.0,Patient,yeah yeah. i'm yeah i'm so that's definitely.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
13897.0,Patient,"On the top of the list, but um yeah like some things to set in and place like, if I were to start thinking about relapse and I try to think in advance, maybe that's not a good thing, maybe it is, but you know how some I was telling you about so people suck self sabotage."
741.0,Provider,I know that. We do that's what we do. i'm and definitely to have a written plan and make sure that we have all the skills available to take evasive action when. Those things occur in our life that are triggering or that will cause us to slip up and there and it's not a question of if they happen is when they happen because they do happen all the time.
13897.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm glad you said that because I feel like in recovery was the other rehab I was at that I was able to attend for a couple of months, it was always um. No relapses is not an option it's not an option and i'm thinking in my mind, and you can't say that because then you're putting pressure on everyone. I mean relapse as a part of recovery so where the the old habits old places or things that what our brain we're trying to break that cycle and retrain our brains um so maybe working on anxiety to if you can help me with that. um. Because I stress and worry so much. yeah and um."
741.0,Provider,"You know what. Some spirituality work is probably the best thing that can help you, with your anxiety."
13897.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Because if you put all if you put everything you will have into trusting God. You know, defining hammer as begun and omnipotent as he he. Can How can he not take care of our little problem."
13897.0,Patient,that's very true.
741.0,Provider,"So we can talk a little more about that so um. That you know, and if that's something that you're interested in I don't push it off on anybody, but. I have been in ministry school and that's a very big part of who I am and how I got clean and how I stay clean on a daily basis, so if there's no if that's something that interests, you also I can share with you on that too."
13897.0,Patient,"Yes, please, I would very much enjoy that very, very much. I knew I was excited to work with you. I I am as excited as I was to talk to you i'm as excited even talking with you know, like I I love. The way talk and how you carry yourself and how I feel like you talk to me and not at me that's a really big thing with people. And you don't talk to me like as if you're better than me he talked to me as if you're right here with me and you could slip up any day like I could slip up any day and it's it's it every day process and struggle, sometimes and. I just love the way you word things and how you are like I couldn't think of it for you like this. Already. you're amazing. Thank you."
741.0,Provider,"awesome i'm glad all right Jennifer waiting so i've got to go but um I will see you again, we need to meet at least once every three months, but I think if you really want to do some work together, then we should probably meet twice a month at minimum okay."
