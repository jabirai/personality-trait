226.0,Provider,"Now so hold on, let me explain so she's."
15425.0,Patient,Somebody said that they would connect me to earlier.
226.0,Provider,yeah to another.
15425.0,Patient,know they said they would connect me to Dominique.
226.0,Provider,So they'd have somebody else contact you.
15425.0,Patient,know today somebody said they would connect me to Dominique.
226.0,Provider,and release the symptom what i'm saying.
15425.0,Patient,"Today, somebody said they."
226.0,Provider,"don't okay listen and listen to what i'm saying, because this is what i'm reading, this is what they said they sent to you too, so hold on. Dominique is asking. A provider a CN reach out to a care navigator will reach out to you okay. And we will let you know when there's something available, whether it's with Dominique or another provider okay. So what i'm reading that Dominique has said is that she can get you in tomorrow."
15425.0,Patient,I can't do tomorrow.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, can you go to the hospital, can you go to urgent care something somewhere that you can get immediate assistance, because i'm dominic can't see you today."
15425.0,Patient,And will will urgent care do.
226.0,Provider,"Well, is there a hospital another like. When."
15425.0,Patient,They do.
226.0,Provider,see if they can provide you with a bridge prescription until you can see dominate.
15425.0,Patient,They won't the urgent cares always see no I can't start you want a new medication.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're going to see if somebody else can get with you today that's that's what we're doing right now that's what we're working on. This is emergency know we understand yeah I understand. This. So um here's here's my suggestion is that you know when you have these appointments do your best to make them."
15425.0,Patient,yeah obviously.
226.0,Provider,Because when when you don't.
15425.0,Patient,"Yes, oh my God, I know I was stupid person. I know i'm i'm literally horrible."
226.0,Provider,No that's not what we're saying.
15425.0,Patient,"And yes, it is, I get it."
226.0,Provider,Because it's really difficult when. Like with a situation that you're in right now it's just really difficult to get somebody else you know because dominic schedule is really full. And so you need to have sessions if you're going to be in the program you need to have sessions with me to for individual sessions.
15425.0,Patient,One do you guys never schedule anything.
226.0,Provider,"The last time I spoke to the first appointment that we had you said that you are not going to do, and you did not have time to do group or individual session."
15425.0,Patient,"No, I said I just don't have time to do group every week."
226.0,Provider,"Okay it's noted because everything's recorded so it's noted that that is what you said to me that you did not have time than that and just wanted medication. So, and I tried to explain to you, part of the program is to do group individual counseling and then also have education services. So is that something that you can do, or is that going to be able to work, can you fit that into your schedule."
15425.0,Patient,know I already don't ever go to appointments.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think we need to get you to another provider like somebody where you're not required to do what we require. So we can talk to Dominique she would know some other places, that we can refer you to where you don't have to. Do the group and the individual. therapy. Because you know if you're not making appointments you know, obviously, you know that's not going to work for you, so we need to figure out something that you know where you can be supported, like where it's going to work for you. Does that sound like something you does that feel in alignment do you feel like that's better no okay so you're willing to do that group and individual sessions, then. Okay, then why are you in the program like we can't do this, this is a perfect example of why we require individual counseling group counseling and medication management. coach because that reduces these emergencies that we're having right now, this is just how bret Hart works. That is across the board with everybody anybody that's in the program that is required of them."
15425.0,Patient,"But how does anybody have time to do this, which therapy and also have a job."
226.0,Provider,"Well, the groups are once a week and the therapy is twice a month, you know, and then we work with your schedule."
15425.0,Patient,Would you literally scheduled meeting 9pm.
226.0,Provider,there's other therapists that might be available at that time i'm not we have other therapists that work out like. Have you been to a group yet ELISE.
15425.0,Patient,"No, I would never I won't go to one."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so we need to find you a different Program. Let me i'm going to have Dominique when she gets with you or somebody else to give you some referrals. Okay, so i'm ELISE can you turn your camera okay yeah can you choose can Okay, so are you having like any suicidal ideation right now, no okay so right now is your anxiety still really high. Yes, Okay, are you working today are you able to stay home what's your situation for the day."
15425.0,Patient,stay home.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you have any coping skills at work for you, when you get like this okay so sometimes when somebody gets really bad anxiety wrapping yourself up really tight and a blanket can help. Taking a bath. watching something on TV watching something on netflix. resting. yeah doing something that's very soothing and relaxing so does any of that stuff work for you have you ever tried any of that. Okay, so is there, one thing that I named that you can do today. yo Okay, which one would want for you."
15425.0,Patient,To sitting down.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so just laying there like right now, like you're doing that's going to help you. know."
15425.0,Patient,Okay here's what i'm going to do.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and did you get any sleep last night. Now. Were you up the entire night."
15425.0,Patient,yeah I couldn't fall asleep until eight in the morning. Because I was so nervous that I was going to miss my appointment today.

15425.0,Patient,"They are trying to it and anxiety, I have constant anxiety all day long."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, they are trying to contact another provider to see if she can fit you in today. So it is you do have has done has been called into your pharmacy okay."
15425.0,Patient,You don't need it. already have it.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm going to have them do is contact you if. shontelle shontelle is the other provider. See shauntel can get with you today. Alright, so I let them know that you need something for sleep Nick you need something for anxiety. And we're waiting to see if another provider can get with you okay. Does it help you at all for sleep."
15425.0,Patient,No.
226.0,Provider,Now did it help before like at some point was it helping.
15425.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,And do you remember when it stopped helping.
15425.0,Patient,Like the past couple nights. I just feel a lot of anxiety constantly. Like everything like I just feel like my life is just about to really cave in and just be completely destroyed.
226.0,Provider,"I think you've had that feeling for a while right. So any techniques that you can think of, when you get like that, because it's a coping like you have to find coping strategies to like the medication works, to a certain point that you've got to have coping strategies for when this happens."
15425.0,Patient,I don't know.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
15425.0,Patient,Nothing works.
226.0,Provider,paint what tell me what you tried.
15425.0,Patient,exercise. smoking cigarettes. Deep breathing none of it works at all distilled leads to having a screaming screaming screaming panic attack and hurting myself.
226.0,Provider,When you are exercising were you doing it every day how often were you doing it.
15425.0,Patient,Not every day.
226.0,Provider,When you did the breathing exercises how often would you do.
15425.0,Patient,"Every day, but I don't know what a breathing exercises."
226.0,Provider,"Now, when you breathe I."
15425.0,Patient,"Just. Was breathing in and out, but this does it."
226.0,Provider,stand for. yeah okay so that's good. Anything then deeply. And then you let it out there now. And you just do that at least 10 times. So the breathing conjure comes your nervous system. So when you get anxious like that I want you to try and start breathing. breathe in through your nose.
15425.0,Patient,It just doesn't work.
226.0,Provider,"And you exhale you haven't tried it any exhale. Okay, and what would work for you let's think of one thing before we end that will work for you that you can try."
15425.0,Patient,All I do is smoke.
226.0,Provider,is taking a bath help you know. Okay.
15425.0,Patient,I don't know about tub.
226.0,Provider,"And what about like a shower. No. Okay, well then maybe just resting how you're resting okay."
15425.0,Patient,"But I do this all day, every day, and all I do is just lay in bed with extreme horrible anxiety, to the point where I can't do anything and then it just goes that's it every day and you're telling me that i'm supposed to just sit here and just lay in bed all day."
226.0,Provider,"Just how they're not willing to try anything else, what else can I say. i'm making suggestions you have to learn to manage your anxiety. You know you're saying to me you don't have time for group you don't have time for individual therapy, because you work all the time to value your time you lay in bed all day so i'm really confused like what is it like, how can we help you how can we help support you."
15425.0,Patient,I just don't want to go to group therapy.
226.0,Provider,"I know, but that's that's why like it can help you why do you not want to go."
15425.0,Patient,it's won't help me.
226.0,Provider,You don't know that you keep saying.
15425.0,Patient,will not help me.
226.0,Provider,How do you know that.
15425.0,Patient,Because i've tried it before it never helps me. I still feel awful hey my life.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so why do you not have time for individual therapy."
15425.0,Patient,I do.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're just saying to me you didn't want to do the program because you don't have time."
15425.0,Patient,"No, I just don't want to do group group therapy."
226.0,Provider,"So maybe what we can try, you know I want you to talk to Dominique about this is like you can do in a couple of individual sessions and then work your way into group therapy."
15425.0,Patient,I don't want to do group therapy.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then we need to find you a different program okay and i've i've i've let them know that i'd like Dominique to talk to you about that to giving you referrals for another program okay. Because I think you need a little bit higher level of care where you can get the support that you need."
15425.0,Patient,I don't think I need any care.
226.0,Provider,"No, but you know, here we are no. And you keep telling me that all you do is. stay in bed all day so that's an indication to me that you do. The indication that you need some more support."
15425.0,Patient,Law i'm not gonna do that every.
226.0,Provider,"Okay alright so they're reaching out to shauntel regarding your medication needs Okay, so I need to end okay hold on. Okay, so what they said then, so at least just so you know is that the Karen ABS have they're reaching out to Sean town and dominic about your medication what you're wanting for sleeping for anxiety. So one of them, the care now so we'll get back to you Okay, and let you know if it's been called in, or if you can see shauntel today."
15425.0,Patient,So today they'll text me call me.

Okay okay all right, and then i'm going to also email Dominique about like some referrals for a different program okay. i'll just explain that you're not comfortable doing groups and then you don't want to do any of this OK. OK so again, are you having any suicidal ideation. No okay all right so somebody will reach out to you soon okay. Okay, thank you take care."
