416.0,Provider,"Right well that's true so I mean recovery what recovery is all about right it's building skills so that you and strategies, so that when that happens, you, you have a lot of other things in your toolbox to go to."
8610.0,Patient,"Go yeah. So i'm glad that i'm here by myself, I mean I could I got a rod got out your drone but I was better off as being here by myself as far as I didn't have no other distractions are temptations for. me i'm smart enough to realize that."
416.0,Provider,"yeah see you avoid it and a lot of your normal triggers and stuff like that. What about like What do you do with all those feelings, because you were you know you had a lot of stuff coming up for you around there you do you just sit with them, or what do you do with them."
8610.0,Patient,"I use it for my just better just really just think about it, you mean try to think about it and realizing. what's going on what's what's good don't get mad if I do this or what what good don't get mad or where's it going to put certain things yeah I mean it's kinda. kind of breaking down on my head to figure out but i'm should do what I shouldn't do what will happen if I do this on so on and so on, but. i'm so used to craft my head anyway, because I mean i've been with you guys for me a little while now, but before that, I mean crap that's all I did was sit there with thoughts in my head basically. Without know guys, as far as like to what it can do as far as the seals and stuff like that you didn't know any of them, so I was just. Whatever i'm. kind of going rogue out here."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah I think you know I know that you are you're really private and if keep to yourself a lot. The one thing that concerns me is that you don't have anybody, other than your wife to go to really when things go wrong like this situation where she she's the one who's you know stuck somewhere you're worried about her you can talk to her she's your go to and you didn't have. You didn't have anyone else to to to be there for you right. And I know i've talked to you about this before right is having just a slightly bigger circle of people for recovery right that you could go to not i'm not talking to huge community, because I know that's not you. know. Do you have any ideas about how that might work."
8610.0,Patient,"I guess that's probably word an advantage to come into going to like I go in a time where do you think would go from an end, I mean, because I know they do have this orange. So you said they're online 24 seven yeah I mean, so I know that probably would be an advantage of that, I mean that's under fall back on but for those, like the people in general. No, no, I mean, because that is still talking about so definitely hearing others families going to have you so I don't I mean i've got family Ohio I talked to here and there, but i'm not going to call. My issues or problems like that. But as far as like people in general is. Too much freakin fake ass people and drama people around the world that I just don't talk and nobody really a maritime i've ever talked anybody religions have bite me and then somewhere along the line so i'm just not good, with people. Too many fake people in this world."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean you've learned with your life experiences to really trust people to easily. yeah.
8610.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I mean there's a few people i'll talk to like like me as far richer living is couple people that i've talked to you, but as far as like going hanging out of you know just let me. know what happened."

8610.0,Patient,"yeah I have a hard time with that religion thing. I believe originally like a universal got that thing, but those are the whole Christianity thing we don't get any questions that people don't like to hear. We feel that way but. It is what it is."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I just you know. I would love to see you know you without sort of like extra level of protection to have at least like one more person. That you know of course it's not going to be like the same kind of relationship, you have with your wife, but one more person to feel connected to you know."
8610.0,Patient,"Go sailing likely, just like her dad, for instance mag bottom talk me down on I mean because he loved me like I always told me a long time.

416.0,Provider,yeah.
8610.0,Patient,"So that's part of my issue, do you mean it takes a while for me to be like break down that point to where I feel like I need to. Talk to somebody or something i've always just. been knowing you know, is, I can handle their their name nothing I can I could deal with Iraq, Libya. Regardless if I can but.
