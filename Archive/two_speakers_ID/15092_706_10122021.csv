15092.0,Patient,Hello.
706.0,Provider,hi Dan how are you.
15092.0,Patient,"pretty good i'm trying to start there you go hi. Hello i'm so. Waiting for this meeting I did see yes ceac after your name um is that, like a license or."
706.0,Provider,"Yes, for alcohol or drug counseling."
15092.0,Patient,Oh okay. i'm. Okay. i'm not sure why i'm seeing you honestly.
706.0,Provider,"I also do so do mental health. And okay um and I also do pain for the. Day, so I do a variety of."
15092.0,Patient,And i'm sorry your screen froze if you can still hear me give it just a moment.
706.0,Provider,pain clinic.
15092.0,Patient,"I apologize for interrupting. Your screen just froze on me and I didn't hear any audio. For about say 30 seconds. Okay, so um last thing. I mean we can we can move on and stuff um. Okay, so. um. Let me go ahead and let you take the lead here because I really. I don't want to waste your time or anything so um, let me just kind of take the passenger seat for a moment."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so it looks like today we're meeting to do your bps, which is a bio psychosocial assessment. Basically what that is it's a bunch of questions, just to gain some background information on you. There is a section on substance use if that's not an issue for you, then we just skip over that. Okay. So it's just to gather the most information that we can so that we know the best way to set up a treatment plan for you."
15092.0,Patient,"Okay, and what was the assessment called again a B."
706.0,Provider,it's called a dp assets stands for bio psychosocial.
15092.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,So um we'll go ahead and get started with that um. It sounds like your issue is mental health and so you were kind of like well why. is somebody who specializes and substance use disorder so that's understandable.
15092.0,Patient,"yeah and that that's um. I, I understand that. there's a division in. Was it. The bright hurt counseling that deals mainly with substance abuse and and things and I have been set up with a I don't I don't have a weekly group or whatever, but apparently I will be joining a group for weekly group sessions. Okay um and with that they're telling me, I have two forms to fill out every week, and one of them yeah one of them focuses on substance abuse and. To be honest, I don't see that as an issue with but I don't mind answering the questions for somebody directly. i've already answered it through. A survey or whatever, but I actually see i'm. Personally, and just on a personal level just side note, and I can set this back down as checking my baggage. I just see it as probably. Not very conducive for treatment when. You you're reinforcing negative behavior that is not there, or at least the mentality of negative behavior that isn't there, and like. If every week I had to respond with well, did you do drugs, this week, did you do drugs, this week, did you do drugs, this week, it seems like the assumption is well at one point I am going to you know. do some illicit drug when that's not in my future so i'm just now that i've said it i'm going to set it up so."
706.0,Provider,"So, the one thing that I will say to that is it's not so much the assumption that you're going to do it someday it's just for for us the ability to stay on top of things, the ability to make assessments and all areas, so your mental health your substance, you know use. Your physical health, you know spiritual health, like all of those things, because if you look at like your different surveys you take it kind of taps into all kinds of different areas and that's because we're we're treating you as a whole person. And so you, you may not have substance use disorders, as of now, but somebody can develop them at any point in time so it's not that we're saying you will eventually develop develop it but we're just checking in to say hey just making sure you're still doing well in that area."
15092.0,Patient,"mm hmm I can understand that and i'm just you know i'm. I I don't. I don't know how other people. Take that. That kind of question if it's better for them to answer it on a forum it's actually better for me to talk to a person, because I can get that. direct feedback that's like hey you know i'm just trying to make sure how we do and kind of thing but that's just a personal stance on that so um yeah."
706.0,Provider,So why don't we start by you telling me what brought you to braveheart.
15092.0,Patient,"um well. A long time ago, actually back in like middle school, I was pulled out a fast and quick through. Different like testing and I didn't know what they were trying to test for or whatever um and I went through and graduated high school. um and then my mom basically told me what was going on with testing and middle school and stuff and I knew it was something odd but um and I was like placed in remedial reading classes and things like that in high school to try to help me. But the testing came out to be. Saying that I was borderline attention deficit, and that was kind of on the cusp of when they came out with the Ad add as an abbreviation."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
15092.0,Patient,"But borderline saying that I should function. Fine, in like. I can basically function find in the world. You know and, but that was like when I was in middle school I graduated high school and I go into college and I have a rough time school and focus and paying attention I daydreamed a lot and everything like that um and then I ended up kind of dropping out of. college, too, because it just it wasn't helping honestly, it was like I started to fail, my classes and it was just downward spiral, so I got work got out of college live life for a few years i'm. Fast forward through marriage having a kid i'm losing several jobs and my wife is like. Looking at me and going like i'm sure you have ADHD or a dd or something, and you need to get help for it and observing some behaviors in our son trying to seek help for him because he's having the same. His experience is not exactly like mine, but he's having he had some tendencies that like exhibit. kind of same way of. Not being able to focus or retain information but being able to retain certain information, but not others and it's just it, it was kind of weird we went through and he actually was diagnosed with ADHD. And he was subscribed, I think he was described Ritalin but on his first day of actually taking medication for it, he expressed his experience. Of the medication, let him like focus and his mind was, and I think he's basically either use the word quiet, all of a sudden i'm. Or, or he described his brain function as not being as noisy or being quiet and I realized at that moment, I had no relation to that experience, and so my wife's was urging me to get diagnosed and I finally broke down, and I mean it took me like. 20 years of her saying you know you might want to see a doctor about this, they can help and. Seeing that. My son went to a doctor and got diagnosed and it's helping him I sought out medical help to get a diagnosis. One I really want to know what's going on me all of it, I don't I don't I don't want to be like okay that's what we can treat so that's all we're going to focus on or or whatever, but I really want to know what's going on with me. And then I want to treat or help treating what's going on, so that I can better. better manage my life and. I will be upfront that. I went to my primary care and they. moved me to another primary care physician, which was Michael bros that. wanted to focus on a dd ADHD. stuff and he referred me to you for counseling for or counseling or therapy and for a psychiatric evaluation and. um and that's, I think, where we are today he did also prescribe me. Oh, I can't remember the the name of it but. Is it adderall that the brand name is. The. ADHD yeah I think that."
706.0,Provider,"there's a bunch of them, but adderall would be a very common one."
15092.0,Patient,I think admirals the brand name and i'm taking the generic so it's.
706.0,Provider,Not a fan of a.
15092.0,Patient,"bubble, but yeah yeah yeah I think that's what it is."
706.0,Provider,methylphenidate is my side has ADHD so.
15092.0,Patient,I know a.
706.0,Provider,lot about ADHD but.
15092.0,Patient,The one thing.
706.0,Provider,Go ahead.
15092.0,Patient,"And i've been taking 10 milligrams a day for about a month. And it. has definitely helped is. For once, I actually understand that. That state of having a quiet mind or being able to control what i'm focusing on and prioritize things better i'm off medication, it seems like everything's on fire, I just have to deal with the biggest fire first."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
15092.0,Patient,"um but with medication, I can see that it's not really all burning down, and I can actually schedule uh huh so it's it is."
706.0,Provider,"So typically with ADHD you also have another co occurring issue so for you, I think it's anxiety."
15092.0,Patient,I think you have anxiety.
706.0,Provider,"I think there was a diagnosis of major depressive. And so, all of those things. Together, are going to do a few different things they're going to make your mind you're gonna have spider webbing thoughts, which is what your ADHD so like. you'll be thinking about one thing which will trigger another thing and then that thing will trigger something else, and then before you know what your minds over here and you're not focused on what you're doing that's the big thing with. ADHD um and you also can focus on multiple things at a time so it's hard to sit down and watch a movie without being on your phone or doing something else because. it's like your brain can't focus on one thing, it needs to focus on several things at once. Your brain just acts differently. But with anxiety piece, then that gives you like racing thoughts, so now those thoughts that are spider webbing everywhere now they're racing through your head, to the point that you feel like. there's never a quiet moment you're always thinking about But what if this and what if that And what if I do that and is that going to work out okay like you just. You just keep it going so you've got a spider web and thoughts, but they're also racing so, then you feel obviously higher anxiety. So you know those are typically kind of the the noise that you hear personally like the noise. Right it's just fat."
15092.0,Patient,"Okay, and I do want to point out because. i'm. My experience. also includes I usually have music going on in my head. And it's not not usually stuff I can control. Okay um and usually it's like a. song I heard like three weeks ago. On the radio on and start playing in my head and it's usually like the same standard same. heart and it just repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat i'm when i'm not. Taking my medication it's loud and like usually just I mean it's it's like you're at a party and there's music playing you have no control over it. um what the medication has helped me do is turn the volume down on that. So. I mean it's it's there right now it's like off in a corner somewhere, but um. And I can adjust it a little bit have a little more control over that but. I don't know if that's part of the spider webbing thoughts or if that that's indicative of something completely different."
706.0,Provider,"um you know it could be, you know, a couple of different things like I said, you have. Major depressive disorder single episode minor severe, so I mean it could be, it could also be part of that it costs will be part of that major depressive disorder, I mean might have some. Some auditory stuff going on, it could it could be or ADHD it could be something completely normal people, you know how they always say I have a song stuck in my head like they. Like I hear like you hear it, but and then all of a sudden, out of the clear blue something's triggered in your brain."
15092.0,Patient,And you.
706.0,Provider,"eat it with that song and this song kind of plays in your head that same stanza you know and that's the only part that usually plays unless you stop and think about okay well what's the next verse and then you can try and figure out what that next verse is going to be. A lot of that is very normal because it's just a subconscious absorption of of what's going on around you like a song that you hear or an event that happens that like maybe triggers your brain to think about something. You know if it's really loud and it's almost deafening, to the point where you're not able to do anything else. that's a more serious issue, but if it's just something that's in your head that. You know, some people will find like they'll just start humming a song for no reason because it's in their head and they have no clue where it came from, but they might have heard it, you know, three weeks ago. Work you know or something sometimes you know it will say why did you have to play that song now it's stuck in my head. For me it's baby shark I have a two and a half, almost three year old and baby shark plays in my head all the time. I could just be doing something random and i'll start humming baby shark and it won't even be on but it's just because it's in my head, because my son listens to it, or like the pj masks on or the paw patrol song, you know just because they're stuck in my brain somewhere. Not you know and so that's that's pretty normal I wouldn't really worry about those things too much. If you're seeing a difference with the adderall then more than likely it's doing what it's supposed to do."
15092.0,Patient,it's just.
706.0,Provider,"it's calming everything in your brain, so you can focus. Somebody that has ADHD with also anxiety, they have a lot of chaos in their head and that chaos usually comes out then around them so. Usually, they aren't very organized they try and organize things like they start to like do a project and they're like cleaning and doing what they need to do, but somehow, no matter how long they spend in that room. It doesn't look anything. hmm um that's that's a big one, because you have the chaos in your brain and so, then you it comes out in the chaos around you. So one thing that helps once you're on your medication once you start stabilize that piece of it is to make your environment less chaotic because it also has a less effect of making your mind feel chaotic. But that's hard to do when you can't focus. um and sometimes you need to ask for help, like maybe your. wife can help. You to kind of create that quiet space. My son is 13 struggles with that his ADHD he will go to his room and he'll be in there for five hours cleaning his room. But all who really do is move stuff around he doesn't really actually get things like cleaned out cleaned up it's just like moving moving stuff around. Because he'll be doing something and then he'll be like Oh, but I need to do this and he'll be over here and so really he just kind of goes in a circle."
15092.0,Patient,Really yeah.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so and it's challenging you know it's challenging and other thing with ADHD is impulsivity so being able to control like how you react to things. Typically, people react to things in a very like. One extreme or the other, like suddenly you get like really mad really quick or you get really sad really quick or you have these extreme emotions. And so, and that's that impulsivity piece of your brain the frontal lobe and so it's hard to control that impulsivity and that's what that that ADHD so there's ADHD that's like attention deficit, which is the a dd. attend attention deficit hyperactivity there's you know there's different types and then there's combination type where you have that impulsivity and that attention together so. You know it's, it is a very complicated and it's also very interesting and i've actually had to do a lot of research on it, because obviously my son, has it so. i'm just researching it to figure out how that brain works my husband has it too, so those two together they know exactly how they're thinking. And i'm over here like I have no clue why you guys think this way, but you know you have to understand that and that's probably where your wife is too and she's like I. really want. You to figure out what's going on, so it will help me to understand how I can help you."
15092.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"So um. So we kind of We talked a lot about like your you know psychiatric like the diagnosis, so this is the first time you've ever sought out treatment."
15092.0,Patient,that's correct.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, have you had any kind of like other mental health things like suicidal ideations Have you ever thought about hurting yourself anything like that."
15092.0,Patient,"Like when I was a teenager I did have. suicidal tendencies. and I had kind of I don't know where it all stemmed from or whatever, but um when I was a teenager I kind of had an Epiphany that I can't survive like that and I. I know that sounds weird but, at the time, I made a promise to myself that never kill myself. and So far, so good. But I. And I basically. I don't have any like suicidal thoughts or anything like that um as to like hurting myself I. I don't hurt myself I don't try to cause myself pain, but um. let's see i'm. Trying to be honest and put us in. The right definition or setting um. You know hurt me, I will put myself in front of my family to take injury or even death. And that is just ingrained in my personality, I guess um with that. there's. This little thing about like I mean I question, sometimes it may, am I really trying to hurt myself or or not, but I don't think I don't think I have an impulse to cause myself on. Okay um I."
706.0,Provider,"Think so either the way you're describing it is that have a protector. i'm a fan of a husband of a protector and. You know and that's what you feel you know as a parent I was stepping in front of a train for my child, you know what I mean like it."
15092.0,Patient,wouldn't even.
706.0,Provider,"You don't you don't even think about it. You just want them to be safe that's very normal. You know you're just. you're taking on that that protector. So I don't I don't think that you're trying to harm yourself you're just saying, if a situation came about, and it was me or them it'd be me."
15092.0,Patient,"And I. So. I know a like when people will try to introspect a lot um there's a defensive mechanism that's like well. And and people will guard that and I am honestly trying to see. Whatever I need because normally when i'm talking to people yeah I I guard those thoughts those ideas I am maybe less open with people, but I am a very open and curious person generally. And i'm making an effort to be absolutely open and honest and hopefully to build that trust and i'm kind of also. i'm hesitant to just say nope and check a box and put it aside in an effort to show that i'm actually really thinking about this and. i'm trying to consider it for real but you're right I I don't see. I don't see me attempting to harness oh."
706.0,Provider,yeah. I don't see that um. What about thoughts of harming others do you ever have thoughts of harming others homicidal ideation.
15092.0,Patient,"um maybe not to that extent um I mean there's. A if I feel wrong, I feel, somebody is wrong, my family I do. I don't really want to express it like this, but I fantasize sometimes about. causing harm like One example is there was a. Business that came out to do some construction repair on my parents property and they actually. didn't do a job that would measure up to building code and. They didn't take responsibility of it, and it was I mean there are times, where i'm. I do think about can I do something that would ruin their business and take their business away and honestly I know that's not healthy and i've had a year to come to the conclusion that I need to just wash my hands and be done with it, but i'm. In the presence of honesty and literally being open, there are times, where I do. Think about doing harm to others, and I know that's not right, so I don't do it."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
15092.0,Patient,"um. I am trying to live at my my. i'm trying to put my thoughts in a positive perspective and um. I don't really want to bring more suffering into the world and i'd like to diminish that, as a general goal and rule. But there are times, where yeah I have thought, so I could so easily and this person, but um. yeah I mean I don't know how to how to move on from there, I mean. Okay, with my explanation and I don't mean to make this harder for you, but."
706.0,Provider,"Oh no no you're fine that's why we do this, bio psychosocial because it gives us a lot of background information, I mean it sounds like you have some very impulsive thoughts. That run into your head, especially in a high stress situation, and so one of the goals in therapy might be to figure out different ways to deal with those stressful situations, so instead of being impulsive and having those impulsive thoughts are. Negative or I could ruin their business as processing okay take a deep breath."
15092.0,Patient,let's look at.
706.0,Provider,"A situation, is it possible it's not as bad as as what it seems, is it possible that maybe there's another way to go about it. it's not my job to save all you know it's not my job to take on that role of judge and jury those kinds of things um you know, and so, but a lot of that impulsivity stems from that frontal lobe which is affected by your ADHD. makes I mean it makes complete sense um. So let's go on to family history so. When our family is there a history of mental health issues or any substance use issues."
15092.0,Patient,"um. let's see I. So, on my mom's side of the family, my grandfather was. an alcoholic and he was a raging drunk so he would. Go to a bar and get drunk and he would take his rage out on his wife and children. My. His children my I have two uncles that. Were. Heavy into. All sorts of drugs and alcohol i'm. One of them actually died after doing cocaine, with a buddy that stayed the night, and he had a heart attack and from. But. They also were. Like through the hell of Vietnam, basically, and I don't know if that was just how they coped with it, I don't know how they will before. But."
706.0,Provider,yesterday.
15092.0,Patient,"yeah my and I have a another uncle that I consider clean and sober I mean socially will drink, but not, I have never seen him get drunk. And then, on my my dad side, I have no idea about the rest of his family, I know my dad. used to occasionally drink, but never to the point of getting drunk. He used to use tobacco and he had he quit because. It was basically he had to quit for two weeks, and for a surgery that he that he had and then he just never picked it up again and. I don't other than that I don't know of any I don't know of any mental illness I don't know of any oh actually my grandmother my mom's mother had parkinson's. And I think my dad has dementia right now I don't know if it's been diagnosed, but he has all the signs of dementia and i'm actually. Right now me and my family are living with my parents. Helping through deal with the dementia issue and i'm technically we're a homeless and residing with them for the meantime and while we're here i'm doing what I can to help with the their situation. So. But as family history that's, all I can remember."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds good so um. And then, of course, your son has ADHD does he have any other diagnoses."
15092.0,Patient,Not as not yet okay.
706.0,Provider,And how old is he.
15092.0,Patient,"He is 14. Okay, and I think I think it was ADHD with anxiety, he has bad very much. anxiety. outbursts and things and since he's been taking his medication. That is. I haven't seen an actual outbursts like that. For since he started his medication. Okay, so I think his anxiety was aggravated more by his ADHD and. What he was dealing with mentally and being able to to deal with that he is, and also with the counseling he's going through as well is is really helping him. notice is triggered triggers and address them before it becomes too. Too much for him to handle."
706.0,Provider,So the medication has helped him to basically control that impulsivity piece.
15092.0,Patient,"It has and. That. I think, as he expressed it, the control it gives him. helps him not. Be as anxious because everything's not like running out of out of control. It I I do understand what that feels like because. years back. i'd be in situations that would be kind of normal like normal workday situations for other people, but for me it's like I was responding to emergencies and everything was urgent and I had no control over my environment, I had no control over. My my job, and I should have been in a position where I could control it, but it just seems like everything comes at you all at once, when you can't even control the little things. everything seemed really big and. I understand that, being able to. Take that moment and go okay let's reset for a moment and take a look at this from a different perspective. and see that we can break this down in chunks and control this and what seemed to be this huge fire on my doorstep is actually something I could just put off till tomorrow, and I can schedule time for that and it's it's huge to be able to have that control over. um I also will admit because part of this is personality, I do have a control issues. Like if i'm in a car, I prefer to be driving if I. Like when I bought a plane or a train i'm always wondering who's behind the the controls of the vehicle and. I do recognize that I have issues with with control if i'm in a situation where I don't have any control I I do tend to be more anxious. Okay, so make sense."
706.0,Provider,"So um I. mean that makes I mean that makes complete sense I mean, then it goes right along with kind of your diagnosis and what you what you have going on, so um What about medical anything significantly like with medical history in your family."
15092.0,Patient,"um. yeah I think so um both my parents have diabetes it's adult onset um and my mom has a degenerative. eye. I don't know if it's a disease, necessarily, but it was explained to her that she has a like a fungal growth in her inner I said it was like damaging and revision and she had a bleeding a few retinas started to. bleed because they were damaged beyond repair and she had lasik some lasik surgery where they went in and cauterize those. Those areas um let's see my think my mom has hypertension or high blood pressure i'm. I don't know about my my dad my dad has dementia. My grandpa again back to what I mentioned before my grandma had parkinson's. We, I think it might be genetic the parkinson's she had but I don't know that much about it um. My mom's not exhibiting necessarily symptoms of parkinson's but she's only in her. 70s and. That is. My dad is almost at he's about to turn at this year, I think, or might be next year, but um. But he doesn't show signs of like parkinson's definitely is showing. All the signs of dementia and what form of dementia, that is i'm not sure i'm they've had a heck of a time getting him diagnosis and. we're having a heck of a time actually getting. In to go in and get like any kind of tests done to show what the progress of of it is or. Or what so. Okay um any other medical things. Personally, I have a. I guess I guess oral hygiene was never the best for me so. i've had a lot of dental work and things and i'm. i've come to. I mean it's like it's no denying I only have like a. Like 11 or 12 teeth left in my head out of 30 so that's kind of pretty significant. Okay um."
706.0,Provider,And that's just from. corner hygiene over the years.
15092.0,Patient,I think it's pretty much from for oral hygiene um and I think it might be I think my saliva might be on the acidic side or something. This.
706.0,Provider,house in your family have that issue.
15092.0,Patient,My mom does but.
706.0,Provider,Maybe something. That is within your genetic makeup.
15092.0,Patient,It might be yeah.
706.0,Provider,That just makes you more predisposed to having. issues with the K.
15092.0,Patient,Because you might.
706.0,Provider,"You know, have more acidity in your saliva or you might have a softer enamel I mean there's a lot of different."
15092.0,Patient,"It could be either or both, or any of that yeah."
706.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely okay so let's talk about kind of your current situation where you currently living, you said, your with your parents."
15092.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
706.0,Provider,So you. and your son and you live with your parents.
15092.0,Patient,"that's correct they they have a. i'm going to say two and a half storey house it's two stories with a law and my parents. had built the House to inhabit the main floor, which is um there's a downstairs and then there's a locked off the main floor and. They have a a guest room that has been converted to my son's bedroom, which is where i'm at right now, because it's the most private space. And then they replace. and The downstairs has a large. bedroom its own bathroom and me and my wife pretty much inhabit that bedroom and have kind of taken over the downstairs area um while we're here and uh my wife has. Some medical issues that make it difficult for her to climb stairs. So this is not necessarily medical that. would be on me but. is definitely stressors in my life. Okay um she has show grinch, which is an autoimmune disease. That. comes with a. See fibromyalgia. And a lot of neuropathy. And it's basically her immune system is it's. it's basically attacking her nervous system and um she's got better days than others, and right now she's in what she calls a flare day but. Which is basically. auto immune reaction so she has swelling in her joints. She thought she had arthritis worldwide. And she went and actually suspected ra and she went to a doctor, to see a bits. That type of arthritis ra and they ran her through a bunch of tests and said she has markers for ra but they don't think that's what it was, and then they further diagnosed it as shoguns which. i'm i'm glad for the diagnosis i'm really not but that's actually happening yeah yeah."

15092.0,Patient,"I thought I did um I. Now. To be honest, I was very much picked on as a child bullied um I. I had a seat, when I was since I was four years old, I was. So okay I grew up in Minnesota and from the ages of when I was four we had. A family moved into the neighborhood on the same block that I live and their boys were, I believe, five and eight would bully me and to the point of. One day, I know it was winter, it was snow they cornered me on my walk home from school because the bus drop me off, about a block away. They cornered me and the older kids grabbed me and threw me into a bank of snow and took my head and started bashing my head into the snow enough that I was bleeding from the nose. And my entire face went numb um. And that summer so about six months later, the younger kid threatened me with a butcher knife. i'm just kind of had a butcher knife and he kept flashing it back and forth like you know just being threatening and, at the time I was across day two lane street from him and my my older brother was four years older than me. i'm stopped me and said wait here, and he crossed the street and scared the kid back home. And they would come over and break my toys and things like that needs them for me to find and it was like you know that that was just kind of like one set of Bowling and then my parents moved to Oregon when I was seven. And I don't think I was ever believed to that extent, again, but in school, I was always like the outcast and. I could identify bullies like like man I just realized, you know it's like you can kick them out of a crowd and most of them would. You know, isolate me and confront me but I, at that point, I didn't back down from from I mean I was a scrapper back then I didn't back down from a fight and. I I would do my best to let them enjoy themselves by getting out of the way but i'm That was my entire philosophy and. After a little bit of them realizing as a group that confronting the wasn't really getting them what they were looking for I was kind of sidelined as not not really being picked on, but I was still outcast from. A lot of. A lot of different groups until I was in high school and. were high school has older flicks and stuff and I like. In high school I had over like 300 friends that I could count me. And that was because I was a part of so many. Like loner groups or outcast groups that I just made friends really easy with anybody who was not part of the in crowd and. I. I just like expand my friends group but they're more or less I would count all those people as more like acquaintances today, then, and then real friends, I probably had a handful of real strong friends that would stick with me and stuff i'm. Also, I think I need to mention i'm back to medical things when I was five years old, I had a severe concussion I. was in a child seat on the back of a bicycle and the child seat. left the bike it just came all the way off oh man I hit the pavement. hard enough that I went unconscious for several minutes, and in fact somebody said that I wasn't even breathing but. I came to in a stranger's arms um and. crying but I didn't feel the pain, when I came. To consciousness for a little bit now I was like going Why am I crying and all sudden I felt that surge of pain and my head is just throbbing um so I had to get to the hospital get some stitches in my head. And that's when I found out that lady keen has absolutely no numbing effect on. Oh that's strange and because they had to clean my wound out because it was black top that was inside my scalp and I felt every bit of them scouring that out of my head. And they were telling my mom that he shouldn't be feeling, this is just scared it's Okay, and we gave him why to can you shouldn't feel anything but i'm even even since then. Like there's a lady King cream to treat pain and things like that and. It does nothing to numb any of my nerves so yeah um but both that and the concussion are probably things that should be noted medically. On other than that uh. yeah I, and I think I pretty well cover my childhood, unless you have further questions there."
706.0,Provider,"No, no, I don't think so um. And so you how would you would you say that you did well in school or did you just get by in school."
15092.0,Patient,"In a primary education, I I just got by I had to force myself to graduate in four years in high school. And in college. um. I started college, I think I started college too early. Because I wanted to take a year or two to figure out what I wanted to do and then enter college to get the training or whatever school to get training for that. And I saw it as I had too many. possibilities and too many options to choose from, and so I my parents. suggested I start college, so I didn't lose that school mentality thing and I started college and I was just getting by and I actually dropped out of the Community college keep. It went to it for about a year and a half, and then I dropped out because I it wasn't helping me it, I was. Doing worse and worse and worse. And a. It just it really wasn't working for me it's not where I needed to be at that moment years later I go back to school and because I was tired of. Cleaning toilets and mopping floors and, that being it for my my working life, I knew I could do so much better or so much different things, and it was just too monotonous for me. So I went back to to college and I actually did fairly well. i'm life happens. My wife had a pulmonary embolism so she was hospitalized and for a week and all those bills when they came do I couldn't afford to continue college and pay off the medical bills. and ended up having to file bankruptcy in the hand anyway, but it was just too much I needed to get work, so I dropped out of college, but then I went back and completed my degree. So I have a bachelor's degree so and I did really well when I went back, and I mean I was working at the same time that I was doing school. But I had. At the time I already had like seven years of experience in the field that I was going to school in. And I was able to do online school and actually graduated with honors oh. yeah and um. So you know, did I do well in school, did I just get by in primary education, I just got by I was not interested. Except for just. To get it done get me the piece of paper, so I could move on. And I didn't. I, to be honest, I didn't take the opportunities that were presented to me in. Like in high school and before to explore different career paths and things like that. And my teachers thought that I would just I mean I had. My mom was a teacher's aide. and new like kept in contact with some of my teachers, even from middle school and I think one of my middle school teachers was surprised that I actually graduated high school and. And that was just before I. got my degree with. graduating honors so i'm. Having heard that i'm i'm like going yeah I had teachers and mentors who thought I was just going to fail in whatever I do. So."
706.0,Provider,"So you were just kind of. A little bit of both you know, like you, you just almost wanted to just get through all of this stuff you had to do to get to the stuff he wanted to do."
15092.0,Patient,He said yeah okay that man yeah.
706.0,Provider,"um What about your work experience, are you currently employed."
15092.0,Patient,"I am currently unemployed i'm looking for work doing. Jobs whenever they show up but i'm. So this is. This is kind of. Where. what's really compelled me to seek help. Not only for my my lifestyle, but my wife convinced me that I need to get help because. And I am concerned with if I get employed again is my destructive tendencies my ADHD i'm my chaotic environment because of my chaotic brain is that going to lose me another job because I do I do see points in my past where I have. been either laid off or fired. and He could all be contributed to ADHD in one form or another, because i'm. One job that I had for almost five years I was. I was forced to resign. Because if I didn't resign i'd be fired. But, and I think that was all because of an incident that. My manager wouldn't be able to. depend on me to do a simple task of calling him to let him know that I completed training a user on a device when I failed to do that, once and it wasn't a routine thing it was like okay today, since this is the head honcho of our whole entire department. I need to be informed when he gets trained on using his Blackberry, and so I trained on using a BlackBerry Blackberry made sure, everything was. Good and copasetic and I had to reschedule that i'm training time for a later time of that day. got them done and out, and I was walking back to my desk to make a phone call to my manager, because my manager ended up going home early that day, whatever and on my way back to the desk I was stopped to ask if. I could check out an error on somebody's computer checked out that error on somebody's computer got back to my desk absolutely forgot about calling an integer until I was halfway home women manager called me and said hey did you ever do this and. I think pretty much I mean he. pulled me into his office and gave me a lecture about. how important it was for me to. call him and that he thought he made it very clear the support and blah blah blah, and if I can't trust that you'll follow through on something like this, how can I trust you in anything and then about three weeks later, I was let go okay."
706.0,Provider,So you definitely have some some instability issues when it comes to employment that you think is a direct correlation with your mental health and ability to concentrate those types of things.
15092.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
706.0,Provider,"Okay um any kind of legal history, have you been in trouble with the police."
15092.0,Patient,"No, no Okay, I mean i've had. A point of an impulsive impulsivity i've had. A couple traffic stops and three tickets in my entire life were speeding okay. yeah and I. I tend to push it a little bit well so okay Okay, but that's that's all that's been the. The amount of my trouble with the authorities or police or anything okay."
706.0,Provider,"And you just have the one child. sounds like you and your son and your wife are are close, you have a good relationship."
15092.0,Patient,We do we're very close yeah okay very open with each other as well.
706.0,Provider,Good that's very important we've talked about your stressors sounds like your main stressors are like your inability to concentrate stay focused obviously employment is going to be a huge stressor which goes along with that is going to be financial. also sounds like a big stressor for you is your wife's health.
15092.0,Patient,Absolutely okay.
706.0,Provider,um.
15092.0,Patient,"I mean, I mean, I would say my wife's my wife's health is. The number one stressor in my life okay and. Financial stability is secondary to that I guess okay okay yeah all right."
706.0,Provider,um do you have any questions for me.
15092.0,Patient,"i'm at this time, no."
706.0,Provider,"Okay that's fine so we completed your meet ups like I said it was just a bunch of background information. So we'll just use that and then, when we start doing therapy will come up with goals short term goals long term goals and then kind of a plan to achieve them. So you can start."
15092.0,Patient,yeah i'm sorry. Your screen froze again I don't know when we'll get contact again give me just a moment. yeah. You just mentioned will come up with some goals and then everything gross.
706.0,Provider,"yeah you froze up, I was just saying we'll come up with some goals and then kind of a plan to achieve them so i'm the therapist but you actually drive your therapy so, whatever your goals are whatever you want to achieve in therapy then that's what we focus on. it's very it's very it's very much driven by the patient, because that's where you get the most buy in and you get the best results, because if. If you believe in what you're doing, and you are interested in changing the things that we're working on you're going to be much more successful in doing so."
15092.0,Patient,yeah and when I mentioned my control issues before I wasn't expecting you to just give in so easy okay.
706.0,Provider,"No that's just how I do there, but I just find that people have much more buy in when you say that you would like to change about your life."
15092.0,Patient,"Absolutely and honestly. I mean. Just being honest nothing's going to change in my life, unless I wanted to. And that's I mean I know you've probably come across that with everybody is I mean it's just. You know um. yeah I mean any any change change is stressful and there's a grieving process to go through it and stuff but. It yeah it change won't stick unless you know the person who needs to change is devoted to it and. Having them drive that that's great that's that's very positive."
706.0,Provider,"Absolutely, so what you'll do now, if you haven't already set up some therapy appointments moving forward, and you can do that through the BC and then i'll see you here in a couple weeks probably. All right, all right take care of yourself."
15092.0,Patient,Are you Thank you Stacy have a good day.
