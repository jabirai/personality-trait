462.0,Provider,hey James.
13123.0,Patient,come up to the end of the Semester here the next two days excited about.
462.0,Provider,The busy time.
13123.0,Patient,A little bit yeah I just have one more class that I have to do some assignments for. But no already done with my presentation and then we're you know no finals or anything like that so.
462.0,Provider,"Okay well that's good that's exciting, because I know you're kind of ready to be done with the program in general."
13123.0,Patient,yeah and I also think you know this break will be a good time for me to sort of set some good habits and patterns and routines hopefully.
462.0,Provider,Before.
13123.0,Patient,"For last semester so. Other than that, well, I had one one thing that kind of concerned me a little bit I thought, a little bit about why this is the case, but I received a second. Article to peer review from someone cohort."
462.0,Provider,yep.
13123.0,Patient,And this was another person that I consider to be a pretty smart. And it was bad. you're freezing on your end.
462.0,Provider,Can you hear me.
13123.0,Patient,"It might be my my connection. yeah so. it's like to have the people in the cohort who. And I still liked him a lot we you know we have things in common, we talked about politics we saw that so that's great but. I was kind of overcome with contempt, to be honest and that bothered me. And I don't I mean I think part of it is we've already discussed that there's there was an overemphasis on that. growing up for me and then also the fact that I haven't lived up to the supposedly expectations which are unreachable really. That I compensate for that, with this sort of competition. Intellectual competition people. So I think that's part of it, but I also can't help us think. That. There is something. To my feeling apart or separate that this contributes to and. I think that that has also played into the loneliness and so i'm reacting kind of angrily with my contemplative look at just feeling lonely. So. That, I guess, I guess that's all I have to say about that, I actually think I understand it better than I thought I did when I sat down to to start this meeting. there's a lot of factors it's kind of complex so."
462.0,Provider,"So the peer review Article kind of brought you into a pretty long thought process, it sounds like."
13123.0,Patient,"fairly yeah yeah it did. It just. yeah I thought about these things a little bit before, but I just kept telling myself if I was being too judgmental or it wasn't true or and this seemed to be kind of tangible evidence of golf. Or at least my proceed gulf between myself and. Almost everyone in the cohort or everyone in the cohort. And that was little. I was actually a little shocking I didn't really expect it. And disappointing and yeah so It made me made me think quite a bit about it. So I don't know if there's anything to do about it, I guess. I guess that leads into the idea of not fitting in."
462.0,Provider,feeling lonely.
13123.0,Patient,"yeah I think you know we talked last time about me trying to take a more holistic view of myself in terms of personality and characteristics and then also other people. So i'm wondering. And i'm trying to figure out. If this is just not that abnormal. And i'm instead of trying to find. someone like me I just had to figure out like what my niche and improvements, maybe I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that sounds like a key Oh, rather than trying to find everyone like you may be finding just where you feel like you fit more. seems like maybe in the cohort intellectually you don't feel like it's your exact fit that's Okay, you really just got to get the degree that's what you're there for. Right um it might be nice to have some acquaintances and some friends, but as far as kind of serious long term stuff it just might not be people from from the cohort."
13123.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's true and yeah I guess it really is the loneliness putting up the pressure on finding that within the cohort.
462.0,Provider,Right right.
13123.0,Patient,"Yes. yeah i'll try to remind myself with that. stepping stone. Internal terms of, I guess, I think this is positive i've been. angry at myself in a healthy way, I think, in a productive way in the sense that. Whenever I start, you know feeling a little bit of despair coming on I just kind of tell myself it's ridiculous and snap out of it and. Also, just make the best of what you do have and. Let go the profession i'm not necessarily saying it in these terms. But I think it's good because it's actually motivating me to start doing things like. eat healthier get back into the gym just like you know, be the best version of myself, regardless of the fact that you know i'm showing signs of age that are bothering me and other things so. So that was good and it's actually i'm doing a pretty good job, I think I learned or discovered that I have some kind of sun damage on my neck that I guess is now permanent it's not the type of just goes away. You know, you can make it less and it's not that bad. You can make it less visible and do other things with skincare line, but that was kind of shocked to. The hairs they get it they're like the age, the sun. marks and. Like I said I think i'm doing a job, think about okay well, what can you do and it's not that big of a deal in you know when you think about the whole person personality. character and then even the appearance, the whole person versus these little things it's not it's not that big a deal so."
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah that's something that you brought up last time so it's good that you've been continuing to just kind of reframe those thoughts and remind yourself of what you can do, and you know that there's a bigger picture to it all. And just you know, remembering that it's natural and everybody goes through it and you know if you do find friends and a partner right that's something that's one of your long term goals they're likely going to be in your age range kind of going through the same thing."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah. let's see what else oh. The the whole I contact thing. Actually, is worked out really well so. That little trick I guess or. I guess it's just becoming a habit now so. that's much better. and it's interesting. I don't know why i'm embarrassed to say this. i've noticed actually like the more I contact I make them more kind of flirtation and getting from certain people. Which is you know it's nice feels good, especially considering we've talked about all the agent stuff so."
462.0,Provider,"When it's not something you would notice if you're just you know really avoiding. Making eye contact. So that shows that you're having a little bit more of a connection and your conversations your observations and you know that's really a big step forward for you, with having social anxiety."
13123.0,Patient,"is huge yeah. Maybe that's why I feel embarrassed about it because it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal, but it is. And yes, you're right, I actually This caused me to think a lot about what you just said, I used to walk down the street like not looking at other people. For fear that. I would feel awkward or have to interact. So this is this is big and it's yeah it's amazing the I am starting to notice all those small behaviors. That I didn't."
462.0,Provider,that's such a good way to just be more connected to people.
13123.0,Patient,yeah and it's also a little overwhelming because it's just like all this new information flying I mean.
462.0,Provider,A lot.
13123.0,Patient,"But happy about it. And then lastly. I well. I haven't done a meet up yet, but since schools over now that's gonna be one of my goals in the next week to do. At least one. Next week or two."
462.0,Provider,Do you have one that you are specifically kind of picked out.
13123.0,Patient,"i'm just that one words of variety of activities, but I haven't looked at what they're doing in the next week."
462.0,Provider,"Okay that's great yeah and that was part of also kind of stepping outside your comfort zone and not having control over what it is, and it may be just being something that you've never done or you don't know much about."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm kind of nervous and excited about that. And then the same vein, I decided just to do and I don't know if i'll stay the classes or not, it depends on if it's feasible, a practical, given that i'm going to be looking for. A job and who knows, maybe. we'll get lucky and get an internship during my last semester, but for the time being, I decided just to load up all my. Excuse me, all my electives as just fun things that I haven't done before like hip hop dance and."
462.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
13123.0,Patient,"and I said yeah I think so i'm actually excited about that I used to love dancing when I was young. And I played guitar for a long time, but haven't played it recently, and they have a class that's part focused on acoustic configure pickings I signed up for that. I signed up or I actually have to talk to the instructor still to bypass the prerequisites since i'm not an art major but thinking about doing an introductory painting class as well. The last Semester, the projects we're doing are pretty much all we work on. So I don't feel like these electives, especially since they're not you know academically challenging things would be too much I think they would just be that kind of fine break from from the other stuff."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's right in line with you know we each week talk about your treatment plan and just the goals that we put on that that's right in line with what we were talking about about you just kind of. Stepping outside your comfort zone doing something you're not in control of or something that you've never tried before or even you know getting back into something, you said you used to enjoy dancing while great Why not try it out, you have the opportunity, so that's really good."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah so that was kind of was excited about signing up for those fun. Just thinking about it. And then I. Have a meeting well just for coffee, with a friend. Who is either, while the guy who used to be in the Program. For next Wednesday, so you know, trying to to plan something social now that school is over, because it'd be very easy for me to just stay in my room now that I don't have to go to. see people. So I feel like i'm making a lot of good plans and. I do think. That, although sometimes I do still despair that overall i'm i'm sort of mentally moving in the right direction in terms of sort of. Telling myself to stop that and just keep doing what you can so. The one thing and I guess it is. largely due to what we discussed last time with. The wellbutrin and don't mean and all that."
462.0,Provider,yeah I was gonna ask about that.
13123.0,Patient,"So I did not decrease it until I talked to shontelle yesterday I guess i'm kind of on my own, but I just wanted to be sure. yeah so i'm just about to start decreasing it a bit. It has actually caused. A bit of a distraction because it's it's maybe focus on one woman in particular and spend a lot of time thinking about her so. that's bad thing, but. Do."
462.0,Provider,You attribute that to the medication change.
13123.0,Patient,"I attribute it to several things. So that kind of interesting. So. One I do find her a very attractive physically. She has some characteristics and interest I also find attractive, there are other things about her that are don't find attractive and actually would make her and me completely incompatible for any real. Long term relationship. So there's that."
462.0,Provider,Is this someone in your cohort.
13123.0,Patient,yeah it is.
462.0,Provider,OK OK.
13123.0,Patient,"Then also. She also has not truly enjoyed the Program. And I worry sometimes that you know it's kind of that that negativity always draws me in because it's what i'm used to I suppose. that's part of it, although could just be. Sorry, to cut you off."
462.0,Provider,"There say that's an interesting perception actually. to notice that there's an common negativity there, and so do you feel connected to people through common negativity rather than sort of positivity."
13123.0,Patient,"I think, so I think so um and she is she can be critical and judgmental. And i'm used to that with my mother so. and I know that she had a difficult time growing up. And she turned her and your outward. Okay, whereas I I turned my inward and that's a very similar very, very similar dynamics again to my mother and me. So it's just yeah it's weird and you know i've noticed patterns and and things like this before, but. So there's this I think probably also what's contributed to my fixating a little bit on her having this infatuation is this kind of push and pull. The pull of the attraction and the push of understanding, all those other things. sounds becomes like an ongoing struggle. exacerbated, of course, by the wellbutrin so."
462.0,Provider,"Okay got it so you know it sounds like you, you know, have a little bit of a like you said infatuation or a crush on her if you will. But that you've thought about it and you don't see it as something worth pursuing or that could be serious and you kind of even see some of the unhealthy aspects of it like you said that pushing that Pole, as well as maybe some of the similarities to your mother and the common negativity. Is that accurate, or do you feel differently."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's accurate. Okay, but also makes it difficult, as a. Although i'm not 100% certain i'm like 99.9% certain that it's mutual. So that makes it hard."
462.0,Provider,"But she's also right, yes, oh okay so then it's. Really really not something that can be pursued and, but do you want to know. Why not let's just normalize this this is kind of a part of life right people meet and work in school and whatever and become attracted to each other, typically just physically that's the start. And then there's little pushing a little poll and that's kind of interesting and kind of fun. And that's just that's Okay, and you can just be appropriate and just let it be there and then eventually you're going to graduate you probably won't see her very often."
13123.0,Patient,"you'll probably never again unless there's a reunion so um well that's not necessarily true but um yeah yeah take your point was I gonna say. Oh yeah that actually brought up one other thing which is that I think. That this is something I have to be careful of and watch out for I think the fact that she is in relationship and it's not a possibility. In a sense, made me feel okay about not being aggressively flirtatious but subtly and you know. Why games and all that kind of stuff. And I guess maybe that's normal too, but I just have to be careful, I mean. I don't know I don't know what i'm saying. it's been fun kind of practice in a way."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that that is good, a fact that you're making eye contact at all is a good thing and noticing oh hey someone else might be. mutually attracted to me right, like you said it can't happen it's not a thing, but you're noticing, and that means you're starting to connect to people, which is something that it seems like was a really big. trigger and difficult thing for you to do."
13123.0,Patient,"that's true. That is true yeah. yeah so that's. So I guess good to think about you know, given the fact that I have felt on the periphery in sort of outside. That it's just a matter of. You know, starting to connect with people."
462.0,Provider,Right.
13123.0,Patient,So I think a lot of that judgment comes from viewing people from the outside.
462.0,Provider,yeah.
13123.0,Patient,sort of like a colder more analytical view of people. So okay yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so. That you know again just normalizing that but then also seeing your progress. As far as just being able to make eye contact with people connecting with people noticing people giving you body language signs, etc, do you feel connected to your own progress."
13123.0,Patient,"I do, I do, to a certain extent I think again that's a back and forth, but I feel like i'm more connected to it than not. So it's just you know habit, I need to continue building until the. Old habits disappear."
462.0,Provider,"yeah no that's great I just I like to ask everyone that because it can be so easy to feel almost more connected to previous ways of being thinking living and even. Being feeling more connected to being like oh I love person with mental illness or oh i'm a person who's not well or however, you may be frame it to yourself."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah and I think that. It did cause me to ruminate a little bit. About you know. missed opportunities friendships everything from the past. So it did it does yeah it does highlight. that to a certain extent. But I think i'm spending more time thinking about the positive and one of the positive of this whole flirtation Is it actually. is, in part, helping to motivate me to do things like eat better get into the gym believe that it's a possibility, in the future of you know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well that's wonderful. So you're not feeling too stuck in that which is just something to note, if you ever feel like you're a part of your identity is having social anxiety right rather than that just being a diagnosis or framework to work with. yeah."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no that's interesting because one thought that did pop up for me again, well, I remembered actually telling my. therapist in the Bay area before I moved down here a few years ago that sometimes I thought that the only thing wrong with me was that I thought there was something wrong with me. And to certain extent that's true you know everything is the result of that anxiety. I don't really have a lot of other roadblocks I don't think so. Anyway, I guess, my point with that was that I don't. I don't yeah I don't see myself as someone who's just mentally mentally ill or."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's good just something to kind of check in on and and and then you know, to think about what wellness looks like for you like really having a an idea of what that looks like and. I think we even talked about last time just kind of thinking about what your ideal life looks like and and that can be in terms of your own wellness mentally physically your your work, your relationships right."
13123.0,Patient,yeah and also remembering that wellness doesn't mean feeling great all the time.
462.0,Provider,Definitely.
13123.0,Patient,"possible. yeah yeah, so I think I am focusing on that more and more. And then I think just going back to that other. comments about. This woman being in a relationship I think my concern was that I was going to again. I was. that this was going to be a pattern of mine that I was going to choose safe flirtations forever, you know. Okay, things that I didn't have to act on, and so they are less. They produce let's face it. Sure yeah. But I don't know that that's true like I said it's just."
462.0,Provider,"something you can take note of and you don't have to get too ahead of yourself right you've just been one thing and you're kind of just. dipping your toe in the water, of being connected to people, whether it be through eye contact flirting noticing their body language. And so you can, as you said, take it as practice as dipping your toe in the water, and just really notice, if it does become a pattern Okay, then let's address it, if not said you don't have to let that be another anxiety."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah and in terms of the wellness I thought again about. The future I don't even know where i'm going to be necessarily so, one of the things I need to start thinking about over this break and probably should start scheduling when to finish these things is to start looking actually at cities and cost of living and opportunities for employment. You know I say don't want to end up in some. You know far out place where there's only you know, two firms and I can't move up or anything like that. And maybe for the first two years i'll stay in the La area, and even though it's expensive and then move move from there, I don't know yet, but yeah so I started started looking at cities, and the reason I brought that up is. to remind myself that I don't need to get so caught up in the relationships, right now, I mean it's like I said it's good if I make one or two friendships that lasts, but even if not I mean i'm going to be kind of hitting the reset button on my life here. Right. So I don't need to get, as you said to have myself in those regards either I can. I can remind myself that I need to kind of wait until I figure out what the next step is going to be before I start kind of build these. Social social structures and. All the rest. Anyway, so break I need to I need to figure out which city, I might want to go to. And you do the research, you know how many firms, they have and the size of the firm's to see if there's opportunity. All the rest."
462.0,Provider,And then i'll say.
13123.0,Patient,I need to. Start reading out answers to job interview questions and get my portfolio.
462.0,Provider,we've done a bit of preparation great yeah.
13123.0,Patient,So I just have to be sure that the break doesn't fly by without any good. Because it seems long yeah next week's can sit by.
462.0,Provider,"it's sure can you're right so maybe you kind of something that can be helpful, is. structuring it in the way that like okay either i'm going to. get to work for the first two weeks, and then I give myself one week to just kind of chill relax do social activities connect with people, and then the last two or I don't even know how just divided it up, but you get the point or start with. And again myself one week, this is chill and then on this date it's go time. Rather than just trying to kind of mix in between the two of having a little vacation and having time to do those preparations that you described."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah I hadn't done that, before I think it's yeah I need to do that, every time I try to tell myself okay you got one day ready to start tomorrow it's just becomes overwhelming. we're just depressing because I haven't I do that break."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. Right so you've got some goals there for work. You know work professional related stuff What would you say you know just to kind of keep your. Treatment plan up to date and going we kind of go through these goals and ideas, every time what would you say are yours for December, as far as kind of obviously those two that you just described, but also some therapeutic emotional stuff one of them is the meetup."
13123.0,Patient,"So i've got the meeting with my friends next Wednesday i'll do at least one meetup event. I do want to get back into a good exercise routine. start that up again i've already got myself some healthier food and has. started, taking care of myself physically in that way. And let's see, let me think about how this time I haven't december's because it's what the ninth today. 1017 so I really have like one week in December after well two weeks one week of the vacation in one week of actually working so."
462.0,Provider,"right man, maybe these goals can be your for your break right December to January or or whatever it is."
13123.0,Patient,"Okay, so and you were saying in terms of wellness first or the mental health."
462.0,Provider,yeah in terms of emotional mental that sort of thing.
13123.0,Patient,yeah Maybe I should make a goal of doing at least one. Like get out of the House social thing per week minimum.
462.0,Provider,"That sounds really good yeah that sounds great, especially now that you're starting to make progress there and feel more connected to people stepping away from the social anxiety, a little bit that could be a really, really good goal and challenge."
13123.0,Patient,"Especially since some of these people, I will. never met before. So there's the once a week. socializing. i'm going to say. In terms of mental health, I need to get back into like the meditation has slipped off a little bit so. i'll get back to my meditation practice and keep doing that morning routine we worked out. Thinking maybe as a way to help myself be more mindful throughout the day. and part of the morning routine was to look at that emotion we'll. Just start trying to label my emotions more often throughout the day."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's that's really good because that's a theme we've been talking about right as far as you kind of watch. movies, and just trying to notice your feelings label them and."
13123.0,Patient,Just be there yeah and I actually bring some question because you know I think it's pretty normal to really only remember the one or two major emotions from the day. Is that true.
462.0,Provider,yeah that's that's okay that's definitely suitable it doesn't have to be any more in depth than that are forced it's good if you can at least come up with yeah like two different emotions that were strong for you throughout the day that would be a really good place to be.
13123.0,Patient,"I only asked, because you know my put pressure on myself to."
462.0,Provider,"yeah no. No definitely don't do that, but if you can say like Okay, I felt this when I was interacting with whoever the woman is in your cohort that's. A big part of the day right or I felt this when I had to do a peer review and the person responded like they weren't happy with me or you know, whatever it is so whatever to kind of big points stick out for you during the day."
13123.0,Patient,"Alright, so i'll do that maybe my goal will be to keep a journal, where I just you know mentioned the one or two major events. And then we have to exercise. that's good in terms of the."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's that should be. I agree, you don't want to go too much. yeah okay so you've got some kind of professional a little bit of social and a little bit of emotional, how do you feel about. That you know those additions to your treatment plan for this month or this this break period that you're going to be having."
13123.0,Patient,"I feel good about that. yeah I was wanting to be careful not to overload myself on the professional or school or stuff too, because I can tend. To get these grand ideas of what i'm going to accomplishing."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so just trying to be really realistic, is a good place to be and schedule that time to let yourself just chill out a bit too. Then you're not just spending the whole break kind of pressuring yourself like Oh, you should be doing this or that like nope today is. Today is the chill day so i'm not going to pressure myself tomorrow is a work day right, you can kind of choose what is the day going to be. you're going to be half and half, so you know, and you can let yourself do one or the other, at the time that you're meant to be doing it, rather than just kind of. Having anxiety about one or the other."
13123.0,Patient,"Right, and I think now that you mentioned that i'm going to make sure I do at least once I get to the the worst part of the break to at least one day, where I just do nothing, or just."
462.0,Provider,Definitely that's great.
13123.0,Patient,I have a tendency to Thomas okay you don't have time to take a weekend.
462.0,Provider,"Now you definitely do and it's very important actually it's kind of like you know it's a little recovery, we all need some recovery."
13123.0,Patient,"Okay, so good about that."
462.0,Provider,"um do you have any plans for the holidays, do you are you going to get together with family, friends anything."
13123.0,Patient,yeah yeah I can't remember if she had contact me if I told you last time that maybe not. That i'm going to go visit my parents from probably the 23rd or 24th.
462.0,Provider,Through.
13123.0,Patient,"The 28th or so. My mother took her maybe like 15 minutes to text me back and say oh and, by the way, I want to put your stuff that's in the garage it's a story so maybe you can stay an extra day to do that. I texted back I said, I think I could do that and fourth day."
462.0,Provider,"It seems like you're really good at setting boundaries with her you mentioned last time, like she'll try to get extra phone calls around birthdays that you just kind of stick to what's good for you so that's that's good that's great."
13123.0,Patient,"yeah yeah she's definitely angling for some more days. And speaking the boundaries last time I spoke with you about is going to be her birthday, and so I called that day and the good news is I have nothing to report really from that phone conversation, because I think i've gotten pretty good at avoiding any personal topics. Which is a good thing."
462.0,Provider,it's good.
13123.0,Patient,yeah nothing. yeah nothing about anxiety or emotions or. Just news.
462.0,Provider,yeah.
13123.0,Patient,"So yeah so to visit them around Christmas time I might actually do either end date early or stay a day or two after to visit my sister and her family and my brother and his family, this time since I didn't really last time. So that'll be good."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've got a you've got a solid plan you kind of know how to navigate these different relationships and that's again that's pretty ideal I know. There is this notion of an ideal holiday where it's just these beautiful family relations and La la and that really just isn't the case so that's why I say it's idea that you know how to navigate these relationships and set your boundaries."
13123.0,Patient,"which actually brings me to tears, which I didn't think about. Definitely, a time I mean obviously now this my age it's not like everyone just going out. crazy a new years but. I still would like to try to find either somewhere in the cohort at least make the effort at least make an effort to find people who are in town to do something with. Great and honestly if I can't I told myself, I might even just go out myself to some event."
462.0,Provider,"that's good yeah I mean there can be it doesn't have to be like partying or can be like fireworks shows, and just different random things so that's a really good idea to try to cohort maybe you meet some people during your meetups beforehand and. You just never know so that's a good idea to be engaged new year, there can be so much like build build up as well just with all the holidays like it needs to be this like crazy cool thing and. So, having a realistic expectation and a plan is a good way to go forward and it sounds like you do if you can't find anything, then your plan is to still just do, or you can't find anyone your plan is to just do something. And that can feel really good yeah."

13123.0,Patient,"No i'm well yeah so I did I do sometimes think of specific methods i'd never come up with an actual plan or details or. anything like that, and one of the interesting things about it is, I think lately it's been more of. I don't know if this is good or scary or has been more of a future oriented thing where it's like if I continue to feel this way. And things don't work out. So it's not like i'm going to do it right now."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're kind of pushing it off yeah that is interesting not sure either if that's good, but it is better than in that moment thinking, I want to go through with this, so you have some. ideation methods come up in your mind, have you started to do anything to progress through what those methods and carry out a plan."
13123.0,Patient,"Now, and this, and they still aren't able to snap out of them within a few minutes a."
462.0,Provider,"few minutes okay alright so that's something to do also just continually work on as far as just reframing those thoughts and referring to that safety plan, if you need to for some support, help coping skills right anything that's it just it's right there, it can give you immediate ideas."

A couple minutes he said, and then, if you could please. In the treatment plan section create December goals and use his his his exact words as much as possible. For his December goals and then. If you hear him or asked talk about how he completed previous goals, could you note next to them like this goal was completed. The Thursday December 9 the date of the session and say like he completed it by picking a meetup or he on Thursday December 9 he reported he attended a meetup or something like that to show when. Thank you, I know it's a little difficult so just if you could do the best you can listening throughout sessions to pick up oh that goal was completed this is the date of the session, this is what he said he did, to complete it, thank you."
