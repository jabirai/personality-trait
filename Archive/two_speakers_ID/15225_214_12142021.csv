214.0,Provider,yeah.
15225.0,Patient,"We should there was. it's not on them. Well, it said in my email that you have been sent the package which usually meant the first cup came just the same way, but if it's not a record that's even more rules."

15225.0,Patient,"Well, I can't have a bad report so."
214.0,Provider,"You know. don't don't don't do that i'll tell you, if I got a screw you because you did something wrong, I will always tell you, Chris we got a problem you know I wouldn't listen this isn't a problem for the course pick that.

214.0,Provider,Six I know you peed in a cup on.
15225.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"The problem that I have is you just tell me you got this weird thing happened this package, are you talking about recently or before this one."
15225.0,Patient,"No like literally last night I went to go get the package because I saw the email from breitbart hope that said oh you received a package so it's like okay drug test I go to the phone and learning is like three pieces of mail. Online in the top envelope the yellow thing was like shield on the inside, like where the bubble wrap is. It was like it was like they sent it to me like that, without the. way I don't know apparently."
214.0,Provider,"No, no, no, listen I, I want to write a. report, but I want to make sure i'm hearing, so you said last night, you had your mail and then there was this bubble wrap. And it looked like. A couple is missing inside yes."
15225.0,Patient,"Yes, there is no white package inside there that contains."
214.0,Provider,And you're saying that happened yesterday on December 12.
15225.0,Patient,What.
214.0,Provider,"i'm going to make a notation in that. Then i'm gonna let Dr packer no to, then you told me there was no cup and now he doesn't write the reports I write reports but I don't want him thinking there's some shenanigans going on we're covering everything was so."
15225.0,Patient,scary so.
214.0,Provider,"No, no, no, listen. i'm gonna. got. never going to be scared i'm going to tell you why because i'll always have to tell you something's not going to go right. This this has nothing to do with you, the reason we got to get in on on we got to get this legit is because it's not about you it's about when they says where's December we gotta say whoa whoa there is no December, because we addressed it there was no concern you know i'm saying. This is, after we address it today, which is kind of good it's one day later so when they say where's the touchscreen to December say with this has already been addressed, we don't know what happened to there'd be no reason for you not to personally Cup. that's my point it does, what does this is easy stuff."
15225.0,Patient,"But you mean on the you don't see that, like, I took the test."
214.0,Provider,"Now I told you, you took the test November 16."

214.0,Provider,"So this is you this is your chart. I just I know it's a little tiny but let's go through it together, I want you to see what I see. So here is. drunk screen. It says sent on 12 nine but here's the problem most most recent mail ship date is 1014 that doesn't make any sense."
15225.0,Patient,whoa. Okay.
214.0,Provider,"And then, it says delivered they mean which one was delivered. And then, if I look over here 1117 was the last one, you did that's correct now when I hit this. October 18 it was delivered. But if we look at this thing. It says 12 nine."
15225.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,So i'm just letting you know that it's not you something's funky it's either. They didn't write it right. But all we need to do is cover ourselves by writing the correct nope.
