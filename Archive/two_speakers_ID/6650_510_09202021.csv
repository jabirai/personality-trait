6650.0,Patient,"he's being more supportive and he's more present and unfortunately I don't know if it's because his games, not very active, right now, because they do like little tournaments and stuff. And i'm wondering like when that starts again he might. Go back to the way he was, but he lately he's been very supportive right now we only have one car so. um you know i'll ask him to like go run errands or whatever. Before you get. And he and he's very you know it's been very supportive he's been on it so. Okay can't complain."

6650.0,Patient,"I actually bought her a gift like a little gift box and she kind of got mad at me she's like don't ever buy you know it's too expensive, no more. Never again cuz she's Egyptian and I mean I kind of read it up already, but they don't really like when you buy them gifts, because then they kind of feel obligated to you know pay it back."
510.0,Provider,huh.
6650.0,Patient,I really wanted to buy or something cuz she's. Just always been there for me.
510.0,Provider,You can always do a really. Nice handwritten formal Thank you letter or something like that I bet that was.
6650.0,Patient,She she doesn't understand English too well.
510.0,Provider,Oh really oh wow okay all right oh that's.
6650.0,Patient,That was tougher to try to do a translation.
510.0,Provider,"Small oh yeah I think your heart and then 10 was in the right spot you're just wanting to relate express the appreciation to her. i'm really glad i'm really glad for that okay well what i'm what are your biggest concerns it sounds like things kind of have stabilized a bit with your mood, which is fantastic. What would you say is your biggest stressor right now for yourself JESSICA."
6650.0,Patient,All right now it's my fiance said we're really worried about him and. I think it's already. part is.
510.0,Provider,"Doing funny yes, and he didn't want to follow nutritional."
6650.0,Patient,"recommendations and not just the nutritional things it's she's not supposed to be going anywhere, and you know in cases hard starts acting funny and we don't want to. You know I can't really keep them home but. What I eat on the street has a heart attack. Know we're not going to know. And he's had situations like that, before. Where. He was under the influence of something, and he went walking and he fell and hit his head and we couldn't find him, he was in the hospital. You know my fiance had to call around to figure out where he was."
510.0,Provider,kindness he doesn't have ID on him or any like information that would identify him.
6650.0,Patient,"So I think at that point, I think, at that point he only had like his insurance card."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, that is scary absolutely."
6650.0,Patient,"And this was like years ago, but like you know it's it's kind of like that again and."
510.0,Provider,feeling like it's bubbling up mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,"Well, he also has a psych about tomorrow and they're really want him, you know not having any substances in the system. And he's going he's I don't know if you heard about the imodium like the effect imodium can have like a opiate effect on people. No Okay, well, we found out the hard way that a medium can do that to people and he had been. He would go as far as to steal it from places and."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, like oh like if you overtake it yeah."
6650.0,Patient,"and The history of doing that, with everything."
510.0,Provider,Oh wow okay.
6650.0,Patient,"he's been going to a friend's House who didn't know that and we've been trying to tell them, but you know. it's been hard because it's a whole nother household and they're not always there. Right, so my fiancee I was finally able to tell him on Saturday, because he was like okay dad's not here, I gotta go get him I know exactly where he is. And he goes over there, to get coffee and his chewing tobacco and imodium."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,"You know, we had a Tom you're not supposed to be on those things because we've got a big sake of Allah and he's not supposed to be taking things."
510.0,Provider,anyways mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,And one because of his heart too because he's. You know abusing substances.
510.0,Provider,And there's a lot of pieces of goodness okay.
6650.0,Patient,So we're worried about him. And he's kind of acting like a petulant child.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,You know.
510.0,Provider,behaviourally acting out mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,"where you can tell him till you're blue in the face, why you're worried about them why you know this is good for you to please just not do these bad things and he's just like well you're just trying to take things I love for me. And you know he's been he'll drink so much coffee. That he'll get diarrhea. He has like. No gallbladder so he's not really supposed to be doing drinking these things anyways. At least, and then the right here during said so he'll go to a friend's house. And then he's supposed to get another kind of met medicine that helps with that, but only when he's going to important places like his Program. So we haven't given it to them, since it's not supposed to be going to those places so he's complaining that he's had to like both bathroom in the bushes on the way home."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,But he's not supposed to be going there. yeah hey.
510.0,Provider,"JESSICA What are his options for this psych about actually let me ask this question first, so the psych about are you are maybe your partner, are you all going to be consulted, to be able to give collateral information about him."
6650.0,Patient,My fiance will be there. i'm. i'm hoping he'll be able to give relevant information because. he's got ADHD and he leaves.
510.0,Provider,"yeah I know I like I really it's, so this is so critical that good collateral information is given because I worry that he's not the most reliable self reporter right he's gonna just oh i'm fine I mean I don't know what to say, but your fiance I just. Really, he is the the layer of hey this is really what we're observing can you write stuff down, could he writes that you two together right some bullet points so he can have that for the appointment oh yeah there's some real very concerning. escalating behavior."
6650.0,Patient,"I think that would be good, because he does well with written. And I do want to make sure that. You know my fiance has access to talking to this doctor, which I do think. That they have very good at communicating with my fiance i'm."
510.0,Provider,Good okay.
6650.0,Patient,"But yeah this is definitely like super super important. Technically. Is that has already been diagnosed with like bipolar and schizophrenia and stuff like that, but. I feel like this is really going to be. Important to our future like what are we do, or we qualified. for keeping him. here."
510.0,Provider,"Is it, I think yeah that's why I want you to bring. Or at least have your fiance bring some documented notes about what you're observing a special around the escalated behaviors around he's really struggling to follow directions. He continues to make very poor choices about his physical and emotional health, even when provided information because you had actually mentioned. Some memory stuff is there possible early signs of dementia, because that really does prompt for further assessment if you really can be managing him. He might not understand the consequences, I don't know it's really hard, I can evaluate him but. In person that's like high itches or that is it a psychiatrist or psychologist do you know. md okay all right well either way he's getting a formal a psych EVAL typically as somebody psychiatrist It can be done by a psychiatric nurse practitioner, but my guess it's an md but. yeah I think that's beyond tomorrow's appointment, the bigger questions are do we have the capacity to manage his behaviors as they continue to start bubbling up. And I don't know i'm questioning it and i'm also questioning there's a young child also another one on the way and. I know you're you're doing all that you can to kind of manage it's a lot his needs are definitely increasing that's for sure. And I don't know what his options are is he under medicaid I think you told me this before, but a."
6650.0,Patient,camera yeah he's got no. medication medicaid and he's you know he's covered he's got he's got all these programs um and I think they've already talked before about even to him about his options of housing like if he wants to. On in when he first started going to the program because he was obviously. Very disgruntled with us.
510.0,Provider,Not having.
6650.0,Patient,To you know change and get off his pain pills and.
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,"he's sober from alcohol and loads of other medications. And you know, he was like obviously weighing us options like do I want to be here. So he yeah he's got he's got options. If he doesn't want to be here, he could move whenever he wants. Family but. I think, because he is. Not. Technically it was right mind they don't want him making that decision by himself."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,"So they're waiting for my fiance and my fiance, as I told you will not do stuff until he absolutely has to."
510.0,Provider,"So yeah I know you don't have control over that but yeah it being as proactive as possible actually is better, but. You know if he's gonna wait for a crisis, I guess, we wait for a crisis that's really unfortunate but maybe maybe through the cycle and additional discussion that might prompt some shifting and your fiance's perspective it's tough, I mean it's tough to witness a parent kind of struggling. I hear you waiting for a crisis is. This really sort of tough."
6650.0,Patient,"yeah I mean he's been good it's been okay so far. I mean. Like I said he's going out and doing his own thing when he's not supposed to magical dragon boat but it's not been like he's been. combative or anything like that. Stopping his feet. acted will be, I think."
510.0,Provider,"I yeah I think he's acting out I bet and this I mean this happens with adults, especially as they're aging and having barriers and struggles. He sort of wants things his way, but I know you all are are trying to set those limits, and it seems like some days are probably better than others, but yeah this is definitely a pivotal assessment that he is getting for sure."
6650.0,Patient,"hey you know other than that, I think I think everything's been good we've been. I don't know everything feels a lot smoother than it has been. Other than the one thing. My mom actually finally called me. Like she wasn't talking to me for a while."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6650.0,Patient,But you know I feel like things are getting a little bit better.
510.0,Provider,"Oh good, well, I love last week, when you shared a reflection of i'm actually enjoying this pregnancy and you're able to really compare and contrast and. I thought that was just that made my heart happy for you, because I think the first one, I think you realize just how difficult and and traumatic it was and all the chaos that you were going through. So that's good JESSICA remind me did I ever give you the PSI resource for pregnant pregnancy."
6650.0,Patient,"I think I did because I link I did, too, I guess, I just i'm i'm just wanting to double check my basis, I was trying to find my notes right before I logged in."
510.0,Provider,"And I couldn't immediately access them i'm pretty sure I gave them to you, but I just okay all right, I just you know why i'm always."
6650.0,Patient,"Free going on the website and I definitely need to call back, but."
510.0,Provider,"yeah, then you did okay good yeah there's I have two of you that I know I gave them to, and I know the one because it was just more recent but okay good I just I wanted to give you any additional resources. Before our last session and actually i'm thinking of another one, have you ever heard of nami, the National Alliance on mental illness in thinking. It could potentially be I know you have a lot going on, but let me put the name in the chat this is such a great national organization and part of it. As i'm wondering if it would be helpful for your fiance so their whole mission and they were created because of severe mentally ill, you know. People and parents and caregivers just trying to figure out how do we navigate, how do we get support. nami is great, because every state has nami but within the state there's certain chapters and regional chapters. And they do a lot of free programming and education around mental health and i'm just thinking it could be another avenue of support and resources, I mean he I know your fiance's father, I have."
6650.0,Patient,To create it.
510.0,Provider,And I just wanted to be aware of that resource.
6650.0,Patient,I think. My finances uncle actually did recommend a program for. caregivers or family members of people who are you know addicts.
510.0,Provider,"exactly they do a lot of those programming so it's sort of like that I have you ever heard of a and the Allen and Allen on does support groups for people. who have a family members spouse girlfriend whatever who have an addiction and it focused on the caregivers or partners, the spouses, etc. Now me does a lot of that too, and I just you're living with someone who has mental illness and. I, and I was saying, your fiance is in denial, but again part of that learning and navigating and be able to advocate for someone who has mental illness. Understanding the questions to be asking and how to advocate within these systems nami does a great job now, obviously I can't guarantee your experience but. You could certainly go on to me not org or and you would just put in your zip code and and to see what is your local chapter. It just might be an option if you think your fiance might respond to something like that I don't know I just. want you to be aware there's. yeah okay."
6650.0,Patient,yeah I do it's super it's nami.org.
510.0,Provider,"yeah okay and. They just they get a lot of federal funding and they get local funding, I mean they just everything's for free, and I know i've had a couple of clients, not in this job, but another job. That their region actually had nami points of contact that actually sort of acted like advocates and they would often go to meetings on behalf of the family or with the family and. I just again every region and every chapter is slightly different and but some definitely have more resources and programming so might be something to consider because I. I know what you're talking about you're trying you're looking at big picture and just. You know, he as mentally ill you're doing the best you can you can't control him right, you can set the guidelines and limits, but if he continues to escalate you got to be aware of Okay, what are our options here, and I think that's definitely important to be aware of that yeah okay."
6650.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"you're doing a really good job I mean I like I said it makes my heart happy that things have sort of stabilized in the last couple weeks since. I think we had that one session you're really struggling and Avi I think your answer was i'm going to restart my meds and that didn't go well, but now, things are a lot better which i'm really pleased to hear JESSICA that's a good thing that's a really good thing. yeah well um I will see you tomorrow and crew and. Then our last session I can't remember if it was on Oh, I think it was on a Wednesday. yeah Yes it oh so i'll see you group twice before our last session at 4pm on Wednesday perfect."
6650.0,Patient,be the news boy or girl.
510.0,Provider,"I know I was so excited that i'll be able to know that, before I leave, so thank you for including me and cheering that because I know that's personal but I appreciate that i'm excited for you. All right, you have a good rest of your evening be well be safe okay JESSICA."
6650.0,Patient,You too okay.
510.0,Provider,"Okay bye. session my desk and rick is over, she has a final session scheduled for next week zoom room closed."
