4819.0,Patient,"a pretty good does anything we're. Not when we. have a saying that when we're out there, he took off a lot back to look at properties or whatever what he did."
226.0,Provider,But he.
4819.0,Patient,I think he took off and I don't know strict clever water. Thinking you know asked him he's never going to tell me. But. I don't know. I can't say because the lies and says all nice things and it's really nice and I can't I don't know what to believe.
226.0,Provider,So do you feel like he has a history of doing that.
4819.0,Patient,He did with his ex. I know that he did with me when we first started going out. on me.
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4819.0,Patient,"yeah he's he did before and I busted him with some pictures on his phone and they weren't like you know, like. Internet textures or anything he tried to say that they were actually pictures."
226.0,Provider,stripper.
4819.0,Patient,know somebody that he knew.
226.0,Provider,That. They were. They were sending pictures of them.
4819.0,Patient,"And then he has this woman that he was saying before one of the women that he was cheating, is why. I know that we are going someplace I think this California we're camping or something, this is a couple years back in. Right, as we were leaving she called me he ran out of the House. was like and I followed him and. i'm like what's going on and he's like he's talking to her and like Why would you run out of the House why won't you just down here, which I could just reacted on that's not just reacting. And I guess she was when she knows were married and it wasn't the first time she's done that, and called. And she's always trying to set him up with him. With her friend in him. And so I don't know I don't know. But we're getting along and now we're waiting long but that's just in the back of my mind, all this mean."
226.0,Provider,If he's like cheating on you know that's in the back your mind.
4819.0,Patient,Yes.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I think that's been I mean you brought that up before to. Well, I mean now, what is your gut say what's your what's your intuition says."
4819.0,Patient,"It says he is but he's you know. But without proof. It solid proof. And then he swears up and down and. promises, and I mean you can ask them 100 times 100 different ways."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
4819.0,Patient,"it's never going to change. Unless he's caught red handed. I don't I can't wrap my head around things like that, because most guys wouldn't say they are. they'll just keep it going, and they will swear up and down and they will. You know they'll. they'll just keep. Having their alibi or whatever say where they got to go someplace. All night."
226.0,Provider,"So. Do you feel like this is an ongoing thing or do you feel like this happens in when. His stress level gets really high or when he has to be in situations that he doesn't want to be, and do you notice a pattern."
4819.0,Patient,"I think it's along with is. That weird bipolar thing he has. But at this point, I think he's latched on to something."
226.0,Provider,he's.
4819.0,Patient,is more consistent.
226.0,Provider,Who do you think there's no consistency going on.
4819.0,Patient,"And in Florida. I had a feeling that he had. Either met somebody out there. Somebody flew out there, you know just to be with him and hang out someplace else."
226.0,Provider,Really what's the disappearing in Florida law.
4819.0,Patient,he's gone every day.
226.0,Provider,All day fairly fairly yeah.
4819.0,Patient,With my son. and his family.
226.0,Provider,"wow. So Okay, so now that you guys have been back in in new Mexico, do you feel like it's somebody there, do you feel like it's somebody in another State I."
4819.0,Patient,"know I feel like it's somebody here. do think reason is is because, when we were seeing each other, he wasn't divorced. He was living and it was getting divorced, and he had moved into is a camper or whatever. And I was in California and he came out he flew out to see me. And he always wanted to coordinate things to where if he was going someplace I would go out to see him. So I mean I know he's capable of doing something like that."
226.0,Provider,How long did you guys see each other before he back doors.
4819.0,Patient,play a year.
226.0,Provider,So it was the divorce in process or was he still contemplating divorce.
4819.0,Patient,I think he was still contemplating divorce actually yeah he was still contemplating divorce. They weren't in living in the same bedroom.
226.0,Provider,"So, like basically the marriage relationship was over."
4819.0,Patient,yeah. I tried to back out of our relationship so many times. My fault.
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's a hard situation because. You know it's like your gut instinct is telling you something's going on, and then the person you're asking is telling me now with me, which makes you feel crazy and all the telltale signs are there. But it's you know. being hidden. Well it's kind of a master at this, you know."
4819.0,Patient,"I don't know he's so he's very intelligent. yeah and there's so many avenues to where you can hide things. He manages money and then, of course. The company. And he is extremely intelligent. And we're not very we're social with each other, compatible but we're not compassionate at all yeah. yeah and. We you know we don't have any sex or anything, right now, because the way I feel in fact i'm not even able to. have an orgasm or anything. I don't have a lot of sensation and a lot of areas in my body, because of what's going on. yeah including going to the bathroom I don't have that sensation. And, but that doesn't stop me, you know everything is fine, without that he uses it as an excuse yeah. But he takes testosterone and he does all this other stuff. But I think it's basically an excuse. So I can only imagine what he. That how, when we got together how true what he was telling me. You know it's I know it's like I deserve this completely. And I do but. It doesn't mean you have to stay with it."
226.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. yeah I mean I think it's it's really about now like what you want to do you know if you want to stay, then you know you make it. Work or you're not going to be affected by his infidelity. You know if you go. You know you just want to make sure you have a plan. So the then, what does that look like and how financially, what does it look like, and you know insurance wise and health wise and all of that stuff."
4819.0,Patient,I think yeah that's not making any decisions with that right now.
226.0,Provider,"Until yeah I agree and that's a i'm a wise decision yeah I think you're I think your main focus should be your health. Like physical, mental and emotional health and like that's that's your job, every day, is it just you know get your body and everything, where you want it to be can take some time."
4819.0,Patient,yeah I think i'm stressing over my physical health right no more than I could you didn't stress over what he's doing.
226.0,Provider,"yeah right I. I probably agree with that definitely. So you know let's prioritize your physical health like what's The next step you're obviously going to the doctor. Today, but what are some other things that you're going to focus on to you know work on your physical. Health and how you feel."
4819.0,Patient,"i'm going to quit smoking. not immediately that I am. And I do soon as I can, I want to start. Lifting you know lifting weights again and. Getting some exercise, I was walking before. I go to the mall or whatever and walk. But right now i'm just like beat down I can't do anything really."
226.0,Provider,I would about like and but the parasites and all that help what's going on with that with the detox when you're going to do something like that.
4819.0,Patient,"They need to do something about it, I keep i'm freaking out about that because it's like i've looked at it, you know. that's what i'm thinking is affecting my health and i'm talking with ELISE. Because it's not it's not any of my medicine i'm doing I can take. laxative a lot of laxatives and go and then be blocked up and take more laxative and not be able to go. yeah, this is not, this is something else, and then. The pain that I have on my. On my right side on my left side any given time. The different pains my leg swelling. The bladder infections that i've been having. Still, so this is what they call it i've been doing a lot of reading and that's. It 10 points directly to parasitic. Actually worm called. I have it on my phone but. skits oh miss or something like that it's. um. And i'm gonna I want to say that again to her today i'm going to demand some more tests. Because it's getting worse i'm getting lesions on my face that are opening up by themselves. And i'm getting long lines. From like here all the way down. and What in the world can that be. I read a lot about it, and there is no reason why they should not test me anymore. They have to because that's deadly. And I think at this point it's elevated to where it would be. See be very easy. The last test, I read it, it said on the blood test it was everything but 1% what was that 1% they didn't tell me what the 1% was."
226.0,Provider,"So they're saying you don't have it through that test the test is saying you don't have parasites, but there's that 1% that you might."
4819.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,and resist yeah it was primarily.
4819.0,Patient,"Eight months ago. And that was on yeah That was a little one that they did right here. Not near it no yeah it wasn't in the area they didn't went here and they did one here, but not in the areas of where the lines are."
226.0,Provider,yeah so. Is this the dermatologist for your primary.
4819.0,Patient,"When was the dermatologist actually both were dermatologist here dermatologist right here, they said it was a cancer and then. The last time I talked to the dermatologist I think I told you, I had to stand up and I said she kept referring to your nose looks better your nose looks better it's like no. it's now it's cracking and it's opening and it's cracking it it's opening and then I put this stuff on it, and I see all these elevated lines underneath. and You know, it highlights the lines underneath. yeah and i'm getting a. Little disk charges and i'm like. I said I say you do know that the testing for. What is it. and sleep a lot, I was coughing a lot and. Whatever the test for cancer, the worms cast off the same thing. yeah and I, but I use same language with her, and I said you do know. that the results come back for parasites and she said yes, I do. And I said, because this this parts not getting better on my chin this none of this is getting better. And she said yes, I do i'll refer, do you want me to refer you to. unam. For the disease thing, and I said. Well yeah this is going to be the second time first time they never called me. And then, well, she said that disease thing then Dr the one doctor. i'm not remembering anything now because i'm really upset i'm sorry. But the doctor at to Chris this they referred me to him again and I said no. And he just told me have a whole bunch of blood clots and I need to get them taken care of well what happened, out of that that's exactly what the parasite does with chance into your vein creates a blood clot and it grows. And nothing happened out of that so I said you and then nobody called again, so I called them and then they said no, you have to have your doctor do the tests and we need the tests and the doctor, saying they need to do the test and they're going back and forth again. yeah I was. So, like there was an outer space."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so i'm not sure that any kind of primary is going to be able to really know what to do with parasites, I could be wrong."
4819.0,Patient,They don't.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so what I would do is I would on your own start researching what you need to do and. You know, go to like a colon therapist that knows how to that really knows what's going on with parasites. would be. My suggestion to you because I think you're going to continue to get their run around because they don't know what to do with parasites, they don't know how to treat parasites it's not really a part of their. pets I don't know like what are they going to do, like giving more medication medication is not going to get rid of. parasites, you need to do a cleansing yeah."
4819.0,Patient,And there's many I.
226.0,Provider,am already.
4819.0,Patient,I think my bladder is already affected. i've already got damaged and my bladder with that cystinosis. yeah and I think it's free the parasites i've never had that before in their life.
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so when you think about you know parasites are in the intestines right so they're in that lower area, so the fact that your bladder is being affected does not surprise me. So if they have kind of moved up around you know the pace area is you have been dealing with that for a while, so if you are actually seen you know the lines. You know that's that's most likely something you know going on there because they're kind of moving around. So you're you, you might be well served to take this into your own hands and do some research make some phone calls and figure out it's like. My. understanding is that you know, there are many ways to address parasites. And, and there are many, there are many treatments out there that work really well and that you're not going to go to a doctor's office to want it. You don't have to do it a little bit more like natural perfectly homeopathic Lee. colon therapy herbs herbs that get rid of parasites. Specifically herbs like. The parasites and then also what's really, really important, from what I know about this you've got changed her diet, because if you don't change your diet than the parasites can still live, and we all have parasites, which is do. You know, but. You know, with candida our diet. Our environment they can get out of control and that's just what what has happened. For you, and it's fixable."
4819.0,Patient,But.
226.0,Provider,"You know and. You want to you want to do as much research, as you can on how to get. rid of these things, and what what's the, what are the best herbs to take to address it."
4819.0,Patient,killer when I read the garlic oil.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. I would research that the one parasite that you think that you have I would look to see like. Okay, what do I need to do like what do I need to stop eating. What do I need to start eating. And like start addressing it like today, like just making some small adjustments and see how you feel."
4819.0,Patient,Because I like nauseous a lot now.
226.0,Provider,"And you know parasites thrive in a certain environment so it's like if you don't have the like when you go to the bathroom like when you sit on the toilet to go to the bathroom and you can't go. Or if you've lost a sensation to be able to do that, that I have heard that that is directly related to a parasite. Because they're feeding the believe it yeah because they're feeding off of that fecal matter so if if. You know they they know what's going to happen, like that's going to be eliminated they're not gonna you know they're going to fight against it."
4819.0,Patient,Carry my sister tried calling.
226.0,Provider,yeah so they're. You know they're they're not they're smart you know they were just.
4819.0,Patient,"yeah they're there as far as. wherever they are, and wherever I have them. it's no. No, I know they. They create their environment they don't want to be discovered."
226.0,Provider,"So they adapt to our body, where they know that they know when we sleep they know when we get up you know and we eat they know what we eat, you know it's like that's how they they've adapted it's how they price within the body."
4819.0,Patient,Oh yeah cuz I can see the lines. And a lot more at night. yeah it in the morning.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
4819.0,Patient,it's like I see him and it's like all I want to do is just go to sleep. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah so I know it's this is really frustrating, but I just encourage you to do your own research on this like I think that's the best way to go and and make some of those phone calls that we've talked about in the past, like a colon therapist you know. Maybe a natural pathak doctor."
4819.0,Patient,"i'll talk to a colon therapist today. i'm gonna write that down i'm going to talk to my doctor today I have that MRI we're going to review for the accident, the one positive thing is that MRI is of my head and they can see the other side of my head, which is my. and We can also get another MRI and see the movement and see and I can tell them look see these things are moving and. Yes, I do and. suit them."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
4819.0,Patient,A lot of my pain to. My pain is from them. Because I was telling you even after I go to the restroom I I feel better.
226.0,Provider,A lot better. it's not exactly yeah.
4819.0,Patient,Before do that.
226.0,Provider,"Okay. So let's let's reschedule in a couple weeks, then, are you are you going to be in Santa fe for the holidays."
