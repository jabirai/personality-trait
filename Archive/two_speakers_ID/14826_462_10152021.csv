ID,Role,Message
462.0,Provider,How are you.
14826.0,Patient,"i'm not great, but it's the usual amount of not great."
462.0,Provider,Right now what's what's going on with you.
14826.0,Patient,"it's like kind of a lot of small things at once, or I guess, not all of them are like small things, but like. I see just been like going through. Like really intense depression and so like. LUSA nations and psychosis. And like having problems with. This. Just just kind of everything or two there's not anything that's not."
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so i'm kind of aware, I talked to tanya about your assessment that you had. A little bit to Dr pachter and. You know just kind of the consensus that we came to as a treatment team is that we, we have to refer you to a higher level of care because there's just so much going on that needs to be treated and in order to treat some of these things, there has to be some level of detox from alcohol. You know, to even get to the psychosis to then even possibly get to the eating disorder and telemedicine, is just ultimately not appropriate for that you know, of course, we want to support you, but it's just not an appropriate level of care, what are your thoughts on that."
14826.0,Patient,um what What do you mean by higher level of care.
462.0,Provider,It would mean likely something in person or in patient.
14826.0,Patient,"yeah. I feel like that makes sense, but it would make things hard in a lot of other ways. But I think like I would be like willing to. Do it is like my. Insurance will cover it is I just I just can't like paid for it otherwise."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
14826.0,Patient,What i'll do is.
462.0,Provider,"i'll contact a case manager and i'll try to get some referrals for you, so that can be a start is finding out where you could go. That is again like you said covered by insurance so that could be a start to that you said that it would be hard and a lot of other ways so maybe we can talk about that a little bit what. What are some other barriers that would be there for you and going to information person or Inpatient treatment."
14826.0,Patient,"i'm all for like impatient, in particular, I like have been hospitalized before, and it was like terrible and like. made me worse off when I came out and. They can only keep me for a few like I don't know. what it was like a like. A few days, because, like I have medical and they won't cover like a hospital stay for more than that. and i'm. I just like really don't want to do it again. it's like."
462.0,Provider,"When was that, like a. hospitalization or what what are you talking here about experience."
14826.0,Patient,yeah is a 51.
462.0,Provider,yeah and that can be really challenging and and traumatic as you described it would certainly be different checking yourself into an Inpatient facility versus a at a hospital like that.
14826.0,Patient,"Right, but I don't I don't think that my insurance would cover me checking myself in."
462.0,Provider,Okay that's something that I will look into.
14826.0,Patient,"Like I tried to look into like. You know those like really hoity toity like yoga retreat to increase it back like this, and I was like kind of do that at one point but it's just like. I would like call them and i'd be like hey. Do you take like this, insurance and they'd be like no and then i'd be like how much Okay, how much like what's the range of like how much it is made to like a. ridiculous amount that I knew I couldn't afford i'd be like Okay, they would keep calling me to check in and i'd be like I can't do this."
462.0,Provider,"it's not happening. yeah. yeah so obviously I wouldn't give you a referral like that, where it's some type of place that's thousands of dollars to check into, so I will talk to. Again, the case manager and see what options, there are. Also, possibly, you know with a referral and us saying that this is like medically necessary that could be helpful to so like I said I don't have referrals right now I can't say exactly but. it's you know we can't treat the psychosis symptoms you're experiencing without some type of detox from alcohol, so that would be the first step to be able to do that, and then, if you were. able to get medicated and not have the hallucination then that's when eating disorder treatment could come in and really start to get to the root of some of this rather than. You know just trying to kind of. cope with it day to day if that makes sense."
14826.0,Patient,yeah also like another one of the hurdles that i've been thinking about lately is that i'm just like i'm pretty. Pretty terribly ago.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14826.0,Patient,"So um yeah. It looks like scares the shit out of me. Even not like already like i've been hospitalized and I know it didn't go well, but i'm like okay like logically, logically, I know that it's like the right decision but, like my brain is like. No, I can't I can't go outside I can't be around. Other people. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Right, so the thought of. going to somewhere in patient scares you because you're a gora phobic."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah, and that is a barrier that's something that. could be worked through you know, potentially, with a counselor to try to at least just get from point A to Point B and then maybe. Once you get to Point B. you'd have that support from a therapist and it in a team. with you in person."
14826.0,Patient,it's very annoying to have multiple things at once.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and that's a valid feeling. And it's hard you know, like I said, because to treat one thing, like the other has to be taken care of first. So yeah you're you're not wrong it's it's a tough situation you certainly are resilient and have been through a lot and you're showing up here today, you know, because you obviously to some degree, want help and support. So that's a really good first step."
14826.0,Patient,"My. yeah i'm. Just i'm definitely resistant to like doing and patient or switching again is like i've had like. All right, like they're there since he was switch so often. I see what. comes up yeah."
462.0,Provider,"It can feel hard to. feel like you're making any progress when it's a constant switch and. It is hard to open up each time to someone new, so I do acknowledge that. So things are a little bit tough right now, you know you've been obviously thinking about it a little bit what are some of the things that just kind of in the moment today, you can do to keep yourself go in, maybe. You know, get the day going a little bit anything like that."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah um well, one of the things that I was talking to tanya about is like I really struggled to sleep at night. Like constant nightmares and like sleep paralysis. being too like I don't usually get a lot of sleep at nighttime I also have like chronic I problems that make me really sensitive to eight so i'm usually like I stay awake at night, and like that's when I get everything done. And so, probably after this i'm going to just like take a nap."
462.0,Provider,a really good plan.
14826.0,Patient,A good idea.
462.0,Provider,yeah sounds like a good plan get some rest.
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,When i'm having enough sleep makes a big difference in how you feel.
14826.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I I think I get enough sleep I just don't like I don't have a normal sleep schedule. They don't. Usually sleep. Like will usually take a pretty long nap during the day, like visually first thing in the morning, when I can like see like outside. um I I took a walk this morning, just because I was trying to keep myself awake for the appointment. My like was coming back to my house and my cat like met me down the street and around the corner and led me back to my house, like us, like leading me, and that was that was a cool thing from today."
462.0,Provider,Thank you.
14826.0,Patient,yeah like like like walking it like in front of me when I go for a walk like a dog.
462.0,Provider,"that's pretty awesome I died, but a cat."
14826.0,Patient,yeah keeps keeps me going.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, since that's kind of a nice little diet and just something comforting."
14826.0,Patient,She definitely like gives me these like tiny versus like wanting to live every day.
462.0,Provider,that's hey then take what you can get and follow that So if you enjoy your little catwalks and make sure you're trying to get that in every morning or whenever.
14826.0,Patient,"I think you're not been a good plan. I think, other than that, like yeah probably just going to like. Taking up so that I am not terribly exhausted and. Then. hang out with my housemate. A little bit when he's awake. And I. Maybe call someone is openly sharing the call friends, a lot more, because most of them don't want to hear."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. that's good keep getting that social interaction and connection, and so you know you're doing a really good job, taking care of yourself, given the circumstances right just trying to do what you can to stay afloat and keep going. Getting your sleep, despite it being kind of an odd schedule getting a walk in connecting with the cat trying to connect with friends. And that can keep you going, but again, ultimately, there needs to be some deeper level of care here to. To move past just that kind of treading water trying to stay afloat."
14826.0,Patient,"Think, I think this. will be then that. This. I don't know I feel very like. almost like almost like unhinged but like not in a bad way, just like. well. I don't want the like energy after dealing with all the ship to. mask or. Like. pretend. anymore so. Just kind of insane like two people."
462.0,Provider,yeah not a bad place to be to just authentically express where you're at.
14826.0,Patient,"yeah it's weird because i'm like really used to like a. Like i've gone to therapy for like a decade now, and like I used to be one of those people who is like like they would be like, how are you and i'd be like fine, how are you. yeah. And then, just like hit this age, where I was like oh that's actually not that helpful at all."
462.0,Provider,that's the lie.
14826.0,Patient,"And I didn't I I believed it like I thought I was telling the truth, I was, I thought, just like everyone felt like this, all the time. So I was like i'm fine, this is just like the usual like i'm at the normal level. And here comes to that. But i'm. realizing now that when people ask you how you are sometimes they actually want to know."
462.0,Provider,honesty and vulnerability and go a long way. How about your suicidal ideation where how's that been.
14826.0,Patient,"With you know, like, I was feeling with like. How I felt like. A little while ago I just it's a daily thing but it's pretty casual sound like I have a plan or anything it's just. Definitely crosses my mind regularly every day."
462.0,Provider,"Some of our time, are there still pretty regularly. But you don't have a method or plan that you intend on carrying out."
14826.0,Patient,"No, I know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you've got some things to just kind of get through today, it sounds like you've got your routine that works for you getting your sleep when you need it and connecting with your housemaid or. friends on the phone. Do you have any plan for a meal today."
14826.0,Patient,"Oh. I don't have a plan i've been like having a really hard time with that all of a sudden. Like it's not like a like. want to extend myself or anything but it's more so just apparent away about. Like I. i've been having this like reoccurring nightmare that I just start pulling like long hairs out of my fruit. And like. I guess, I read something a really long time ago that you're not supposed to pull a string and have like an animal's mouth, because it might be like wrapped around one of their organs or something. And i've been having this nightmare that I like I have a really long hair and I start pulling it out, and I have to do it really slowly, and then I pulled the hair out and images bundles and bundles of hair coming out of my theory. And they're like wrapped around like an Oregon or something. And so it like hurts and really visceral and i've been really struggling with eating food or drinking water, because i'm like afraid that there will be a hair in it."
462.0,Provider,that's pretty terrifying.
14826.0,Patient,yeah it's awful and. doesn't like it doesn't make any sense but i'm still just like I can't eat anything yeah.
462.0,Provider,Is there any food that feels safe for you to eat.
14826.0,Patient,"um it's like completely like contained in packaged and no one else has touched it before I Okay, but assuming I think it's fine like I might need to go and I like i've been having trouble drinking water, because I don't like you trust any of the cups. So i've been drinking like. one likes. of interesting like cans of lacroix or. A water bottle or something."
462.0,Provider,"Okay well that might be a start for today to make sure you get a water bottle and some type of a packaged food, so that you at least have the basic. kind of. Give me her but."
14826.0,Patient,I have like little. packets of apple sauce that I usually go to and i'm in like this sort of cycle happens regularly it's like. The cycles in and out. So I have my one of my friends bought me the little like kid like squeezy packets of applesauce.
462.0,Provider,Oh yeah yep.
14826.0,Patient,And usually I can eat those totally fine like nothing really bad and then I have like. The the tubes of like ritz crackers.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14826.0,Patient,And when I went for a walk today I stopped with the corner store and bought like a big bottle of. Like. Water and. a bottle of imperial in case I like certain a noxious and. yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that's a good start, you know you are really doing well, considering the circumstances and considering everything you're up against right now. And it could be again just getting to that next level of care that could kind of launch you off to be able to get beyond some of again just that treading water of having to get water bottles and. You know all of those things that you're doing to. stay afloat, as I described before."
14826.0,Patient,"I think there's also like a little bit of a hurdle of like I don't I don't have a way to consistently get to impersonal appointments. mm hmm. And so, like that would lead someone to be like Okay, so you need to do invasion and i'm. And then, it leads to it, the other problem is."
462.0,Provider,"OK i'll note also that you don't have like consistent transportation. So i'll talk to the case manager and try to find something that could be. Close for. Inpatient again where you're not driving back and forth or trying to commute on a bus or something right. If you're in oakland park or anything. So i'll i'll make sure to get in touch with the case manager and try to get those referrals as soon as possible. What we'll do is contact you with them, and you can kind of take a look and determine which you think would be the best option."
14826.0,Patient,sounds good.
462.0,Provider,And as for today is there anything else that I could support you with or any questions or something you'd like to share. process.
14826.0,Patient,"or I. mean there's a lot of things to process, but it does, like my. Brain is like. spinning, all of them up. Right I don't really know like which on is like took us. and there's like I have this friend. I started talking to again. Who. was like. Pretty like. Like. manipulated and like hurt me really badly. But i'm. Like. abusive. and Like. contacted me after you and."
462.0,Provider,Talk to her a.
14826.0,Patient,"few months to apologize to me. and apologize like really specifically. and he's he's been really like supportive lately. And what. we've been like laughing together and like. he's like changed a lot I, I think. And then confusing. Because i'm like. I feel like really. Is distrustful of other people. and It. is just one I don't know it's like it's like the latest like sprinkle on top of everything else that's wrong. it's not even it's not even that it's great like I reunited with a friend who has changed, and like apologize like that would be a good."
462.0,Provider,"That can still be. triggering of some old feelings and trauma that might be there, as you said, you have a tough time kind of opening up and trusting people so."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,This person betrayed your trust in the past and you're. Still could be reactive to that.
14826.0,Patient,"But it's also like i'll just like I can't I don't even process any of those thoughts logically to myself, like I just like i'll be like. hanging out with a friend having a good time wanted day it's like it like goes directly to that like it doesn't I don't go through like the the toxin between and I. Think it's been happening, and the reason why it happens to me multiple times a day is because, like I don't like know what thoughts are in between ago like walk out of my room and i'll be like. One today and say there's. I don't know what comes between that. Like I don't I don't have any like. idea of like what is between the like start and the finish."
462.0,Provider,Right like you feel like it's zero and then all of a sudden.
14826.0,Patient,"Great and even if i'm having a good time and I feel happy I get just like this is so good, I want to die, they did just go straight to that every time. It makes it makes sense to me i've been prescribed lithium multiple times because, like like. I don't know I guess like people say that it helps specifically with suicidal ideation it just makes you not like, even if you're still depressed like I guess people have that thought."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it seems like you know that's a really tough place to be where you're happy and then the next moment you're like said, want to die and that's where. Just that that medication can really come in and and start to create changes get you to a baseline. Where, then you can implement more into your life, as well as far as behavioral techniques, but it's it's tough to do that when you are kind of right in the middle of an eating disorder having active. hallucinations and drinking."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,So there could definitely be room for that to feel better and to feel like you have a little bit more control over. Where you're at zero to 100 and not have it just kind of. shoot between the two. But it would again take some probably a little bit more care. Do you practice any type of. mindfulness or anything like that to try to just remain as in the present moment as possible for as about really challenging.
14826.0,Patient,or. is far from the present moment as it came to me.
462.0,Provider,"Okay that's fair. Yes, well Hello kitty friend."
14826.0,Patient,"um but yeah I like. I think, like, for us, have tried like different types of Vedic meditation. For for co morbid reasons it's. difficult to actually. Be in my body like types of meditation that maybe focus on like your physical body or are really hard for me so like. us like the closest thing to a patient, I can say that I do is like. This list like daydream. and listening to music."
462.0,Provider,or just not good.
14826.0,Patient,"or not necessarily. always good, just like. i'll just like listening to music and i'll just like think through things and like recount the day i'm like what's going on the moment. That doesn't have to do with my body."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's that's a coping skill so make sure you're still engaging in that, but like you said. You really can't even get to the point of being able to do some of these behavioral and mental health coping skills and practices, without getting to a certain baseline so yeah it can be almost too scary to try to be in the present moment in your body like you said."
14826.0,Patient,"I like yeah I. OK, I take a walk like every day it's like my eyes aren't to inflame to go outside when it's like break."
462.0,Provider,into.
14826.0,Patient,"I like. Oh. This for the for the purpose of like. You know, literally just for the purpose, even of forcing myself to go outside like and i'm terrified of it regularly."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
14826.0,Patient,"easily just like notice every time I get scared ago, just like notice it and then all I keep wanting."
462.0,Provider,Right. yeah kind of in a bind really with. The covering. symptoms and. So. makes it tough for you to be able to kind of thrive and live and feel good day to day.
14826.0,Patient,"yeah. Like. I know i've had like a public problems similar to this for like. A decade over a decade now, and i've been like. Oh, like i'm going to therapy, but again, like, I told you, I wasn't like answering like. As honestly, as I thought I was. I just keep thinking about myself back then like whether or not I would have. Ever even conceptualize getting this much work. it's come it's come so far I don't even. Sometimes i'll just be sitting i'll be like I can't believe that like i'm this person."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it can be hard to grasp the reality of where things are at you know. But it seems like you do have a good awareness of everything that's going on, and you can see that there's a need for treatment again and you're here today, you. Get registered in our Program. And you're open to the idea of a higher level of care that could really kind of launch you into. A more kind of quick moving recovery, rather than Tele health which again just isn't isn't appropriate to treat everything going on, so you've got a good awareness and sometimes that awareness is a start it's scary like you said to be in the present moment in your body but. You can look back to the past and see kind of where you've come and that you need help and there's kind of a specific kind of help that needs to be had given the Co occurring. symptoms. Oh."
14826.0,Patient,And it just kind of just sucks.
462.0,Provider,"that's like if that's a fair assessment. It is well it's valid, we can say it, and I support that statement, it does it's hard it's really hard. And then, what day is your groupon i'm going to take a look about group."
14826.0,Patient,"um it's it's on Tuesdays. I haven't I haven't been there, or I didn't go like the past week but yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Do you think you could try to make it there, this Tuesday."
14826.0,Patient,um I I don't particularly want to go to to a group.
462.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah well. yeah that's that's part of the program too, but since we are going to be referring you out what i'll do is i'll make sure to get these referrals or be in contact with the case manager today, so that we can get them as quickly as possible and discharge from our program to the next. Does the group give you anxiety or."
14826.0,Patient,"um I just. I don't really feel supported by random people like i'm I like. Like. Not only do I have like attention span problems so it's like difficult to listen to multiple people like talk. For a long time, I also just like an incredibly anti social like i'm autistic a don't really feel supported by. Like random people like if people give me support in the group it's like we'll get through this like it it's it gets better and i'm just like thank you, but like it feels like those words don't actually mean anything like um I just I don't. And I don't even know like what I just like I told my mom I was in a group, and she was like you. In our in a group. And I was like yeah it's just not like a way that I like feel so i've been in like several different groups throughout my life and it's never been helpful. And like it kind of feels like a waste of time because basically just do what I do with my psychiatrists. And I am i'm sure it's helpful for a lot of people, especially if they don't have any sort of support system at all and that's great, but I don't really think it's for me. At least, maybe, at least, maybe just at least that group specifically it's just not helping it's really distressing It makes me want to die more afterward every time."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so, then how about we. Just yeah you don't go to group anymore again i'll get the referrals and we can discharge you to a program that's a better fit too, because that is a big part of the program here is the group therapy and if it's just making it worse for you. Then i'll try to put kind of a press on this case management to try to get a referral, so that we can find the right program the right level of support something that just seems to be a better fit how's that sound. Okay, so yeah I will. Again, get that in today i'll try to either email you or have the. Virtual clinic contact you to get the referrals i'll make sure they look at your insurance and all of that, and that can be the plan moving forward is just to discharge and. move on to a program that is better that you feel more supported by that is better fit for what you're experiencing as well."
14826.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, Melissa and then, if we need to have one more appointment, together, we can to just kind of talk the referrals through if that needs to happen absolutely we're here to support you, but. More than anything, I just got to get those referrals in the works."
14826.0,Patient,it's it sounds good.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so try to kind of go through with that plan, we talked about today, getting your sleep bottle of water packaged food. little bit of social support and again hopefully we can get you the care, you need, and you can feel a little bit better beyond that. Okay okay all right well thanks for being here today, and we will be in touch."
14826.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
462.0,Provider,"you're welcome take care, have a good weekend."
14826.0,Patient,You too bye bye.
462.0,Provider,"Can you please note that the patient is a moderate suicide risk that she reports ideation pretty strong ideation but no very explicitly said she has no plan that she intends to carry out, you can just note everything that we decided about her discharging. and other folks on the higher PR team here agrees on the need for a higher level of care and we're going to work on referrals Thank you."
