2680.0,Patient,i'm good. Seeing you.
386.0,Provider,"yeah they put me over here in this this room over here so. Like you can do more work over here um no go ahead and give me full name and date of birth, just for the record."
2680.0,Patient,Ryan Robinson April 14 1983.
386.0,Provider,"perfect and I have ever received a message from the prescription triage department, saying that there was some over use of medication Is that correct."
2680.0,Patient,"It wasn't an Okay, you can put it as an overuse of medication, but um. that's not what I was aware of mary's always sent me a 30 day supply. Okay, which would be 90 right and it's always been that way. Last month. She sends me 120. We were in group I assume that she wanted me to start taking for a day. or so. I took for a day and as of yesterday i've been out was my 30th day."
386.0,Provider,Okay.
2680.0,Patient,"As it got tend to last month, and then I call the pharmacy to get a refilled and they said it's not going to be do and or something about it can't be dispensed until 10 more days which I didn't understand and. I usually take them three times a day, so I thought she wanted me to take them four times a day that's it like that's that's The only problem like. I mean, it must have been like a mistake on both sides, because she never gives me 120 and. i'm always used to taking three a day. So, and then and from from her are the pharmacist, I wasn't explained to do anything different. Like. I know, but i've noticed that I have more so I figured that I had to take four day so that's what i've been doing i've been taking for a day i've been taken one in the morning, one in the afternoon one in the evening and one before I go to sleep. So now i'm out of my medications and there's no possible way I can go 10 days without."
386.0,Provider,"My bag yeah so what I did, though, and I don't know if I think insurance might cover it, but if insurance didn't cover it."
2680.0,Patient,"Then I put in a rx coupon for at least nine of them. To give me by because he said that. They could possibly be do Rama 17th or something like that so. But um I guess. Like you guys have to call in and do that and I know like you told me last time, like. per your guys's law i'm not supposed to go out with my medication I don't want to feel I don't want to get like i've been taken it for a year and a half, I don't want to start feeling sick and like. yeah like."
386.0,Provider,"yeah we don't want you to do that um so I have buprenorphine and it is in the strength of the eight milligram. And then it's the sublingual tablet and what it looks like here is back on 810 2021 she sent in the prescription for the directions for 120 with three times a day dosing. So the instructions were at three times a day dosing now the pharmacy should have said hey that doesn't make sense, why are we doing three times dosing but we're prescribing at a four times a day dosing quantity, so that should have been flagged. Whether or not it was or not I can't I can't control what the pharmacy does I can't control what Mary kastner does. um in terms of that, but what we can do is just make sure that we're getting it managed appropriately and what should be prescribed is a 30 day supply for three times a day dosing for quantity of 90 versus the 120 understandably you took the four. times a day because of the quantity um um dos inch increase you know that's just something that's you know makes sense, it makes sense to me um, however. I mean look at my calendar Mary costner."
2680.0,Patient,yeah I thought it was a 30 day supply so that's how I took it as a 30 day supply.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, let me send a message over to Mary kastner she is back in office but she's just off. Because she's normally here Mondays and Tuesdays so she is back in office she's not on vacation anymore, which she was on Monday and Tuesday she's not on vacation so she is back in office, let me send an email to her. With some type of clarification, and unfortunately I just can't authorize an early I know it's not considered to be. In an aspect it's not should it should not be considered to be an early fail because of what was been prescribed and she did send in a prescription on the 31st of October of August, excuse me for an additional 120, so there is a prescription there for 120 ready for pickup but if. The dosing on that on that prescription as well says, three times a dosing three times a day dosing for 120, and so let me get some clarification on the dosing schedule on if. You should be taking four times a day dosing if that's what was in the plan, because the note doesn't reflect that. The note reflects three times a day dosing at 24 milligrams per day if at at four times a day dosing it would increase that dosing to have 32 milligrams per day. And what I can do is once she gives me that clarification just let her be aware, like patient was prescribed 120 and took the hundred and 20 per 30 day cycle like. that's why he thought he was supposed to do and what can we do to make sure that this prescription, so I just need her authorization for me to be able to call the pharmacy. and be able to get that clarification done letting her be aware of the situation and letting her give me the authorization to call the pharmacy for them to fulfill the prescription order with the notation that you had an order for. You know, four times a day dosing basically and that's how you are taking it so. i'm because the quantity and the directions don't match up, and so it can be an easy fix I just need to let the pharmacy know I but I, in order for me to be able to do that I need her approval to do that if that makes sense, does that make sense."
2680.0,Patient,Do you do you know. how long it will take her to get back to you or.
386.0,Provider,"she's usually really quick when I when I email her, I once I get which one she responds back to me, I will call you back and. I will tell you i'm not going to. Leave you without medications for 10 days, so there will be some type of management that occurs, whether short script and is sent in to get you covered up until your next appointment. With her which would be was it Monday, are you seeing her Mondays or Tuesdays."
2680.0,Patient,Tuesday tuesday's yeah.
386.0,Provider,"Tuesday, so no."
2680.0,Patient,"No, no, even."
386.0,Provider,"No matter what I want to get clarification because I want to kind of just make sure that this gets nipped in the bud, and if we're doing one dose and the quantity needs to be able to match, I want to be able to correct the prescription. that's my ultimate goal is, if I can't get that clarification from her today, then, no matter what I will definitely get a prescription out for you, for, are you completely out of medication, all the way."
2680.0,Patient,I was out of yesterday.
386.0,Provider,"Yes, did you do."
2680.0,Patient,Yesterday yeah yesterday was my 30th 30th day so.
386.0,Provider,"You took that in the evening, though. yeah Okay, and are you currently in any type of withdraw."
2680.0,Patient,"um you know i've been up for a couple hours i'm used to take a mine in the morning, so i'm kind of feeling a little bit of body aches."
386.0,Provider,Okay body aches any nausea vomiting sweating.
2680.0,Patient,sweating for sure I feel clammy.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, no nausea vomiting, though."
2680.0,Patient,No.
386.0,Provider,"Alright, so it sounds like beginning stages of some withdrawal symptoms going on um let me see if I can get some clarification from her if I don't, then I will definitely get a script out for you, for today Saturday Sunday Monday and then you'll follow up with her on Tuesday."
2680.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that would even that would even work to I mean i'm not like. As long as I get something until Tuesday, then I can talk to Mary about it. yeah work."
386.0,Provider,"i'd rather have what my thing is, is that because there's already a prescription on file for you, you would have to pay out of pocket for this this prescription order basically because it's still considered to be too early. With the dosing, and so what i'm trying to do is just make sure that it gets it's able to be processed appropriately and you don't have to pay any money out of pocket. that's what the hopes are good okay. So. let's say when it perfect yeah let me see what i'm able to do get going for you, I will let her know so as of 810 you were taking four per day."
2680.0,Patient,"Yes, oh. No as of as of eight. Oh, as of a chin yeah last month yeah 10 yes."
386.0,Provider,"It 10 taking. Four times a day Q ID due to. quantity of 120 all right. um let me see what i'm able to do, I mean you would be right on target at this point, I mean that's right on target so. 1234 2829 30 and so you would have taken your last day yesterday, so you know, realistically, you are, you are right on target if that's what the prescription order. was supposed to be for is this she was increasing you to the four times a day dosing just doesn't reflect that in the chart, and so let me get some clarification from her, and then I will reach back out to you, I have your phone number at 53060863 for four."
2680.0,Patient,yeah that.
