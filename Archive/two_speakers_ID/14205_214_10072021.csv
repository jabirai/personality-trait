Dr Malik will be reflective of Okay, I see what brandi been there was something that happened on one session she's trying to make it up so it's good for him to see it, but the system won't change your chart.

214.0,Provider,"12 because i'm still having issues oh. No that's fine, we can do that i'm not worried about. that's fine so we're good with that so let's take a look at your last survey see how you doing. So the last survey was for depression, anxiety. see your anxiety comes up, I mean your depression comes up as a six, which is mild, how do you feel about that, what do you think that's a."
14205.0,Patient,"And here lately, I feel like i've been a little more depressed because I just lost my way just buried her. On Monday. um, but I feel like my anxiety is always up. And I do take medications for it so."
214.0,Provider,What are you taking for anxiety.
14205.0,Patient,I don't take medication for anxiety.
214.0,Provider,So you just take the medication prescribed by Dr Malik.
14205.0,Patient,"Well, they they i'm wondering Bray lar. i'm one. it's it's something like effects or but it's it's not effects or it's does I don't know there's a D in front of it it's spelled just like effects or but there's a D in front of it it's a new."
214.0,Provider,Who are you getting that from.
14205.0,Patient,"campus but it's becoming like a little bit. hard for me to work with them because, like, I called him and told him about the coven where my daughter had coven they said, well, we don't want you to come in we'll do it we'll do a TV. Well then, they never called me with the TV, so I call a woman i'm like hey you know i'm about to be out of my medications and you told me, you were going to do my tell a visit. And or my Tele health call and you still haven't done the Tele health call well we're going to have to reschedule I said but i'm i'm almost on a medication. Well, we can't prescribe you anything until we actually see through Tele health or but it wasn't my fault, you know, and I mean like they told me they were they were going to do that full, but then they didn't."
214.0,Provider,"Well, let me ask you a question, would you like to do everything through bright heart."
14205.0,Patient,Is that possible.
214.0,Provider,"that's what i'm going to find out, right now, I know I offered it, but let me just see was was the lady the doctor."
14205.0,Patient,Can I still keep like Dr Malik.
214.0,Provider,"yeah you would keep Dr Malik for your beauty and you would keep perfume so one would be for like substance abuse and the other would be for mental health, I think that's a great combination because it's all within one place, you know what i'm saying."
14205.0,Patient,"yeah and then that way you guys know like how i'm yeah you guys know i'm doing, and you guys can work with me on both because. I know they go hand in and when my mental health meds when I stopped taking my mental health meds that's when I seem to attend to to like want to relapse and stuff."
214.0,Provider,"I totally get it, because then that medication isn't working, either because you're running out, which is causing anxiety right. Then they tell you we can't do anything well let's just shoot everything to hell in the basket. So that's not very helpful, but for the most part we usually work um. You know, we try to get patients who are either having problems with the outside prescriber they're like you know it probably be easier if I just did everything in one you know one place. So I know. yeah I think so, too, so i'm going to wait for her, she may contact me now or she may not be working but i'll let you know and i'll chat you in group on Monday, and it will we can address that. Do you think the very law was what is working."
14205.0,Patient,"And okay so like I take play more than that, I take them regular lamictal Sarah will. yeah."
214.0,Provider,"What from your perspective, do you think they're all working or do you think like wow, this is a lot and i'm not sure it is working."
14205.0,Patient,"And, and like some my mom says, if she sees a different in me a difference in me when i'm. When i'm on my mid she said that she can handle me and, like, I see a difference when i'm on my meds when i'm not on my meds. or like when I have forgot to take my meds that day my mom will be like brandi, I can tell like you know you haven't taken your meds you need to take them, I feel like the trailer I don't know what happened, like I started hearing voices a. few months ago, like maybe a year ago it's been a while ago, but I started hearing voices and I couldn't get some voices to stop and then. They started putting they put me on for a lawyer and the Braille or did help for the voices the seroquel use to help for that, but then it just quit working because i've been on seroquel I want to say 15 plus years. And then i'm only migdal for mood stabilizing."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I what we're listening, you may be on the right medication, but we know. Like some of the combinations of the same thing right some of the medication, you know it's like eating a regular slice and you want to another very loosely it's the same thing it's not. Really adjusting I know that the very law is something that works well for a couple people that I work with. But then we're trying to get them off the circle so i'm not saying that's your case it's particularly to a person, but I think it would be good. for you to leave me with somebody and someone say Okay, I see the whole picture I think these are the things that could be beneficial to I don't want you. To think like within a wipe out your medications first of all have to see if the doctors, want to see you, but just to say, maybe we need to make some adjustments. hi."
14205.0,Patient,"You guys know to like like she doesn't work with like dual diagnosis and so like my doctor doesn't and so, like, I think that with me, working with you guys, knowing that I have a dual diagnosis, you know with you know with trouble with using. And and bipolar. I think it might be more beneficial for me to."
214.0,Provider,"I can I just I just think all because we will all of us constantly talking so we can all like being the same loop if we had to go contact. Your outside provider, we may not be able to talk to them for quite a while and in the in the middle of that, though, you may be struggling or having a hard time and we can't fix the mental health because we don't have anything to say about it. So, and we just make more sense. But why do you think your anxieties heights any team that's quite high when you're taking a lot of medications. To be really low."
14205.0,Patient,"I know, and so I I don't know I just felt like going on lately, and my daughter struggling in school, I feel like I feel like I worry about every little single. And I feel like. I always have i'm always anxious that I don't know why that something like bad is gonna happen, and I know that probably doesn't even make sense, but like. So it keeps my anxiety super high because i'm always."
214.0,Provider,"But I wouldn't go I wonder. What did you I mean did you in your life, where you always kind of like that, did you build yourself up to be like always worried, in the next shoes dropping and what else is going to go wrong is that something that's been through your lifetime."
14205.0,Patient,"I want to say, I always hope for the worst but."
214.0,Provider,Like so.
14205.0,Patient,"Have a stronger, not for the worst but um thanks for the worst thing the worst but."
214.0,Provider,"For the worst and hope for the bus right. yeah well that's the that's but we call that catastrophic thinking right everything is catastrophic we say something is really, really bad. it's bad, but not really, really bad you know so there's a difference between the two parallels and that's something I think we can work on together to figure out, you know how we can. Because I think if we get to depression by 10 or a single digits you'll see a big benefit on the depression side and the mood swings won't be so radical I think you're going through extremes you go from one end of the pendulum to the next end of the pendulum. I think it's a lot of you. yeah I know. I can kind of understand that and see it, and I really empathize with you and I don't want you to have to go through that, so I think the first steps of our intervention is, let me see if I can get you in with our mental health person."
14205.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"To see what what she's willing to do on medications like is we can't make any abrupt changes it's not fair to you, but at least get a consultation with her. In hopes that we can keep everything within bright heart and this way we can address the dual diagnosis one hand, on the other hand, with the mental health but it's in the settings and two, I think we can work on a couple of things to help you with that anxiety."
14205.0,Patient,"yeah I just wish I could find some type type of like medium, you know what I mean."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I think that the medium is. The bomb i'm presuming is. Your your naturally condition almost to be hyper like you're you're actually waiting for something to happen, like you sit there going on, should this this don't feel right nothing's happening, but you kind of feel like something's going to. You know so you're you're constantly and what we call flight right your parasympathetic nervous system is in the run all the time, so it's not into like just chillin be calm. And I think that happened over a period of time, so I totally understand you and get you for sure. But I think we can work on that you know together to listen, if we can drop that five points you feel the difference right away so it'll be interesting to see when you fill out this. survey how you're feeling and then, when we meet next week we'll talk about it, and then we can make a reference to say okay so nothing's moving so that means something's got to change either we've got to make better improvements on the medication, or we need to start. Addressing just as some of the things that we think of and change our mindset how's that sound to you."
14205.0,Patient,"sounds good, and I broke my foot to. i'm going to the doctor today I did it last night on I was walking through my i'm not i'm certain I broke it. And, but I was walking through my hallway and I don't know how I did it, but my my to my second and third toe got stuck in between it like it went underneath the dryer and there's like a little wheel thing there. In a in a kind of like I didn't know they got stuck there, and when I tried to like. pull it out a like I don't know I don't know how to explain it. But is it really messed my foot up look i'll show you my maybe be able to show you look at this."
214.0,Provider,Oh yeah. yeah you should go have checked off for sure.
14205.0,Patient,yeah I did that yesterday but. I was just showing like it yesterday to go to the hospital and settle day so it's my mama said we'll go today that way we don't wait too long.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I agree, I think that's a good thing, so then i'll See you in group and i'll let you know what's going on with this Doc then we'll start the ball moving is that good."
14205.0,Patient,yeah that'll be great.
214.0,Provider,"All right, thank you Randy I really appreciate it hope everything works out with your foot."
14205.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
214.0,Provider,You got it bye bye.
