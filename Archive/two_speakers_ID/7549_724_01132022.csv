I already have like 20 hours from you know Sunday and then yesterday I got like 20 hours already on this pay period, yes, like 20 hours so i'll i'll get Saturday and Sunday off. So I mean, basically, I did get two days off this pay period, so I worked, you know, technically, I guess, but I worked six days I guess. You know what I mean cuz assembled into Monday morning. coulson need so. Because on Sunday, we actually went in at.

So we ended up getting to watch the game and doing inventory, but I wanted to our it started at 525, we have to be there at 630 and I didn't want to be, you know cuz I can't be driving and looking at my phone. Even though it's like 10 miles away and only takes like if there's no traffic and then I can really get to work in like 15 minutes for the monthly about 15 minutes. But I saw I got there early, so I could be watching the game already and then have to like hurry up and try to get up. And you know, make it there, and something happened during the game and i'll miss it like you know I could put it on bluetooth on on my my car stereo and actually listened to the game, but not wouldn't been able to watch it so. I got there early, so I was up. Like at 4330 ish forest because I knew I had to do everything eat and everything before work and then I wanted to have time to make sure I had everything done and then to get there, so that day was not day was a while I was up for like. 1415 hours on Sunday going into Monday, because I like I said I didn't get off until like. It was like seven or something it was about seven something like I work like 632 I can't remember 77 something in the morning, so that was a long day. yeah well you know that was on me but anyway."

7549.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. yep that's that that's true okay wow yeah yes i'm gonna be cold because remember role that they play like.

724.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. I saw that headline and they're like that, like the first game, one on three passes only or something like that."
7549.0,Patient,"You know, and they ran They ran the ball like a lot, but yet I cold man that's crazy that's crazy it gets cold here to some time like I work on a dock and it's under me. Like the it's on the lower level basically of the store, so you go down, but you know it's it's cold in the in there when I get in there in the morning and then you know, on the truck is colder on the truck but it's still not. it's not like like that, because someone in this bed I wake up, I wake up and you know go outside nurse frost on my windows. it's cold, what is the most outrageous. rate."
724.0,Provider,"But it. But it's a you know it's like being in Nevada to imagine where they're like it's hot but it's like a dry heat. yeah so it's like Arizona you don't. Like the summer it's almost like hotter than the surface of the sun, it feels like but."
7549.0,Patient,Oh no yeah my sister who lives in Arizona right now and I got a sister who lives in Las Vegas.
724.0,Provider,"But it's manageable, you know, because if it was like as bad as, like you, would you know kind of proceed with that be like it would be on uninhabitable. I feel like that it's still manageable so like in Florida. I lived in all different parts of Florida. yeah when it gets cold in Florida, and if it drops it's like the 40s and 30s which it does depending on like where you live. yeah it's cold and it's because there's so much humidity it's like a wet cold it's. On argue that it's more cold down like a discomfort level than what I felt like last night, like last time just bitter cold and that but there's no. Yes, you just like oh it's cold man, but but down there it's like, no matter what you do you're like I feel wet cold."
7549.0,Patient,wet that's not cool I know what you're talking about yeah that code is not cool.
724.0,Provider,"So, so in California like dependent like where you're at you know what I mean like it's a pretty arid climate there, but there are pockets of like humidity so like when again, you know if it gets to the cold people I that's not cold it's like it is. it's a different type of cold, just like the Van is going to different types of heat. You know it's different than Florida either like Florida heat with the humidity you're just like you feel like the oxygens like sucked out of your lungs because you'd like but there it's like yeah it's 110 we go outside for a little bit, but. hang out all day, but we could go outside of you okay."
7549.0,Patient,"yeah, that is true cuz I think they've said some of the coldest. I mean, besides somewhere like in Minnesota I can't think aware, but truckee California this some of the code is like temperatures it that's been recorded also and truck and that's like. trucking truckee is like. I want anywhere between like hour and a half and three hours from here, from sacramento we're basically going to well because you know going to Reno is the. rocky mountains it's the mountains yeah you know what I mean so yeah it gets cold in front end it snows you know it snows up that way like no snow down here."
724.0,Provider,Well right yeah cuz altitude.
7549.0,Patient,"yeah getting getting up there, though it. It wasn't in Nevada city basically like grass valley closed Reno is is it's bordering right there and it snows but yeah."
724.0,Provider,"it's cold like I was like geez man. So yes, like the next couple of days it's because I think I guess it's like some caught a cold front coming through but, like you know set like the high for saturday's 18 degrees that's."
7549.0,Patient,me and it. Is the set like i'm sure to send still come out. As.
724.0,Provider,"it's not going to touch it. So yeah I guess we're getting like a cold front that's coming in, like off of the like the Great Lakes and then cross, and then it just you know ISIS is they're calling for snow On Friday we had snow last Friday. But I have."
7549.0,Patient,"How many inches like the because I worked like I told you, before I worked with an older guy well a few older guys. One of them, the older older guy my guy john. john edmonds. He he lives up in a pioneer from here so it's like. it's somewhere up in the mountains he's he gets snow because it's like amador county on the you know the counties, or whatever you don't necessarily know the counties but it's amador county so it's up like basically in group going towards Reno and all of that basically. He he says he gives dear, you know he he's like literally can go outside and then as you're already there's deer and he can he feeds the deer or whatever, but he has to shovel snow sometimes sometimes when he shoveled snow you, you have to several snow up the driveway some time."
724.0,Provider,yeah oh yeah.
7549.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Like growing up that like we said, like go around neighborhoods and stuff and people would pay us like monitor like shovel their cars, because it's a chore you know. You could see to be proactive you'd stay on top of it and, like. The you go outside every hour, you know what I mean. You shovel. school level, like my house now my driveway it's it's it's big enough for two cars it's like goes up slightly was over, so what we do now and then. Like there's a sidewalk that runs in front of the driveway. And the. street So what we do now during snowstorms is that we we actually pull a card both our cars way down to the edge. yeah it needs the sidewalk. So, all we have on the sidewalk. yeah open it to the street that we're good to go. You know what I needed at the top, I just walk from one end to the other I just push it off until like the side of my neighbor's yard. Be was like yep alright cool man he."
7549.0,Patient,got it. Not me since.
724.0,Provider,"then has to stay on top of it like it ain't too bad, but it like if you. You fall asleep in the next morning you wake up you're going to shovel like like I. Let him watch it's. Not fluffy it's like I see. Like a mix that like yeah you're back is going to be pretty stiff so. wow we we sold the roads, we sold our stairs all that good stuff so. Just just being proactive, I found like it like it my experiences is good enough, because you don't want to get stuck in and you don't want to drive you know so."
7549.0,Patient,Make sure like.
724.0,Provider,"trees and stuff like that, for the next couple of days and then. If I get I gotta I gotta like a wood stove in our House so like if."
7549.0,Patient,A wood burning stove that's.
724.0,Provider,It so like if we lose power it's like. i'll put all my cold stuff like literally outside on my deck everything in my fridge I got a cooler i'll put it outside it'll stay cold.
7549.0,Patient,cold and.

724.0,Provider,"yeah like lumberjack status, like."
7549.0,Patient,He will yeah I see that's crazy yeah. yeah my cold is not me complaining or says something about a good called nothing compared to call.
724.0,Provider,"It it's all relative you know. I tell people all the time it's relatively what my experiences differs from a lot of other people like I still walk outside and like shorts you know the middle of winter and sandals and tank tops on look like a crazy person that people. might like I got like a high high threshold for discomfort believe me so. Yes, it doesn't really bother me so when people like i'm cold i'm like that's cool. yeah I know what it's like when I get cold it sucks so like it. If that's what you're feeling right now, you know i'm empathetic or sympathetic."
7549.0,Patient,"yeah the only time when i'm at work, the only time that i'm like actually get code is when my hands get cold and i'm like that's what i'm inside of the truck actually envelope soon as I get out of the truck. and get back on to the Doc is cooler on the dock than it is inside of the trip, so you know, I just want my hands. With normally as long as my body like my sister my core is is warmed it warmed enough, then i'm pretty cool it's just it's just gets cold yeah."
724.0,Provider,You gotta do what you ever seen that Batman begins movie where they're like after Bruce Wayne. Personal yeah what Christian bale when he gets like dumped in the water and he's like doing this.
7549.0,Patient,I think so yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah he's like he's like no he's like rub your core because, like when like in when your body's like a dire straits you'll lose blood from all your extremities it's not an important it'll start circulating here, this is the warmest part so like he just go like this. So you warm up."
7549.0,Patient,"yeah so that was long as my core is enough cool well. yeah yes. And at this point now you know, since i'm. Since i'm in the, especially now back you know back to my regular schedule. Pretty cool you know what I mean, I guess, because you already know, you know we talked this is around the time that i've pretty much. ready. Shalom go to sleep. Anyway, well, like I said as long now for sure I don't have it's not going to be. a bunch of six days, no time probably within the next three months or so that I would probably work, you know, a six day. schedule is if they add a truck or something on a Thursday I mean on a on a Saturday. You know cuz pretty much."
724.0,Provider,down a little bit.
7549.0,Patient,"The pretty much work, you know Monday through Friday, basically, so the basically the only time that I would at this point, work on a Saturday, you know works in both within, at least within the next three months i'm sure, because the first quarter basically. If they added a truck during the week like if they ended up adding one on Saturday, rather than that I shouldn't I should be having a regular, for the most part schedule. Good so."
724.0,Provider,"You know that's good you know, like rest is important, I know, like you get to a certain age so we're like you can still you can still operate, but it doesn't mean you have to you know. That is like just as important and. have some free time will allow you to get back into like you know exercise is doing the things that you want to do. This this holiday rush."
7549.0,Patient,"And that's funny that you say that because they just like I just checked my credit like I told you, I had stayed up that day. I was walking i'm like man what the heck I had a torch and I didn't even like really look at it. With my gym I haven't been to the gym in three months and i'm like man why don't we haven't heard my card, but now it's like i'm glad they did, because at some point, I will be able to go back to the gym you know, and so my membership is still."
724.0,Provider,"No yeah maybe they'll charge you they're gonna get their money out of you, so you know."
7549.0,Patient,"Exactly cuz at this point. You know I almost forgot about it, like almost like. A gym membership but yeah at some point i'll be able to get back. And then some days, I know that you know my boss my boss are cool so I know at some point i'll be able to. kill he'll go ahead and say Oh well, we don't got a truck like staying this Monday coming up and we don't have a truck and he doesn't necessarily mean me there, then I might get a three day you know, three days a week, and that that'll be cool so."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah you did.
7549.0,Patient,"Okay, so yeah. soon enough now was this valentine's time so we're starting to get stuff no for that it's like constant. Constant. Changing the season once like Christmas over now go straight to Valentine then Easter will start getting all that stuff. Three months pretty much two three months before the time comes, and I mean, I understand that. it's been that same way, for the last 19 years. So that's pretty cool. So we were talking The other day I don't know at this point when I gave my. Release of information. I do it send it in, but I think well i'll talk to my probation officer and she said that I guess that she I don't know if she got it from the courts or she got it from my. Like my public defender the which they probably gave them to her, but she was like. You know you I know you're doing good, because you know I got to import or whatever, and I was like okay well that's cool you know just no."
724.0,Provider,"i've literally been been typing up your your final progress report, like as we speak."
7549.0,Patient,She said I go on the 27th but didn't carve it out on you know I don't know.
724.0,Provider,"It might be it might either one you know you might not have to do it, or two they might have you do it like zoom. Like I know a lot of a lot of people do in court stuff their resume and because you've been pretty pretty solid as. As it stands now, they might just be like you know the peer recommendation would be like yeah he's good to go, unless you unless you have to be there formally to the science of it but."
7549.0,Patient,"I don't so. we'll see, I guess, because she told me which I didn't know you know I got an email saying that. Like my. I didn't know that I didn't have to go to court anymore that was that wasn't explained or wasn't specified, so I didn't know. But then when probation officer called me, she said well yeah you don't have any more court dates, I was like oh oh that's cool. Like okay that's cool I didn't know that so that's why she wants to have, because this will be my first time actually going to see her so, because now that i'm done with the Court stuff I can actually go in to her, so I guess before I couldn't was no issue already. But she was saying that it's it'll be I have to I would have to go see her two times a month at this point, which I mean there's no problem, you know. there's no big deal or anything but. i'll know what the coven. because everything is here we're now starting to get back even like at my job they're saying you know we have to do a wellness check every day, you know you come in clocking in, and if you have to call up the phone make sure it's your temperature, you know just. So we have to do that, every day, but they sent out an email saying that. I think probably starting in February they're trying to think well you know they'll have to figure it out like the financial part of it, because they they said something about. I think getting a like getting a test every week or so like yeah getting a test every week. To be able to come in, so you know that that they'll have to figure out the financials on that."
724.0,Provider,cal founders.
7549.0,Patient,"Believe me, check i'm telling you, I know, yes, so. Because, at one point in time. Well, you know, everybody, for the most part, you know a lot of places like shut down, except for you know the essential or basically in the all the non essential things or whatever for sure, at one point, there were people off. For like six months, like macy's had cut shut down like period there was no in store, as some some locations. There was no in store, so, then they ended up. You know, after the. The. Regulations or whatever got lifted. You know, and it was back in store, but. If if it goes. Your thing keeps going, you know, like it is they might."
724.0,Provider,shut it down again.

724.0,Provider,"It, for it is not it's not strange to me but it's like hey this is normal."
7549.0,Patient,"yeah i'm so used to even people even people that like I already known like you mean I mean like for years, see if we're mass so it's like damn who are why no is you'd be like."
724.0,Provider,"I was at the hospital, they were like new and I didn't know what they look like without the mass."

724.0,Provider,there's no put that up over your nose.
7549.0,Patient,"Is it's crazy it's like it's this, this is really at this point like is really a way of life, we don't necessarily know at this point when is it going to. not be that way because, being in the store, you know some customers when we see them without mass our first is like and then it's like Oh well, hey you can have as your prerogative, or whatever you know. But that's in store. We have to have you know we got to have our masks on and. I mean it's not so bad, I guess, because at this point."
724.0,Provider,Two years into it now we're kind of.
7549.0,Patient,yeah it's like almost. Its base is basically wearing a mask at this point is like wearing. pants and shoes.
724.0,Provider,yeah it's pretty yep hanging hanging off my my blinker in my car is this like a row of masks like for for me my kids for a girlfriend oh my God like. We got a stack here. Can I mean like like we're never not without mask and my car so.
7549.0,Patient,Like pick which pick which one.
724.0,Provider,You have all different patterns and stuff.
7549.0,Patient,"is crazy like talking about that the only time I don't have a mask on for the most part, like is me being at home right now. and obviously when i'm in the car I don't drive with a mask on."
724.0,Provider,yeah i'm not i'm not a i'm not a lunatic. And you're like how. You change your gloves man.
7549.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly touching everything else, and then you go give back in the core and put it, where your gloves and the core intense everything in the core."
724.0,Provider,"that's why I like I like going to like eight like cash machine sometimes and be like it's not working, and like hand of cards to the cat and they were like. they'd be felt like in their eyes are like i'm not used to suddenly."
7549.0,Patient,Like oh my God like.
724.0,Provider,Take the card.
7549.0,Patient,"there's a bunch of places like here, you know I don't hardly fast food, but when I do like sometimes in the morning, the final if I don't eat. Like breakfast at home if there's a there's a burger King like cuz i'm basically in a mall you know what I mean it's basically a mall well, it is a mall. yeah there's other stuff you know, like around in some big parking lot but, like in the parking lot all the way, on the other side there's a burger king and I went like there was like three weeks or a month ago now. I always, I have a card now like you know I have my card i've been having a card, but I happen to have like 10 bucks on me that day and I will hardly ever heat cash anymore, and I tried to give them cash they looked at me and they were like oh no."
724.0,Provider,We don't.
7549.0,Patient,We. know what I do my car they they give they take my card in. Like in a plastic container. container.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, like it's radioactive."
7549.0,Patient,"near it's crazy it's crazy, like you, my food and my kids in the container and i'm in my car to it's like."
724.0,Provider,know all the soda for someone to the mall last week right all like in the food court all the. Court all the soda fountains are all turned off. yeah right.
7549.0,Patient,So you gotta go give it to them.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so you can't touch anything except, except that the debit machine everybody touches the debit machine when they put their card and they put their pin. it's like right in the front so it's like. You turn all this stuff off, but this this thing is still here."
7549.0,Patient,You know what I mean that's crazy.
724.0,Provider,Like i'm confused a little bit.
7549.0,Patient,"that's crazy yeah it's somewhat somewhat some of the stuff don't make sense, like really but it's like I mean I guess."
724.0,Provider,yeah like.
7549.0,Patient,"At this point, it's like man, I guess."
724.0,Provider,"Like, what do you want me to do. How do you want to play the game today what's. what's the new rules sure man."
7549.0,Patient,"For the most part that's that's that's really what it is, because on something like some days I will go to the food court in the mall. You know you still got the and I always been like this, I don't ever want to sit like right next to other people like while i'm eating, but now. Even when it's kind of pack like on certain days, mostly on the weekend, like a Friday and a Saturday, people will be in the mall and the people in the food court. Nobody it's like one table, you know what I mean like it's it's a person sitting at this table a person sitting at that table the table in the middle there's nobody there, and so, people are still all is spreading out but it's like it's like man, you see people not. Even like it obviously during this holiday time during Christmas, it was a lot of people like being in the malls and stuff but people weren't necessarily being too close to each other. it's crazy to see and only sometimes you see it like in my own store when people were like get on the escalator or whatever. you'll see certain people and you like okay well you know that they they're not like, together with each other and it's like you'll see somebody close up or somebody you see almost people getting ready to fight. Back yeah give me at least two or three steps on the on the escalator. Some people at this point they're like man forget some people have gotten just immune to it and it's like well whatever. know you see some people still without masks people were without mask like they're like people go out and stuff without man."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I do. Our our state just. Put in like a like an interim a mandatory like re mask mandate to like January 19 so like like in small businesses and restaurants and stuff like that, regardless of you know, vaccination status. Because the overdrawn you know surge. But I don't know how long they can always extend it, you know because. So many people were like. And, ironically, like, I went to Florida over the summer, and you know that's when they were like oh florida's like the Wild West people do. We found like my girlfriend I like we went to a couple of grocery stores and we're like they're more people mass down here than they are like in my blue ass liberal state. yeah and I was like I was like so like whatever. Like my experience was. That there, there are a lot of people were matched up down there and they weren't just sounded like. yeah. Like it's not as crazy as like I thought it was going to be exempt lives in Florida and Florida can't be the Wild West. yeah I was like. seems like like people are pretty smart enough about like they're taken care of themselves. Like it's near do it don't do it, you know what I mean like that the CDC and I just got on a session with. Somebody else and. they're saying that that her that her comment was taken out of context, but the director of the CDC so she's that female price seeing around other news and stuff she she said that there was a study that they did very recently, that of the 75% of the people that died. From related had four or more co mobility issues they had for more underlying issues and. she's like those were all magic triggering factors as to why they died. And the fact checkers or like wow That was a study based on will say 50 people and it's like and they're like you can't compare it to to the grand population it's like no you absolutely can compare it to the grand population because that's what you do and. So if we can all agree that that most people that are high risk probably have underlying cause being compromised so yeah for sure those people should be very concerned about what they do anyways you know. Like um but the say like. Like healthy 70 year old high school kids are dropping dead for overcrowd like it it's not you know what I mean like somebody just malicious you out of California, she was a doctor and she was like I have not put one person on a ventilator because of all the quran."
7549.0,Patient,"And I believe it because honestly. Honestly, I can even say, just like being in sacramento you were is rare. Like you know, like even for me, being in the mall you know what I mean and seeing a lot of people. If you don't see too many people not really wearing masks that's why like when do we do see when it's like Oh, but it's like a yes that's. yeah that's what you want to do that's fine but. People people are wearing masks. yeah like people are still wearing masks. and"
724.0,Provider,"They think that's why it last year when they said, like there was barely any flu last year they think it's because people were. Actually, because of a mass like that that have mastered stop the spread of fluid it's like that is one definitely positive thing you know what I mean like you know, maybe if maybe if everybody could agree that, like during like high peak months for like blue."
7549.0,Patient,Year.
724.0,Provider,"For just be highly encourage that you wear a mask and you know, like a bunch of people would do that anyways like."
7549.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You don't have to make it mandatory because you know we're Americans, we don't like being told what to do. Is after like you're not. Like it's our it's in our DNA, but if they were like hey we highly encourage you to do it it's flu season it definitely we could show you the stats were definitely do like flu flu related hospitalizations debts, or whatever it was and it's like I like get the flu you don't I mean I. got a public. event or whatever, but. Like for for sure I would probably do it if I went to walmart or target or some shit like wear a mask just during flu season, but I don't like the idea of having to wear have asked like outside while you're at the beach in the middle of July."
7549.0,Patient,"No, no."
724.0,Provider,"I got some clubs, but I don't like the fact that my daughter who's four years old, who speech delayed has to go to school and has to wear a mask. mask working with a speech pathologist so i'm like, how do you guys work."
7549.0,Patient,With a stage.
724.0,Provider,"If she can't see you. Exactly speed. Is no expression, you know what I mean it's like. that's just that's just my kids so like I got a direct link to it. tos of people's kids are like this, you know what I mean it's like it's very unfortunate. what was happening in the schools for these kids it's like you know out whether or not they're all being sent home and on telehealth my daughter has been sent home twice, because she coffin school and they'll actually can't come back so she gets a negative Kofi test it's like. No, I got a subject my three year old. To assess you know what I mean it's like because. She had sniffles or she cough like most kids do and it's like. You know, but. it's just the world that we live in carly so."
7549.0,Patient,yeah is is here. I don't I don't see any end in sight in the near future.
724.0,Provider,i'm just trying to be optimistic.
7549.0,Patient,"Of course, you know I know you are, and you know I am. Pretty positive. You know i'm pretty positive person, but man it's it's just crazy it's like it's really like it's a it's a way of. Like life at this point. Like you were just saying I know we got a little bit of time. My my girl my base if my son my stepson he he's he's autistic he not artistic to me to me he could I mean me and I, we talked about our time he so he's smart I mean, of course, he is where he not artistic why he understands and all that, but he goes to a special basically a special school. where he talks, he has. One on one individual learning. And Ai exactly and like you were just saying is crazy, because one of his. One of his teachers basically. He tested positive so he was out of school for a whole week yeah you know what I mean and and he's learned to, but they have to wear masks like mature sand it's like how how is he supposed to luckily he's he's a little more advanced already he just turned five in November. His little you know he's a little advanced but it's like man, this is crazy and then another one of the teachers just tested positive. So he was able to go to school, now because he wasn't in contact with him, but it's like you're saying this, if they sneeze or cough love is like that's what they normally do."
724.0,Provider,"Now, and you're in a school for kids like competencies and germs like it's. it's a real problem man."
7549.0,Patient,yeah so yeah it's.
724.0,Provider,"it's tough it's tough for everybody, but you know what I mean like it's tougher. i'm sure like i'm sure like a lot of the old school administrators and the teachers are just fire like come on now, you know what I mean like they've been a teacher for 20 years and, like, of course, these kids are like that, but the states like nope. So the whole you know I mean like and it's got a break their hearts, I know, it does not speak with like my daughter's teacher is when we pick her up and they're like no they're tired of it to you know, maybe they're just like. everybody's burnt out on it it's."
7549.0,Patient,"cuz This basically is. is basically stopping people in a sense. Like their work, basically in the city thought I mean is stopping their work, teachers and i'm. Like all right here there's no like even people can go into restaurants and stuff you know what I mean now but it's affecting business, this is just this. is crazy and I don't know. Like I said, because a lot of people i'm seeing a lot of people wear masks you know they people are wearing masks but they said, the numbers are going back up like it."
724.0,Provider,"So yeah that's how it goes, though, you know what I mean like it's like these, like these pieces like these surges and then, if you look at last year's like pattern for the surge like that's how it went like like the hot states, because everybody goes there they. You know they spike and then they taper off and then it kind of ripples up and then it moves over and just it's, just like the natural pattern of like illnesses and stuff and. Like. it's never going to stop you know what I mean like the countries to open and accessible for. Everybody that. You can't control, you know what I mean, so you would expect, like like the the general population that do their best I mean like ask don't demand, you probably get."
7549.0,Patient,Much better or.
724.0,Provider,If you just ask Instead of demanding all the time It just seems. kind of silly but.
7549.0,Patient,"yeah that's true I swear is true that's like i'll say when we see people I don't tell people like being in the store now if i'm out on my own and somebody gives next to me and I got a mask on it's like a that's fine even still a get away from. get away from me in you, is fine if you don't worry oh man i'm wearing my mass because I don't I don't want to be in a sense, rude. consider it to you so don't do that to me, but you know we're we're not telling people that they can't be in the store if they don't have a mass born, you know what I mean, so I mean this. yeah how know at this point."
724.0,Provider,yeah I just wake up and I wait to see what changes every day so.
7549.0,Patient,So you can do.
