ID,Role,Message
726.0,Provider,hey. Look so comfortable.
5848.0,Patient,"I am it's very cold in the House today, so I was like. 10 bundle."
726.0,Provider,How have you been I haven't seen you after like in a long as.
5848.0,Patient,I know i'm so sorry.
726.0,Provider,We went now don't wait.
5848.0,Patient,"We went up to Washington and the House was saying all Kobe. was only we didn't so it was taking care of a quick. So before every appointment something went wrong, and I would end up staying up really early and I ended up sleeping through give witness sorry."
726.0,Provider,"So don't it's okay Oh, a lot of people have been getting covered and it's been kind of crazy I think everywhere, with it, because I think the holidays, like everyone got together and then, like all these people got sick."
5848.0,Patient,All spread it.
726.0,Provider,yeah i'd love.
5848.0,Patient,"To get take tests, no."
726.0,Provider,No yo.
5848.0,Patient,"that's really difficult because. It was like I can't tell if you're still sick or not I can't test you. And then, for me, like I started feeling sick couple days ago, so I don't even know if I have Kobe."
726.0,Provider,"Oh hey um who was that I was telling someone I was like even if you're not sure like make an appointment for like then whenever they have the next available one because you might need it by that time. Maybe. You just don't know um yeah but tell me, because I know that we're planning on going like camping with friends."
5848.0,Patient,yeah we did a. An off road trip up into the mojave desert. So we spent three days driving and having fun with a couple different groups. There was a lot of fun them. much needed.
726.0,Provider,yeah how did it feel being able to connect with nature and just being kind of disconnected from everything else.
5848.0,Patient,"Oh, I love it it's I love going camping because it's really relaxing for me. and being able to get away from everything is. it's awesome."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah. When you disconnect did you notice like what are the things on your daily routine of life on regular life that affect your well being or your sense of feeling good.
5848.0,Patient,"I don't think i've ever paid that much attention to, but. I think. Being away from people. Because usually it's people who. Stress me out. With social interactions. So it's really nice to be able to get away from that and not have to get on the face."
726.0,Provider,"yeah Is it because you were with people that you felt comfortable with or when you say social interactions so they have to do more with kind of like. You an error and then working and like that, like the difference between social interactions with people that you feel comfortable with, and then the ones that are complete strangers, that you have to interact with in some way."
5848.0,Patient,"I would call the group I went with close friends little I mean I only just met them recently um I think it's more of like. I really feel like I have to put on a face for everybody, except for me. Because of the stuff that I deal with physically with the. problems that I have with like eds and the pain that I. Get all over my body. Normally people don't want to know about it so. I put on a face, for most people. So it's nice not having to. pretend that i'm okay. i'm okay. No, I can just. Sit. You know, deal with. People. you're trying to give me their advice. On my life like if they see that i'm hurting or something there oh someone always got something. So. Like one of the we went to stay up at the House that we're going to be moving into soon. And it's owned by my boyfriend's best friend and he's a very opinionated individual. And he basically. scolded me because it was actually I had missed your appointment and because I slept through it. And he was like well if you were serious about your health you wouldn't have missed it sounds like."
726.0,Provider,Oh God.
5848.0,Patient,I don't think it was that deep I just it just.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"yeah um and then he he basically kind of just. made me feel like I didn't do anything. For myself, like. To take care of myself. And it's hard because usually my boyfriend's like agree with him and. I don't need this right now."
726.0,Provider,"Interesting he sounds like. Like most people that are fixers want to fix everything they want to like like any like anything that's even remotely uncomfortable you want to get rid of there is like going, how do we get rid of so it's not there anymore, or like the discomfort it's interesting."
5848.0,Patient,"And it's funny because his wife, she has really bad lupus. and basically doesn't seem to hurt you so. How do you like the business not fun."
726.0,Provider,"But what i'm sorry. Now, yes, now."
5848.0,Patient,But what were you asking sorry.
726.0,Provider,"i'm oh no that's Okay, no I forgot on."
5848.0,Patient,Did you just recently get your septum peers.
726.0,Provider,"In oh yeah yeah. Oh, thank you all that I try something new. you're like boy Thank you so much."
5848.0,Patient,As one of the things I was thinking about getting.
726.0,Provider,"You should totally get it it's um like it definitely hurts to get it done. And you have to use like they'll give you a bigger one, so it can heal with like this is the biggest right but it's healing but wanted to they could get like a nice ski one you know."
5848.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
726.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean I like it and it's like tattoos are very permanent for me so it's like. it's nice to have something that you can look at and then, if I get tired of it, I can just take it off if I want. You know it's like yeah, you have the choice, so please. So did you end up seeing the place that you're going to be moving into how do you feel about it now that you want to see it in person."
5848.0,Patient,"i'm really excited. The. The areas have been really nice and they're building it up really nice and we'll definitely be having to do some work on the apartment when we get into it, especially. in regards to. Like fixing it up in the kitchen need some help about the need some help. But i'm excited to get there. I love spending time with them. But yeah i'm excited. there's lots of things for me to do there, so I can entertain myself."
726.0,Provider,I meant a little bit more isolated right and where you're at now.
5848.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
726.0,Provider,"And I think Sophia to it's like um you know, for some people, people get energy out of being with a lot of people, and some people. Like not being with us and then new people is actually better for them and they think that in. You know, just like you live, your life and you get to know yourself a little bit better it's like you start to gauge how you feel and it sounds like. Because you were saying that it's very nice to be in a place where you're a little bit more isolated and so a it's almost like it'll be interesting to see how you feel once you're there compared to where you're at now. Just because I think you know your your emotions will indicate to you kind of like what's the right step for where you want to go. And it might be, it might be like a really nice change of pace for you."
5848.0,Patient,"So. I mean there's times when I want to be social but lately it's not. happening very often, especially with like the corporate stuff."
726.0,Provider,Are you connected with. On your own that you enjoy connecting with.
5848.0,Patient,"My boyfriend. there's like a few friends that I have some of them are in La and then. I feel like my boyfriend husband wife, I can be myself. So she you know she suffers from lupus so it's kind of like a I understand. yeah so we're able to kind of get along in that sense. And in other senses to. it's not just. me. But. Other than that it's hard to find people that uncomfortableness letting them know. kind of what i'm going through and i've been trying to be more open about it. Like when people ask me like Oh, you said you had a darkness when. You stayed home will was like Oh well, it was a therapy appointments for my head. I know it makes some people uncomfortable to know that, but I feel like it's time to stop letting this be so taboo."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"And I don't know if it's helping in any way, but i'm hoping being more truthful and honest about where I met with me. that's against."
726.0,Provider,"Well, I always when I think of like being more open to it's like the more you are who you are, as a person, the more you filter out the people that i'm not good, I not going to mesh with you, you know, like if. If you are just who you are and you're there in the moment with where you're at that moment, and you, you either encounter someone that's like a great. Support or someone that is at least non judgmental about it. And then you'll you'll start to see the ones that are more intolerant and you're going to be like oh i'm going to stay away from that person like they're not somebody i'm gonna. That we're gonna vibe like we're definitely not going to live, so it kind of just filters those people out more easily and it's almost like. Like Yes it kind of sucks because we want to connect with people but also there's just people that that you're either going to connect or not and it's just kind of. We, the way that the things seem to flow sometimes. yeah it's interesting."
5848.0,Patient,"I noticed that with like my best friend growing up. she's still very mormon and very much involved in the Church. and I she lives in Arizona, and so, when we talk on the phone, I can tell that there's a lot of differences now, and I feel like if I met her today I would probably not be friends with her because of just how judgmental she is. And I feel myself drifting from her. Because of the differences of opinion. kind of sucks because i've known him for so long, and I really do love her. But it's hard. it's hard being friends with people who don't alliance, those of you beliefs are your. feelings."
726.0,Provider,"of fear, what way um. What are like the major differences that you're seeing like when you talk to her compared to where you're at."
5848.0,Patient,"um. it's mostly her stance on certain things you know she's very much against. marijuana being used in any way, shape or form she thinks that people use it, the equivalent of people who use marijuana are like people who use heroin. We can harm. and You know i've told her that I use me and she's like. Whatever you want to do, but. yeah well see the ladder cry."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"And then there's also. The controversial the points you know. The whole. sexual assault type thing, because we have a mutual friend from high school who. She cheated on her husband and was taken advantage of by someone at work and the children getting pregnant and having kids and when we found out, you know she's like she's claiming she was sexually assaulted or that he manipulated her, but you know what you're doing when you have that. And i'm just like that's not entirely true. yeah sexual assault is real. And sometimes you're not aware of. what's happening because you're being manipulated into it. But I feel like that's something that we can't talk about because. she's not going to understand it and i'm just gonna end up revving myself. In fighting with her so it's. it's not even worth it."
726.0,Provider,And that hard to hear from her when you think about like. Just your own experiences that you've. Had on your own like does she know about goals or is that something that you've never discussed with her.
5848.0,Patient,"And i've never really discussed with her, really, really super deep stuff but she is aware of most of my problems because you know, over the years, things have come out. i've never really talked to her about when I was sexually abused. And that's probably one of the things that i've never. broach the topic with her, because I don't like spreading that around it's one of the things that I rarely talk about with people. Because it affected me so deeply as a child. I feel like, if I were to tell her then. Like her family would find out I just don't need things spreading yeah. But like she knows, most of the things she knows more things and most people I think my boyfriend knows the most but she's second."
726.0,Provider,Okay yeah yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"But it's hard, because I can see myself dripping. it's sad because I feel like we've shared a lot. Like her kid is. he's part of my life, whether I see him or not. But it hurts to hear that kind of stuff from. I don't think she realizes how judgmental shoes."
726.0,Provider,Imagine to win that community of people they're very like minded so she's probably not being challenged either about her viewpoints.
5848.0,Patient,"I think. She doesn't want to think logically about. are open, maybe or be open to the possibility of. Not knowing. Of. Explaining. How the sheep."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5848.0,Patient,But she doesn't question these completely. where she does she questions the wrong things. For different ones yeah.
726.0,Provider,"yeah. i'm wondering like. When we don't question things if it's to protect ourselves from knowing what we don't want to know, like, I wonder if. If, like underneath that is like i'm gonna deny this, because I don't want this to be a reality for me um. Or you know, sometimes like you know it'll it will destroy the foundations of what you grow up with too right like if if i'm being told a certain thing as soon as I was able to remember anything um it completely distorts what my current reality is because I grew up thinking this way. So."
5848.0,Patient,"And I feel like I understand that I was like that point like I was. Pretty aligned with my beliefs, for most of my life until I started. Until I started kind of hearing other people's perspective is over the years you do hear. people's viewpoints but being open to it. And I feel like. It was, until a couple years ago that I started being a little bit more open to what people are saying versus what I believe. And I feel like she's never. Really. opened himself to that."
726.0,Provider,"And you think that part of it is that. you've been vulnerable to the experiences as well you know, like when when let's say. It let's say nothing has happened to the other person so it's really hard for them to even from mostly. From what we understand something, because they can't even conceptualize it for themselves right totally different lives and all that um. So."
5848.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like that's. that's definitely heard because between two is I was more empathetic. The others, and I think that's just the abuse talking. But she's also always been there for me. Like anything involving my parents she's the one who's like listen, I know you love your parents, but they really have been bastards to you. So there are things that she still understands and she recognizes, I mean she knew that my parents were abusive for it."
726.0,Provider,Ah yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"Remember, when I talked to her about it she's like it's about time you came to this realization because i'm known for you."
726.0,Provider,that's so interesting that she she had seen that so she never outwardly said that that's what she thought you just it was like after you came to the realization.
5848.0,Patient,"yeah never really broke. Up it because it didn't really I wouldn't hear it. Because it was such a big fan of my parents. But then when I. started doing this work and talk to her a bit about some of the things she's like yeah parents have screwed up and i've known that for you. Like I know you love them and I love them too, but they they really shouldn't have done those things."
726.0,Provider,"there's a saying in Spanish, on his big fish."
5848.0,Patient,yeah I do.
726.0,Provider,"yeah so it's like i'm more Nokia Nokia symbian like someone you can love someone but it. Like it doesn't take away the fact that you know, like when they're not being great again not being good and made it made me think of that like. Like the feeling of loving someone, even though they were terrible you can still be there at the same time is as much as the anger and hate for them. At the same time. So it's not it's not so black or white it's just like this that that's the part where I think those are the great parts of the great parts of life it's like. Nothing or not everybody is totally evil are totally good it's just like we're all a mesh of like. radius melting pots of grey yes and there's. All the different versions of it so interesting."
5848.0,Patient,"that's actually something I wanted to bring up with you at some point cuz I really I recognize that i'm not very good with Gray areas. very black and white, but I don't know how to get better at that, because the Gray comes up i'm like no that doesn't make any sense."
726.0,Provider,"I yeah. So. So i'll ask them some questions about it, then when you think about Is it because I know you've said before that you have a hard time with Gray areas, what are the things that trigger you when you think of black or white thinking."
5848.0,Patient,"it's probably more like scenarios. That. I think anything involving kind of justice. Like. sexual assault. Robbing people. There was a really long time where I didn't comprehend the other side of abortion, but now i'm more open to it and I I recognize that it's necessarily that type of thing."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"Basically, like individual choices for people."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"And it's. Not being able to understand why someone would make the choice. That either hurts themselves or someone else that type of thing. But it can be like a Gray area for some reason. me justice is very blocked, or if you've done something where you're not supposed to do it, then you consequence and you move on. yeah I. am starting to recognize that it's not always the case. My boyfriend's really good at being the devil's advocate. And he's always trying to come, like throwing stuff whenever I bring up. like an observation, or something and it always throws me for a loop."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,And I can I can feel myself getting agitated and being not being able to understand the certain things where the certain viewpoints. into really not used to it.
726.0,Provider,"i'm i'm thinking because. Also, I think it goes into like, for example with calm um it's that feeling of. you've lived firsthand and justice, you know what I mean so it's like for you, it could be hitting all of those little wounded parts that are like. What is that that's not right, you know and it's so that guttural reaction that visceral reaction to something could also just be those wounded parts from your childhood that are kind of showing up. So it's like this is reflecting my my feelings of pain or my feelings of injustice from my own childhood like this is clearly wrong Why are people not seeing that and so. So sometimes I think. Our reactions do come from that wounded part of us, and it makes sense, like in childhood, we as a kid kids to think in black and white and so. If if a lot of your developmental ages, there was a lot of that your thoughts may be protecting you it's like this is not right, this is for you it's going to be black and white, because that's was that was your. yourself protector coming out as a kid it's like that was what was telling you that this was wrong because nobody else is telling you that this was wrong and you were a kid. Like you would expect an adult to say that this is not right, we should stop doing this, but you as a kid were the one that were that was experiencing and seeing it. And not getting the validation from the adults around you to say that that's not right can also be very much like. This is wrong, and this is it that's where you would see the black and white it's like there's it's either 100 or zero like no that's just that stop correct so sometimes if you're getting triggered by by. let's say someone's discussing something. Go back go back in yourself and think I live, and I think of this as an imaginary exercise it's like I create in my mind I create myself in a separate the feelings from me. So if I were to look at the feeling and I created an image of a feeling separate from me how am I going to see it when it's not if if it's not my what what what am I seeing now right because it's not it's not connecting with my will depart what is it what is that. And being curious like the best way to get through this thinking of black and white is get curious about that. Because the anger, the hurt or are the ones that are going to stop you from being curious to know more about it, just like you've been and I think you've been doing this with your boyfriend and sounds like like he'll play the devil's advocate. And it's interesting you're getting trigger. So."
5848.0,Patient,"All right, exactly just turn. A moment."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
5848.0,Patient,"roomba was needing attention. um. You will, since you mentioned it could it also be part of. Like the. I was sexually abused by three female cousins when I was younger and none of them ever got any sort of. punishment or anything, because nobody really knew about it."
726.0,Provider,yeah okay.
5848.0,Patient,That be part of it.
726.0,Provider,"It could be. It could be it could definitely be um at that time, did you tell anybody about the happen or."
5848.0,Patient,No.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"They told me not to say anything else, they would hurt me."
726.0,Provider,Right yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"I. feel like the animosity. towards two of them, one of them, not so much anymore i'm not sure why. I think it's because she was around the same age and she probably didn't know what she was doing. But the other ones were older. and I don't see myself ever forgiving them. ever. And I tend to be pretty forgiving to people. it's actually something i've talked to my mom about it because. I finally told her what had happened when I was like probably 21. And I think she wondered why I always hated. Two cousins or one cousin more than other. and She. I think she figured out on our own, that I was sexually abused, but anytime somebody brings up these two cousins where. I don't know what. But. anytime they come up i'm always like. I hope they fail. I hope they don't. know I. You don't do that, to a little kid. If you're a kid yourself. That all excuses like kids do to other kids what they had done to them i've never done that to somebody else i've never. done that, to a child to another person. So I don't understand that that concept of. They didn't know better. because to me, I did, and I was four years old. At the time, and then you know. i've been babysitting kids for years and there's no way on earth, that I would ever. Ever touch a child, like that or do anything to the child. And so that, even though they were children themselves that Gray area. seems very black tea."
726.0,Provider,"Think about them, do you still feel fear about what they they are. So scare you."
5848.0,Patient,I wouldn't say it's fear more than anger.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"I can, I can say with a lot of certainty that if one of them were to like come up to me and. Not that they would try anything because they don't even swing that way anymore, or I don't think they ever did. I would probably violently react. Very violently. And I tend to avoid them like they Thankfully they live in other countries, but anytime i've gone to visit and they're involved in some way, shape or form, I just. I don't want and I don't even know if they remember what happened. You know, unfortunately, I have very, very vivid memories, since I was like two years old. And so I remember everything perfectly when it comes to those traumas I don't know if they do."
726.0,Provider,That.
5848.0,Patient,"I remember like about a month ago, I was sitting at the dining table with my parents and my parents House and my grandma was there and they brought up one of the girls, the one that I really, really hate. and I don't remember the situation of why they brought her up. I think it was because she broke up with her fiance or something and I was like good for him, he dodged a bullet. And my grandma was like don't see that that's not very nice and I was like listen. Viana is not very nice in fact she's a bit of a shift. And she's like you can only mean like that, and I was like yes, I can I have my reason and I every. Day hate her and every right to wish awful things. And she looked at my mom and my moms like she does have the reason. That really was helpful that my mom recognize that I That was something that was born. In fact, when my mom found out. She was livid. Because I think she suspected it because of things that I would do when I was younger. And older. But she never really. found out until I actually opened it up and I didn't know I didn't recognize that I was sexually assaulted. Because. Like the sex ED classes when they start playing those videos. People were sexually abused and i'd always be like wow i'm so glad I never had to deal with him. was very much sexually abused."
726.0,Provider,"So at four years old, you you just you know it doesn't feel right like whatever is happening is not right, but you can't like a go and identify it. yeah."
5848.0,Patient,"I remember the whole thing very. It was. it's horrible it's horrible to think about. I hate the flashbacks that again. And I feel like I get them more when people talk about sexual assault. And I feel like most people don't understand. the depth of the pain and the trauma if they haven't experienced it themselves like people wonder why certain people act so violently. When things get brought up about that stuff and. it's kind of like no you don't understand those are the feelings that we feel when we think about that kind of thing. I feel I feel like most people don't want to know the depths of that. So it's kind of like they'll touch it and be like oh yeah that's not good, or I don't know if that was real. And then you know people like me will be like. hold the phone. i'm going to slap you."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
5848.0,Patient,"And it's kind of like always been that way. When it involves things like that when people do something to somebody. And it's funny because I feel like. My experience made me. Really scared of the female population for years. I didn't want any girls touch me I didn't want to be heard, they didn't want to. Nothing. is still kind of reflects into today to i'm not a very touchy feely person. The only person i'm touchy feely with is my boyfriend. Even growing up with like my parents, the only person I would want to hug from is my mom anybody else don't touch me. And so, growing up, I would always hang out with like my uncle and with his friends who are all boys and I would always feel safer with them, I always felt safer with men ironically enough. It was going with that I forgot."
726.0,Provider,"I had a question in my mind, because, like, I remember this from before in a different session that we had, and it was that you had like that conflict internal conflict of like. um like sexuality as being, even though you're not you're not attracted to females, but having like that. It was like."
5848.0,Patient,It was a fear.
726.0,Provider,"That belief that belief that fear of it, and I wonder if it's tied into that that experience of thoughts like that, where that came from."
5848.0,Patient,"yeah i'm because, for me, you know my first sexual experience was with a woman and. When I think. Of. Women in general. I usually don't like them. Like I can't. Stand women, for the most part i'm seeing a really long time for me to start making female friends like my best friend, she was the only thing over and I had for years. And I didn't start making female friends until I think I was in college and like accepted the fact that I was sexually abused and recognize that not every woman is that way. But it's still that like fear of Am I not listening to myself. Am I not recognizing that, even though I know for a fact that i'm not attracted. it's like the fear of not. Knowing, who I am. Since i've. been kind of a chameleon most of my life we're all blend into whatever is happening around me. And I never really figured out what I like or what I want to do that type of thing. it's going off of that. Like do I not recognize myself to the point where, even though I feel like i'm not attracted to women, where it's like oh you actually are. That have to say."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I. Think that's partly due to the fear of the common like nothing coming then in particular book even any anything, not even attraction, but just seeing someone thinking Oh, that person is suitable but. That yeah it's not like. it's the fear of becoming them becoming like them, that really is the thing that's really. Because it, it sounds like the your consciousness sounds like the conscious mind and the subconscious mind are like this, all the time. This conflict and conflict."
5848.0,Patient,"And it's weird because. I feel like with the conflict it's something that pops up anytime like all that goes really pretty or something like that um. I don't know what to. do with it because I recognize, I know I know that i'm straight. I don't you know anytime. i've been. propositioned by a woman or. anytime i've thought really deeply about it, you like Is this something that I need to address I don't. I know it's not there. But it's like that fear of what if i'm wrong."
726.0,Provider,And I feel like that affects me in every.
5848.0,Patient,"thing I do not just. In that so it's like what if i'm wrong about religion, what if i'm wrong about God, what if i'm wrong about all this stuff. is just a fear of being wrong."
726.0,Provider,"I would, I would think of it this like nothing of it this way, but ask yourself is think of. i'm going to make a comparison, so you look at a work of art like let's go to museum and you see a piece, and it looks really beautiful right it's like all I love the colors of this. And the way I I I understand in my mind like let's say sexuality is. If i'm looking at someone in the just look really beautiful and there's. there's a difference between having a sexual attraction and just having an attraction to something just because of what it is so taken aside whether female or male it's like Am I seeing this person as just who they are like a piece of art. This this this portrait has such beautiful colors and like how it looks good in my in my. kitchen or whatever you want to compare it to and so when you're in these interactions with other people, and the question that happens it's like. All right, can I see this objective free just for what it is maybe that's just a beautiful person, maybe Maybe she or he has really beautiful facial features because what's what's really the thing that's hoping you is the fear the fear of. Like What if what, if I am really attracted to her as a woman, then. Then I think that's where we get into that ruminating thoughts or that can trigger part so like if you see something if you see a person and see a situation, how can you look at it objectively away from you know just for what it is right, nothing to do with sexuality nothing to do, whether. You know you want them are not like you know you're with your boyfriend that you are attracted to him as a person like that it's a different kind of relationship. And that's how Maybe you can gauge your environment and people around you or people that you see it's like. All right, am I looking at them and in in the objective way in life, they have great features, they have great qualities about them, but it when we think about it as being or identity of who we are that's a totally different thing right who we are, as people isn't just based on. Who am I sexually attracted to right there's so many different parts to a person that exist, apart from that. Sorry, if that was a bit long winded."
5848.0,Patient,No it's fine I actually I never. thought of it that way. But it makes a lot of sense. That makes you feel better about it.
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I think um you know, especially with sexuality it's it's not a black or white thing, sometimes, and I think that's. The time that we're in Now people are more much more exploratory with it, and everything and so think of it as like an umbrella right there's people that will be somewhere in the middle, some people are will be more this way or that way and it's all it is is you know. teaching. Teaching like. Like like we said, like seeing people as what they look like sometimes you can see someone and think they're absolutely beautiful. Does it mean you want to go and sleep with that though right it's just that there's something about them that's really beautiful that you really like and so, if you can. Just even a little bit practice it like when you go out when you interact with people is, how can see them as objectively as possible without the fear of the sexuality part. or even if you have it, you know you know it's there, the lesson i'm going to try and determine the tried different way and look to look at the situation. Because it could be the fear of the four year old it's like the four year old is going to be terrified like, of course, a four year old would be scared. I mean any four year old would be terrified of the situation didn't feel good to know. You have blank so so then for yourself, you can think about Sophia at for what would you how would you want to feel Okay, I want to feel safe all right. What are the steps that I can do to make myself feel safe right, and then you start going back anything all right. I have, I live with my boyfriend now, I have a safe place to stay I don't have to interact with my family over time I have all these different things that i'm doing they're helping me feel safer than what I did at that time. So I mean it's something that if you wanted to you could do processing with mtr. Know whenever you feel like you would be ready for it. Especially if you think it's kind of it's kind of. affecting the way you see a lot of other things."
5848.0,Patient,So maybe.
726.0,Provider,"Like I think about a four year old just because, like I think of a four year old, and I think of what do they do to make themselves feel better. And so just and you've worked with kids right, and you know kids are like like a four year old just wants to play wants to watch cartoons wants to have a fun time they're not really thinking about. they're not deeply thinking about sexuality it, you know that's, not even in their awareness of that point, probably, or maybe it is, but very little. I mean. I."
5848.0,Patient,"know it makes sense. But how do you reason, with a four year old."
726.0,Provider,"So so there's not really like interesting part about it right is that with the four year old, and I only say that because. I have a four year old, so I see it every."
5848.0,Patient,day you know.
726.0,Provider,"So. Like if you think about the four year old like I know it sounds ridiculous, because at where you're at now you're like i'm a grown adult like there's no way that this is going to work for me right, but. Think of a four year old and think of. activities that they like to do, and so, for example, I was, I was reading this like a long time ago and it's like this kid had a really bad experience going to the dentist and that, so the parent was like Okay, how do I make it easier for this person. For this kid to feel better about going to the dentist. So it's always play therapy right, this is why they call they have like some sort of therapy that's specifically acting so you're acting things out. You could do this, and I know you could do this for yourself, nobody watching you in your private moment it's you can do it for yourself and say. All right, i'm gonna pretend it even writing stuff down so for four year old you're not writing sentences you're not doing any of that the color they play they they use Plato right, I would even for yourself cuz you know how you are sometimes will dissociate. It makes sense, get some Plato like a little kid Plato, to help you get back and movement so you're not getting stuck. If i'm if i'm grounded if I find some grounding technique i'm going to be better able to be here in a moment, and so, incorporating that for that four year old self because a four year old self it's like. I want to get out of here. At a four year old self just wants to have fun play you know, recognizing how a conversation I would even write it down for you is like, if I had a conversation with my four year old self okay i'm going to write. I was really scared you jot down all the feelings that showed up for you as a kid right, so you can say I had flashbacks I can asleep at night, I was scared I couldn't I was scared to tell my mom I was scared to tell my dad right the feeling so okay. And that's the first step and then work from there is, I wanted to just jot down the feelings that showed up for you as a kid you were four years old. Okay, just write down the general feeling, so this is an exercise that that I do with other people and I write the major feelings. And then I think about what's the opposite of that feeling so whenever the opposite of the negative feeling yes it's different for everybody, by the way, which is violent you choose it if if mine is fear why positive would be 60 I want to say. If my feeling was anxiety, I want to feel calm. If my feeling was sadness, I want to feel joy, I want to feel happiness right because I don't want to be saddled with time it's okay to feel sorry about yourself time. Just dropped on the negative feelings and then our next session we're going to work with that and we'll go to the next step of it. Okay okay."
5848.0,Patient,we'll do this.
726.0,Provider,"Yes, we have another set up."

726.0,Provider,"yeah we're having next week on the 17th on Monday at 9am. Yes, perfect yep so just think about the feelings and just write them down that's all you have to do you don't have to do anything else just write down the feelings or showed up at that age and then we'll work with that okay."
