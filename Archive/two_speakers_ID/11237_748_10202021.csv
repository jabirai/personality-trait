11237.0,Patient,hi Karen.
748.0,Provider,How are you.
11237.0,Patient,"i'm good i'm good, how are you."
748.0,Provider,that's wonderful to hear i'm good give me one second because somebody came to my waiting room at the wrong time and I need to let that virtual clinic no.
11237.0,Patient,She isn't good.
748.0,Provider,"Okay i'll be right back. you for your patience very, very. I really appreciate it, I the other person thought that they had an appointment, at one and didn't go to the virtual clinic."
11237.0,Patient,Oh okay yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Right to my room Oh, I know you're the one scheduled. Because you're on my calendar, so how can I support you. Today what's going on."
11237.0,Patient,"that's a um so for today I i'm actually at my friend's house right now and. You know if it's okay with you like, when she needs to leave like I don't know how you would like like I don't mind like if we're on the phone are but like if there's a policy against that that's Okay, too, I just thought i'd let you know."
748.0,Provider,"yeah you know I am because i'm so new I don't think. I know there's a policy against it, if you're in a group. Because of course. As then other people can be heard and that's a violation of their hipaa. yeah and their sense of safety. Even more importantly than law to me is how that people be comfortable, but if you're not comfortable I mean if you're not uncomfortable with it. I you know that's totally up to you."
11237.0,Patient,Oh yeah I mean this is like my best friend word. It doesn't matter to me.
748.0,Provider,"Save that and. Yet, of course, I may be wrong about the policy, but then it's my mistake and i'll take responsibility for that."
11237.0,Patient,"it's okay it's a really short car ride to like i'm literally going home and we live two miles apart, so it happens, but it's okay so um let's see I did want to ask you if there were no left by Tara. Or, if I have to like start over and unload."
748.0,Provider,"What you know what I would love is because this is happening for a number of people, of course, and. i'm I tend to not to read other people's notes a lot, especially with some of the ways that they are structured because it's not as personal. I don't need you to go into all of your history i'd rather you talk about what I mean I would love to know, of course, but, but I would love to you for you to start with what's true for you today, and if I feel a need to ask questions I will has that."
11237.0,Patient,sure.
748.0,Provider,And if you want to go into history first and that feels like the best way to start that's also fabulous okay.
11237.0,Patient,"yeah I don't really mind um so let's see today it's a pretty easy going day for today, I do have to like. leave the House which I always dread, but still do."
748.0,Provider,What What would the House i'm sorry.
11237.0,Patient,"Oh, I just eventually have to leave the House today to run errands and things like that. After I dropped my bird off i'm like change so um this weekend is going to be a good friend's wedding and not only my attending, but I am also. doing her hair and makeup in addition to like a few bridesmaids and, like the mother of the bride as well as the mother of the groom so thankfully I have someone to help me and I won't be doing it all myself, I was initially feeling a little salty. Because about a month ago she and I had you know facetime thing and we were just talking about like how the itinerary for the day would look. And that's when I learned that the expectation, for her. Was that like we would be taken care of hair and makeup like originally when we had spoken last year, I had let her know hey. i'll do hair and makeup for you as long as you show me what style you want, and I can do it, but otherwise not for the other people um because you know I primarily specialize in applying makeup. Oh, but. You know I. Am really close to getting my Cosmetology license so I mean, I know how to do these things it's just last year when we made the agreement that. I was going to be doing this for her it was like a strict like okay yeah type of thing and then last month, it was just I think it just kind of got like muddled essentially and now that it's like so close I she wasn't and I wasn't able to find like a person to like do care. And, thankfully, like the things that she's expecting are not like super foods to perform superfluous to the point where like you know it would be excessive, for me, and like unattainable. And I guess the only downside so far that I can see is that i'll have to start at 5am on Friday. What I did there, like, I have an early fee like if you need. Like because we have to do this, this certain way, like you're gonna have to pay me extra and she was like yeah well there's no extra what there's no other way, so I don't mind, and I was thankful about that um. and I don't know I just have come to terms with the fact that, like you know i'm just going to be getting double the money, so I guess time. that's, all I can do, I can't do anything."
748.0,Provider,yeah. Did you feel as though your boundaries or your original agreement wasn't respected or do you honestly feel it was a misinterpretation or a bride being a bride and not hearing what she didn't want to hear or. So that you're in acceptance surrounded or do you think there's a chance that could come back and buy.
11237.0,Patient,"So i'm, the only thing that I confer see as an issue because i'm also attending and the wedding isn't until like four o'clock pm. The expectation originally was that we're going to finish at 1pm and but now she wants us to finish at 1230 so as long as I can, like pull through and like you know speed through all of us, because, like. At this point I don't care anymore weddings in two days I can do it, like, I know I can I have. it's not my preferred thing, but like you know going forward I. First of all, you know she's not a horrible person, and I know she's not doing it to be like you know shitty to me and she's not trying to like forced me to do it like we both try to. find somebody else, but because there was a short notice and like everybody's getting married right now, because, like you know the corporate restrictions in the Bay area are finally like relaxing. it's a busy time. So we're working with what we have, because I, on one hand. wouldn't normally be doing this, but on the other hand, like you know it's not as though she was like you have to do this for me like there's no she's not bending my arm behind my back."
748.0,Provider,"Great I can really feel how relaxed, you are around her presentation of the new. And you're more working through it, so that makes perfect sense great. And will you be okay, as far as sleep is that. And super you already look through that as long as you get to catch up by Saturday."
11237.0,Patient,"So, ideally, I because we're also going to be staying there The night before like Thursday, which is actually tomorrow tomorrow we're going to be staying the night there I won't have to worry about like waking up early in the morning and driving there, which is going to be great. And in addition like you know I do occasionally have times, where like i'm so nervous that I can't sleep, but like. i've i've learned how to like circumvent that. Whether it just be like trying super super hard to wind down early like watching videos with like you know the soft soothing voices and like listening to the 440 hertz little audio thing with drugs. or even like you know, taking CBD it just there's. i'm going to be able to like get rest and i'm not like super worried about."
748.0,Provider,"Great great you've already thought that, through which is powerful. Yes, we're in a space of being aware of the need for self care around because five o'clock is early. yeah i'm sure that doesn't come as a big surprise or news to you. mm hmm it's yeah it is it's early so okay all right."
11237.0,Patient,"So, as far as in between me being done, and having to attend the ceremony i'm hopefully i'll be able to get a nap in but otherwise I am pretty sure i'll be fine I have done way worse with my sleep schedule and still been able to do important things."
748.0,Provider,And enjoyed yourself.
11237.0,Patient,"Yes, that enjoy."
748.0,Provider,"To me, is. is really not will you be able to do it because we push ourselves through things all the time, especially something that you're clearly passionate about since you're entering for it and and then also it's a dear friend, so you're looking forward to the wedding. But, but also that you get to enjoy. You know that's what I was really looking at is is that a setup for you to be. Not not able to have it be something you enjoy but it sounds like it'll be fine."
11237.0,Patient,yeah I mean i'm pretty sure it will be okay um I have gone no sleep and still enjoyed myself. Nothing a little coffee won't fix right.
748.0,Provider,Oh well.
11237.0,Patient,"it'll be fine really. So that's like the biggest thing that's coming up right now and. I think you know and i'm in a really good headspace to kind of just like. be able to do this, I mean I wanted this to be my profession for a really long time, and I feel as though i've put forth so much effort to get here. And you know with the presence of coven I blew through all my savings like having to keep myself alive and that sucked so like you know it's not going according to plan the way that I would have wanted it to, but at the same time, this will have been my fourth bridal party in 30 days."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's fabulous."
11237.0,Patient,"yeah like one every two weeks, and so that's really nice and I think just. it's only a matter of time before I can't rebuild myself and like you know actually have the finances to like do marketing things and all that other stuff so i'm just trying to be patient with myself Sometimes I feel really irritated. That like I didn't. get to where I wanted to be by the end of last year and. There were times, where I felt like oh yeah like you know you drop the ball by saying no to all these people who wanted to get married during COPA, but then I thought to myself, like. Why the Fuck would I subject myself to that like we're breathing the same air like yes, I would be wearing a mask but like what difference, would it make it like the person who I was doing the makeup on like. Was infected with Kobe, then I couldn't do anything you know, I was. So."
748.0,Provider,"That. That was about health. care and extenuating circumstances, of course. And it's a good opportunity to look at those inner voices that were all ready to malign you and tell you, you have done it wrong and and really identify where whose voices that really. Where did it come. from and how can I transform it, how can I, you know more or less amputate that person for my head and say sorry can no longer live here rent free. And instead invite in the new book that's more compassionate and thoughtful and caring."
11237.0,Patient,"Right exactly um so I kind of feel like there's something around the corner. Oh. i'm not really sure what yeah but. At the same time, if there's something so that it's comforting. I just want to make sure overall that i'm like financially stable enough to like. just allow myself to slow down for once. I feel like I did get like the maximum amount of rest that I would have ever gotten. have ever gotten in my entire life during the presence of code, because I decided not to go back to work, and even though everybody was like yeah well. You totally should because you need to stay alive, somehow, and I was like yeah but, like, I have been a contributing taxpayer, since I was 16 like there's a reason why we have unemployment insurance yeah i'm not go to waste because. I might as well take care of myself, for once, because i've never been allowed to take care of myself."
748.0,Provider,For you.
11237.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm. Now that I feel as though i'm ready to. reincorporate like a working routine I feel more at peace than I probably would have just like forcing myself to do it during a global pandemic, where I have to be in close quarters with other people. And i'm thankful for the fact that, like you know I can do that. I understand that there's like so many other people out there who don't have that option and that's just kind of like what keeps me going like the fact that I have that option means that I don't want to waste it."
748.0,Provider,"But for you really positive outlook really. Not just a positive outlook, but a perspective, like I get this picture of you, having this really full picture and utilizing it in a very positive way for yourself and your future. Yes, wonderful It makes me wonder, and I know I said, I would ask you about your background will call me a liar you know call me a liar and with full accuracy. What brought you to break hurt in the first place."
11237.0,Patient,"I have suspected for a really long time that i've ADHD. i've known for like my most of my life like two thirds of my life that I was depressed. Had like the tools or the ability or the time to take care of myself in that way. And like. Of course, the anxiety that's coupled with like not having the tools to navigate life, even though, like. I feel I always felt like you know, even though there's an instruction manual it's an old English I don't understand."
748.0,Provider,"I don't know where the instruction manual is. If you find it please, no matter what language. It is yeah together, we could find translators. yeah i'm not so sure about that or there is one it's. instantly available to about 1% of the population and they aren't the richest people. So it's a different 1%."
11237.0,Patient,"you're ready. Alright, so we are going to pack. You get a little bird boy here, oh no USA. Doing his little annoying bird thing conspiratorial oh oh. I have to go chase him to put him back in the. cage he does not like that. um. yeah so primarily I felt as though it was time for me to like. discover what exactly it was that made me feel like shit all the time. and it's been at least three years since I started having the inkling of like me potentially having ADHD. And it came about after I read this like 40 page peer reviewed article about like the presence of ADHD in like female bodied people and how it's often overlooked and ignored. or miss diagnose."
748.0,Provider,yeah.
11237.0,Patient,"So when I was looking at it and I was like holy geez okay what am I going to find i'm. prone to daydreaming. The thing all the executive dysfunction. memory that isn't good. Either binge eating or opposite i'm chasing dope mean. cetera like all the classic things. And I was looking at this article, and I thought to myself my God like. i've been living like this for my whole life. Is this why I don't understand how to do things all the time. um why I have to why I feel as though I have to overcompensate essentially by like figuring out how to do things that normal circumstances, would allow somebody to just pick up automatically. And it felt as let as though, like. I finally had clarity. Like it was the biggest Aha moment of my life. yeah. So right before it happened, I. had spoken to my mother who um we didn't always have a fantastic relationship. growing up, I did feel as though, like you know because of the circumstances um. She unintentionally like ignored, a lot of science, that should have been taken care of like way earlier. And like you know the unintentional look like, even though she does whatever she can out of love. There could have been some kind of facilitation. And essentially I sat down with her, and I was like mom I think I need to talk to somebody and she's like a woody mean like yeah, of course, like everybody benefits from therapy and I was like yeah I know, but like. You know i've been feeling this way for my entire life, I feel as though i'm the last lamb, or like. i'm usually. I yes. I told her like I almost entirely certain that I have ADHD and she looked at me and she was like. You know what maybe and I kind of had this flashback essentially of like when I was young, and I wasn't like fully paying attention all the time and, like you know she would tell me to do something, or I was supposed to do work for school or whatever, this is for you. know what."
748.0,Provider,"i'm losing you right now, while."
11237.0,Patient,What was that.
748.0,Provider,I was losing you as you were moving through the.
11237.0,Patient,house oh sorry.
748.0,Provider,that's okay. I got a bit.
11237.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so I mean it's having that flashback was kind of like shitty because I was like oh my God like yes, I actually did. I actually did mom um but then she kind of got this like sorrowful look on her face and It made me feel as though, like huh. yeah and It made me feel it was finally listening, for the first time. That."
748.0,Provider,We had a moment in.
11237.0,Patient,"It was it really was. Because even though. She had expressed sorrow and regrets. and basically serve me enough. She was a single mother from what's happening like. I told her like. You look okay yeah. she's going on a date today. yeah. So i'm going back to that you know I told her straight up like yeah, of course, it was shooting and of course it hurt, but like. You don't know what you were supposed to do."
748.0,Provider,yeah and. i'm probably overwhelmed with so many things as well.
11237.0,Patient,"Right. Like 10,002 things. At least your cars. You want to get back. yeah so overall like, finally coming to an understanding it just felt, so I don't know powerful. I feel like. Even though we have you know not gotten along in the past and then like you know gotten to a place where we understand each other, and we have the dynamic. This. level of understanding was never like actually felt before, so it was like very brand new for me anything for her to kind of like forced her to take a look at like. What she can do going forward with my youngest sister. Sometimes I get a little envious because my younger sister who just turned 12 is pretty much allowed to be exactly the way that she is which actually reminds me very much of myself."
748.0,Provider,She doesn't really tell.
11237.0,Patient,hmm.
748.0,Provider,"Go ahead, I said I was going to ask that, because it sounded like that's what you were saying."
11237.0,Patient,"she's a major space cadet she's a very intelligent person who has a lot of creative capabilities. She doesn't like talking to people, and I remember being like that I remember like being berated by this annoying on that I have like oh yeah you're so anti social why can't you just be like everybody else, like you, don't know how to talk. But you know these days. Because she's the youngest and like because my mom has had like the opportunity to. zoom out. And really look at like. You know the possibility of my sister probably being exactly like me. It gives my sister, the ability to like. grow in a space that is. That is what is it called."
748.0,Provider,Healthy.
11237.0,Patient,"Yes, healthy, safe, etc."
748.0,Provider,yeah that would be really hard to.
11237.0,Patient,Accept oh.
748.0,Provider,I said it would be really hard to accept or or take in not accept because I know you can see it from a bigger perspective and do all that work but hard to take in and witness her getting what you needed so bad.
11237.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Like i'm as painful, as I am. Like G will occurs, that would have been fucking fantastic. yeah sure um. But i'm thankful that she has me i'm thankful that she has like. A more supportive system. You know, growing up, I was the oldest so our middle sister is good support for her to and so. Its. Overall i'm not really worried."
748.0,Provider,"No, no, it sounds like her needs are being met rather significantly and. The reflection of what you didn't get as what's painful."
11237.0,Patient,"And sometimes I wonder like. If I have done enough for myself, but I think, overall, I can say, like. today. As of today, looking back on like all of the things that i've been able to accomplish, even if it was just small things. I am proud of myself, I am okay."
748.0,Provider,"And it really feels like you have taken your self care to a level that I don't see in a lot of people just so you know I mean I get I get that you advocated for. yourself. And said I need help and that's how you ended up at breitbart but what I really here. Is that you proactively have. been seeking out information and. tools and utilizing them not just talking about them, but utilizing them in a way that's empowered you significantly."
11237.0,Patient,"Yes, I agree very much so. So, as far as like you know getting. The help that I need and the tools that I definitely am pretty. happy with the progress i've made over the last few months. I think I started in May, and it was definitely like a very. Different time. I had just moved and life felt really chaotic and I felt like I was in suspension and I essentially thought like. Even if I. exercise and eat right and wake up early and let the sun hit my face something seems a little off stone. So. Maybe it's time now that I have an unlimited amount of time to do things I might as well. I might as well do whatever it is that they asked me so. It wasn't until I think late me. I was pushed prescribed with the trend, but like the moment it had taken effect, I really feel as though, like. That was. Not not the last thing that I need it, I would love to have like you know, an impervious amount of like financial security, so I never have to worry about anything ever again, but like emotionally internally to kind of like. Give that extra push to be able to do things like I don't have to think twice about whether or not I want to get out of bed and finished my laundry anymore I don't have to. Basically, do mental acrobatics to complete simple tasks, or like you know. convince myself. That like. I need to do important thing I just can't do that."
748.0,Provider,that's huge that's i'm sure I would imagine that must be like a miracle in your life.
11237.0,Patient,"yeah totally I mean i've never felt like that, before I never felt the silence. That i've experienced and I also like you know it's an awfully and will trigger for ADHD and also helps with like anxiety and like depression and things like that so like. I guess the Nice side effects are that it also takes care of seasonal affective disorder which I had a really hard time with them, because you know how the bay area weather is it's different in every city and like it's a different climate at a different times."
748.0,Provider,Every single day like.
11237.0,Patient,"So, with the incorporation of medication, I feel a little bit more like at ease. Rather than like. all over the place, and of course it's not like you know. I never expected it to take care of every single thing that's wrong with me, but everything that i've experienced this far as really positive for the first two weeks, I had like. tinnitus. But like I also didn't care because i've always had tinnitus it was just louder."
748.0,Provider,Okay.
11237.0,Patient,"So I stopped having it after two weeks and I was just like Okay, is this going to be the only side effect. I know that when you read the papers this like laundry list of stuff because it's also like you know, an antidepressant and sometimes body chemistry doesn't always allow for these things to go completely spindly, but I am really grateful that like. it's, the first thing that i've tried and it just stuck."
748.0,Provider,That is fabulous and it sounds like it's been about six months is that accurate.
11237.0,Patient,I think just about. yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Which is absolutely wonderful, it also sounds like you have utilized a lot of resources outside of bright heart, in addition to incorporating break heart like you look for information, information you research you listen to things on I at least heard YouTube and. i'm yeah other sources and are you are reader."
11237.0,Patient,you read oh yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, it seems like this probably true have you heard of gabor my take."
11237.0,Patient,On more time.
748.0,Provider,God bore my last name is spelled ma to eat with an accent mark on the east.
11237.0,Patient,"No, but I. take it back."
748.0,Provider,I. can't hear you you pick a spot where you're not coming. Through so i'm looking forward to hearing what you're saying I don't know if you can hear me.
11237.0,Patient,I know it's frozen.
748.0,Provider,yeah yeah we were both. you're still a little frozen. But it's getting better I think you're in an area where you're not connecting.
11237.0,Patient,yeah i'm around. A little. bit so.
748.0,Provider,"yeah that's what it felt like Okay, so what were you what were you going to say a backup or Monday."
11237.0,Patient,Oh um I would definitely be interested in taking a look.
748.0,Provider,"So he is one of the. One of the current experts in the field of. personal growth trauma. addiction and, of course, that leads into all kinds of other things that have to do with."
11237.0,Patient,"Thanks dude i'll see you later i'm gonna get back into my house and connect to wi fi and yeah we're gonna go from there, thanks for letting me ramble on the car ride on my phone please Dr Dave love you. or a better connection now that i'm connected to wi fi."
748.0,Provider,Oh it's definitely getting better.
11237.0,Patient,Good I pay top dollar for Google fiber I mean Google fiber agency fiber.
748.0,Provider,cool.
11237.0,Patient,yeah so um.
748.0,Provider,And we're in the Bay area are you.
11237.0,Patient,I forget live in oakland.
748.0,Provider,You do live in oakland.
11237.0,Patient,"Yes, I do. Like to Berkeley for about two. years but I was born here and I spent the majority of my life here."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's exactly where I am."
11237.0,Patient,Oh Nice.
748.0,Provider,"And so what I was saying about government. Today is that he he's a brilliant and powerful. In fact, I will."
11237.0,Patient,link to anything that you want me to see specifically.
748.0,Provider,"Well, what I was going to mention is that he he's an expert in the field with trauma and and addiction and and those are the things that he's known for. But he also he's a medic he's a physician who's worked in the field of addiction and and brain chemistry for years and. He is also identified the huge role that dopa mean plays and ADHD."
11237.0,Patient,He so he was the one.
748.0,Provider,And he has a no he wasn't belt one.
11237.0,Patient,day one.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, one and he's also just really good at transmitting information I think and. I, and I love his part, they have a book about ADHD. That I. Excellent it does look at it from the perspective of you, but that could be very healing to the young part of you, and he didn't identify a zone until he was definitely an adult in his 50s. wow so it might source and the name of his book is scattered."
11237.0,Patient,"scattered couple much i'm just gonna put that into my thing and screenshot or, just in case I lose it. i've seen pictures of him before."
748.0,Provider,"Well i'm i'm not surprised, there is a documentary that was done on him and his work this year that the first time they showed it and it was supposed to be shown for one weekend there were over 4 million views worldwide. And, as a result, they had to show it again and again, and it still comes up fairly regularly. You may be able."
11237.0,Patient,I would give netflix.
748.0,Provider,"know now gone through the people who made the documentary, which is a group called. Science and non duality. But the name of the documentary is the wisdom of trauma."
11237.0,Patient,yeah okay um. I think I would want to watch this as it is.
748.0,Provider,"It is powerful, I will say that a significant amount of the. Of the attention, especially in the film itself their breakout sessions that happen when they show it, which is tmi but just. A lot of it is is focused on addiction. A lot of it is focused on. The reason for addiction. And the quote, that is. Over and over and over again that I absolutely love that has become pretty viral is down to ask why the addiction as why the pain."
11237.0,Patient,"Yes, oh, my goodness, I think. I think a lot of people because of the ways that like you know society is essentially marketed to us. People feel a certain way about addiction and they kind of just like overlook the underlying aspect of it, and when people bring it up, I think, in congregation. The framework of it is. Essentially, like Oh, why do you want me to feel sorry for junkies and i'm like. nobody's asking you to feel sorry for junkies. But it is definitely like. Not a justification, but a reason, and the fact that, like you know, these things are overlooked. Because we're expected to individually like garden ourselves in a society that makes us pay for water. Like it's very difficult."
748.0,Provider,"yeah and and it isn't the thing I always say, is it it isn't as if anybody in their high. High School Yearbook says. Oh, my dream is to become a junkie and live on the streets right, I mean if that's where we end up there is a mental health component that significant know."
11237.0,Patient,"for fun they do drugs, because they have a problem they have breast."
748.0,Provider,"yeah and if it becomes that severe. Then there's something else going on as well, and the pain is really acute and you know most most judgment comes from a fear that that could be me."
11237.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Exactly it's just that it's unknown so anyway i'm i'm not i'm bringing most of that up just as a way to explain who government a is as a as a being he's this. Big ball of compassion, but also wisdom and brilliance and although the focuses on addiction, and that is that your issue. In it, there are layers and layers of what he presents that applies to so many of us, and may actually be."
11237.0,Patient,healing.
748.0,Provider,"For you, especially around the ADHD."
11237.0,Patient,yeah i'm definitely down to like do a little bit more reading and hopefully we'll be able to find like an outlet to watch the documentary on.
748.0,Provider,"I would think you I think you will be able to when it comes up again, I will do my best to remember to notify you. Because I will find out. and Probably what I will do with email you I don't know how often you check email."
11237.0,Patient,Oh yeah I have the notifications on.
748.0,Provider,or i'll tell you in this session.
11237.0,Patient,that's okay too so i'm.
748.0,Provider,Back to you.
11237.0,Patient,And we have 11 minutes left okay. just wanted to see where we are.
748.0,Provider,We actually only have about six minutes because I need five minutes between sessions to sort of. get ready for the next one.
11237.0,Patient,"Okay yeah Okay, no yeah and then. I guess like since we're talking about addiction i've never really identified with the feeling of addiction. it's kind of interesting I definitely feel as though, like I have. a surplus of people who are you know drinking have been addicted to cocaine, etc. And it doesn't really like stray further. I literally only know like one person who's ever done heroin like he's been clean for eight years, so. I guess some ways i'm thankful that i've never had to experience that because math seems really scary like street math I sound really scary. yeah don't act which is like still a derivative of cocaine, but like even though i've like. experimented with like you know the. The more mild things. I never felt as though, like it had to be something that I continue to do, and I know that, like for other people, it is very different, and I know that for other people, specifically with ADHD like tend to be drawn towards stimulants. and that in itself creates a possible addiction, because there's like the quiet. But i've always been able to just like not care about substance, I don't know what it is."
748.0,Provider,"it's certainly something to do with your brain chemistry. And that's a lucky thing. So that's a great thing and that you haven't gone down that particular rabbit hole. But it does you know, as you said, you've had depression, you have ADHD you've had some anxiety so you've got plenty to contend with. work with."
11237.0,Patient,"Sometimes I do like you know, look at the people around me and wonder like I was literally just talking about this with my friend IDA, who was the driver of the car like two days ago she suspects that she has ADHD. We have known each other for most of our lives and, like the whole running joke is that Fiona and I are basic like you know, two people living in different bodies. Because she's also forgetful and she sleeps a lot, and she deals with like so many of the other things that I deal with, and we have. Another close friend who essentially like exactly the same way, and I think this other friend trish has definitely come to terms with the fact that she's nerd divergent. And like you know she's on her little healing thing herself. And you know this last weekend, we were together for about two days in Vegas doing absolutely nothing and, like my whole thing was like oh yeah you know. We are a few miles away from home but we're just doing dumb shit we're not doing like we're literally just sitting there enjoying each other's company like. I don't know eating good food and all that other stuff so like it feels as though, like. And I have started to say this, like we're reading from the same script."
748.0,Provider,I love the feeling of safety to have people you're that connected with.
11237.0,Patient,"Yes, yes i'm thankful for that, too, so with That being said, i've come to wonder who else in my could possibly be neuro divergent in like. I don't know i've heard once before that. people tend to attract each other when they're neuro divergent or. It just. I know have one uncle and i'm really close to him, he has ADHD and he basically raised me and I was like yeah maybe I act like him because he raised me or do I act like him, because we have that little thing in our genetic."
748.0,Provider,hilarity yeah. um maybe it's both.
11237.0,Patient,um.
748.0,Provider,I would love to I would love to pursue finding out more about that relationship with your uncle in our next session.
11237.0,Patient,"Sure thing I was gonna say, should we look at the schedule and put something on."
748.0,Provider,"I will let the navigation team know what I want. As they've just been filling up my schedule, since i'm new talent like this is somebody I see every two weeks so. Good this time work for you."
11237.0,Patient,"know I actually. The original thing I had told the care navigator was 1030 in the morning. I. Typically, like feel the most mentally alert at that time, and I also have like less things to do in the morning i'll."
748.0,Provider,be doing a half hour appointment.
11237.0,Patient,um. I feel like half hour appointments are like okay if they're like the only option. But generally speaking yeah.
748.0,Provider,"An hour. The only thing is that. To do an hour appointment, we need to start on the hour because of the way they schedule and because. So if you could do 10am."
11237.0,Patient,"that's perfectly fine I mean I. Think based off, of whatever it was they told me, and they were like yeah there's a ton 30 open and I was less than an hour and they were like we could make it an hour and I was like Okay, whatever let's do it."
748.0,Provider,and
11237.0,Patient,Not the case but yeah.
748.0,Provider,"that's the way my schedule works, maybe because i'm part time and because of groups, if I can tell them 10am it would be on either a Monday or Thursday or Friday yeah. I mean that works that's OK OK, I will definitely put that out there to them and make sure that in two weeks we get one of those and the care navigation team will notify you but i'll send you an email as well."
