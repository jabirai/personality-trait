6973.0,Patient,"Yes, she just don't want me to get you know too crazy where i'm never home so that's."
207.0,Provider,that's something to definitely be conscious of.
6973.0,Patient,"yeah cuz she don't want me working you know all the time long hours, so today. Long as i'm off, you know I told her you know going to make sure that you know, I think. The lightest six o'clock is a good time, you know no later than national to get off."
207.0,Provider,"But you have to stick to you know, whatever that plan is so that it doesn't put her in a position where you're going again, what is it that you say, and then it leads her mind to wander."
6973.0,Patient,"yeah I know because you know she she says. she's brought up in the past, you know she's like i'm down here and doing you know working for myself, I couldn't be you know doing anything and she wouldn't know, I was like. One day that trust you know they back you know, and she won't have to worry."
207.0,Provider,"I mean in all you can do is just you know, continue to maintain where you are. But and not. You don't want to overdo it, where you're trying to prove yourself so she can you're giving her a time frame in when she should start trusting you."
6973.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm not you know pressure name thing i'm just gonna come when you know as time.
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So it's it's really looking into. You know you're starting your own business, you tell her i'm coming home by a certain time and it's just to ensure and just keep a line of communication open at all times. And maybe what I would say is. Sometimes texting is not always your friend because texting is what got you in trouble. me carefully, you texted me another number who you talking to. Michael you're texting yes. Chris overall, let me let's let's let's review so in terms of your goal a treatment, we look at a treatment plan and uncle what is a goal that you have like. let's start off with the long term goal like what is a goal that you would like to set for yourself to, and we can work on it over time, by building short term goal."
6973.0,Patient,"One go, I want to work on is quit smoking cigarettes. that's one go and then the other is a talk with you, before i'm just. hadn't been the right time, yet was a you know, maybe. Finding that. Communicating with my dad again. Building a relationship with him, maybe that's."
207.0,Provider,"yeah so it's re establishing the relationship with your father, but um, and so it is trying to his own that's a good goal, so one of them is too, and I would say, if you give yourself let's give it yourself a year. And it can always adjust itself, because if you give. yourself, I like I like to say six months to a year because it's been a realistic like how many years, have you been smoking."
6973.0,Patient,"Well, since I was 18 so. i'm so 32."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so 2020 something you."
6973.0,Patient,know I think I started 18 which 114. Years 14 years.
207.0,Provider,14 years you say you're 32 now.
6973.0,Patient,"Yes, I started was 18."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so all right so 2014 years old 14 years to you. can always take the. You to always take the high road at cold Turkey. Or you can take the path where. You. work through. So you can start off like talking to the doctor right about you know effectively from yourself or come off of smoking cigarettes. The end of the day, you can do cold Turkey, but if you know if we never. get to the point of identify it and acknowledging that what got me smoking in the first place, is my anxiety anxiety don't go nowhere right if you don't work through it. And so what's going to happen if you don't go to unresolved anxiety or identifying are acknowledging what makes you anxious, or what caused you to be anxious and how you coped over the years, with your anxiety for smoking. guess once you stop cold Turkey without identifying what are you going to do you're going to go right back to it. So I would say let's do a six months to one year goal of cutting back, but I would recommend as a short term goal is to talk to Dr Jackson right. uh huh when you meet with Dr Jackson if that's something that you know if you meet with her individually, I don't know if she has individual appointments but. met appointments but talk to her about you know you would like to start coming back on smoking and if there's any recommendation from a medical standpoint that she can recommend whether it's good whether it's the nicorette gum whether it's a patch or what have you. But it's working through the anxiety. Our goal is to work through identifying the things that when you think about smoking, like in that moment what is going on, that makes you say hey let me reach for a cigarette to calm myself down. What, how are you processing and that can also tell spin into wanting to overall work on the relationship with your bad that can bring about anxiety just the idea of okay now it's rebuilding this relationship it's really establishing these conversations and. What does you know when I have to to to pick up the phone to if i'm going to think about okay Let me pick up the phone and call him. I get butterflies like Oh, do I might my palm start getting sweaty this is how I feel I wonder what he's want to say Oh, you know what let me get a cigarette let me come self now, before I do this, you see how the two comes together. In relation. To these. In relation to your your the anxiety and how do you cope with the things the events, the circumstances that causes your identified anxiety and what you struggle at here and generalized anxiety, the worry is he going to be receptive is he going to. You know, be embracing of me and a conversation, what is this going to be like the things the anxiousness that come around that. And how do I have how I dealt with it over the years or however, if I cope with it over the years is engaging in unhealthy activities. So your long term goal of quitting smoking and rebuilding and re establishing the relationship with your father that's the long term goal the short term goal. The short term goal is. Continuing for your individual session. Each week or each we meet let's see we're monthly right. We could continue meeting for our individual sessions."
6973.0,Patient,span. Like two years. Maybe three because last time I spoke to him was when I got out of the hospital last lot issues well my stomach. that's been going on three years.
207.0,Provider,For you have some do you want you want to make up. You have siblings.
6973.0,Patient,I do yeah but. Just one sister that's got the same mom and dad so and. know not much she's. Not doing good she's in and out of jail and she's on drugs and. So I don't she don't talk she hasn't talked to him longer than that.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's increase it let's let's do this as it's related to you let's go back to every two weeks and let's process. What are some of those issues related to you and your bad that you struggle with and you've come to that place where you want to reestablish a relationship with him. Okay, so let's let's do that let's increase your sessions to every two weeks so let's schedule your next session for the 25th at 12. Okay, and let's do that let's work through a lot of those things that brought you to the place where you are today where you said that you want to be able to re establish that relationship with him."
6973.0,Patient,sounds good.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and so we'll start working through the steps of processing that past relationship and what stops the communication and just come some of the issues and even what you struggle with today. When it comes on to the thoughts and even within your your relationship How does that relationship with your net impact you today. yeah okay so let's move back your sessions to every two weeks, and each week we'll check in and back what will be processing. OK OK, but then for the for the cigarette I want you to first goal is to talk with Dr Jackson about you know effective ways, but we will build on how do we work through the invite and everything that true for when it comes on to the smoke and learning how to pop back on call. All right, alright so we'll do. I think it will be 11 your time."
6973.0,Patient,I love it okay yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
6973.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
207.0,Provider,you're welcome bye bye.
