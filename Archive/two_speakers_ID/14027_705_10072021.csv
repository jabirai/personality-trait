14027.0,Patient,"Going okay. bit stressful because, like i'm What would you like my parents are divorced, and like my mom's boyfriend, I guess, he was being violin yesterday. And she had to like call the police and the police told her that it's better for her to be serena my dad paid for her to stay in a hotel because, like there's still like on okay terms. So my dad prefer to stay in hotels, though she's like somewhere safe. Right i'm just saying worried, you know because I don't leave her apartment and she had to like relinquish her apartment so that way she she's just going to go look for another one because he's that kind of squatting in it so like the police can really take him forcefully."
705.0,Provider,"I can see why you know. That you would be concerned and have you know some worry about Okay, you know what's next for mom. Today, though, she's she's safe and she's somewhere right."
14027.0,Patient,"And like she wanted to come visit today, but I felt like it would be I don't know like she has a habit of trying to like steal things and I can get stress that I have to follow her on the House. So I told her that i'll see here on Friday, because I just feel like today's too busy for me. But like later i'm going to go take her food, because I know she's at hotel. And I don't want her like to go without food."
705.0,Provider,Good boundary though where you're like no i'm gonna bring it to you and i'm going to still respect that I need some time right now.
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. I know this it's challenging and. Knowing, though, that your dad is there and still supportive. Does that give you at least some comfort. That, in the event mom needs maybe more days in the future that he would."
14027.0,Patient,Be yeah. yeah it does give me comfort because it's like a little better than her just say having to leave and have nowhere to go at least like she knows that my dad will pay for her to stay in a hotel till she's like able to stay on her feet again.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and if ever, you know she was looking for something more longer term to there's a lot of different women shelters that do provide care longer term."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"So all this with mommy you're doing what you can to help her and give her food, then my main concern is. How are you going to be able to manage and keep where Okay, you know how am I going to maintain my health and be at my best."
14027.0,Patient,"I mean, I do like little my listings like I was drawing circles."
705.0,Provider,And I said.
14027.0,Patient,"Okay. yeah just like fill in the blank. So I was kind of doing that because they because it all kind of just have them for this, so I was kind of doing that, like to the little bit before. And then. I do like to escape and movies, so I think I want to watch movies."
705.0,Provider,"that's that's good and healthy things. yeah and the crisis, and you can be one way or you could be the other you're choosing to be healthier."
14027.0,Patient,"I try I do, I feel like I still have a little unhealthy habit, because I do smoke a lot, but I feel like it's better than. Other stuff I don't like."
705.0,Provider,"it's harm reduction. yeah yeah. There are things that you could do that are absolutely more unhealthy for you. i'm hearing that not only did you try, but you. You did when you needed to escape into you know it's a form of meditation what you're doing with the circling."
14027.0,Patient,And you didn't yeah.
705.0,Provider,"So you're actually applying those things, and then in time when you're building up more things. Who knows, maybe you will maybe feel like you know what harm reduction wise maybe I don't need to smoke, maybe I can even go, you know only on certain days and take it from there."
14027.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah. But like Besides that, I am kind of. happy at one point because i'm doing really good in my stats class which I was really worried about because i'm really bad at math and last semester like. I was doing really bad, but I think, maybe it's because it was online and then also during that semester, like my mom was off meds so it was a really hard. So. Now it feels weird that she like left i'm doing better, but I feel bad for doing better."
705.0,Provider,she's your mom and you want the best for her right.
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"And having you in that situation if your mom's not taking her meds and your mom's not willing at this time to take care of herself. It makes sense to me as being that you would fill yeah relieved in a way and not having that, day after day, like you were saying you were having to follow her around to make sure she wasn't taking things from you."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"And that's probably just one stress, you know. If someone's not taking their medication they're not usually not able to maybe manage their anger. Or you know other things, that is just like yeah whereas on you."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,You get the concentrate now on your studies. And you're good at it.
14027.0,Patient,yeah very good drowning in school that's one thing I like.
705.0,Provider,"It it's again it's changing changing like. We can go unhealthier we can go healthy and you've taken were putting your time and energy and to school. What draw she though you were saying, because I want to validate to where the guild park because usually you know what the guilt there's some things underneath it. Do you have any any like maybe it's this."
14027.0,Patient,"hmm. I guess I feel guilty cuz like she's not doing so well. So that makes me feel bad. Because like. I don't explain it like. growing up, I was always like there to hear like whatever she was going through so it's kind of hard to kind of they call so let go. And let her do it on her own. But like I know she's older than me so like she's an adult so that's why I keep telling myself like. She just has to I guess learn. I don't know."
705.0,Provider,If you've had to take on that responsibility and now. It is more of having to watch where your parents having to be the parent.
14027.0,Patient,yeah you.
705.0,Provider,"You have, though every right, though, to put it back for your mom and it is for choice of to get help or not, that doesn't it i'm not discounting how you feel because it is a kid oh you're like. Oh, my God i'm usually the one holding this up, and is it okay to let go. And what happens if something does occur. And you know you asked me that won't be your responsibility. Your responsibility is as her daughter you love her you care about her wellbeing. Be you can't you know there's. there's no way to make her. You know I know with family it's always hard to. Do something if it's like it would be so much easier. it's working till and the guilt piece is starting to first of all, you verbalized it and identify guilt is what I feel it's like okay now, if you take a look, and you look at it, a different way as. you're taking your mom food. So you're responsible for you feel at this time, feeding your mom making sure she has something to eat. So if you're taking or something to eat. Can you then take that guilt and be like wait a minute i'm not going to feel guilty about this, because this is what I can do today. She needs her food, I can give her food and that aligns with my mouth tree. I know you're thinking, I can see that what's what's coming up."
14027.0,Patient,i'm just thinking like you're right there like. You do have to they kind of told myself just do what you can. Because I always try to do it all in those numbers once I believe you do it all right.
705.0,Provider,And the guilt comes from from at times when you feel like that's the expectation. expectation has shifted back to your the child your mom is the adult. I like how you said that and what you what you can do about it.
14027.0,Patient,yeah. you're really good at this.
705.0,Provider,"I just listen trust me when I hear that it's such a huge burden and to think that for so many years, this is what you endured, this is what you did and distill even when you're trying to get yourself healthy to still have that burden will you feel guilty about mom."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"That right there sake. Okay, so glad you're here. you're gonna learn, even more so, of how to do it for yourself. To put yourself, first because you haven't had you haven't been allowed to do that before."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Now, this is about you."
14027.0,Patient,"it's like we're. To they put your own feelings forward, and I think finally like, how do you feel rather than like, how will something make someone else feel."
705.0,Provider,"I can share with you, too, I grew up in a dysfunctional family and you get caught up in that chaos and you don't know anything else."
14027.0,Patient,yeah so it's to it.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, well guess what it's unhealthy and, of course, the guilt would would be there because that's what's part of the dysfunction in the family. You usually are able to manage people in a dysfunctional family because you're told that's what's expected that's what you're supposed to do you're my child, etc. So you're having to go against the own childhood messages so like wait a minute. No yeah."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah like not only like childhood messages they feel like also cultural because I feel like it, especially they can then Latino culture it's a really shamed upon to not always do what your mother tells you to do. or like to not always just they give them what they want or like provide for them, a city need money so they feels like. i'm like being thanks man like. nah I guess Honorable to my culture in some way. But like also like how you're saying that growing up. Just like the motherly position is a very authoritative position and you just feel like it's hard to set boundaries with someone that's basically raised."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. It is, and do you have do you have brothers or sisters."
14027.0,Patient,yeah I have a brother. How Chi and then the one that just opened the door and. He like open the doors open and close it slowly.
705.0,Provider,And then you're the oldest and so it's that sense of responsibility and then also to sometimes in the Latin community is if you're female your roles are even bigger you're supposed to babysit you're supposed to do the House you're supposed to it's never ending yeah. And you lose out on being a kid yourself.
14027.0,Patient,"yeah. And I think it was just like more added that I lost out to be a kid because, like my mom has always suffered with your mental illness. And like boy when like I talked to her about it, she talks about how like she feels bad that when I was born, he got worse. And she was trying to make it less worse, but she just couldn't because, unlike our Community it's like Oh, if you go to therapy you're crazy so she was scared to go she didn't address it to like her 30s so like I grew up like with her, just like. battling it and not knowing what to do, and she was like battling with drugs. So she wasn't really present so it was, like me, taking care of my brother a lot. Like with my grandma."
705.0,Provider,"And having an impaired parent it definitely sits with you, and until you're an adult and you have an opportunity to work on yourself. Then it's like Oh, my goodness, I have a voice and I don't have to feel this way any longer. And it's not like i'm saying we don't have to put a positive spin and it's like daisies and the wind is blowing every day is fine. But putting it back into perspective, like what the Gill, is that. Being okay with today you're doing your best you can paint your mom if that's what she needs as food, but it's healthy to set a boundary that you're not going to allow her to come over right now, because you're dealing with your own stuff. you're going through you know you have school, you have other things. And verbalizing that and starting to feel like you know what i'm okay with this, but yet I also here with culture that you're respectful and that's part of the piece of it, too, is where do you fit in now with your belief system and how those family values are for you. If that's the culture that you grew up and helps understand you know a lot of family dynamics you're an adult now. You can invite in of this is my priority, these are my values, this is how I feel might view my culture or agree with it or not, because some of it might be generalized. Do you know other Latin Latin families where. Things are are not set and maybe what what you may deem as traditional."
14027.0,Patient,yeah like usually they're like third gen.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14027.0,Patient,"I think, maybe like I talked about it with my dad a lot like I think like not only immigrating here, but like coming from poverty as well just come with a lot of mental illness and then. they're not dealing with it leads to more into poverty, which is a and he was like talking to me about how. it's often like you feel like he was telling me that, like the times when he would hit us when we were younger he feels like he was just all out of stress. And we were just like so poor during that time, that he was like overwhelmed and he was telling me that he feels like maybe that's how a lot of parents are to that it's just so much on like the financials and them being young or being in poverty and just learning to deal with children. So I was thinking about that a lot to like. When you brought up the cow."
705.0,Provider,"And it helps you understand your father that it's you can forgive them it's not forgotten, but you forgive them and accept what happened."
14027.0,Patient,yeah and like helps you understand.
705.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely. If we look at ways to like your protective you know mechanisms that you developed in time, it sounds like with dad to is there may have been some traumatic incidents to where he had to project and was very aggressive to keep everybody at bay."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"Unfortunately, he did that with discipline to eat it no another way. yeah."
14027.0,Patient,"Oh, he was telling me that. Now then, like i've been studying psych and stuff and like i've been talking more about it, like, I asked him like So why did you do this because I want to understand. He said that it's helped him like more understand himself and where he came from, because he never really turned to look back, of how he was raised, because I would I asked him like ios angry like Where were they aggressive with you and your younger like by. You so angry. And like just like uncovering things like that, but I never had conversations with that was it like like that was him as a kid because, like I know as a kid you feel like you're scared because they're like the authority and then. I know I feel like he's changed to like we he does make more money and now he has more stable job. So I think that helps like I feel like he's also changed in his like mindset of things."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and experience and then part of it, too, is young younger men, you know a lot of times with the testosterone and it comes out in a more aggressive manner. And, if needed, develop those skills to. not release like that, like you had you were able to manage your anger."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah he was young, when he had me he was like barely 21 so my age."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is and. By you now being and also the psychology field is starting to see where some of the theorist where they were going, you know why they're certain approaches the way it is and then seeing if it fits in your family dynamics and you're like Lo and behold i'm not. Pulling but i'm getting my own counseling. yeah but that's good light bulbs will start to go off and you'll realize like Oh, my goodness that fits makes perfect sense."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm. and helps a lot.
705.0,Provider,"yeah. It it does, and I think more and more understanding that. it's okay to wish that things were different, and especially with mom situation of course you love her and you wish her the best and you wish that she would get the help she needs she's not there yet. So, again it's like pulling back to i'm going to do within my boundaries of what I can for today."
14027.0,Patient,In.
705.0,Provider,"and getting you to a place to where you're like you know what I feel more in balance, where, if there are other things that I want to put on my plate then maybe so, but you know, again, building on that. What are some things that you're feeling like that you know, sometimes it's exercise meditation taking time out from the day like what are you doing that seeming to work for you."
14027.0,Patient,"Well, ever since I got back like and just go in person, during my breaks, I like to. Just wander the campus."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14027.0,Patient,"it's like a nice breather because my campus has a lot of like trees, such as walk around them, and just walk around the campus and just take it don't go on my phone I don't hear music I just there like just like this in the moment I don't explain it."
705.0,Provider,yeah the impression.
14027.0,Patient,"yeah that's been really helpful. And like I. I think of the saying like stop and smell the roses, when I do this because, like I walk around and I look at the plans and I look at the details of the leaves like. I feel like it's kind of therapeutic to me because I just. it's like i'm pulling myself away from everything else, and just focusing on like Look how this plant has grown from the last time I saw it."
705.0,Provider,yeah you're doing mindfulness. I mean I. mean you are doing mindfulness and that's exactly how it is. it's interesting that you're doing this already you didn't even need the book.
14027.0,Patient,No i'm just like what makes me feel better.
705.0,Provider,"But it is you you're already keying in on grounding techniques and by going out and listening and experiencing that that it does help with mood that it does put us back to where we feel stable and lyft even if it's just you know, a. Point five oh it lifts, you know your mood to be outside and to experience that it detaches you from the stress for a bit. yeah wow. How did you get keaton and then that would work for you."
14027.0,Patient,"Oh, I saw like a real of how ADHD people do better in the in nature and i've like been in schools haven't been able to get to nature so like I take the trees around me as nature, so I just started doing that."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness that's great. Fantastic on that. That is something that if you can incorporate into your daily life you're going to start to notice, even more so that i'm not saying, like all send you know everything is just great and the clouds. It makes it where it's more manageable because you're giving yourself this opportunity, because with anxiety that just built on anxiety and all that and it's just like short circuit you're breaking that sort of short circuits hard for me to say today. And you're reestablishing back a connection with with nature. That stuff. And then cocoa, I mean i'm sure there's times to that cocoa wants to go out."
14027.0,Patient,"No cocoa or lazy one tends to the one that likes to go out the one that's barking right now, he doesn't like when they take out the trash and the neighbors taking out their trash to the front yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I mean, let you know. yeah it is you know anything that you can do that's the mindfulness different types of meditation. Have you tried, like some of them, you can have an APP or you can follow or affirmations like daily affirmations."
14027.0,Patient,"No, but I should get enough. Like maybe daily affirmations. I think that would be good."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you can definitely a right now to if i'm all Google that if you Google it there's a lot of either for low fee or no fee because mental health and people are staying indoors and so a lot of people are promoting free Apps. For mental health. So give it give it a go it'd be nice to see how. It is a lot of. growing up in a dysfunctional family and how you had to do things. it's changing that up because before you didn't know that there was this other side and it's like Well, this is other other side, where we can be healthy and it's not selfish to take a moment to do the things that I need to have my my needs met."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's one of the hardest parts because, unlike dysfunctional families, it does look like when people take space and boundaries that it's selfish like you just grow up hearing that when they do things like that they're being selfish or that we train their family. But like as you get older you realize like oh like what am I on got mad at my grandma years ago and wanted spaces to on its face she wasn't like leaving us, for you know you start to understand it."
705.0,Provider,"You start to understand it, and then you get to decide, you get to re evaluate the people that you want to let in or not and it's okay to there's no time limit, some people are like there's a question mark you don't know yet."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"And that is okay, I think we were talking about this in group."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Thanks coming out.
14027.0,Patient,"You know, with the holidays coming up it's who were okay with bringing up in our boundaries, with people."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14027.0,Patient,"And like that you also mentioned that if we go to a holiday party and we do encounter someone who we don't feel comfortable with. That it's okay to excuse ourselves now selena to my dad like actually run it up to him because he's also like kind of like a people pleaser kind of like me. So he always has problems doing that. And I told him. You said it's actually really healthy so that he should do that, that it doesn't mean that he's being rude and he's like it's so hard to leave, though, because they don't let you know, I was like that's true. Because it can our culture, like in a lot of parties to, not just in our culture, but like you know when you try to leave they're like. No stay look we're almost done with this desert is almost here like oh wait, let me get you a plate like they try to keep you and they make it really hard to yeah but it up to my dad and he couldn't hear liked it yeah."
705.0,Provider,"it's good, because now it's on his radar and it's on yours too and it's also he is i've been in those situations where. it's like you don't want to anyone and coming from a place, you know of how can your approach, it is there a is there a sentence that you would feel comfortable where you're not offending them but you're still going to be able to leave. and walk away feeling good about yourself."
14027.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I haven't thought of it um. I don't know, I guess, I always just thought of it i'm just saying like. i'm busy by, but I feel like that's not."
705.0,Provider,"how it works for you to study. Oh. Okay, so. We go with that. It will I call it like you know, maybe some fine tuning there. yeah instead of busy SIA. Now, you know that you have things that you need to do such such as school work and things like that. So if you were going to share then broader than i'm busy."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Well How else could you communicate that.
14027.0,Patient,"I could like say that I have an assignment do, and I will, and I will like now, I would like to excuse myself, I like. To say bye to everyone and leave so that we, it seems like a life respectful and I didn't hurt their feelings, but I still left and my boundary."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely yeah and it's like if you already have that and then depending on the situation, you can you can revise it as needed. And sometimes too it's just that simple fact of just I really appreciate our time together and then you go into what your sentences. Re engaging to you can check in with them, you know it's like you were saying ask for permission or to be excused. If you don't feel comfortable with just walking away, you could say you know, are you okay with this. You have to be prepared in case you say no i'm not."
14027.0,Patient,Really Oh well. yeah. I was consider it.
705.0,Provider,yeah and is there a compromise.
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah like 20 more minutes all eaters i'll eat the piece of pie, because I know you made it and you spent a lot of time on it, but after that I have to ask it at all have to get out peace out go. Okay, as its as you get into the psychology to and the communication and just how we communicate not only verbally but most of it is even like how we carry ourselves the body language. yeah so matching up the more that you're confident in what you're going to share that your body language will even come off in a different way, because if you if you're unsure you know how to find like that and you're looking down and you say a quietly and it's like. No that doesn't really sound like you're committed to leaving. body language is saying I have room to convince you."
14027.0,Patient,yeah that's your.
705.0,Provider,"More up writing Oh, and just again appreciations here's where I need to go and study Thank you so much you're sitting we're up right and just kind of move toward I really appreciate boom. By delaying language is saying I am confident, my decision to leave."
14027.0,Patient,"And maybe where they always get me because i'm like Oh, I need to go."
705.0,Provider,"It is your body language before we even speak is usually already connected. Like huh Okay, so I can change my body posture to feel like if you're going to feel anxious or something like that, when you go into speak. Like you're giving you know, sometimes a lecture I talk about you know doing your body pressure more upright and then going out to the audience and being able, before you even say your first word are. fine tuning it's up to you, of what you're discovering like hey Is this something you know if you are looking down Could it be that the next time to approach it with more, not the stair we're like hey. But the Nice gauge, you know. My contact and then you can guess what it's. Finding that balance, too, because even when we're talking about like with body posture and it is trying to work it out and you tend to go one way or the other. same thing with being assertive I work with you know different people to be assertive and it's the way you approach it and it's getting your needs met and their needs, met or their needs to met by listening. However, sometimes people take it where all of a sudden, they become aggressive and it's like well aggression isn't assertiveness. i'll be able to be more in balance. or being able to say no, you don't always have to say, you know. No to everything. So, but this is what i'm working on i'm going to say no. bring a bag. What do you think right now, so you do the mindfulness you're out where you're doing the grounding techniques, what else brings you into more of that balanced area."
14027.0,Patient,"um. I guess, I think, maybe also I think Kobe has a little bit of credit for it. I just came out of it appreciating the outside, more. I feel like that has credit for it to."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and when we feel grateful that is definitely positive psychology We already know that feeds her mood."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah and I think also like. When I like before I got into school, we would go on hikes with the dogs and I really like her, and get two points where it was just us, you know they take off my mask and just stare like internally and with the dogs and I just. don't know I feel like coven may be more appreciative of that moment, because before then, I had gone hiking before like with my fiance and like I would be the one complaining, like, I want to go is hot and then i'm the one like Oh, I want to go outside. yeah."
705.0,Provider,yeah absolutely absolutely and so you know again having that adjustment and knowing that you know what I feel the reward from this i'm.
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Go out even more. Grateful list, have you ever tried to you know just each day couple of things on the grateful list."
14027.0,Patient,"um no, but I do do that when i'm sad because I did learn that with my past therapists in high school, he told me that, like if I ever did feel like really depressed to they count on my fingers five things that i'm grateful for like happy to live for. And I do that when i'm like I feel down. But I don't do it, like every day."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's you know, sometimes you may not need to if you already have that coping skill and you only use it like as as needed. It may give more power to it, then, because you only pull out that one that tool. When you need it and you know it. yeah. I liked how to with with incorporating the fingers with that too, as your as you're doing the five right decide how you."
14027.0,Patient,yeah except to the.
705.0,Provider,"Is mood like you know, in the last since we spoke last I think was what a couple of weeks ago. Since that time. As far as mood has there been any periods of depression."
14027.0,Patient,"No more like. Periods of like sadness, but they're not long they're like instances. Like when I remember, things are like after I get a phone call with my mom. Like things like that."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14027.0,Patient,"But not big periods of depression, just like drops to sadness."
705.0,Provider,It does it ever in the last two weeks has it dropped from sadness to more thoughts of self harm.
14027.0,Patient,No quiet. down.
705.0,Provider,Just filling out. And when do you think the last time that you did have any thoughts about self harm.
14027.0,Patient,"I think it was like I could tell you less than like around the time we're like coming parents are splitting up and like feels weird because my mom left with so much had met at mental hospital, so I just hold it shows in danger. And then she should know those around that time, everything was chaotic and I just felt like. My dad was leaning on me a lot to take care so because I just said he was good at dealing with my mom's divorce so as a. Around that time."
705.0,Provider,"So are already by you, engaging and doing some things that are different like even you know before you were going outside and taking a look and doing grounding skills. You haven't gone back to the self harm and that's that's progress where it's like yes, I can be sad but i'm not going in this direction. And, did you build on OK, so now i'm not building i'm not filling the self harm anymore now i'm incorporating even more and more into my life and then pose this word people accuse your people when you're like Okay, I need someone to talk to."
14027.0,Patient,it's usually my fiance have very small circle. And like if it's not him as my dad. my brother sometimes will like I feel like since he's younger I don't I don't know.
705.0,Provider,How much younger see.
14027.0,Patient,Four years younger so he's a teenager right now but I don't know I sound like a baby.
705.0,Provider,"I want to be fair, you probably did raise him."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah my mom my mom would say that she credits, I think the, the reason why I love my brother so much over the fact that she would tell me that she doesn't feel Okay, and that I need to pretend that he's my baby and and you take care of the baby. So I will just take care of him."
705.0,Provider,"And again it's like you didn't get a chance to be a child and was given the responsibility. As part of out of that, though, and you have all of those things that you're independent you're responsible you're resilient I mean all these were built because of going through all that."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,abnormal psychology use always look at only the childhood and only like what's wrong with us. I like where today it's more bringing it back to also to what did you gain from that.
14027.0,Patient,"I think of a quote, that I had read a while back about how. roses thorns are like its Armor. So it's basically I don't remember the quote exactly but it basically was talking about how. You shouldn't ever be mad that you have thorns because that was like your survival skill and you should appreciate those thorns."
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah exactly, and I think with the thorns you know analogy to is that sometimes those pedals that are protecting the the thorns right fall off too, because you no longer need them. We have all we change perspectives can change."
14027.0,Patient,yeah that's what I like.
705.0,Provider,yeah. And it.
14027.0,Patient,"tasted like. Oh, I don't think we're gonna have to think when I was a teenager that you would always be stuck in an emotion, because I always thought I was doomed to be stuck being sad."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14027.0,Patient,So. I like to now I kind of see it as a. emotions are just temporary things and they move with you. So you can't change that.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. And there's even different degrees of it like if we look at sadness. different degrees of sadness different degrees of even anger.
14027.0,Patient,yeah I.
705.0,Provider,"can see, though, where, as a child that you would you would feel stuck because of what was happening around you and that responsibility that was given to you."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah I think also like a trial day. I felt like I had no say and what I was doing I just had to be there as a support and not complain. You feel like i'm like starting to grow into my voice, but I still kind of struggled to get into another way, but I feel like. I mean it more with my parents like with them, I feel like I have better communication now. That i'm on it, it was better before she left, but then it got rocky with the whole divorce, but i'm trying to kind of slowly fix it was kind of. Good so."
705.0,Provider,"You are building a better relationship with your father and that you're able to tell him or ask him questions that is helping you and your healing process. Understanding, you know now you have a better sense of okay well why, before you don't know, but now at least you have some things to say, well Okay, I can have empathy, but I also know, it was hard for me. that's that ever said he was sorry."
14027.0,Patient,"i'm. To me, and I really to my brother yeah. because to me he he sees it like I didn't get it."
705.0,Provider,"If there's a time that you feel comfortable and you're having one of your talks. To put that vulnerability out there and saying you know dad. All I ever needed was to hear you say i'm sorry. And so i'm taking responsibility for for who I am right now, and I just need the same. Exactly and to compare you to your your brother. is not appropriate, because it's it's different, and you know again your your father in his own way, is probably. living in that denial that it wasn't so bad for you, because it makes him feel better and he has no way of knowing that you feel this way and that YouTube need to know that he's sorry."
14027.0,Patient,"that's true. because sometimes like. I guess, like last time he was bringing it up about how like a few months ago who's bringing it up that. he feels bad about how used to hit my brother, but he didn't really think that he was everybody abusive. And then, like the day after, you said that he kind of got mad at the dog and like kind of like doing to him, like a little Punch and then I was opposed to that feels like a little snapback goals you can start abusing the dog now it's like. it's like things they haven't dealt with, they kind of just spit out in like a snap sometimes. When he looks at me like What do you mean."
705.0,Provider,"Those unresolved feelings and that resentment that builds and it comes out just like you were saying when you see that, and it was just out there."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"it's a process and your dad from what you're sharing seems like he's opening that door it's also because you're opening that door and you're willing, and when you feel like the opportunity is there to start broaching some of this, you know of what it was like for you. And you can remind them hey here's where I was when I was five or here's my memory, when I was eight."
14027.0,Patient,I think it's weird to go when you think of a memory it's like you're watching yourself there's a memory.
705.0,Provider,"to form a detachment. To protect yourself it's like doesn't even seem real, especially with dysfunction and abuse. Now the connection where it's even more important for you to start to connect like yeah this is how I feel. And feeling got a bad rap but it's not it's not a bad thing."
14027.0,Patient,No it's not a better.
705.0,Provider,"Is it easier for you. To process, like some of the things i'm thinking of recovery, you know work. I have, where people are able to have those conversations, or they were not ready yet and it, it was more therapeutic to write it down and then. To decide if ever, you want to give that to your father, but some of the things like I would encourage writing a letter to your mom maybe not giving it to your mom but just to start writing a letter to your mom and what you would say. And the same thing to your dad. And then you can evaluate if he feel dad maybe is more healthy right now, and he can he can engage in that, and it would be okay. First, is your mom."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah. that's good. I don't know if i'll be able to give it to them, but I think writing the letter will."
705.0,Provider,"it's still up here of those like you were talking about being detached and so you feel so detached that. The way to make contact and connected is by writing and, as you have to think of it and process it and go oh oh my gosh now that i'm reading this it's like yeah was there ever a period where you felt, you know, compared to your brother or you know unfair or rejected. Those things you start to see and highlight. make sense in your adulthood, then, if you've since rejection and you're already out the door if that's you like, could it be This is where it stems from and the good news is is, I know how to identify that. Take a break revisit it and be like okay i'm gonna i'm going to stay here on stick out with the relationship i'm not going to run from it."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah I do that because the micro relationship has been with him for about six years now and. In the beginning, I was so scared that he would leave or that he would hurt me that I wanted to leave. But I had to keep telling myself that I think I want to leave because my mom would leave a lot as a kid so maybe i'm just too scared to get attached so it's helped to kind of ignore that."
705.0,Provider,"If that, though, is was your role modeling that this is what we do when there's a problem you leave it becomes part of your development to is Oh, you know and sometimes just subconsciously you just do it, and then you're like Oh, this is where. The where the stem from. yeah yeah. Six years you have staying power. it's you know, is it to where we're what you're going through and still with your mom and your dad and you said that pretty much your circle was was pretty pretty tight circle. Is there a level, though, that you feel like not only is he supportive but you're also as a couple like learning and growing together."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah because, like when he turned 18 his mom kind of kicked him out so my dad accepted him into our House, and I feel like he has kind of like helped me because I was never really been responsible and even like, as I was older she's just she's just mentally ill, you know so. He kind of came to help a lot, and then, when the divorce happened he took a lot of responsibility on with me, so I feel like we're both really kind of learning how adulthood works in helping my dad pick up what he stressed with so like we're both growing in that sense."
705.0,Provider,"And that's that's good, and if you are ready, are at this age able to get that just think and then building up on that you know and a couple more years couple more years it's good foundation. hang out again I what you're already been doing just to come so natural for you is pretty frickin amazing like you're ready like. that's what I need and i'm going to start looking at the leafs and describing them and defining them like are ready, so i'm hoping that more and more, you have the self confidence of you know what, no matter what i'm going to manage and i'm going to do it my way my style. Everything else becomes background noise. Until you invited in."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely. Yes, mean I know we talked about you know, maybe, if you feel like writing the notes that that's something that definitely to start the process of filling."
14027.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,If you find that doesn't work sometimes people will dictate it into their phone notes. i'm.
14027.0,Patient,"In Africa, writing."
705.0,Provider,"Okay okay good so you already know this, that you prefer writing and so okay yeah and if it gets also where because. memories are going to probably come rushing back because you're writing about it, to allow yourself to put it away and then come back to it later on, maybe the next day, or only on weekends, if you have more time on the weekends. not go over overwhelmed."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Is there anything else that you feel right now would be like you want to explore more you want to set it up as a maybe a weekly goal.
14027.0,Patient,um no I haven't really thought of it.
705.0,Provider,All as we go so.
14027.0,Patient,Far my weekly goal has just been to continue just doing good and showing up to therapy.
705.0,Provider,I hate. Being here is already like that's. Absolutely I don't think too that there's another scheduled appointment yet right.
14027.0,Patient,I think yeah on. The spot is at 6pm.
705.0,Provider,"Okay that's what I was going to double check, thank you for looking at yours, yes I go through my calendar. Okay, so October the 20th and that is at 6pm and that's still working for you. yeah Okay, and do you want it, then for right now keep it at that, and then the next time we meet schedule, or do you like to have things already scheduled is what i'm asking I guess."
14027.0,Patient,Unquote the next time we meet we schedule.
705.0,Provider,"It is um everybody has their different systems and so. we're like, no, no, how I don't wanna I don't want to you know and others will I can I love two months in a row, and all the same date same time. I will go with the flow, so you let me know and we have the October the 20th that is at 6pm. and"
14027.0,Patient,"You know, and I did that option, though the just the same time, every single month."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and what I would say yes mean if you like, like a certain time, if you like, six o'clock and you know that I can look at the next month. My calendar tends to like right now and October, it tends to fill up where I can project easier in November. So you know, but you have the 20th so so that's good. But we could you know I can look. Like in November, I can pull up the month and, if that is more of hey at least set it up two times, and that would be best for you."
14027.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Because November right now is a lot of availability so pretty much for November, you tell me what time and Jesse and I can put it in there. Is. Through Friday, but you have group on Friday, so it needed Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday."
14027.0,Patient,I think i'm good with Wednesday at six.
705.0,Provider,"So. If we then look at did you want to shoot for the third, which would be November, the third, which is a Wednesday."
14027.0,Patient,Can you do the week after that.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, so the week after that then would be November. The 10th."
14027.0,Patient,"yeah that's good, because if they're just my cousin's birthday."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah absolutely make this work for you, because on November the 10th to I basically have on that Wednesday. The earliest appointment is 9:30am and the latest appointment is 6pm."
14027.0,Patient,"I can do, six."
705.0,Provider,"You got it so six it is, and then, would you want to go ahead on the 24th and November 24, it is a Wednesday and do the same time. yeah Okay, so that would take us then to the 24th at 6pm It is, though, the day. Before thanksgiving right, so the 25th is thanksgiving, so it is the day before, if that matters to you."
14027.0,Patient,Know that's fine.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to book These, then, why we're talking where no one else takes those appointment times and then, as we go along when you're ready to schedule December, let me know, then we can do that. And we'll keep going on there. It just takes one minute to pull up my calendar for you. We already talked about to the texts, where you can text to check in do you already have that number."
14027.0,Patient,You can text the chicken.
705.0,Provider,"You know how you check in how you call the virtual Center and you check in. there's a text to where you can check in or if ever, you need to cancel."
14027.0,Patient,"Oh no so what I just take some them and they just charge, and then I just go straight to your meeting."
705.0,Provider,"Right what i'm gonna do is i'm going to send it right now, it is a 415458. To six a. And that number, you can text to let them know that you're checking in or if you're canceling an appointment. And if you want to you could even send you already checked in today, but you could even send a text and just put testing the system to see if it works for you. Most of the time, I know that would be able to be for check ins for cancellations things like that only some insurance, I think, in the past, I don't think they're. You know just if they share that they would prefer not to or whatever, then Okay, but usually that's the number that i'm get getting. That is workable, so we have November 10 and that's going to be at 6pm."
14027.0,Patient,yep and then the 24th at 6pm.
705.0,Provider,"You got it. And that one is safe so we're going to do that, next one and. Are you going to pick up something for your mom are you cooking."
14027.0,Patient,"And we're cooking. Okay, right now, my fiance should be preparing to me. My therapy appointment, hopefully, he did it."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I will then you get this going for you and then that way we're good to go, and you can do what you need to do with cooking and I like your plan of delivering it to mom love yeah and then I gotta go. And that one is saved too so perfect I will then see you Friday and group. Yes, alright sounds great have a good rest of the evening, and you know. last thing I was going to say I don't think I said before, the grounding techniques or did I for mindfulness."
14027.0,Patient,hmm I don't think so.
705.0,Provider,"Okay i'll send it to you too, and that way you can just confirm already that you already know mindfulness and branch off of that if you want to what you're doing sounds like it works."
14027.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely Thank you and good to see you. And Friday.
14027.0,Patient,see a Friday. All right.
705.0,Provider,"A patient is sharing she's not suicidal no plan no intent patient sharing she hasn't been suicidal. Since the divorce, which was, I believe, past six months ago, so patient right now is no risk for the suicide assessment, I believe, in her chart is still, though, leaving it at low risk assessment overall."
