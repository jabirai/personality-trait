271.0,Provider,"girl. Contract you. Make track as well, so."
2668.0,Patient,"Yes, Hello."
271.0,Provider,i'm Dr Oliver got your daughter here. Here what's going on and i've got to record it anyway.
2668.0,Patient,"Oh, very good. Can you hear me OK. Yes, so if if you can. Are you ready for any questions I have."
271.0,Provider,"just a minute. All right, zoom meeting on here for beside API s. And i'm Dr Oliver, of course. She has in my office personally today. And that's because the state of Kentucky requires that. You cannot do. medication assisted therapy purely by. Tele visit. So she came into the office to meet me today. going to give you her vital signs, this is a partial 154 97 a heart rates 107 or ISIS five foot six 640 or tempest 99 zero, and she has had our call but immunization data. and She wanted her father to join us, and he has joined us on the on the zoom. forefathers on the zoom and jennifer's in the room, so Jeff we're going to talk really with your answer me so that the. zoom can hear it. Okay. bright heart health records. And the right heart health zoom and. My records. When talking to different people in two different places, so this is kind of texting me here. Right medication lies Jennifer you're on natural xr 20 milligrams on the Marty one seven hours later and suboxone a slave to your tablet one and a half a day. Today, correct yes that's correct all right you're not have any withdrawals or cravings no all right, and how long have you been in treatment now Do you remember January January all right good nine months ago. And i've been regular are coming into groups don't think she's Mr time yeah. And how operation and therapists to say listen oh yeah Oh, it was every two weeks notice once a month Okay, so this has been seeing a therapist every two weeks, and now he graduated about three. My other things that i've talked to her about is that she's got some facial spasm there's a medication for that that you might want to try. Yes, but she's all blurry of trying to new medicine. medicine for actually for tardive dyskinesia which has a motion disorder that you get from taking. Anti psychotic medication, not a pain medication, but anti psychotic medication and he had a movement disorder we go do this or eat spasms yeah but i've got a similar spasm and my face, not from that but it's a genetic one and that medication works for me. ask him if he. was presenting have you noticed her having a spasm uppercase."
2668.0,Patient,"No, not at all."
271.0,Provider,"But you may have been like this, all your life and i've been like this, all my life because I remember as a kid like people had asked my dad why don't smile. Because like i'm literally like it hurts. To do that. Right, do you have anything that you need to tell me. Mr versace what you're talking now."
2668.0,Patient,"Okay well she's been on suboxone for quite some time and I was hoping that she'd been. Going on nine months yeah I was hoping she'd be weaned off of it at some point. And you know also, are there any. Long term effects of. of taking that medication for this amount of time."
271.0,Provider,"This is not a long time that much you asked as the most common question that that relatives ask. Because in your mind she just wished one opioids for another and she's not any better, and this should be a stepping stone to get her off of it all together and then actually used to be how I thought to until I got more adept in it. It isn't other opioid but this opioid has a sober magical properties, it has a ceiling effect to where it will work up to a certain level, then it won't work anymore, you get 80% of your effect with the first eight milligram pill, and the second and third. Eight milligram pill, I want to get you know, a 20% effect. That, so the ceiling effect means, if you take four or five or six and won't work anymore, they just won't do anything a push that button you can't push that button right any harder. So that keeps it from from doing a couple things one it's it's very, very hard overdose on because if you took a bottle it won't do any more than three pills so it's almost impossible to overdose on. The other thing if you wanted to take more just to get high level do you any good, because taking for him to get high won't do any more than three nose. And matter of fact, the second, third one only get about 20% more effective, the first one to us so very hard to use it JESSICA hi. In order to get high you would actually have to crush it up and started or shoot it up, but we put in a box zone and it looks just like narcy and so, if you're crushing and started up your nose are shooting up the marquee and box and all together, so it doesn't do anything. So those in the magical properties I bet they keep you from abusing it and make it safer to stay on long term and not be harmful ticket. is for people that want to get off opioids but just can't because they have withdrawals and it's very similar to somebody that smokes and 90% of smokers would quit if they didn't get nicotine fits which is basically nicotine withdrawal. Now one way to stop nicotine withdrawal just taking nicotine patch to replace nicotine."
2668.0,Patient,Right.
271.0,Provider,"And what to be an orphan does is very crudely. If it replaces the opioid better replaces the bad opioids with one that works all day instead of four hours because one problem with opiate addiction is that. If you take an opioid just for our pill to stop your withdrawals, for us, maybe having girls you got second and fourth leading I take another one. So you're always chasing your tail trying to keep them can get to it throws away with this, the box will not work so days you take one I think she's on one and a half a day. And she doesn't have to go out and you don't do it you're not worried about what's gonna happen in four hours, not worried about withdrawals coming, and she can relax and just get our life in order. Now some people some clinics will put people on it till they get clean lead magnet for six months, a year, two years so magical number then decided they're going to be them off. And there's no rule that says, you have to do that and there's no law that says, you have to do, that the DEA says that you should make an attempt to me and people down. on for a long time, they also say that with any hope you're if you're taking the more tab for pain, they say it at some point time, you should write it down if you didn't get my list. i've got people that have taken that plan and lead themselves off. The majority of people take it long term. i've got people that know him for seven years 10 years and, just like taking a blood pressure pill they take the pill they don't have girls on any cravings and they go out my life. One of the other magical effects of it has it has a ceiling effect but also it blocks the receptors so that, if you take a percocet or chat with it won't work. So far from what work to a certain amount, but if you slip up or somebody gives you something, and you take it it won't do much for you. So one is it stops the withdrawals, which allows you to go about your life, but it also kind of protects you so that if you get clean and and slip up again, it will do much for you. first saw its protective. So that's one reason that people will stay on a long term because they're afraid if they get off of it, they go to the dentist and get some art Fo to say my fall off the wagon again or friend comes by and says here I got a percocet take one that we make it, we can take. goes it's kind of like a smoker you might be. quit smoking a year ago, but just take one cigarette to kick it off again. So some people take that long term because they don't trust themselves and you should know yourself. And some people wean themselves off and and get off of it now, when I tell people that I want to talk about that for a year. Because there's two major two major milestones you get on there's a six month milestone in one year and six months your brain kind of wakes me go holy shit to hell's going on back then. And then, it says here you go holy shit what was I doing a six months, so your brain kind of gradually comes out of this fog. And it takes about a year for your brain to get out of the addiction, for which is part of the use of opioids and it's probably because your brain has gotten gotten used to be the bad things. And you got to quit doing bad things for a while, for your brain to kind of start processing and doing good things to get a new habits. So people to wait at least a year, then we can talk about we enough if he wants to hell forever i'll be gone forever, if you want to write down what we can do now, I don't care, it will do either one, but not for here."
2668.0,Patient,"So you mentioned all the the good things that the drug has, as far as you know, all the positive. Things will, are there any health related negative impacts on on using it for this amount of time."
271.0,Provider,that's very good question and so that's the second most common question. And people think I take it to the lungs gonna hurt my liver my kidneys or something and it doesn't there's no long term effect the effects tomorrow or needed definitely affects today. So if you take a pain pill and make sure drowsy it's gonna make you drowsy today there's no long term effect of taking it doesn't hurt your liver doesn't hurt your kidneys it doesn't do anything like that so there's no internal damage that happens with it. there's really no long term effects of taking it looks like said i've had people on for like a couple a couple of people on it for seven years going to cut them off for 20 years. And the effect is that they're not using opioids and they can hold a job and take care of the family live a normal life.
2668.0,Patient,"Right. Do you treat. Patients similar patients with any other type of medication like. Like hypnosis to beat their addiction or a. few years ago there was a. There was a show on TV called Kentucky I Alaska which these people would would take, and that would work them through their addiction. Like you know, naturally, you know with the IOSCO. or hypnosis or anything like that. I don't use any of those things."
271.0,Provider,"It kind of like cigarette smoking and some people get off by using a patch and some people get off by smoking a nicotine inhaler some people use of ape there's a medicine called wellbutrin it helps you with addictions and use it most sister try to get them off smoking. Some people go cold Turkey there there's. With addictions or tabs there's a lot of different things to try. i'm a doctor, so I do medication assisted treatment so that's what I do. Right, as far as non medication assisted things, the only ever proven thing that's been proven to work as there's one that's a. simulator that you put on the earlobe. and And that's got medical evidence that it works it's extremely expensive so they only do it. At clinics. But. i'm not familiar with anything other than medicine and groups, which is what we do. With your addition there is no."
2668.0,Patient,um. You mentioned it before how often does Jennifer have to come there to see you in person.
271.0,Provider,"Actually don't know the the. Kentucky border just sent a letter like a month or two ago. read it to you, and they stayed in that. Occasionally, come to the Boards attention the number of clinics and meditation or Kentucky or attempting to off medication assisted treatment. The 100% virtual format printing reports and these providers are offering audio only services, basically, diagnosis and treatment online questionnaires and attempting to carry out directory and protocols, be a mail order mail and samples or self reported till counts. and It says the advancement and continued development of medical communication technology have had a profound impact on practice medicine systematically the use of virtual clinic as natural medicine. Between license and one one location, a patient another advancement and the guy advancement sister may offer some opportunities for improvement over and accessibility of health care area medication is his dream for opioid use disorder, however. They say telling it as an as a substitute for in lieu of deprivation of in person, medical care is not appropriate all circumstances, in particular, this specifically includes patients requiring medical assistant treatment for opioid use disorder. So the mere act of seeing a medication assisted. Patient. has a positive effect. So, and it says much better things but basically it says that. You can't do it just tell him I can't do it by just audio where you don't see the patient and you can't do it by having mailed in urine samples, and we don't do that. right if audio visual and the samples or go to the outside lab just not put in the mail. and The bottom line is it doesn't give us this. Statement doesn't give us any guideline of how many times they have to be saying is it every other time or one time, a year or. Whatever because it just says you can't do it solely. So that means got to see at least once."
2668.0,Patient,I see.
271.0,Provider,"And then hopefully. They will give us some more guideline, or we can find out more guideline about what that's nothing. I I suspect that they don't really know that and they haven't even the board hasn't decided that. I mean they're saying if you're just spending a clinic where you're just. Calling people on the telephone and telling them to do their own pill count and tell you what it is and but somebody urine in a male and send it to me so. that's not The fly."
2668.0,Patient,Right right.
271.0,Provider,Now now and they're leaving kind of everything else in a in a quagmire. So i'm seeing everybody wants and then i'm not seeing them again until I get some kind of word from the board about how often that's going to be.
2668.0,Patient,I say.
271.0,Provider,"The Kentucky is is. backward on on suboxone indiana is much more liberal and advanced and Kentucky they actually have suboxone declared an experimental mouse the DEA is pushing it in the country on everybody, but the state of Kentucky he's still looking at an experimental thing. I see a sorry to get pharmacists, even to fill it because it tells the state of Kentucky has got so much pressure on where the DEA is trying to get everybody on slack so I can. Because it gets people off hope you guys. Right so but we got to deal with. I got a license in indiana and Kentucky so public places in Kentucky to writes about something even, I have to do with the medical licensing board Kentucky says. At this point in time, the one thing they said is. You can't do it just by john Nelson. So, you know as much as I do at this point."
2668.0,Patient,Okay well.
271.0,Provider,"I don't have anything, let me know because i'm a sister here too."
2668.0,Patient,"yeah. All right, um well, I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions I don't have anything else."
271.0,Provider,"All right, then I will tell you that. Very commonly the relatives. or friends what people often are suboxone is fasting get as they want to claim from everything. And I would I would try to get you to see that that's not always an optimal situation it's always a risk and benefit what's the risk of being on suboxone versus the risk of being off suboxone because I hope you know what the risk being on suboxone as. yeah and we don't want that. So there has to be on suboxone yes. it's very minor I mean I i've not had anybody overdose on suboxone i've not had anybody have any medical problems on suboxone i'm not like a people to stay in it. Every day for seven years 10 years and just just nothing except that they're living a normal life now. Right and we can take them off of it, they might theoretically be better to not taking anything and most times most times we won't get off the bus or just tried to go into Director or picking it up so they'd rather not take a pill. Right, or rather not have the pharmacist stare at them, because now they're on xbox on Sunday very good they know they're targeting so you feel kind of uncomfortable we go in. But otherwise it doesn't bother anybody, to be honest, because the dose in half a dozen they don't like there's no side effects to decrease in half. But you gotta remember this as keeping her plane, and this is bringing your daughter back yeah and the last thing you want is for her to relapse. addiction as a genetic disorder and that's because there's chemicals in our brain that don't work right that makes her more susceptible to addiction and some people. And he can be clean for 50 years and still relapse. So that's always going to be a risk. Right it's like it's like somebody has diabetic that lose 30 pounds publisher comes down normal well, they still have twice a day, every single day. You know if they gain weight there what's your go back up. For our number one goal if not be worried about whether suboxone causing damage on that one goes to keep her playing because that's and stay clean. That makes sense to you."
2668.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
271.0,Provider,Okay. And whether she needs it for a year or 10 years. As long as you got your daughter back. You know let's let's go one.
2668.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I agree, I agree."
271.0,Provider,"But if she decides she wants to get off of it anytime after here i'm more than happy to do that. maga push either way I say you need to be on a year. To get straightened out. And then, after your money decrease it that's fine you want stay forever and that's fine and whatever you want to do i'm good with either way. I don't push one way or the other. Okay."
2668.0,Patient,"Okay, well, thank you again."
271.0,Provider,"was nice to meet you I always like talking to the relatives and see if they have anything else to offer and also helped her up some of the misconceptions you get about suboxone. yeah and tuition will help you out from that accident 10 years ago I felt like you did. And the methadone clinics are different I don't like methadone because it doesn't have a ceiling effect more message don't take it works, if you take methadone think present with it, it still works. So it's not as clean an animal as the as the as the. Beautiful Norfolk locks on combination so. As far as having a ceiling effect that's the big thing that makes it makes it safe, is that we overdose just nothing else will happen if you take a person with it, it won't happen. What hurt your livers your kidney and then having long term effects."
2668.0,Patient,Well that's good that's good.
271.0,Provider,"Work long term effects of taking it is you got to keep going to the doctor, you can keep going to the to the pharmacy you gotta keep going to groups you. Know keep the ability to get tired of that you want to take these get out of the rat race and so that's that's main reason we have been taken it's not because it's hurting them are causing damage status guitar i'm doing all that other stuff."
2668.0,Patient,yeah.
271.0,Provider,So I might make a recommendation to earlier but i'll still do what she wants to do later right.
2668.0,Patient,Okay.
271.0,Provider,"I think she's making a mistake, get off it i'll do it so that's what she wants to do this sort of life. Right versus clams your relapse and come back. yeah hopefully come back. Jennifer do you have any anything to add. No um well, you were saying why do I need to be on it, I don't have been it's because it's a genetic disorder, because I never had like trauma or anything to be on to take opiates I just like to. know what causes addiction as as as. A chemical dopamine dopamine in the brain is our reward chemical So if you snort cocaine, you really stop me if you smoke a cigarette you really stoking the pet the dog you really stoking. If you fall in love you really stop me. If you gamble you're really stoked I mean that's every word chemical that's the same chemical for whatever. Right and that's why, when you when you your wife dies you follow up you got heartache its actual physical withdrawal you're actually withdrawing from delta mean it's the same as if we're drawn from cocaine when you fall out of love. Their studies done that, when you pet the dog we draw people's blood and you're hoping level goes up and guess what people love dogs dogs don't you love those up. Now different people because somebody has an individual action adult men and how much don't mean a release So if you pet a dog and it releases I don't mean you, you love dogs. If you pet the dog and not open me gets released, then you could care less about it up so it's it's ultimately a chemical process. Now what causes addiction is how much hope you like your body genetically releases for whichever substance. So yeah 90% of us will take an opioid it doesn't release any domain and then do anything for us 10% of us will get up for a government same without the whole 90% of people can drink and put it down to 10% of people picked up alcohol and there are drugs other life."
2668.0,Patient,Right right right.
271.0,Provider,So it's your genetic predisposition to release don't mean with whatever chemical that that puts you at risk.
2668.0,Patient,gotcha.
271.0,Provider,That makes sense.
2668.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
271.0,Provider,"But physical, chemical it's rural transmitters so her body releases a ton of open man with with opiates so she's always at risk our life that somebody could give her a percocet and that's going, it would be a really good feeling you don't mean if you want to do that again. you've got like junior times X, for the first time, you know they want to do that again. yeah that same feeling."
2668.0,Patient,"Is yeah I never got the the euphoric feeling on on pain pills, you know. Like I said I they just like stop the pain like an aspirin to me."
271.0,Provider,"Like 90% people. 90% of people get that. yeah 10%. dopamine release. Statistically 10 to 20% of population will become addicted to it. there's 20% of population like alcoholic can put on your person and people get addicted to marijuana so 90% of people can smoke marijuana that down not care 10% of people will get hooked on and going to have it. wow so it's just time I don't mean your brain releases I work at an Indian clinic in in Arizona down inside the grand Canyon it's a town of about 1500 people just called supine there's no roads and you go down there for two weeks shift just you and a nurse for two weeks. And every chart I picked up there over the age of chances alcohol currently using alcohol or was alcohol. wow and the Indians were perfectly fine here until somebody brought in fire water. yeah they're genetically predisposed that not only Indians, but you know a lot and more than general population, you know they drink they become alcoholic if there's an article and they're fine. Right, but you get an alcohol and it's off to the races that's that's the journey seven. And so Jennifer Jennifer has a genetic predisposition to just like predisposed to be diabetic."
2668.0,Patient,yeah.
271.0,Provider,"yeah well for predisposition to be fans getting fat diabetic whatever but that's her genetic. But but saying you take it it doesn't do anything for you, so you don't understand and i'm passing away to do anything for me, but it's kinda like the people that you really like dogs and if people don't like dogs you. Like dogs, because you will ever love dogs, but they don't understand why you don't."
2668.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
271.0,Provider,"Okay don't let me. Right, but that same thing they're like Oh, why we like dog so much. guys."
2668.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah well. Thanks thanks again for your time and answering the questions and. it's all good.
271.0,Provider,Right appreciate you joining us. man was a sculpture some.
2668.0,Patient,"It did, thank you very much."
271.0,Provider,"She doing her best geez I get a lot of people that they don't show up they skip meetings and she showed it every single meeting she made herself, I met she's not miss a thing and that's the top 5% of. US lots of people have. gotten dedicated."
2668.0,Patient,yeah yeah good.
271.0,Provider,that's good so you got a good girl there.
2668.0,Patient,Thank you.
271.0,Provider,All right. You can stay on or leave i'm going to keep talking to summarize our. Our case for us.
2668.0,Patient,yeah i'll bow.
271.0,Provider,"Alright, well, thank you. Jennifer this is for the dictation is. Good diagnosis of opioid use disorder and attention deficit disorder. attention deficit disorder is a very commonly associated opioid use disorder and it introduces order predisposes you to get up to use disorder. And their studies that show that if you don't treat the attention deficit disorder you're more likely to to get to relapse on opioids that people that that. Add people that have an opioid addiction compared to people don't know if there are more likely to stay hooked or it takes them longer to get to to clean it makes them more likely to relapse so treating add. helps and the FDA the DEA recommends using a stimulant medication, but that's what works, the best for add in because treating add controls controls the helps control the impulsivity that that makes you want to use drugs. Help some people think that okay well you shouldn't have monitor amphetamine because that's the stimulant that's addicting to. Do different things. Well, good the amphetamine and add PR person doesn't speed them up, it slows them down. So it's the opposite effect so it's not actually addictive and add people and that's their chemicals. And I can explain that to you by Chinese if I put a great book yet on add medicine to parents give it to him every day when they get high school no quit taking our mess This just goes high school kids won't take the message. But if they were taking it and addictive amphetamine all through grade school they couldn't be able to stop it. they'd have withdrawals, but in fact they just quit taking it they sell it to their non add friends who it is addicting for. This what they do. But to an ad person they take it not taking it doesn't speed us up because it slows our brain down we don't get stimulated, it has the opposite of the enemy is not addicted to add people. So that's a very common misconception, I can pharmacist willing to. put them on a centimeter was not addictive add people and it's. it's a tough concept. But again, if it was addictive kids will stop taking in high school because they have withdrawals, and they don't yeah but Jennifer has made her in person visit we're going to keep promising medication. and becomes to grip every two weeks she sees Lisa Anderson every month for. For. Individual psychotherapy and she has her medication. visit, for me, every two weeks. At the group. And indication on Jennifer. Okay, sir."
2668.0,Patient,Nice meeting you bye bye.
