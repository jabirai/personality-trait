14473.0,Patient,Hello.
214.0,Provider,hey how are you josh.
14473.0,Patient,How you doing.
214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking. How did we make it from last Wednesday to this one well."
14473.0,Patient,"let's see the I guess a couple of things of note um so I started. Taking. 50 milligrams of the trash don't rather than 100 so that has been basically I think pretty much since I last saw you. And you know, good news is because it's still sleeping as well as I was with with cutting it down so. You know, for the foreseeable future i'm going to stay on the largely because of the second thing I want to tell you. So i've been working for the last couple of days on arrangements to return to work um, let me tell you I never thought it would be so difficult to go back in the sense of. You know I thought it was like hey i'm just going to show up on Friday and maybe like her, a he's coming back on that, but I learned that when you've taken. 20 plus days of FM la la leave and you work with children, they really want to make sure that it's appropriate for you to come back so i'm. A because I had been targeting this Friday on the thought of i'd come back i'd have a day to reactivate myself with my class and then be able to plan. But uh when I was speaking to my principal and office manager about that on Monday they're like oh no, no, no, it doesn't work like that you have to get a return to work clearance form that needs to be signed off by you know your health care provider so. Monday was a day of just doing all that paperwork and then today I got the paperwork back from Sharon of what she had to sign off on so. um there's a little bit of a wrinkle but it's looking like a week from Friday on October 1 assuming that the district cleaners me to come back i've been led to believe that human resources might want to speak with me beforehand to. Just to make sure that they're you know they're not sending me back into the classroom where you know if."
214.0,Provider,ya know.
14473.0,Patient,"And I mean it makes it like I was annoyed by that at first, and then I took a step back and said from their perspective completely understand it, I mean they have to make sure that that they are putting the interests of you know, the school and the children first and I respect that so. yeah I mean the only thing that's a little bit of a stressor on it is. Is my the leave and the the last day of it is the 29th and then Sharon put the return day as October 1 so I have this kind of nebulous. September 30 day that I sent an email to HR just said, look, you know. I can't be the only person that it doesn't match up, for you know this is this region is there a way that on your end, you can extend the leave an extra day on that and so i'm sure i'll hear back from them in the next day or so. i've been diligently trying to do the. The the different exercises that you gave me last week. i've definitely done them at least twice a day, every day, since we've talked i've been trying to do them three on that so i'm good. I get out of the shower in the morning and then just do them right after that, and then I always do them right before I go to bed, and most of the days i've also been getting a midday one in as as well, and you know I guess if. I mean, obviously I transform stress me out period, even in the best times and obviously just you know, still a little. It depends, when you asked me on how i'm feeling about going back, I mean obviously doing the legwork to do it speaks volumes on. Right and even even going after we met on Wednesday, I got right off of the the meeting with you and I made a coven test appointment for the day was last Friday, because that this way to build that I again in my mind, I was going to go back in two days. So obviously i'm going to have to do that again but to me do making that appointment going and having the colby test last Friday. Again, just doing things that for lack of a better term they force my hand and you know they they're just kind of as we talked about last week just inertia so they're the kind of like inertia pushers Okay, if you do this, then you can take the next step. Then you can take the next step, and you know those steps are still kind of hard for me, you know, and I would imagine they are going to be for for the foreseeable future, but just trying to do them and. Things in place and it was interesting my principal when I spoke to her. And you have to understand my principal adores me and I adore her so she she's not seeing this as I would think most bosses principles would have God get back here we need you here she sees this as I want you to be okay, you know so she puts me as josh ahead of me, as Mr Davis. which I, I very much appreciate and she's like. She basically said, without saying I don't think you should come back and and I said and i'm like why she's like it's just it's just a stressful place and then she's saying to me some of the stressors and i'm thinking to myself those aren't my stressors you know. she's like you have a really difficult kid in your room I said I said his name. Because I knew it from the first two days that I was there and i'm like that doesn't bother me i've had far harder students than him. And then, unfortunately, the latest tick tock challenge of vandalized school bathrooms and posted on tick tock hit our school this week so so you know and wow that sucks and that's is decimal it's it's not again it's not a stressful thing for me per se so. If those If those are the things you're worried about with. me, you know they're not those aren't the things that i'm worried about with me so."
214.0,Provider,we're good yeah okay.
14473.0,Patient,"And you know my mom. You know, when she she met with the surgeon on Monday. And I like the prognosis is probably as good as one could hope for with the surgery as well, she meets with. The oncologist tomorrow, just to have all the options laid out, but if she if she does choose to go the surgery option, it is it seemingly you know. she'll be in there for like an hour she'll be in recovery for a couple hours and she'll go home that day so like I said as far as cancer goes she seems to be you know. The best best possible situation so kind of where where i'm at right now, and you know you tell me if you, we are steering this a different direction on at group on Monday and group has gotten exponentially larger. We have we had nine people and, and this is just a quick aside it just because this is a just out of curiosity. It does is it common to have two very different types of people in group, because it seems like with the nine people, it was very much split between people. who seem to be doing it solely because they have to do it in order to get their meds and then the people who are there because they're trying to actually participate is that is that common."
214.0,Provider,"It so if we're saying that within a bright heart framework, yes, I was saying that outside of Bray hide that is not the norm. And the problem is supply and demand of professionals puts us at the most awkward vulnerabilities so we basically got a park motorcycles were buses."
14473.0,Patient,And my experience in the in the mental health Ward at northridge hospital that very similar when I would. say when I was asking about. Is it usual to mix people with such different needs there and they're like nope but in coven world it is.
214.0,Provider,"It is yeah. yeah I get it, but there there's also you know the. To an extent is it also a a brighter horizon of understanding, like wow wouldn't get a women on that or huh that's interesting. yeah it's helpful but. There are some Aha moments, and then I don't know who the facilitator is so sometimes that's a little bit of dropping a juggling balls to but it all kind of works out at the end."
14473.0,Patient,"Well, I mean it has been sharing but Sharon each time has said that that they're supposed to be a therapist in there as well there just hasn't been one yet. And then, as of October 7 about half of the people who were I have been at the Monday morning ones, including myself, are going to be moving to the Thursday afternoon ones um but uh. We so she went over because they're only you have been two of us, myself and one other patient who have been there for all four of the start of that group. And so we were doing a little bit of review on on cognitive distortions and kind of where I stand, right now, of. You know where I want to move forward with with you in particular, is again I like tangible things to do that's why I, like all the. exercises, because it gives me something to do I think it's helped a you know a little bit. You know, even if it doesn't help at the other times it definitely helps the times that i'm doing it and honestly with what you said, one week isn't gonna do anything going to change, you know my whole whole wheel mo. um but you know I keep coming back to the the cognitive fallacy that resonates most with me is catastrophizing of just seeing any you know. Situation coming up and always looking at the worst case scenario of what's going to be in expecting the worst case scenario, so just in terms of. To me it's one thing to recognize that it's another thing than just start doing something to learn techniques to you know with self talk or with other things, to try to. learn other ways and that's that's kind of where where you know i'm i'm hoping, you know, to get some guidance on."
214.0,Provider,"I think I think it can be addressed correctly, but I want to take them the this moment out to realize. there's a certain extent of conditioning that's happened over your lifetime."
14473.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"So there's the distortion. And now, is I don't want to ever say something becomes the norm, but something becomes. The practice and in the practice, therefore, it must be so now, when we introduce another practice it's very difficult for the mind to accept it right so whether or not I I don't I personally see more of. A boundary issue that you should work on and and people pleasing should be never in your vocabulary and I think he distortions would be a lot more. acute and chronic I don't think he would have challenging distortion thoughts you'd be like. Why are you asking me to take you to stone when you really have a car in your own like just small little items like that, with someone says. hey josh I need you to do this and you do it, and then at the end you're like well shit like I stopped everything for them, and now i'm behind. That now what happened was at the moment it's almost as if you feel the immediate necessity to please someone. But at the end you're forgetting how's that going to feel when you get back home when you're finished, so you got to start off with that feeling first, which is. So you want me to take you to the store when you obviously have a car and you're not doing anything right now. So what i'm willing to do is take you to the store and three and a half hours because i'm going to finish that i'm doing. and hopefully you'll be free, as well, and then we'll go do it because you're not saying no you're just saying I need to delay your requests of immediacy I am delaying the action and that becomes very difficult, but people have learned to that. Like rethinking process has been so beneficial to them to just say I never said no, when someone says this is bullshit you just don't want to do it. i've never said that I want to do it i'm gonna do it in three and a half hours, though, so you let me know when you're available and what we wind up seeing is I don't want to say codependency but the necessity to people, please automatically just wait just withers. Okay, because."
14473.0,Patient,Then I just need So what is it that you have seen and heard in me that draws you to the the people pleaser conclusion because I don't see that in me and.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough, but you have been in a relationship for longer than it should have been. Okay, so why Would that not be people pleasing."
14473.0,Patient,"Because i'm not doing the I don't think i've been doing it to to please you know my wife, I think i've done it for inertia, you know and again on that of fear of change of. A you know of fear of reprisals, for you know of you know of cutting that, and you know, and so, for me, like the the immediate. And again what was in my mind at least the straw that broke the camel's back you know five weeks ago. it's you know what is My biggest concern right now my biggest my biggest immediate concern is Wednesday is the day that my youngest daughter gets recopa tests at school. And so, in till I get you know she tells me oh I tested negative that tends to absorb my thoughts. On you know, on Friday, when I had my coven test, you know it was and because my assumption always is she's gonna test positive. When when my when my oldest daughter came home The night before you know, this also the you know the extremity of this started, and she said i've been exposed. My instant reaction isn't oh okay well you know what you're only probably around this person for a few minutes you were wearing a mask she was wearing a mask you're probably fine my reaction is oh my God, you have common and on that and to me that. You know, it just might be a semantic thing but."
214.0,Provider,"No you're you're you're on point i'm off. On on what i'm trying to hit the target with but let's go back to this one, so you have trouble with facts you accept fear. Okay."
14473.0,Patient,guilty as charged.
214.0,Provider,"proud easily done. Okay, but this is not who you are, as Mr Davis you don't challenge facts actually. You practice facts right we work on facts whatever whatever those facts that's easily but as we we change I don't know we go through a door and now we're josh. josh doesn't want to use facts josh josh wants to resolve to negative thinking as if everything has a negative consequence, but if I remember correctly. josh has had a successful maybe it's not current but i'm going through a process josh was successful as a son as a student became a teacher became an influence with students. met a woman had children grew a family so there's no negativity in there, right now, so i'm wondering if you could say to me. You know, when this started Baba Baba because there had to be accused of made you go from the being valid about facts and now facts don't play. Being catastrophic like they don't play a part, she wasn't a match the other one was a mass you only want it for five minutes you when she finally got coven. So what I would say to us when you do that so Okay, so now i'm i'm at you know, the death of the village. ha is that really true. And I think we're missing or let me rephrase that the missing point, maybe to sit and challenge the thought. Not a whole lot but a little bit so i'm saying she's got coven but she clearly said she will mess you the person will mask wasn't what to the whole time Why am I saying, she has called it like what in that those those that piece of information makes me feel it's catastrophic."
14473.0,Patient,"and It said I don't really know the answer to it, and it has been so habituated for 30 years, so you know you just rattled off the laundry list of all the positives you know of my life and yeah I can I can acknowledge, you know that but. um That being said, um you know, I have a good 30 plus years of practice of of always looking for the new you know, again, is the you know prepare for the worst hope for the best, and I was talking to you know my. My friend who whose whose house i'm staying in today, and we were just kind of like I was talking a little bit of back history and stuff and you know it just. While I kind of had that you know i'm that tendency, you know even in my my early teens it really kind of reached its its full fruition when i'm you know I started having like the panic and anxiety disorder, as I had stopped you know. You know abusing marijuana and started abusing alcohol, you know, and then we talked about having the complete opposite. effects on on just kind of like my my emotional state, but I mean because I said to him today, I mean I went to someone from someone who like 16 to 21. Was fearless fearless stupid, you know, in the sense of just doing reckless things with with. You know, illicit substances on that, but had no fear of it, and it was an you know kind of something that stood out for me is you know. starting my sophomore year in college, when I was doing really well in school and thought I was going to go and get a PhD. I said to my roommate at the time Okay, we cannot be smoking weed in our dorm I cannot risk getting thrown out of school, so it is. This is, we are going to do outside we do whatever we want, we have friends who have apartments off campus fine and we thought we made a bet with each other at the beginning of the year of who could go longer without smoking weed at all and. I found out later he chewed on this bed something fiercely but I actually made it all the way from the start of the Semester to. The veterans day weekend, and so we were both going back to La and we said all right moratorium for the weekend, you know go and do whatever you want, while we're in La. And I went with some of my friends, and you know just started smoking like I had never stopped and that was the first panic attack that I ever had you know, on that, so I had this massive panic attack. That night the friend who was kind of my idol in the sense of like showing and feeling no emotion, which, for whatever reason, I found that attractive I did. On that he wasn't there, because if he had been there, at least in my mind the panic attack wouldn't have been as severe because he would."
214.0,Provider,Just.
14473.0,Patient,"He would have calmed me down, but his roommate who was kind of more like me. He was scared that I was scared which just fed the beast. But what was the lesson learn from that the lesson learned was that was go back the next night and smoke a bunch of weed with my friend and have some anxiety. But have the friend there to talk me down because it's like okay well i'm not stopping doing this, so you know, but again, that idea of you know, even in that sense of of having a really kind of fearful anxious moment. Of still plugging forward and wanting to abuse what I like to abuse anyways, but when when the wheels came off the wagon in 1991. I lost that ability and went from someone who could be who did things recklessly because I wasn't afraid of really anything. going to someone who has been very governed by fears for the last for the you know the subsequent 30 years and have practice that behavior for the subsequent 30 years."
214.0,Provider,"Correct so to to just take it really deep now so at some point, your parasympathetic nervous system. got corrupted because that's that's the system, the system stays in flight or stays in fight for whatever reason, at one point yours was remaining and fight. And then it changed to flight, so the way I try to have this vision about the parasympathetic system is when a tiger comes at you, you don't have time to think to run that's what the parasympathetic system does it tells you get out now. But then when we go back to the same street we always feel the tiger is coming so we're constantly running so the parallel to that is in life. Instead of addressing things we avoid things we become distant two things right, and now you bring up now we are conditioned 30 years later. So the exercises actually from last week are addressing the parasympathetic nerves to reengage it and one of the things, though I was researching. during the weekend is that bearing down that like putting all that and I don't know I did it on my cell for like two days and I kind of found myself i'm even keeled To begin with, but that doesn't mean I don't jump off like a rocket but I found it to actually helped me be more. I want to say. not prepared, but more relaxed, I found myself, not to be in you know the the hyper vigilant if something's going to happen versus a felt very chill. So I thought about it, and then on Monday I journal little bit and I didn't do it on Monday. And then Tuesday started to feel like my hyper hyper vigilance self again feeling like Okay, what are you ready for it and. The reason for that is I come from a law enforcement background I haven't been able to shake that but I did feel that my. Small test for the weekend provided me to know if I can continuously practicing with my Vegas nerve and I can do this, I actually can get my body condition to go back appropriately and not always jump off. On one all the time, so i'm still thinking that that twice a day, although we've agreed the one week doesn't provide as much there may be a change. I would say to another three weeks well, you may find avoidance could be the wrong word or distraction, you may find yourself not doing that anymore."
14473.0,Patient,"Well, I mean the. I mean I don't know if this is wishful thinking or this is is reality or probably some combination of the two is that. What I took heart on um you know Monday and today. was again just having to jump through the bureaucratic hoops for the return is usually, something that would just eat away at me and. I stayed you know pretty even keel and even with that one kind of off mystery day you know my friend i'm talking to him about it, and I said look. worst case scenario, I have one unpaid day. which would lead to. an incomplete year of service, but the incomplete year of service doesn't hurt me because my first year teaching I got mono I had no accumulated sick days I missed three weeks, so I already have an incomplete year of service, so if at the end of this year, instead of having. 29.94 years of service, I have 29.91 because of the one day I don't get paid it's not going to affect me one way or the other, and so I don't know so I mean, which is not. I don't say normals the wrong word but that's not how I would generally react to some."
214.0,Provider,"But, but so this, so this is, this is a little. stunning for me and one hand we could use that one day, to say the world's coming to an end, this is ruined me completely. And the other hand, you said, the self doesn't matter one way do i'm okay with it right."
14473.0,Patient,Well i'm that's that's where you know I guess i'm i'm looking for little victories.
214.0,Provider,Big victory that's not a little.
14473.0,Patient,"Well okay fair enough i'm on that, but, but just you know, let. In the grand scheme of things i'm in a very fortunate position in that. The monetarily, I am very, very comfortable you know. Both my wife and I have been very good savers, for you know, for me, my entire life for us our entire marriage, so we always had have wiggle room so yeah I mean to me. So to me that's it's not an I don't like it when things don't work right so that kind of was the era. era tend to me, but this one was yeah this isn't working right, but if it doesn't work right what's the big deal, I can deal with it, you know that's fine and to take those and then to build them up to to."
214.0,Provider,"I actually would almost try to visualize. What that would have meant to you, six months ago. How you address it today and can we use that as the metrics of saying okay. So I was faced with this one day thing of user service, I was faced with now again a completion of my first year because of model for three weeks so in both of those circumstances I didn't lose my shit and I didn't say the world's coming to an end. So i'm wondering if this you say small I say big. um i'm wondering if this can be the catalyst to go back to when we're saying oh my God. This is this is terrible, this is all going to come crashing down and say wait a minute, let me go back to the one day, I want to visualize how I got through that one day. And said I it's Okay, the one day I can absorb so I want to put everything in this one day framework, because when we be when we are catastrophic It is as if though you know henny penny the you know. The sky is falling, the sky is falling, but the point being is. If we can go back to something that we know we've accomplished successfully and utilize it and not maybe catastrophic that may be the point to go back to to address the carlin."
14473.0,Patient,"Okay that's that makes sense. And the other, I mean it's just to kind of building off of something that you know you said regarding what I was talking about with group, and what I was and what I said about the hospital, you know, in terms of you know. The there, but for the grace of God of just seeing people who are in in really worst situations and and today i'm going to be i'll be really, really crude here, I had a moment of of. of self reproach of all my God, you have been a myopic narcissistic douche bag and here's here's where this comes from is you know, yesterday I was saying to. You know the wife of my friend, who is also my friend, you know where i'm staying with. I was just saying that I felt. A little abandoned by some of my other friends and I said, for some of them, that is completely at my doorstep, you know my reaction to coven have completely isolated myself from the rest of the world. They have no idea what's been going on over the last five weeks, they have no reason to reach out to me or believe that I want them to reach out to me, but there was one friend who. knows the broadest brushstrokes of that have you know, in the last five weeks and I haven't heard from them for two weeks, and I said, I would just. And, and you know, Maria said to me, you know you realize he might not know what you want, you know of whether you want him to reach out to me if you're putting in and, and so I took that. Well i'm sitting in the park today reading and he calls me, and you know we touch base and he's how are you and and going through that and and he says to me, you know. My company is is shutting down I don't i'm not going to have a job in in a few days and I know his wife lost her job so. You know he's worried about you know losing the House yeah and all that if you don't have job and it's just like it was the biggest smack in the face for me of. You know that I had made this all about you know why aren't you there for me why aren't you helping me where the flip side is why don't I there for you to you know i'm that why aren't we there from each other and and and that was. It was it hurt, but it was a good thing to you know it and and it, but it reminds me of why I to i'm taking your why i'm listening to your advice about about going back to work on, is where, am I, at my best man at my best when I can put other people's needs above my own."
214.0,Provider,"And and and and I have to tell you I would I would bank on that all the time and I. Say was a little bit hectic day for me only because of scheduling, but it was there were a lot of individuals who came. And said, this is why I won't do this anymore and somebody else, this is why, and I must have at least 15 times and I said, you know when. you're basically almost finished with treatment when you start being number one and you put someone in front of you you've changed the whole dynamic of how you think. Because the world doesn't revolve around one individual and what i'm saying, for you is and it's really admirable and at the same time i'm really blessed. Because what what what i'm able to see in you, I know you know, but you know what I get to really enjoy what I would I would. envision really happens with the people you work with that that's what brings me my greatest joy, when I meet you did i'm watching a planter i'm watching somebody plan something that's going to grow. And I have to tell you, for me, it's invigorating but, but I know that. In your words, your articulation about shanties even like when you have two different kids and you got to make sure one doesn't think you're favoring the other. Just the the energy of passion, not the energy of force, the energy of passion that goes into tells me we couldn't ask for better nature nurture and the classroom."
14473.0,Patient,"yeah and, and I mean and to comments to that one I just need to learn to take that outside the classroom and I have never been able to do that."
214.0,Provider,"Because it's it is actually. It is not like a fireman it's not like a CEO because they're their jobs are about putting shit out making more money. They don't they don't have the luxury of having compassion they're built one way, but in your. In your field it's really based on compassion and what's happening is, and I think this and you always say you're a narcissist i'm not sure I would agree, all the time. But what happens is as soon as you walk out the door, you know it's not that you don't have the empathy it's that you know one. Whatever is here is not here i'm not built like that here, I do something different here it's not a personality disorder it's just you're adjusting to inside outside. And I think you said, the best thing right now, which is, if I could just bring a little because you bring a little grow a lot."
14473.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's and you know it's funny because i've. Always kind of you know, had that joke of that when I talk about myself as a teacher is almost as if I did have a personality disorder that I, because I do see myself as two completely different people and so again my my my buddy. Whose house i'm in today, when I was talking to him, you know about all the forums and stuff and letting them know and he said to me, he goes. I just want to say to you that I hope that you're going back is for the kids and not for you and I said, what do you mean by that and he's like he goes. You know you can't do this, just because you need something to do you on that to occupy yourself so you're not sitting in a room or in a park reading all day long. And I sat and I said to him, I said okay yeah I appreciate your input on that, but here's where your concern is wrong, I can't be in that environment without putting them first. And, and that, if so, am I doing this for me, yes, and then there's always, and I mean there's always been a selfish component. To my job. It makes me feel good about me, you know, on that it's The one thing that has been the constant to make me feel good about me so on the selfish part of that, yes, I want that back. But in doing that I also realize what I am able to do i'm under no illusions i'm i'm going to it's going to be a tough road for the first couple of weeks because i'm going to have to earn back the trust of that class of Oh, my goodness, you just abandoned us, for you know."
214.0,Provider,slowly.
14473.0,Patient,"And I learned that lesson from my first year of. teaching the class being gone for three weeks with mono and then coming back about how angry those kids were at me not on a conscious level they know they were right. And, and so I mean I get that and I think i'm i'm prepared for, for you know that that aspect of it but i'm like I said I mean. Because games like he's like if you if you go if you kind of fall apart and go back I said look if I fall apart and have to do this again i'm probably never going back that. kind of what we had talked about, as well as you said. You know don't resign until you give it a chance to see if it works, so if it works great I draw strength from it. And if heaven forbid it doesn't work that's the writing on the wall and I can then start making arrangements for what I can do with the rest of my life but um yeah i'm not concerned about that, but. You know, again I just I there's been. My parents met as teachers my mom taught for 45 years my dad taught for to. My mom thinks it's the greatest job in the world, my dad would rather scrub toilets with his head then then do that and I actually have tremendous respect for my dad. for getting out when he realized he hated it because I know a lot of teachers who just stay in the job because it's gotten good benefits and you get your summers off in and they hated and they hate the kids but. My mom understands me as a teacher in a way that no one else does because that's what she got out of teaching."
214.0,Provider,Okay.
14473.0,Patient,"And so, so yeah I mean i'm encouraged with that, and you know and and like said i'm really happy that I get to meet with you do, one more time before I go back."
214.0,Provider,"I also, I also want to. I don't want to dampen this, but there is a thought in my mind. I, I think that it's fine to build someone's character about what their performances and employment because it's a performance it's an orchestration and to the way we serve it the way we've. delivered or we talk. But bigger than, that is, I think you know when when we say this for others that's an obvious to me, but then I gotta come back to a little bit of reality and so okay so josh. So your light your lights going to be live at school because of how you can provide our new youth in this world to be the leaders, they need to be fabulous but then i've got to be realistic, with you to say you know what are we doing about the elephant in the room."
14473.0,Patient,"You know and unfair um. You know, we. I guess as far as just be straight answer to that is i've done nothing yeah. and But at least my wife and I have had. A couple of of civil, you know conversations with each other and it's um you know she. yeah I think I mentioned to you that I had last week that I confronted her with like, do you even care and what her reaction to that was so I mean even a couple days ago. You know she just texted me, you know how are you and and then i've been telling her you know little broad brushstrokes about you know just the therapy and what i'm doing and whatnot um I mean. I know this is a completely you know non productive. comment. But there's the inertia thing there obviously for her to i've not been living in a house for five weeks and then she doesn't ever asked me, are you coming back. Or what are we doing, why are we continuing this either so and and so again that doesn't take any of the responsibility off of me, you know, for what I need to do. I mean this i'm just might be bullshitting myself here, but for me i've always kind of needed to deal with a stressor at a time and so. Not only the going back to school and you know, and what we were talking about with just you know facts versus fear Okay, there has not been a covert case at my school for over three weeks. There has, you know I survived the the mental health Ward with no code protocols whatsoever on that without getting comfort. i'm and i'm trying to take those personalized facts so it's not just you know some giant raw numbers that I can see on the news every night. i'm trying to see them on how they how they clearly how they affect my immediate surroundings, the fact that, despite my wife, where she is. She has not well at least we don't know if she's gotten cold, no, no, no, she on that, but yeah these she hasn't gotten sick with corporate whether or not she said, I mean i'm of the belief that. At the very beginning of this, I think all four of my family had it, we were all devastated with every single symptom before anybody really."
214.0,Provider,know what was going on.
14473.0,Patient,"um so um you know, on that and just trying to take that have OK, so now don't be afraid to go back to work with the covert it's you know it's you look someone's going to test positive it's you know just statistically speaking it to think that there's not going to happen. Is is probably 90 However, if the evidence shows that there's not going to probably be some massive outbreak of Cobra. I agree."
214.0,Provider,"yeah let's see look at that look at this thinking this is again I gotta get we gotta stop when we catch him. This is factual thinking. We had the one day we got over we processed it we didn't allow it to overcome us, the facts are based on three weeks. The chances are that the outcome would be catastrophic it's not there, the facts present to me that it will happen, but it will not happen as if the school will be shut down people start dying in my school you use somehow. i'm i'm wondering if you're if you're swinging out of a lane and you're coming back you're slowly I think utilizing facts and saying this is why i'm having. This is this is how i'm expressing what i'm thinking because of facts and i'm wondering what if what we're doing same the last 30 years a condition is always present and that isn't true really."
14473.0,Patient,"Well, I the dilemma that I have with this is and and you know I think we've talked about this in the sense of it's not like I can't I have a. problem seeing the facts it's not like I mean, I still think you know from like an academic intellectual level, I think I am a pretty rational person in terms of how I can think through things but i've for 30 plus years i've let the feelings kind of you know. take precedence over the over the facts."
214.0,Provider,"Well, put."
14473.0,Patient,"And, and so, as far as the situation with my wife, this is what i've been trying to tell myself for the last couple of days is OK, when she finds out that my youngest daughter is vaccinated and she loses her shit over it. It can't be taken back she's vaccinated Okay, so how, no, no matter what she says, no matter what she does, and that also taking it that my wife asked to be intelligent enough to realize that if she wanted to. You know, take some extreme measures to punish me for this. that she is going to ultimately hurt herself in any sort of split pretty proceedings between us here and to be able to one side, whether the initial storm of it. To be able to say that is like look I understand you know that you feel betrayed by this by you know, on that I I said, but if you don't take it out on the 14 year old. Sure, because, be careful of what you do, because you know with your relationship with your daughter, and with you know. And with you know just potential custody issues with your daughter, and if you want to be bad at me be mad at me, but you know, on that. And just to try to see it more of a way that again it's gone and I appreciate you because you've never pulled you haven't pulled punches over the last three weeks of it in saying that this is going to be ugly or potentially going to be. But, but again trying to say okay yeah this is going to be ugly and unpleasant but it's not going to be a catastrophe."
214.0,Provider,"I I can't I can't validate more that this is going to be bad, but it's not going to be with a world just falls apart and disintegrates. And I think what I like about the conversation i'm hearing is you're preparing your a psychologically preparing for this so on the offset of the volcano erupting it won't feel so hot. Because we've already. was trying to condition how this is going to be and really this will be the catalyst. To presumably what would be the end of the relationship or not i'm not sure, but what i'm saying is I like that you're preparing. And I also want to I don't think I need to caution you because sounds like strategically, you know this. there's no need to add anything other than I understand right, you can just say what I understand for the next 10 hours are yelling at you, because anything else would engage a more fuel firing."
14473.0,Patient,"Well and good I appreciate, you really reinforce something that I have been kind of playing out because. I know it's you know what I kind of had in my you know arsenal for this, for lack of a better term is for an extended period of times. You know, probably, about a year ago um. You know my wife, I decided that my that our daughter needed to be able to interact with other people, and what I was being told, was that she was meeting her friend. In the backyard of her mother's apartment complex grandmother's apartment complex by the pool area. I found out after a few months of that that's not what was happening that she was inside the House that you know unmasked and all of this. And and and I I picked up enough clues that I just said to my younger daughter, I said. I said look I need you to tell me the truth here, I said i'm not going to be mad at you, I just want you to judge tell me the truth and and is this what's going on, and she said yes, and all I said was i'm sorry that you felt the need to lie to me. On that, and you know but knowing where that was coming from. So you know, in my mind initially is like if my wife was going to say you know you did behind my back you got our daughter to lie, and all these things i'm going to say I was gonna say say. How is this any different from what you did you didn't respect my feelings about this, you didn't respect my opinion, but then starting to say that's not gonna do any freaking good that's just that's throwing gasoline on the fire and you know. And you know this can't be a tit for tat going back and forth it's and she's she's going to feel betrayed she's going to be angry."
214.0,Provider,"No doubt, no doubt, and I I get it, but I, I would just. What i'm what i'm what i'm suggesting, and I think you you kind of took the cue on it is anything we say is going to be volatile anyway. bringing out the facts of show you want to forget that you betrayed me. At that point, really is useless even what around five will be useless because it's not the right thing at the right time and what i'm saying is. also prepare yourself, for whatever the three I wouldn't do more than four words, in the sense just say him over and over and over again, because she's gonna figure out. And that volatility you won't feed the flames, and she will fan out just by herself, whatever it says you're a fucking idiot, and this is all you got the same answer."
14473.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean and and I think I I did that pretty well when she found out about my older daughter, but my older daughter, I had a whole lot more maneuverability because my older daughter is 18 and could. leave me and then do it, you know. On that, so it was just like she you know. It wasn't my thing to tell she's 18 years old, she made these decisions."
214.0,Provider,She yeah for sure yeah I agree.
14473.0,Patient,"And I just kept I kept that this one again a little bit trickier obviously because on that, but so I don't know I mean I don't i'm not going to make you or me any promises of when i'm going to start the ball rolling on this because I. Just i'm not there right now."
214.0,Provider,"I also want to be clear, I think that I started to run before the shot was fired so I need to go back and now only apologize, but realize that sometimes. Although I believe what i'm about to say make sense it's not coming across correctly what I meant by the elephant in the room is your timing is your timing. And all I want to do is hit you, I just want to pick you, for the moment to realize that the elephants in the room, I am not here to establish what I think is a. Great timeframe, you should be doing this is 72 that I wanted to that's that's not my position, my position is, when I see all this growth. No, I no one wants to be deflated but we always have to be aware, you know that we're portraying half of the portrait and we need to see another half, and I think, as long as there's a reminder. it's awareness and if I play into not talking about it i'm actually giving some false illusion, as this this kind of brings it up so. You know, then, then it looks like i'm agreeing that won't be a problem, so I want to just I want to tell down on my side to just say, I just want I just know that you're aware. And that's all I need to do there will never be so what what's the plan, I rather the plan be. On me seeing you and you tell them, you know what I am I am so grateful that I did the paperwork wasn't worried about the one day I went back to school, I believe I am 99% point nine on that and I think that is going to be your catalyst your growth, whatever that growth is."
14473.0,Patient,"No, I agree, in the sense of a you know it's like. I want to go back to the well that has always brought me strength to get the strength, I need to confront the elephant in the room, and you know, and I know that you know I don't want to sit here and wringing my hands over whether or not I am doing this backwards, because I know that. I do have some people who I care about in my life, who kind of know my situation, who think i'm doing this backwards, who think you needed to deal with that situation before you deal with a work situation and I have made the decision. That, I think it's better for me to to get back to what makes me feel best about me and get the strength to be able to do it there, look if it all blows up it all blows up on that, but I said I don't. I mean, I think it's pretty apparent that this is the most positive i've been in the four sessions that that we have had."
214.0,Provider,No question.
14473.0,Patient,"yeah and and so in that regard alone i'm going to say i'm making the right decision because, if I can, if I can you know have that and have a day. You know, and like I mean i'm also realistic enough to know, and especially with the two kind wonderful people who are letting me live in their home, you know they they see the vison me. See the good day and then oh my God, he is like completely isolated won't talk to anybody, and you know and i'm not you know stupid and things like that i'm not going to have days like that, because I am, then, I always have and and. that's molly. Always gonna have to struggle with."
214.0,Provider,So you go.
14473.0,Patient,"But um. You know I just. I just want to. You know, try to find the positives where I can and and try to try to you know build on those to give me the strength that I don't feel that I have for maybe some of the other things yeah look The bottom line is. The shoe is going to drop soon whether I want it to or not. And and, and so I just i'm just trying to get these little shots of positivity to for and and if I am pass if I am so passive that I don't we deal with it until the shoe drops with it because I have no other choice. than, then so be it yeah i'm going to have to deal with it, then, but hopefully I will have built up some some good stuff in the meantime that will."
214.0,Provider,"I know I think you're building up your Armor correctly. Because this is what this is this is Armor we feel good about ourselves, we can intake a lot of incoming missiles we don't feel good about ourselves one incoming missile can destroy us. So, and I think you know I I appreciate Anybody who thinks they have an idea, the problem with that is they're not you i'm not you. But my speculation on a strategic form is based on communication you give me right, and someone else's is like you know you shouldn't do that here's the problem that this is Vegas it's either going to be auto even red or black we're going with the best. we're not going with nine you know knock on whatever oh so what you know I always believe from the practice that i've done for quite a while. i've known people to survive stronger by going back to the well and then being rejuvenated by addressing things versus feeling like they're corrupt and broken, and then I can't find the well again i've lost the well. that's what I found like they can't go back to the Korea they're either so destroyed or or. So non motivated because of working through processes that they can return so on the onset of an early return to a well for me is always the best idea why because, if anything, has the most potential to spark would be that devil he's not going to be a sponsor."
14473.0,Patient,"And i'll be honest with you the other kind of shot in the arm for me was cutting the medicine in half, and still being able to sleep and because you know as we've talked about the. I just it's not something that I ultimately want to be on and and so i'm trying to make. What I least I feel are smart decisions so like, as I am now going to transition back into work, and you know the next week and a half, I think it would be. stupid on my part to cut it out, because I don't know if I got so right now okay i've cut it in half i'm still being able to you know, to get the benefits of what the medicine is supposed to do, but yeah I mean I need to get through the next to hurdles before I."
214.0,Provider,"experiment with that, but again we're we're processing."
14473.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"we're saying okay i'm not a fan of any medication, but it has been working, but I think he can work at half the range so i'm going to do that. And i'm going to do that only because of I gotta go back to my well I can't be tired and Moody because i'm not getting sleep, this is processing correctly."
14473.0,Patient,"And the other thing that the positive that had today is just you know I am significantly further from my workplace than than I was. You know if I if I were living in my house, and so you know today I did a little bit of legwork of looking at traffic patterns and how long is it going to take me to get there and. That was again I like that I like tangible things that I can do that I can actually do, and then on just the Nice note which is you know, maybe neither here nor there for you, but I. And, but this was something that made me feel really. loved um is that my friends, whose house i'm staying and said because they know that one of my biggest concerns is my my oldest daughter, you know in terms because she doesn't have the best of relationships with. With with my wife on that and they said to me look, you know you get yourself reactivated with school, you know you, you know you're welcome to stay here, as long as you want to as long as you need to, but if you transition out. lily as welcome to stay here, you know this is. This is a place for her, and you know, on that, and you know, we want the because of who she is you know we because of your situation you know you're just kind of staying here as a guest but we'd be willing to. Like grantor the room, so that she can have the responsibility as an adult to to be able to do that, but we'll give her a rate that she can afford that she might not be able to do in an apartment was not living by somebody else and. You know I don't know if lily if that would be something really would even be interested in but. I mean Jesus, I mean that that was just hard coding for me to have that you know just say that wow you're not only just thinking of me you're thinking of the alpha and omega of my entire life that you are on that and so that was nice."
214.0,Provider,"Absolutely absolutely so it has been a nurturing week, it has been a a more upbeat more see more sun, not less clouds like it has been I think you know don't make too many modifications to what's worked last week because right we're still subject to ring up. And you know we will we'll take what we take when we got to take it, and maybe we don't need to be so prepared and i'll accept that, but I think the mere fact that you did the paperwork. you're looking at traffic you're putting yourself in the game you're not going to be exclusive of the game. you're in the game, so when you hit the Court you're ready to run and I think you couldn't have prepared that any better because that's how you're going to keep that motivation going in a warm lamb flat, so this is good."
14473.0,Patient,All right.
214.0,Provider,So we're on for next one Is that correct.
14473.0,Patient,"Yes, that that there was, I talked to."
214.0,Provider,yeah I don't know what's going on with everybody. I haven't.
14473.0,Patient,"told me that I wasn't scheduled that i've never been scheduled for that time that i'm like I can send you the emails of the receipts where you've charged me for these times and. So I I you know I they said, well, can you come back into the virtual clinic like in an hour and a half, because I had a conflict with the. Clinical communications assessment that i'm supposed to do with scheduled for. Next Wednesday, at this time, so I called for that, and they said well you're not scheduled for next Wednesday you're not scheduled for this Wednesday i'm like okay well that's news to me, so I know they said they had me scheduled now for today and for. Next week, and then you know we'll."
214.0,Provider,"we'll figure it out yeah don't worry about it that's fine. Okay, but again, two things. If forever reason breaking case of emergency call the virtual clinic i'm there for you. Okay, and the other one is. take a moment to breathe and realize. And i'm not looking to scare you you've done this on your own. There were no collapses. There were no there were no strokes, there were no defibrillators needed this journey and which you just did and continue to do you are sustaining yourself, please take pride in that. and good friends, you have good friends. I know your kids love you but you know what two people out of 200 and something billion people you're basically doing on your own and what i'm trying to save us, you do have the industry to do this there's no doubt you have it, but I need you to know you have a tool."
14473.0,Patient,"yeah and I and then i'll be honest that's that's still that's a hard hump for me so and and you know i'm trying and trying to want this for me to you know, and I mean obviously i'm in a i'm in a better place and more in that mindset than I was you know, over the last few weeks. But it is still not my primary motivation."
214.0,Provider,I know.
14473.0,Patient,"And, and so I, and I just feel the need to be honest with you, but also with myself about that as i'm trying to. I mean it's always it's always going to be about my daughters and it's always going to be about my you know if I if i'm able to do what I want to do with my return to work it's always going to be about my daughters and my students, primarily, but I want it to be about me too. And, but that's that's that's a big hurdle."
214.0,Provider,"What what we'll figure it out, I promise okay."
14473.0,Patient,Fair enough.
214.0,Provider,"All right, josh but, again, if you need me you call me, other than that same time next week. Thanks man, you have a good night YouTube as well bye bye bye."
