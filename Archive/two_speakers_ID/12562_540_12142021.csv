12562.0,Patient,hi ilana.
540.0,Provider,Hello.
12562.0,Patient,"I am so sorry i'm late, I just discovered a huge leak if you're in southern California, but in northern California, it is pouring. rain and I just discovered a huge leak in I just moved into a place tmi I know, but you understand it, I mean there's rain just pouring in the window on to furniture and the floor and and I have to go get the apartment supervisor, so I humbly apologize, but."
540.0,Provider,"It was it's all right, I understand. My apartment it's pretty old and when it does rain, on the occasion it leaks, like the the ceiling links on to things and it's it's so annoying."
12562.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh that is well and in this case it's it's something in a seal I think i'm not really too sure anyway, but the Supervisor is the the building maintenance Supervisor is coming in and out but. But hopefully it will be not too distracting."
540.0,Provider,Right right.
12562.0,Patient,"And so, tell me how you are."
540.0,Provider,"Generally kind of late. So I was doing pretty good with sleep up until like a couple weeks ago, or maybe like two months ago i've been starting to oversleep alarm. I used to be able to wake up around 10 or 11 and just be fine like I would go to bed. Around say like one or two I go to bed pretty late, but I have evening classes, so it it doesn't really affect it but. I had it was it was a schedule those trying to help like I was trying to wake up earlier like I would set my alarm to. Like say one day I wake up at 1030 for Linux day i'll try to wake up at 1033 and then all of a sudden, I just like would sleep through my alarm and now i'm waiting i'm going to bed at like same time like one or two but i'll wake up at around one or 2pm. Well, and i'm generally like when I i've been a lot of friends are. coming home because the seas are on break so i've been trying to see them, but even though, when I do you see them I kind of just like I don't necessarily look forward to it, nor do I get excited for anything in general and it's like I feel like i've kind of just stopped enjoying things. So it's it's like no. it's been hard to get can motivated like these days and I don't know I don't know why this is happening because all of a sudden, it just I just started over sleeping and i'm starting to like lose my appetite like. I would go through the through the day and I just wouldn't feel hungry and, like the only times I would eat is because i'm like forcing myself seat, like, I have to eat like i'm not hungry, but I know that I have to eat right now."
12562.0,Patient,So it really sounds like depressions.
540.0,Provider,Right.
12562.0,Patient,So. Have you talked to your prescriber yet.
540.0,Provider,"I have talked to Sean tell a kid. I think the end of last month. Because I thought I might have like ADHD or something along the lines because it's because I do have like an issue. With. I would say my time management skills are on and off sometimes i'm really good with keeping up to my work like I like to. Work on each individual assignment like an hour every day for the week and sometimes i'll be able to manage that, but then sometimes like the next week, for some reason I just burn out really quickly. And then I wouldn't sometimes it's really hard for me to finish like personal projects and stuff like that, so I talked to her about that, and she gave me like this question here, and I have yet to talk to her again about it."
12562.0,Patient,"Okay well the ADHD sounds like it could go on the back burner for at least a short period of time, while you get the. Depression. monitored and. Are you taking any medication for that."
540.0,Provider,I used to be on lexapro but it didn't really help so so shauntel had me come off of it.
12562.0,Patient,yeah My concern is that it sounds like you're not it would not sounds like you just told me that you're not feeling interesting things your sleep is gone to sleeping a lot and. And you're not feeling as your it doesn't sound like you're feeling like yourself. yeah yeah any sadness any. thoughts of self harm or anything like.
540.0,Provider,"That necessarily sometimes it's more like sometimes I just wish I wasn't here I don't have like. Like any intention of doing any self harm it's more like sometimes when I say like Oh, I wish I wasn't here, sometimes I wish like Oh, I wish I was in Italy doing something else, or something like but. um."
12562.0,Patient,So it's it's a. difficulty or a. and unhappiness around what your life is rather than a desire to not be in life.
540.0,Provider,yeah basically okay.
12562.0,Patient,Okay. sounds really hard.
540.0,Provider,"yeah especially silly. So it's finals week, but because I do animation I don't have tests quizzes it's just projects and i've turned everything, like all of my final assignments and except for one last one, and so that's the one that i've been trying to focus on but it's like. No. Like sometimes I just it's it's hard to just force myself to just sit at my desk and it's like I can do it once I actually start, but the actual starting part is just the artist."
12562.0,Patient,"Okay, so it does sound like you, are are having some issues with focus to. Getting sort of geared up and focused on what it is that you want to be doing, need to be doing."
540.0,Provider,"is very like on and off sometimes I would have no issue at it and sometimes I do and I don't I it's like I can't really control it, and when I do or don't and stuff like that and it's not consistent, which is the biggest problem for me."
12562.0,Patient,"You know that does make it challenging again that's work, one of the things that does bring me back to the idea of. It sounds like they're raised an issue with focus. yeah so when is your next scheduled appointment with chantel."
540.0,Provider,I was actually going to schedule and I for this. Like I was going to go back to the. Brain hurt.
12562.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds like it might be a really good next step in terms of starting to differentiate starting to get a sense of what's depression what's potentially a dd or ADHD. and seeing if we can create a. You know. solution that incorporates both of those and gets you to a place where you feel as though your life is working better."
540.0,Provider,Right.
12562.0,Patient,"From a medical standpoint and then there's also the emotional standpoint. Is what i'm here for. So. I hear that you have class at night, do you feel like you're on a schedule that actually works for you, or do you feel as though shifting your schedule at all might make a difference."
540.0,Provider,"um what I usually do is I would finish all my late. Personal household chores before class and then i'd have class and then after I be able to like have dinner and relax. So that's that's how I would you like go through my day, but the problem is it's like i'll sleep through the day and only wake up when I have class and so that's that's like the problem i've been having recently."
12562.0,Patient,yeah when you try to wake up or get up what happens.
540.0,Provider,"I either get like really dizzy. or. Like i'll just start to feel sick until I laid back down. So sometimes it's either late. Sometimes i'll be able to get up and i'll be able to do like just one thing like walk my dog and then as soon as late, right after i'll just feel so tired that i'll just end up crashing on the couch or something like that."
12562.0,Patient,Are you on any medication. But you're feeling dizzy or even sick to your stomach i'm assuming you're talking nausea.
540.0,Provider,"not know ozzy I just like wouldn't you know that link tightness that you get when you have like a cold or feet, or something like that."
12562.0,Patient,Okay okay so under the weather.
540.0,Provider,it's kind of basic.
12562.0,Patient,"yeah speaking of brain. And okay. Well, I wonder if the dizziness maybe this too is the result of low blood sugar what you're eating like."
540.0,Provider,um so far it's it's going it's been going down because of poor appetite.
12562.0,Patient,"that's what you said, so how often are you yeah."
540.0,Provider,"I used to eat a full three meals, a day but it's been good went down to two it's been going down to one. But it's just like I kind of have to, I have to remind myself. That, I have to eat basically throughout the day."
12562.0,Patient,"Okay, so it sounds like your blood sugar is off for sure and that's contributing to the dizziness. right that yeah being off balance and and. In feeling like you're an equilibrium is off when you stand up in that blood rush so."
540.0,Provider,"Also, when I do eat like caffery it's like i'm really easy to fall into a food coma so and it's like i've tried. Looking up late oh don't eat too many carbs so i've done that i've eaten, just like purely like low carb purely vegetables and link lean meats like chicken. And even after like it's like I would get so drowsy it's like I don't know what it is what I could eat that wouldn't make me drowsy after eating it."
12562.0,Patient,"I can't see him through that obviously I don't know for sure, because because i'm not in your body seeing what's happening and. And you may need some blood tests great one of the things that stands out to me right now is the possibility that you're just off kilter enough that your body needs more regular food, but because it isn't getting that even a little bit of food makes you tired. Right and and that it needs to get balanced out The other thing that really occurred to me that i'm wondering how much water are you drinking."
540.0,Provider,I drink like a want to be like one and a half to two of these a day.
12562.0,Patient,"Oh that's not. No it's not enough and I want you to stop drinking out of plastic. Okay, that was my that was that was for the mom and me. Because it's you know you're getting chemicals you don't need when you when you drink out of plastic like that. uh, but that is definitely not enough water so you're you're a combination of undernourished in dehydrated sounds like and i'm not blaming you i'm suggesting that there is something pretty significant going on. With your biochemistry. Right yeah so. You know I, my first thought and suggestion is that you start to. When you open your eyes, the first time you have something close to your bed to. Like a couple of almonds comes to mind or. Something like that NUTS that have some protein. And then you get up and you can have a small meal as quickly as possible, and then you make sure that you have another meal four hours later, and then another meal four hours later, so that you are starting to rebalance your your system. It just feels as though you're you're out of whack and i'm wondering if that would benefit, you also, though, I would when was the last time you add blood tests to see what was going on with your chemistry."
540.0,Provider,"um last time I had a physical was like a plus plus bloodwork was a year ago, so i'm i'm up to get. Up to have an appointment with my physician soon."
12562.0,Patient,"sounds like a good idea, because. At this point, we're doing some guesswork."
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12562.0,Patient,"Although it does sound as though there is something going on biochemically. And it also sounds as though. You know your your whole schedule, because you're doing things you're doing something so intensely school and and it is not on a nine to five schedule that it's also throwing you off your circadian rhythm."
540.0,Provider,Which right.
12562.0,Patient,"In your sleep. yeah. So hopefully that will make enough of a difference. When you start to get some answers that you'll start to feel a little bit more comfortable because I imagine, this has been disconcerting you're so young."
540.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's. I know. Sometimes it's like. i'm. Like what is what is it that i'm eating literally. Making me. What am I, like I don't know it's it's more like I don't know what to do, necessarily like sometimes I wish I had. Like a dietitian or a nutritionist like to help me with when it comes to food and then. Also because of school I used to go to the gym but because the school I had early I wasn't going to the gym enough, so I ended up canceling my membership so it's like the most play activity that I like exercise I do is just link walking my talk for 30 minutes but. Overall I don't really do anything else, but I assume, but like in the spring it'll change because I did sign up for. readers for three different sports. So it's like it's more like. Should I start now or, should I just wait until spring and it's like, even if I do it's like. i'm not really sure. it's more like waiting to see if if, like it will get better or not."
12562.0,Patient,"Well, and at this point, I mean exercise, of course, is going to make you feel much better and. that's absolutely a positive that you can add to your life and it doesn't feel like you're getting enough sustenance for water right now to make exercising healthy. You know and and it could be, if you started exercising it would have you do more eat eat in a more balanced way in drink more water but i'd like to see you start there instead. Okay start eating better, do you know your blood type."
540.0,Provider,"and I know it should be somewhere in my files, but not know I don't know it."
12562.0,Patient,"Just curious because it does sound like you're eating. Food that would be very conducive to you feeling balanced from vegetables, but it isn't it doesn't sound like it's working well and. i'm not I am not an expert on blood type and food by any stretch but i've heard enough about it to and from people about it that it seems like it's got some values, so it assuming that may be. may be a part of it, like maybe you need more carbs or I don't know I don't I certainly don't know that realm is outside of even anything that, as you said, you'd like a nutritionist. But it does sound like food and water uh."
540.0,Provider,huh.
12562.0,Patient,"How about. Emotionally how are you feeling I know you said flat, or at least that's what I heard like not good not bad."
540.0,Provider,"Basically yeah that's just how i've been for. A while even like even before this it's like it's been that way, even when I had like a schedule it's like and I followed it, and I was healthier than I am now. that's how I felt it's just like nothing really made me excited nothing. Was particular particularly enjoyable been neither was it like I know. i'm. In I know even when I see people are i'm with people that I like or i'm supposed to i'm doing something, but i'm supposed to like it's like I don't really I don't necessarily feel anything about it and. I know and it's like I don't know. What it is that i'm doing because, like there were times, where I did have like a stable life or like I I was able to manage like a set schedule, every day, but even then, I still felt the same way, so that it's like it's never changed, no matter what I did. And recently i've started to like. i've been getting like a little more annoyed at small things than usual it's like oh someone came into my room without knocking or. Someone said this small thing but. could be overlooked, but it's like it's it when it's not necessarily like about me or something it's just something that either I like disagree with, or I think is stupid and it like it'll annoy me more than it usually does and it's like. I don't i'm not sure Ellen even even when it comes to like getting angry it's like I play like this game I play this video game with friends every so often and usually it's supposed to me it's. it's one of those types of games that you get really frustrated with easily and they always get like. Like everyone I play this video game with they get super upset over. Like they get upset over it sometimes it's like. But i've never and they're like, how do you not get upset and i'm like it's I don't know and so all those times it's just like more like a lack of sensations stuff like that."
12562.0,Patient,"Okay, so this may feel like it's out of the blue, but. Have you had a history of addiction."
540.0,Provider,know.
12562.0,Patient,"Because one of the things i'm hearing is Anna don't yeah I don't know if you know that word but I love, I mean I don't want that I don't love that word but I love that word if that makes sense."
540.0,Provider,yeah no shit it. it's like i've. i've tried like alcohol and marijuana was the first I went but I don't like the feeling of getting high I hate it a lot so that's why I don't do it.
12562.0,Patient,"that's great. Well, what I was looking for. really is outside your universe."
540.0,Provider,No.
12562.0,Patient,No don't yet is something that people who use math for a one time. Experience for a fairly one period of time after using so so I was just checking it out.
540.0,Provider,Because I.
12562.0,Patient,"ran islamia so strong. i'm sort of like. Not here, no they're not not carrying a lot not carrying a little bit it it's it's flat very platform."
540.0,Provider,feels like right.
12562.0,Patient,"And, and so. Being able to support you in that particularly as you talk to share Intel and and we really try to support the movement for you in. feeling a shift in a difference and having your life's work the way you want to. Right, so one of the things that i'd like to suggest in terms of your your focus going forward or your treatment plan to make it more official in the records is. That you do start to eat three meals, a day, even if they're tiny to start, especially the first one. And that you start drinking more water. Help clean water possible yeah and I don't know if that makes sense to you, but. filtered or I don't know if you've got a Britta at home."
540.0,Provider,We don't. The my parents just they always buy these large tracts of water bottles from costco. Okay yeah.
12562.0,Patient,So you've got what's in the House. And I hope I didn't sound critical I just worry because.
540.0,Provider,"No, I completely understand my boyfriend is the same way, he they don't have water bottles they use like he uses a hydro flask and and he's like don't drink out of the bottle i'm like."
12562.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's a well at once, so many levels but um yeah I really, really love it if you could. And I don't know what your financial situation is like, but if you could even invest in a broader picture."
540.0,Provider,yeah.
12562.0,Patient,We can get one for Christmas.
540.0,Provider,yeah we can definitely buy one it's just I even told them like stop buying bottles like environmentally it's bad.
12562.0,Patient,I can't say that but it's it's Horn.
540.0,Provider,"I know it's like personally in my own household i'm the only one who actually like recycles um but everyone it's like I keep telling them just stopped by bottles it's cheaper anyways to just filter just to buy a filter. that they will do it and it's like. Why. yeah so it's it's more like changing the whole family's habit, as opposed to me just like yeah. And it's i've tried to tell them before but they still keep buying bottles, like, I know, whenever we'd run out and hope that they wouldn't buy more, but then I open the cupboard in there's more yeah."
12562.0,Patient,"Well, and it may be that you keep the Briton your room and and just use it for yourself I don't know but. I really want to see you do that and drinking I don't have my glass in front of me like I should but joining at least eight glasses at least eight glasses, a day and I don't mean little blesses I mean 16 ounce. Because if I think hydration may make a difference that will surprise you."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
12562.0,Patient,"And then, what are you doing in terms of emotional self care are you putting any attention on how am I feeling today, what do you want need. It you said you're not feeling a lot of interest in spending time with people, even when you have the option or when there are events to attend as."
540.0,Provider,My yeah.
12562.0,Patient,Go ahead. Go ahead sorry.
540.0,Provider,"I do go to like. overthinking thanksgiving I plan to get together with two different friend groups in and I went to them, and it was nice but it's like you know, while I was there I was. Like there are things to talk about and stuff the same things to laugh at but generally, I was like pretty bored I guess I don't I don't think board is the right. term to describe how I actually felt it's it's it's like along the lines of like. When I would laugh, it would be forced basically."
12562.0,Patient,When we hear the word I would use this black.
540.0,Provider,yeah.
12562.0,Patient,Maybe wow.
540.0,Provider,"hmm and and just yesterday, I saw like a really close friend after like. I last time I saw her was during the summer, because she was down at ucsd and she came over and we cook together and we talked on caught up and it's like even then, I was still kind of just there I guess. um. And when it comes to like taking care of myself, I visited like. I went to two day spas on two different weeks like one week I went to this one, and then the next week, I went to another one and I like that I was like really relaxing but obviously I can't do that every week it's kind of expensive but I mean that's what i've done. Like in terms of self care."
12562.0,Patient,"Those are great things. and see and when I say bait those I mean the day spas are fabulous that's a really wonderful way to both detox and relax and do some restoration I love them. And then. The spending time with friends, is another one in but it doesn't feel like it's restorative yet. yeah there's still something that's going on, so. yeah i'd love, I really want to see that shift because you're you're doing everything you can feel school."
540.0,Provider,"yeah it's that's one of the things that's been kind of like frustrating these like what what am I doing wrong why everywhere, I still feel this way, even though i'm doing all of us in. it's like it makes me feel especially bad because, like I can't just tell the people close to me but i'm not having fun. When obviously they're having fun. And it like i'm just a couple days ago my boyfriend knew that I was just feeling like down lately, so he surprised me and took me to like. One of my favorite restaurants and even then like I was, I was thankful, and I, I like that he did that, but in the moment of actually being at that restaurant I just like. I just didn't feel anything I I told him like I was thankful, and I told him that, like i'm happy to do this, but. How I actually fell is just I didn't feel anything. It makes me feel horrible because it's like. How I can't I can't just sleep. See I didn't feel anything for that I didn't think I didn't get anything from those, even though he tried."
12562.0,Patient,"that's painful to hear. hear that you end up feeling not only the. The absence of joy. You know that you appreciate what he's doing, but you can't receive it and have the positive experience right."
540.0,Provider,Right.
12562.0,Patient,"And then, on top of that, you feel bad or guilty oh. yeah. it's challenging. really sorry."
540.0,Provider,yeah.
12562.0,Patient,"Definitely, is something we need to find solutions."
540.0,Provider,yeah.
12562.0,Patient,yeah find out what's going on either biochemically or brain chemistry or. Because they're there is definitely a solution. um. What do you do with your time during the day when you're not focused on school.
540.0,Provider,"um. Sometimes I just play video games, or I watch a show late it's also weird with shows sometimes people are like oh watch this one show it's really good, but I just. don't want to start it like as soon as I start a show I get disinterested or I feel like i'm committing too much time to it that I don't want to watch it and then, when I actually watch something it's like I don't enjoy it it's like I have this. it's really weird it's like i've only been want like re watching certain episodes of shows that i've already watched and i'm not starting anything new. Because I feel like I don't want to commit or I don't want to commit to like this short. or episode show it's like even even shows that are super short it's like I don't want to like started, even though people will tell me when it's good or you'll enjoy it it's like. Most of the time I like to watch something while i'm eating, but for the most part, because of that I don't watch anything when i'm meeting because I don't want to start a shows, and I end up just scarfing down my meal within like 10 minutes and i'm just going back upstairs to do work. And then, but otherwise mostly I would play video games, or like. spend time with my dog he's. I like training him I guess that's that's one thing I do, but he has like dogs have short attention span, so I can only do it for like an hour to I mean not an hour 15 minutes to half an hour before he starts to like get bored so that's that's one thing that I do and then. i'm it's weird because i'm in school for animation and I like to do animation so it's hard to differentiate when i'm doing a personal project from when i'm doing a school project and it makes me start to like. This, like my personal projects because I associate them with like the stress of school. Because it's like sometimes I just want to sometimes I have to draw off or enemy for a class, but sometimes I want to try and meet for myself, but when I do something for myself it's like I end up not finishing it and just being overall dissatisfied with it."
12562.0,Patient,yeah it really. It really sounds like you're having a lot of trouble finding joy or positive feedback from the world in things that you normally love.
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12562.0,Patient,that's hard that's painful.
540.0,Provider,"yeah. And it's like I one of the hobbies that I took up just for myself was was sewing. And I only made one thing and then I just never touched the sewing machine again and I feel really bad because my parents bought it for me and it's like I have this pair of pants that i've been wanting to him because i'm pretty short and blood legs are too long, so. i've just had it hanging next to my sewing machine for me to him and it's like. I just haven't touched it in a while. And I tried to incorporate it into my schedule, but I ended up just skipping it."
12562.0,Patient,"What gannets that it's not that you're not doing things that you should be doing it's more that you're finding joy and things you want to do so, why do that's what I hear. Right yeah. So I am I am committed with you in finding. Some solutions do you remember a time when you did Julie. And like."
540.0,Provider,"It was pretty cool while ago, I think the last time I actually felt really happy was was like. Back in high school like i'm two years in the college now and it's like awesome it's like I associated with just having fun with my friends and going out into nowhere like when we were in high school it's like. i'm. I feel like coven also have plays a big factor into because I remember being out late they're still stuff there's still things that were open really late, but now because of that hours of change things close earlier in there isn't much else to do and. um but, even when I do those things now I don't get like the same feeling or the same rush, as I did back then and. Most of the time it's it's really hard as well, because my feelings of like happiness and joy are attached to people that weren't good for me like. Toxic friends or toxic axes so it's like. I associate joy with these toxic people and it's like it's not like I can't. And, even with the people in my life now it's like it doesn't feel the same and I don't know why. um."
12562.0,Patient,What what made the to mine with those toxic people feel better.
540.0,Provider,"i'm as a time well it wasn't. Like the spending time with them that was toxic is more the how like. Their personality was very draining on me and like how they are as a person is what made them toxic but, at the time it's like. They were always unpredictable these people were unpredictable and they always like Oh, in the middle of the night let's go here or let's go here let's do this and that and i'm like sure Okay, and I thought that was fun. I think. Being spontaneous was something that played a factor into it, but even if i'm spontaneous now like, with my boyfriend he. tends to surprise me when he sees that i'm feeling like upset because he knows that, like I like those but even then it just like doesn't. do the same thing and I don't know what happened, or what changed and it's it's like. I know it's because i've tried to ask myself, these things and try to figure it out, but it's not like I don't really know what it is. I think the closest right now is like I really liked the book that I read in its part of the series so i'm looking i'm actually looking forward to. I have the second book on hold at the library, which I plan to pick up later this week so that's one thing I actually look forward to, but it's like that's obviously not the same as, as we know."
12562.0,Patient,What is the book.
540.0,Provider,Oh it's a it's a classic the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
12562.0,Patient,Oh yes.
540.0,Provider,I have the restaurant i've been of the universe on hold at the library.
12562.0,Patient,And that's so great.
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12562.0,Patient,"that's great. So that is really important that you have something you're looking forward to, I really I value hearing that, in the midst of all of this, I am wondering how much after just listening to you how much. Calvin has impacted you."
540.0,Provider,"yeah it's um the thing was so I graduated spring 2019 and fall 2019 I took a gap semester, and I just I was working full time. And then, right after. In I enrolled in school winter of 2020 and I also bought my dog so. I would go to school, but because he was a puppy I had to stay inside anyways to take care of them. And then coven the pandemic kid so it's like. During the fall, I was at work and I wasn't socializing with new people, because I was at work, and then I start school when the pandemic kids which didn't give me a chance to make friends at school anyways. I also yeah and I also had a puppy who prevented me from actually going out for a while. Like I wasn't able to go out until he was like six year old six months to a year old."
12562.0,Patient,"Because you couldn't leave. But on top of that, it was covert and nobody was sleeping. yeah and now, people are going out, especially younger people but it isn't the same. yeah and I don't know how much of your schools still online."
540.0,Provider,At this Sir so only a couple classes are on campus and they aren't my classes. And next semester i'm taking so my in animations the department's really weird only certain classes are offered certain semesters so. next semester i'm only the ones that are available for me are just. These are just two classes and they're both online and the other classes that i'm taking i'm taking just for fun and they're on campus.
12562.0,Patient,"Okay okay well at least you're getting to campus somewhat. But I do hear that that's a factor i'm glad we got there before we got off, I was a little worried. concerned and wanted to make sure that we address those things and i'm glad we've got a plan in place in terms of you're eating three times a day really planning for that. This may sound really strange to you, but that's okay. And one of the things i'd love to see you add to the protein in the vegetables, which I think is a really great plan is soluble fiber which is things like beans. Black beans Pinto beans lentils. That pretty much wraps up the three the three and garbage cans of beans anything like that I don't know what might fit in your food round that would feel. That would feel like it related to that for you, but i'd. love to see you try it it's very grounding. And, and it balances your sugar your blood sugar. Okay, so. So that's that's one one thing, and the other thing i'm really proud of you for is that you're you are going to schedule something with chantel and that and really look at what's going on and then finally getting. blood tests. And, in the meantime, what i'd love for you to see is, if you can notice a difference in the way you feel, even though I know you're not feeling. Positive like jumps in your emotional experience. When you are spending time with people, what do you feel like after that is it any different than when you're home for long periods of time. Because I think one of the things that's happening to us as a culture as a result of coven is that we're starting to just kind of our world is getting smaller. Right it's getting much smaller and that becomes comfortable, even though it is what we want. um So if you could notice that between now and the next time."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
12562.0,Patient,All right. i'm really glad to have seen you i'm so glad that you came today.
540.0,Provider,yeah me too.
12562.0,Patient,"And again, I apologize for coming on a few minutes late, and thank you for your understanding, fortunately, they didn't have to come back in the space yet so that."
540.0,Provider,made me.
12562.0,Patient,"feel good, even though they wouldn't have heard you I still would prefer having complete. Complete. sacred space."
540.0,Provider,For it.
12562.0,Patient,So that made me happy anyway take good care of you feel free to reach out if you need anything.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you."
