Right. How is there."
298.0,Provider,"um they say that you use about 16,000 word in a day time. The average person is is about 16,000 words that's mind blowing to me. But when I think of that I think of how important words are you know that words can be very comforting to someone you know hearing. You know just hearing somebody talk and say nice things to you can be very comforting there's also the have you heard of this, the Ministry of presence just being by someone. When they're they're down like just your presence alone is enough to comfort someone. Is that comforting to either one of you somebody will sit with you when you're down."

Like I mean I i'm straight to the point with things you know so like the only thing that I really do catch myself like to do. is misleading myself and my Google about how I actually feel are the things that are on my mind, because i'm probably intrusive thoughts, so the whole time I can be thinking something completely non saying. Well i'm telling somebody Oh, you know, did I think it's a beautiful day out, said, you know. might be nice for a while already inside my head it just like some drop bombs. That they."

298.0,Provider,wow and how are you going to deal with that grief.
15367.0,Patient,I don't know i'm still figuring that out i've been dealing with it like. i'm so I just was died found out that that's why a lot of my problems were was from him passing away and I just bottled it up.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15367.0,Patient,living in a bottle ah.
298.0,Provider,"Very much so, we have so many people come to us and you listen to their stories and there's so much heartache underneath it. I would have done the same thing if there, I was in their situation, the pain is just so much and alcohol is like xanax you know it's. it's a way to numb the feeling, so I get it, but at some point you you're killing yourself."
15367.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"So. i've watched you go through a lot of grief recently, but what that's something you to and have in common is some brief. What is the angriest you've ever felt Matthew."
15367.0,Patient,"Oh there's multiple times, but the first one that comes to mind is. I had given one of my friends arrived for gas, money that I really needed and granted I had taken like double dynamics wires and I was you know I have an attic and stuff like that well. My there's this chick that basically a black male name. into. You know, basically, having the fucking live with her, which was just hell and either way, and this chick starts pitching me excuse my language i'm forgiving this dude right and I was like you know what. came back kicked open the door then walk their house turned off the bluetooth sound bar and it's just her they kicked open your door and it kicked it off the hinges. And a slam the next into her wall disintegrated her ashtray broker TV head buttermere head butter wall after that. And then went to decapitate or with a ninja sword and ended up just breaking the sword and a half. And then I went to having a seizure directly after that climbing on my neck and face, because I was so mad, I just wanted to really, really. heard of that person and instead I didn't and I woke up on the floor in a puddle of sweat like what the Fuck is going on, why is everything in this room broken, why is there a fucking X in the wall. she's Oh, you did that thing, where you black out and get super mad I was like oh. yeah that's right. Right and then boom broke my phone after that had another a tirade just me being violent. and yeah I was pretty mad that you know i've had times, where like when I get mad I need to go take a walk I cannot stress that enough, let me take a walk please. I learned if i'm going to be here i'm not going to ask to take a walk i'm just going to take the walk then kicked me out of the one. Because way follows suit i'm typically a pretty happy person I let things slide you know. But when I get into those boots and I just have someone like fucking basically saying hey you can't go on a walk because you're being a bit try now. doesn't let me go for a walk and talk to me like a punk I get a little bit mad you know. and actually really mad. At a you know also want to do is just take a walk. i've already variances here."
298.0,Provider,"So, have you done. Anger management classes in the."
15367.0,Patient,New great with anger management it's just like Have you ever had like a cup of water and you turn it on. And it fills and then he don't turn off the water and it just kind of go like I mean it makes your hand slip and he dropped the glass and it. like that.
298.0,Provider,"it's like that that's a good analogy um when you think back to the time that you really lost it in anger is there any embarrassment you feel what, what do you feel now when you think back to that time."
15367.0,Patient,It is me off.
298.0,Provider,"Still, yes yeah."
15367.0,Patient,"I. don't associate myself with that person anymore. Which is great, because a lot of. I was in a sober living when I met them and they decided to take it upon themselves to. Basically, start the wheels of chaos. In my life. And me being a drug addict and her having money and stuff like that I never had to do anything like relationship wise with her. But she was in love with me and I took that as an opportunity to i'm just going to use this bitch till she's got. which is exactly what I did because she would not leave me alone, I told him multiple times only be alone, I do not like you I don't like them, I like please leave and she would buy. To continue to make my friends be I hated you're being a real deck you need to go hang out with her i'd be like oh dude I don't want you to do not understand this. And then, finally, when I lost it multiple times a year, you know it just fucking. No one got it all they did was tell me i'm an asshole. And that I need to go if I can be a part of this person's life i'm like dude I literally hate her to every T in that word."
298.0,Provider,"So what did you learn now that you're older and wiser, what do you."
15367.0,Patient,What have you that was only a few. Months ago that happened.
298.0,Provider,I was not expecting that.
15367.0,Patient,got three four months ago I did that. What did you learn from it. don't put myself in situations with people I don't like.
298.0,Provider,"I had a time I. lost it like I totally lost it, I was kicking things I. Was throwing. fit like you can't believe. And if I look back at now and i'm like God that is so stupid Why did I lose it, but what it had been was building up to that there is no so. And I lost it at that moment, and it is quite the embarrassing when I look back i'm embarrassed it. And I have regret at how I acted because I acted in front of my one of my adopted children, she had a thievery problem, she was a fetal alcohol syndrome daughter I adopted two children a mess baby and an alcohol baby that alcohol baby is more of. mental retardation. that's but she's very deceptive and she steals from everybody. I mean my children are long gone now because you know i'm old now but back then. How many years ago was this 15 years ago, or so. She was probably about. 13 years old 14 years old and I had been in Mexico and I had gotten all this Mexican candy and brought it home with me and wanted to put it into the stockings of my girls for Christmas, I have five daughters. And I had all this Mexican candy that I wanted to do it, I had it probably nine months before Christmas, and I was really happy that when Christmas come I had already bought this candy. at Christmas time I came I went to the spot, where I had hid it, which was in our motor home under one of those seats, you know how in motorhomes you can lift up the seat under the table and there's a storage space. Okay. I had wrapped it in a bag, I had disguised it I had done everything when I lifted it up, there were candy wrappers everywhere underneath that thing so she had been going out to the motorhome and just helping herself, for the last eight months and I was pissed I was so pissed I. love it as an errant like i've never had i've never been any angry or sense and I don't know why you know. It $20 worth of lost candy and I, I had a meltdown of my life over stupid candy."
15367.0,Patient,See that's like what happens to me is like it'll build up and build a you know and then it's like oh i'm writing something in the pencil tip breaks and then it's World War three from there on out.
298.0,Provider,"And so. i'm going to tell you I don't think anybody can get me i'd beat her, but for that, like, I really beat her butt for doing that, and when I saw. Her like two years ago. I paid for her to come out and see me. She reminded me that I had beaten her, but you know i'm she was still hurt to this day. That I had lost it on her. I had yelled more than I beat her but but i'm still i'm still having to pay for my. outbreak. And you have to pay you can't just act like that and not have consequences."
15367.0,Patient,"I fixed everything I broke in that house repayment the walls, like, I mean I told you, because i'm not gonna work, so I mean I fix everything, and you know even upgraded some other parts of the House that they're right because there's basically my house anyways. But uh you know her mom came home and I told her exactly what she's like well, maybe because she knows my mental health issues and stuff like that she oh What did she do to piss you off and I told her she's a little he. which validates it. Though so time did I really learn anything from it, even though it's something I look back on I kind of cringe a little bit."
298.0,Provider,yeah I mean I.
15367.0,Patient,"have no problem, talking about just about anything that's all."
298.0,Provider,So Jeremiah what did what do you think when you look back to your most angriest moment.
15367.0,Patient,"I don't know I just I wish I would have I blame myself a lot. I think I guess I wasn't so much frustrated. I was angry with God. And I was angry that. I just had a lot of self guilt because. I was wishing I would have been there to help them in some way. So he was still here. Is. his heart blew up. I don't know if he committed suicide, or what but he took a bunch of medications. The end. yeah it's all good Thank you. I just wish I would have been there to help them out. It was on his birthday you like blew out his candles on his birthday cake and then his heart blew up sitting on the couch at home wow. and yeah he was like my best friend like We grew up we're running partners, you know my first cousin and then now many brothers I don't have any like blood brothers and one sister, and he was my brother. So to say. We are tight."
298.0,Provider,"wow let's lighten things up Okay, we have let's say what's something frivolous that you don't mind spending money on."
15367.0,Patient,i'm just kidding What do you mean by frivolous.
298.0,Provider,I don't know what do you think frivolous means.
15367.0,Patient,It was like. Something like oh you got me splurge.
298.0,Provider,and
15367.0,Patient,"I don't. I will spend money on just about anything i'm like. When I go I like to go shopping at costco do their bidding comes in bulk. Because i'm like Oh, we need five of those shovels we need. Three of these breaks, you know when I go out and buy stuff and by twins of everything you know I go online I buy a car parts."

15367.0,Patient,"Car. Okay, it just needs better Carver it's me go broom broom. louder. My car's a do trainings to gas pedal. know I probably dropped at least $4,000 in my car in the last seat covers the seat covers and interior set new interior kid and exhaust upgrade in end or an outtake manifold to the three inch great but. it's not straight, but it does Scott, the Canyon burner, and then a new resonator which just a pumpkin cherry bomb, and then it goes out to a super 10 Hello masters so. By taking my kids shopping and let them get whatever they want with whatever they want I spend too much money on car parks and drugs take my kids to do anything that's why i'm here fixing my life. Like I said rigorous policy right."
