Right yeah. i'm pregnant or 65 or 20 kids or whatever criteria. is different than Michigan so wow yes. sucks I know it sucks but i'm. So i'm trying to find some health insurance and figure out a doctor that will accept it, or whatever you know. Which is going to take me a second I gotta do it quickly, as I can, because it gets cut off on January 1. From from Michigan so. But I was thinking, maybe like that Dr fargo could possibly prescribed me like a I don't know month or two or something so that I can actually get to the next doctor, you know what I mean. or figure that I get through till my insurance or whatever you know."
726.0,Provider,"I ask, let me um while you're on the line, let me see if I can message my supervisor real quick and see if we actually. Take people from Georgia."

13628.0,Patient,"Thanks yeah. anyways and then yesterday was a day when my. sister just oh no my nephew my two year old nephew of the one that's up in Michigan. has some heart because something like heart defect is like a like a narrative or. anything. to heart, yes, we used to have heart surgeries so it's so sad, I mean I think he'll be. Okay, but still snakes scary and sad to think of."
726.0,Provider,scary yeah. just keep spraying them your voice just. See you.
13628.0,Patient,at all.
726.0,Provider,"I can, I can hear you but it sometimes it goes like whatever you're saying takes like a whole minute to come there."
13628.0,Patient,that's probably a fucking rule I hate this rule. I don't get very good service in here so tell me if it keeps happening on the phone.

13628.0,Patient,Well i'm gonna start my sister but i'm definitely not saying they're very long I can't handle it. Is that why you asked. Your new I.
726.0,Provider,"I know I know that once you have kids in the House it's really hard to have other people in just because it's like I remember you telling me about how you had a hard time being like i'm like authoritative like you just want to like. Get alone everybody, but they have these attitudes and i'm like Oh, my goodness."
13628.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well, I mean I stayed with them enough it's fine like it's not going to be."
726.0,Provider,There my sister likes my sister lives that she wants me to.
13628.0,Patient,"Because I helped her a lot, you know I mean so. It won't face her my brother in law she's like you know what the kids they don't know how to feel about whatever. I don't think they'll care like sound really yell at them and tell them what to do, I mean. I don't think they care. yeah but but I can't be for very long because I can't do it, I just can't like I. yeah I put I just Michigan it's just not the best tuition for me. and"
726.0,Provider,"I always enjoy Georgia, when you have your sister, I mean, even if you're whatever happens, like you can always she's there you know what I mean."
13628.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I know the only problem is this okay so. she's varying. huh pretty conservative right, so I."
726.0,Provider,"guess I can imagine from Georgia, when you say Georgia, I was like red state rem sleep."
13628.0,Patient,"she's pretty concerned, which is like whatever that's fine, but like she's very. No, no it's like Okay, for example, is it's just an example, but like yesterday, I told her, I was going to be gone Saturday, this weekend some time here right now and I. told her was going to be here Saturday. And she's like Oh, why what's up and I told her, I was going to be a. friend of mine from that treatment Center but she she like works there now she doesn't go there, or whatever. she's like she say Oh, and then she like drilled me on whether she was just my friend, or like it was something else. Okay, first of all, why do you care so first of all, and second, of all. What is it you know and she's like well, maybe it's just not the best idea I was just thinking Well, first of all, I was just like no it's definitely not that. Because, even if it was i'm not gonna tell her right away, I got to see what she's. saying so she's like. she's like well I just don't think it's best just like, especially since you know she's in there i'm like not enough she works there for one. And she's like yeah I know but. But with like with like this, what happened there with you because I like I told you, I like left to."
726.0,Provider,Right yeah yeah.
13628.0,Patient,"yeah so she's. Some things about it and i'm like So what does that have to do you have anything to do with that place anymore, you know what I mean she's like well you do now i'm like really I mean I really don't know I mean. So I don't know why she thinks that's a big fucking deal like either way. it's. You know what i'm saying says to me Oh yes, you bumped they're. going to be all knows about it and she's gonna it's all like you know, like that's some big worry like that that's the least of your concerns what i'm doing with myself and should be fucking happy, let me tell you. You know, you know."
726.0,Provider,"You know, it sounds like a very similar thing where you're like so what's going on, what do you do it, where you might."
13628.0,Patient,"She goes what what cuz I hung out the girl this weekend right. And like yes not it wasn't like that, though. I mean, I think it was I just asked my friend. On it actually it's kind of weird for me think of anything else I don't even know if I can, to be honest, like, I really liked like like her as a friend, like a chemical reaction and I, and I never really liked. about it other than that, to be honest and like I don't know and then she starts telling us telling me all the ships weekend so it's kind of weird for me and think about it that way, but working out with her, but i'm like a little awkward so we'll see."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13628.0,Patient,But um. yeah. i'm not trying to be with anybody know either you know what I mean I really don't want to be hidden anybody.
726.0,Provider,So yeah.
13628.0,Patient,I mean.
726.0,Provider,"Even if you choose to want to be with somebody it's like you know it's not it's gonna at the end of the day, you're going to make your own choices, whether or not someone is going to be approving of it so it's like."
13628.0,Patient,"Well, I don't. know my sister really knows that."
726.0,Provider,"Julie, by the way, I just got a response back and at this time, we do not take anyone from Georgia."
13628.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't think you did say sorry I don't think he did I. Thought I remembered reading something a long time ago about that, but. I didn't really think you did um which I mean whatever my insurance isn't gonna probably cover it anyways whatever my name insurances so I have to. figure something out."
726.0,Provider,"I think I think even looking at. it's a love hate thing because sometimes like either our doctors can prescribe it um there's pro there might be a program out there that they could. do that. yeah be able to prescribe. But but. it's gonna be because it's a more conservative state there's a lot more stigma around it so they're probably. I don't know how the medical field is over there if they're more restrictive about they're going to prescribe that too, so I would check it out. beforehand before you even go there, I think that's, the first thing you should look for because you don't want to set yourself up. To like go there and then just have absolutely nothing to let it get you over there, and maybe your friend knows, because she's working at that facility she might know what something the doctors might know something there."
13628.0,Patient,"Well, I know there's doctors there that prescribe it, but like that's a whole different thing it's like a private pay thing and. i'm not like I know there's doctors everywhere that will do it like that will prescribe it, but whether they're gonna take my insurance and whether they're gonna are you gonna pay cash, you know. ya know. And, and even if not then there's like telehealth and others, you know what I mean that."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I was just thinking that maybe. In bright heart might not have do anything in Georgia, there might be another program just the cost that is just different and then we'll we'll be able to take you from Georgia."
13628.0,Patient,"Right yeah that's uh I was kind of thinking about doing something like that. If not, I mean if not like, I know I remember a long time ago is down here like and I was sick from not having drugs, I was trying to find suboxone. And I come on there's like this there's an urgent care that was going to prescribe it to me, but they were like it was like internally $300 just to see the doctor. Though yeah I mean, so I mean like if it's an emergency, I could do it, but yeah well like consistently so yeah i'm just gonna call a bunch of places about the suboxone today and see if I can find somewhere that would you know figure out what insurance, I need to get."
726.0,Provider,I just wanted to ask you.
13628.0,Patient,Something because.
726.0,Provider,"I, I know that you, you, thank you for providing your screen, by the way. So this it came out positive for them so."
13628.0,Patient,"You know what that's such bullshit I not do bundles I don't even care i'll tell you, if I did talk among those only rarely take ben's 11 never really had thing with pencils. Like really and there was a little line you could you just cut it was very hard to see she said she could see it, the lady told me she could see it. But."
726.0,Provider,The players like your mom just I can see.
13628.0,Patient,What.
726.0,Provider,"I can, on the on your screen. here."
13628.0,Patient,Oh so.
726.0,Provider,Now you are getting ready so. hey hey.
13628.0,Patient,"Sorry over here, though, so I have a good signal so anyway. yeah so um it was very. annoying I was on a phone call lady for like 20 minutes and just it was horrible and I tried to do it do it the other day, and I was on hold forever, I mean they make you sit in there for like. I don't even know it was more than 20 minutes, this time, the first time was 20 minutes, and then I had to go, but then the second day that I tried to do it, it was like. 45 minutes, I was just sitting there oh my Jesus or no."
726.0,Provider,Can you expect in through they have a virtual clinic.
13628.0,Patient,yeah I know. Oh that's what it is that's what.
726.0,Provider,I have no idea okay.
13628.0,Patient,"yeah but no, I really didn't do pencils I promise I haven't done anything I haven't you know, like if I actually no I did I hit my weed pen Bailey Rae but that's it. Like and that's an even come up on there, but."
726.0,Provider,yeah he didn't even come on.
13628.0,Patient,"Well, I."
726.0,Provider,"Did there was something my. Next, or something."
13628.0,Patient,"No it's a cartridge it's like well. When it was like it wasn't really like a week at all anyway, I know the weed would have come up longer than you know I mean. You know."
726.0,Provider,"I don't know, I was just trying to figure out where that that benzo would show up."
13628.0,Patient,"i'm telling you to be there was a. There was a line there, I promise you that I promise. yeah there was a lot, she said she saw it too. yeah like it, and like. I used to work at treatment Center and if the training was like if there was any line, even if it was like you could barely see anything, it means it's negative and like. The last play okay i've been to other places, these like like dipstick drug Texas or cut up drug tests or whatever, and I cannot tell you how many times. I tested positive for oxy cotton or amphetamines and I didn't do anything."
726.0,Provider,Like.
13628.0,Patient,"That usually ben's those, though, but actually kind of amphetamines, like the line would be either be like super fan, or they couldn't see it or there would be no line, even though I didn't do any drugs like at all, not even like oh haven't done them a week but hadn't done. And would come up for those so I don't. Ask that I swear to you, I know and it's just like constantly but like I don't really care that much to her, I wouldn't just tell you, you know I mean."
726.0,Provider,today.
13628.0,Patient,I have to go i'm gonna go work i'm gonna go to.
726.0,Provider,purchase Monday.
13628.0,Patient,Through.

13628.0,Patient,"Oh, sir."
726.0,Provider,yeah oh. Why am I forgetting this you were there.
13628.0,Patient,I was there.
726.0,Provider,"I got it yeah you are there, my bad i'm looking at my notes you're good you're good you were there, you were there. I don't think enough I don't know why, but you were not there sorry."
13628.0,Patient,"was when. I went down here in Georgia so like really I haven't done any drugs, I promise."
726.0,Provider,Are you going to be moving.
13628.0,Patient,um well I gotta I gotta get my stuff probably sometime. around the beginning of the year.
726.0,Provider,Okay.
13628.0,Patient,"Like where I go get all my stuff for us and you know, bring it down here, whatever. um. Not no it's not my nephew my parents were going to come down here Christmas, but now i'm I don't know if they're going to be up there, because my nephew or whatever what's gonna happen."
726.0,Provider,With your nephew once.
13628.0,Patient,he's in Michigan. Oh no.
726.0,Provider,Hopefully it's something that can be treated. Pretty easily it is scary because he's a little he's too so there's this area with little kids.
13628.0,Patient,"Right. Well he's got a fever right now to get a fever, for some reason that they think that's. completely unrelated."
726.0,Provider,that's how I found it.
13628.0,Patient,"And then sent know about it before which is kind of weird. yeah, so I think it's really unrelated, and this should just be some sort of virus, but they're trying to get a fever, to go down go away with they can't really operate with a fever and stuff so yeah. he's gonna have to be in a hospital for a while pie, a week or two or something I don't know exactly. You know. um but yeah I feel bad because it's like Oh, and then my my sister, and I was supposed to have shoot my sister's life is supposed to have a ankle surgery this week or something, but she can't do that, obviously, so I don't know either all. This plan and they were supposed to come to Georgia, because they used to live down here and so yeah it's just like total mess for them."
726.0,Provider,"So. Are you gonna go see them are I mean, I know, right now, sometimes they don't let you when. I go step hospitals or anything."
13628.0,Patient,"yeah the goal it won't let anybody in and so like. Like I know my. sister loves parents want to go up there, but she's told them that too, because, like then she's just going to feel like she has to hang out with them being go leave the hospital and really they're just like staying there fast, but with him so that. Like in his room they haven't like it's like a children's hospital so it's like set up that way, I guess, so that they can do that, and so you know. They don't really want to leave the hospital much you know at all. yeah so. So yeah no I don't think that i'm going to go up there, right now, I mean after you know inputs he gets home or whatever, maybe, but not always an obstacle because it's like. they're not going to leave you know, and I can't get in their Sim like even if you like, they designate to people like the whole time you can't rotate this with people like it has to be the same two people so like nobody else can see him. The whole time yeah so but I get no but. It sucks."
726.0,Provider,Sorry.
13628.0,Patient,he's cute he's so cute. yeah yeah well and then I put my mom it's gonna kill her not to be able to go see him I know.
726.0,Provider,I said he had.
13628.0,Patient,"A while my dad's like a. My dad to, but he was a doctor, so you know he's. All and it was like a specialist so he's like really smart like so he you know I know that my little sister is going to look at him, but he can't because he's not allowed to go. Down there so yeah."
726.0,Provider,That they find out about that.
13628.0,Patient,"yesterday. huh yeah and they take them straight from the doctor down to the hospital, which is like two hours away or something. So they didn't even get to go home in between I don't know I just told him take him straight down there, because they didn't know what was going on getting like 104 degree fever, I think, and then. They found that out, I guess the doctor that he usually sees wasn't there so different doctor saw him and she's the one who heard the heart murmur. which I guess is sometimes more pronounced when they have a fever, so my dad said it might not have been you know it's bad normally, but this doctor might have been missed it I don't I don't really know what yeah. No, no, no, no, I just say that sucks and the other thing to work my mom to worry about my sister worry about. yeah and my sisters worried about me dating some fucking woman, you know, like. No, I mean. She says it's serious."
726.0,Provider,"You know what I want her, she just like needs a distraction from her own life because you know she's probably so used to her every day that it's like almost more than a month to see how somebody else's living I don't know."
13628.0,Patient,"Oh no I think you know, I think that she just does so, like. Like will you say Conservative or like a. um. So. I don't know just. Like I said just not used to I mean just everything goes perfectly she's got her personal life, whatever like so first of all, she hates it and also doesn't like it, that that you know they women anyways so like but like. You know she snapped at her and she can deal with it, but like. She wants to have any whatever say in it, she can you know what I mean so like. I don't know I don't Fuck I don't know what she thinks, I really don't This is just like what I mean i'm not gonna like get her approval for one or two like like. it's not like i'm like you know i'm not I don't I don't i'm not in the treatment Center i'm clean. she's works there she's clean obviously so like I don't know I mean, and if the treatment Center had an issue, then they can Fuck off too because honestly I mean unless really getting high then there's really I don't see an issue with it, you know what I mean."
726.0,Provider,So we you're not in the facility so they can't say anything anyways so.
13628.0,Patient,"Well, she didn't work that she'll work there, then either she didn't used to work there, she was in there, when I was in it."
726.0,Provider,You know I mean yeah yeah.
13628.0,Patient,"yeah so it's not like goes on it's just another. Another example of my fucking. High fucking end up always meeting people, but I don't know if I can even go on a date her not what I want to do because it's just weird for me to think about like that we've always just a good friend now it's just kind of I don't know and like. I feel like she kind of fucked that up anyway by telling me because now. Even if, like I say don't want anything to do with it, then. Like it's gonna be kind of weird trying to hang out with her."
726.0,Provider,"You know, and not yeah well. to you."
13628.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Oh, you did. Oh yes. yeah sure so stuff but. I know."
726.0,Provider,"I don't know I think like sometimes it's just like if you know someone, I think. It almost sounds, and this is just an opinion, this is not like fact or anything but it's like finding a friend, a good friend is harder than sometimes like like you can date anybody. Put like when you have legit friends that are with you. through good and bad times. You know, a girlfriend and boyfriend a common goal, but a friendship that's a whole different thing so it's like you gotta weigh out the pros and cons on that if it's worth."
13628.0,Patient,"That so she kind of fucked that up a little bit, because now i'm going to feel weird, no matter what, even if that you know, like no, I know, and she will to probably and like. I don't know and yeah I know what you're saying, like, I never really pass in early like dated of like somebody that's been like my really good friend, like ever okay. I never have and like I always I mean if there's a couple of times that that's happened that people like, if I had a friend that decided that. The funnel if they liked me or something like I always felt like it was so weird because I just didn't see it like that, you know. And it's to me it's still this situations, I don't know I mean I thought, maybe she did have a crush on me, but I never, never even got anything in the world which you ever admitted her bring it up, whatever. yeah i'm just like and then it makes it worse because, like I do care about her as a friend so like I don't want her. feeling, you know I mean."
726.0,Provider,"I mean. Like. yeah it might hurt her feelings, but like if it's for the greater good."
13628.0,Patient,"I think I know. I know I know I know, but like sometimes I, I want to like just see all the sale like I told her i'm not trying to date anybody regardless fucking perfect situation or not I don't care, I need to be alone for a while and. So that's the truth, but like I don't. I mean I don't know, even if I do want to see like she just wants to hang out like oh like we're friends or something and then just see like see how it goes, but like. What am I supposed to say like Oh, I still don't want to be with anybody like regardless whether I, like you, or not, I still don't want to open, even if I do have fun with you, or whatever like."
726.0,Provider,"I mean either way I don't complicate it. No, no. thing is like. I don't know like relationships are fun, but then it's like."
13628.0,Patient,working.
726.0,Provider,"The work that you have that like it takes from your own time it takes from what you need to do, and you know because you've been in it sounds like you've been in long term relationships right."
13628.0,Patient,For the most yes and there. Were there were very codependent and I. Myself and that's. Why adamant. about being similar no.
726.0,Provider,"yeah so so don't fall back into the pattern, you know what I need. To it it's like don't set yourself up for something that you know are so easy that like for MAC into it's too easy it's almost too easy to fall back into that."
13628.0,Patient,"I know, when I was like I don't think I mean either like that, and as far as versus my password I don't think she's just like selfish and. Like I don't think she would let me be as um. I guess negligent of myself, as I was in the past, but like. that's not the that's not the point anyways you know, like. yeah that's really know but. yeah so I don't know i'm just be very clear. I guess."
726.0,Provider,it's just showing your new no one's going to have your best interest than you.
13628.0,Patient,yeah true. And I think that goes with anybody in any relationship.
726.0,Provider,"If it fits if you don't put yourself first or you don't put your needs up first nobody else is going to do it for you, and so, then we get mad at other people for not for doing something right but it's like it was it's on us first. To take care of us."
13628.0,Patient,I know. yeah I don't eat and you know it's nothing like my family's always been like that too late to blame other people for shit that i've done like or shift that's happened in my life like what it's like i'm only did it I only made that choice. And even if they were like not the best person to be around or that's the. biggest influence on the one who.
726.0,Provider,"You know, say yeah."
13628.0,Patient,Exactly so like I don't blame anybody except myself but family shows.
726.0,Provider,yeah. I wonder is your family and all codependent do you think that that's kind of like. thing.
13628.0,Patient,Like. With me or when their own relationships.
726.0,Provider,"Just with like your own relationships with each other, like this or any chemical dependencies I wonder like where the poor dependency may have started for you like, is it something that was taught, or is it like something that happened along the way, like knows."
13628.0,Patient,"not really I mean not a lot, I guess, I think that I don't really think they're caught up in their in their relationships my brother is probably but I don't think the rest of them are. Not so much anyway, I mean I think every relationship is somewhat codifying but."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, lovely yeah."
13628.0,Patient,"I mean, but i'm. Like maybe with the relationship towards me at this point, now that, like the things that look like take care of me like i'm a child or like make sure that I do you know. yeah yeah so. I think that almost I don't know if blurred the line and they don't really know how to separate it, you know. It sucks because then they think that like I don't know. They think i'm not doing something right or how they want me to do it, or whatever, and just because, how do you want me doesn't mean it's right, you know what I mean and they don't get that you know they don't see that. They really don't ever see that and so yeah. it's tough to handle my mom and my sister hard to handle sometimes."
726.0,Provider,I don't like.
13628.0,Patient,"Know they're actually very different like they're both like you know pretty positive people and stuff but they're also a little bit like they're very like. unselfish and like giving and stuff like that, but like, on the other hand, there are also like kind of. I don't know, I guess, they think they know what's best or something you know I don't know. Is.

They were grew up around them, you know so like yeah they knew what it was about at some point, and like so I don't know it's all my brother in law, my sister didn't like it, but she could have stepped up and been like no Fuck off this is what's happening, but. She didn't. And I think I mean i'm I was kind of a baby like just just hold grudges forever and he won't like, and so my sister like. I know she has a hard time dealing with it because she'll just be like think it's easier to just give up and not even you know, try to fight it and, like apologize when she shouldn't even be sorry type of thing then. Actually, like. I guess make him see his air, you know what I mean so. yeah so she's dealt with a long time, but then I think that's part of it, I know that's part of why my little sister had to get the Fuck out of here. because she couldn't like like work with him anymore, because he was you know the boss and. my sister my sister but, like the sister had to be putting the middle all the time, and she got sick when she didn't like why don't we put in the middle, she want to have to like go be the in between the two, the two of them, you know. yeah and, especially, especially when my little sister was always in the right, you know what I mean. I my sister my older sister not new it. She just couldn't do anything about it. yeah. So yeah let's partner is nothing. Here, but. yeah."

Totally his know what he's doing his scaring me, I mean I know it's getting high any order so drugs on the dark web, so it gets. Anything he wants because, like when working in so bad in the past, because he didn't associate with people that would get get them like street drugs, you know heroin in or or any and never really done heroin. And then, all of a sudden. He wants he started ordering online next thing I know he's asked me if I can get him heroin and so like he obviously because he couldn't get anything else, or something or I don't know why I really don't. Even have time to order something or asked me to get him that kind of shit and like. So now i'm afraid he's might be into that and I know who's doing other drugs whatever he's doing I don't know I know he's doing drugs because, like this business went to shit."
726.0,Provider,Is your sister.
13628.0,Patient,know his business went to shit i'm telling my brother my brother in law.
726.0,Provider,Oh OK OK.
13628.0,Patient,"My actual brother my brother in law is thought is the one that was judging myself my brother doesn't judge about that no he doesn't give a shit he's actually like. it's very much like me and a lot of ways, but he's just he's also like he's completely self centered various i'm not self centered like that he is self centered like very much so. and his wife is kind of like manipulating him I feel like because she's I think she's afraid to lose him and things like that so i'm trying to walk out, and I think that, like. she's afraid that she might like lose him if he if he comes back and starts being around family again because. Because of everything that's happened now but I mean we used to like really like her, like i'm the one who like at my family to like accept or in the first place, because. my brother was married when he met her to the stupid bitch that he used to live with, I hated her and then and I hated that he was cheating on her, but I didn't like it, I didn't agree with it, I didn't need you know I hated my brother, for what he was doing. You know, he wouldn't tell anyone about it wouldn't admit it, and I was just like you just tell me i'm not mad at you you're just you're like I don't like your wife, of all people. yeah you know but yeah sit here and lie and go back to keep going back to your life and become i'm not doing anything wrong. So. He eventually minute it's me and got me to like meet her and stuff and. Even though she's older than him and like is a little weird no I didn't give a Fuck you know because I liked her and I thought that he was he was happy, so I was fine with it. yeah and. But. yeah I don't know he. And then eventually my parents like they hated the whole situation to and about him cheating on his wife and whatever, but then I got them to see like okay this lady's better for my brother. And a lot of ways, and like he wasn't happy and so, but you know, give the lady a chance to is actually really nice to have that which she was but see what happened is when. At some point behind her back my brother said doing drugs right and she had she had used drugs for a short period. And then that and clean, because she was a nurse. So she had to get clean through like the hospital program so it was pretty like a serious Program. And she did it well, they were together some part of it was while they were together that's how they met and some meetings. and But then my brother started like using. And behind your back like can do about it, of course, because I was half the time getting the drugs. yeah which was fun Oh well, yeah um and then at some point she found out or something and I don't know if she like then started doing with them, because she eventually quit her job and decided to start working for him right, which was so stupid, but she did and. And so, then like when I went to him, I told you, I told on him because I was worried because he was ordering those drugs to the office where my parents, for helping him and I do like working for him, like with him to help him because he needed a physician to see his patients once a week. yeah it was risky my parents Cole like livelihood and reputation of everything and his own but really it was my parents that I felt like I said I owe it to them to tell them, you know. And not I mean I look back on it now, and I feel it was just a huge fucking steak because they didn't even do anything like for. Like I don't even know they tried to confront them and my mom threw me under the bus because she didn't know how to confront her own child wants you to package of oxycontin in her hand she had intercepted. So. You still had to say she still had to say julie's worried about you know, even though I made her promise me that she wouldn't do that you know. She didn't know how to be like well uh we're worried about you know how."
726.0,Provider,You know what I mean yeah yeah.

And so it was just very, very upsetting it really messed me up with my mom I feel like she betrayed me. A couple times like not just that, but like when I worked for my brother attack this is. Why like what. If I knew about me absolutely Oh, she made me sign a sheet that like it was a 1099 when he was supposed to I was supposed to be like those of you to you know, like I had paid taxes familiar like thousands of dollars, you know.
