7817.0,Patient,I got that done.
191.0,Provider,"Thank you, thank you, so I know at one point in time you're thinking about moving, are you all stand pull it or were you in that process."
7817.0,Patient,"um well. let's see because the whole Florida thing kind of got put off for now, because the taxes on mom's house. were behind. So she was going to sell it real quick before she lost it and then she was able to make a payment arrangement to where she can pay on it, and still keep it so she's not leaving at the moment. So that's off the table again."
191.0,Provider,"how's that for a while, since I didn't. lose the House."
7817.0,Patient,"You know yeah she made a payment arrangement so where she can pay that monthly out because she got she was working. The same job for like 23 years and then got laid off when the sun took over the dad passed away so owner and then the sun took over, and he laid like more than half the company off and. Then she was off work for a year and a half and so she got behind and that's why I came back was to help her with the bills."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan."
7817.0,Patient,Oh.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so sounds like Am I understanding this correctly that. There is a plan worked out for her to pay the taxes on a house, so it sounds like will vote for you all working together so by you being there really you're helping your mom to keep her home and that way both of you have a place to live Is that a correct understanding."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah cuz to keep the kids in the same school district, I was talking to manny. The last time I had a individual. Because I was going to try and get on first shift another job and I went to the interview to the background the drug test, and you know did everything. And they wanted to call it Friday wanted me to start yesterday or Monday yeah Monday i'm on third so I have to remember what day so Monday. um it is technically my Tuesday, but they wanted me to start Monday and i'm like what did you get the background back yet Well, no, but we need to know today, so you know I reminded them, you know from. You know the petty theft and all you know charges ahead and she's like well we don't know for sure if it's you know, going to be a no go or not, until we get it, you know physically in our hands, so i'm like well I guess i've turned it down because I can't lose this job. To take that job and then find out when you do get it back that you can't keep me plus I would have been losing. I would, making 15 an hour now. And I would have been dropping down to 1150. And the only reason I was considering it was not only because it was first shift but it's in the. nursing field, I have, I graduated from nursing school I just never took my test."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so so all right, so you sounds like you're getting more confident in that area, so you may decide to go that way after things get a little bit more subtle and stable."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah I tried to but they they're not sure about my background and then kind of made me nervous, you know with them, not having it in their hands, give me a definite answer. Okay that's. The last thing I need right now is to not have a job."
191.0,Provider,"Right, so it sounds like. Will you be able to keep this group job, but you still think about the nursing piece."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah eventually want once I get more everything caught up here. yeah my mom's and. You know, get my back bills i've got like two two things left on my credit to pay off and because it's too i'm sure you know, but 200 for the test and then 75 and then I have to write the letter stating what happened and why I have a background and all that so i'm dreaming about that. But that's in my mind, but it's not there yet."
191.0,Provider,"So I keep here in one day at a time that's a thought keeps coming to my man you got. yeah water, so you have work you have shelter, you have food curious to save the keys in school, so the big things."
7817.0,Patient,Now.
191.0,Provider,"The main thing, the main thing, which is the main thing is being taken care of is that a good understanding. But then there sound like there's some really good opportunities that are developing and you still want to kind of flesh to kind of flesh that put some more flesh to that later on, as you move along."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah and that's another thing too is. I was I know not to get on the Internet and look up things, but I was reading about being in there's a difference from being a nurse already compared to going into the nursing field with you know the charges i've had plus being in the program and stuff they're more harsh. From what I read anyways they're more harsh if you're a nurse, and then you go into a program. As to being in a program and going in as an or some kind of I need to look more into that."
191.0,Provider,Okay.
7817.0,Patient,"To see how that works. Oh cars, you know getting the license and stuff."
191.0,Provider,"Right yeah I kind of see what you're saying, have you done your internship and all that stuff too."
7817.0,Patient,Because I think it's just stuff that's kind of went through my head a little bit.
191.0,Provider,Okay don't give up keep looking because there are people that there are some people that understand that you can go through that and you still valuable and can be trusted. Everybody knows like That was my first.
7817.0,Patient,"thing I wanted to do. And then, when I got pregnant with my son at 18. I was intimidated by all the biology and chemistry and all that. yeah so I ended up doing it, but."
191.0,Provider,yeah it can be intimidating I think that's why a lot of people don't go into the medical field but. So mainly it sounds like there are a lot of good options nursing is always a great option.
7817.0,Patient,"i'm hoping, so I just I may have to wait longer for the background to be after 10 years you know I mean, I may have to wait, but it's something i've kind of brought back into my. Vision I guess."
191.0,Provider,"yeah it's a good vision and then not only that, but you see how medicine is going and with the pandemic is something that's going to always be needed. So no I think it's a beautiful thing in it and, and not only that, but. that's job security. Madison is usually. A form or another form of job security don't give up yeah. So the reason why you have the gifts and the skills and why are you able to do the classes and pass them so yeah. I gotta get clearer as."
7817.0,Patient,"Well, hoping so."
191.0,Provider,yeah.
7817.0,Patient,"Because when I did my sta. I got attached to a few of the residents, because I was doing when I was in school. yeah and then they let me work, six months after. Because you're you're allowed to do that, until you get. Without having your SDN a license and then you have to get it, but by then I had graduated and I was overqualified so I can't backtrack. Okay, so I had to quit that job. But I absolutely loved it just working with patients and a residence there you know, helping them get dressed and it. was like gratifying."
191.0,Provider,"that's awesome. I believe so. Kenya hosted because I don't I just get the feeling from what you hear what you're saying and. You know, and you seem like when you talk about it there's a piece. don't give up keep looking okay you're not the only nurse that have used and turned your life around and been able to focus and will be able to find another job in the field, I believe that's a possibility, so don't give up on that okay. If I know keep man Emmanuel and I formed okay."
7817.0,Patient,So your urine drugs male.
191.0,Provider,"get your results done today positive for buprenorphine all less is negative, so that looks good okay. All right, good sign off on that one that feels good to any changes which are medications."
7817.0,Patient,"No, I was actually a brother, if I could get some more that stuff for constipation. arrived actually i'm backed up again."
191.0,Provider,"backed up, we got to get you taken care of. sending me now have you made any lifestyle changes for that, like increased your water intake increased your fiber have you done that. eating the fruits in the."
7817.0,Patient,"Water I have. i've been trying to do better. Now that the money is getting a little. it's not so. spread out because now ability to buy the better foods and not, as I by the kids their stuff first and I. cook dinner for what they like and. So, now that I don't spend everything on them. That and we just got an increase in food stamps, though."
191.0,Provider,"Oh good you get my Green leafy vegetables. Are you getting apples, are you getting some sale it's even if it's some lettuce you know you kind of see what i'm saying, where you're getting a variety beings. different things like that the beans are really good for helping with the cholesterol that side of five or. I know some of the things that we."
7817.0,Patient,there's a certain kind of been.
191.0,Provider,"Well, I I well, it depends, I have the tendency to be I love all kinds of beans I love green beans black beans red beans to kill me Lima beans. All kinds of beings in general, very helpful So if you want to kind of Google that and what I find is that they're really affordable, because I know when. we're being very mindful about how we spend our about a lot of brown rice and what about a lot of beads and they dry, so you don't have to worry about shelf life dry."
7817.0,Patient,cooker.
191.0,Provider,"You back you know so you've got your complex carbohydrate and found brown rice, to be more feeling has more fiber and I found beings have soluble fiber and. helps with your health and so a lot of times when you look at longevity longevity studies Mediterranean diet things like that. Then you see beings often be incorporated some olive oil and then being able to get some broccoli and hopefully we can get a small garden because that'll help say because food is so expensive now being able to grow, some of the food and. asher freezing and some things so. yeah so just really having to be economical now. But yeah so that's just one of the one way to keep increase your arm. increase your fiber soluble and both the other kind and saying about how you can get other other forms of five, but I know metamucil helps and I see a lot of people they put it in water and it keeps you from being so hungry it fills you up."
7817.0,Patient,"Ah, OK that's what I was trying to think what was my couldn't remember what you said."
191.0,Provider,"Like a metamucil that's over the counter and then a lot of people like what's the other one that a lot of people eat well I can I can let you know about I slipping my mind, right now, do you have a primary care provider that talks with you and works with you."
7817.0,Patient,"know they sent me another card, I called the care source and they said when they send the cards out, we always have one that's assigned to us like to start out. Okay, and. Of course, only the kids cards are here. i'm supposed to call this person. Get yourself checked out."
191.0,Provider,"You need the primary care provider, so you still need your preventive care like your arm PAPs and things like that lady have we reviewed your laps already."

191.0,Provider,"yeah get get yourself checked out so labs have been done yeah because you know amelia is as a lot of moms are kids don't ever miss their appointments, but a lot of times we're not getting our so. yeah so once you to put some of that spotlight on you get yourself checked out get your preventive care visit checked out get those irregular periods checked out. You know. Periods checked out may need maybe do for PAPs okay. So just do that yeah yeah so while you're going through what you're going through getting that taken care of and I know you're still young but we just still want to make certain we don't take your health for granted, so you're 34 years young and when was your last menstrual period."
7817.0,Patient,"it's been a few months. She is. Over. yeah I don't know, three, four months, maybe."

And like from pictures then till now it's like I steadily keep getting bigger, so I was looking through my books that I still have their I needed to dust off is I need my thyroid checked probably too."
191.0,Provider,"yeah you need a. piece of chicken and. I noticed some you have noticed, some people, they say what the buprenorphine and they do have a tendency to eat more sweets okay. And so you do want, and some people don't gain weight with anything they just don't but then you have to be careful with these medicines and how they affect the endocrine system your hormones Okay, so you don't want to be going too long without getting the period all right."

7817.0,Patient,that's a good sign.
191.0,Provider,Any anxiety or depression.
7817.0,Patient,No.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, one of the things I do want you to look at doing, I want you to try to walk walk at least 30 minutes. four to five times a week, you need so you need at least you need at least five times a week really need about 1500 and 50 hours a week Okay, even if you break it up. I even have hand weights, while work my upper body, and it makes me tired, so if I do 10 minutes a. Day i'll do at least 20 minutes walk into i'll keep my my heart rate sometimes that's the least I could do, but I try to get some type of aerobic fitness like today. Today I walk for 30 minutes so i'm a plan to do some lightweight even before I go to bed, because I noticed, as I got older. My arms against the flabbier and then I noticed my range of motion started decreasing and I don't know if you were there with manual and I had that talk, but. A lot of times as women when we hit our 40s and 50s i've had a lot of women have problems with the rotator cuffs because we use our legs, we never work out. Our arms and we constantly lift it and then, if you notice when I go grocery shopping most women say we put out of bags on us and we bring everything in and over time. we're like, why are my shoulders certain so what I started doing is conditioning my shoulders I do push ups. And do lightweights and I start low and go slow, so this is something I used to train my patient so. i'm sure i'm using the right technique and I go online and look at the professionals to confirm if it's the right technique, but definitely. taught what your provider, because if there was something I could have I should have told my younger self, and I would have listened. Is do not neglect your upper body strength, I even do weights for my risk and. Because, at one point time I thought I was gonna have to move the carpal tunnel surgery because of hand and wrist pain, because we're getting somewhere. All i've been doing is physical therapy for my arms and my shoulders and my pain is basically gone and like I couldn't I couldn't do this before it's still a little slow, for me, but at least, I have a full range of motion yeah and I have, and I remember. You know. My women go through that because we we use our arms and we overuse them when we're cleaning and doing overhead and cleaning old showers. And then you have women come in, like this, and I was one of those women so now i've changed my life in terms of how I do my shoulders, I actually focus on upper body strength that men usually focus on upper body strength Okay, they got a book that. I found a lot of us as women don't but think about what you're going to do, because there's going to be a you at 40 and 50 and your middle age life and latter life may actually be more productive in your younger years and that's great, but you want to be physically able to have it. In the body kiki but, like my mind, is trying to break down. You see, so your third. House and you will guess what I I started Medical School when I was about 30. And so I didn't really start medicine at the residency until I was about 40 and that's when my life took off, I had a whole. Life beforehand, but I was doing research. and travel and that was great. And so i'm kind of listening to you. It sounds like you and I may have some similar you may have do your factory work and your regular work. But the thing that you feel that your great creator has called you to do may not start to you about late 30s early 40s and guess what. You don't want to just as much when you fall out 52 now you don't want to just as much more when you 40 but just make certain your body is healthy enough to keep up with your mind okay."
7817.0,Patient,"You know my mom says, probably I probably put it on the back burner until like subconsciously like I was. More like mature enough to do it and want to do is what she keeps telling me she's like yeah you love it, I know you do, but you just weren't ready yet you weren't ready to put all that work and effort into that job and."
191.0,Provider,that's what.
7817.0,Patient,"She would never be able to do it. yeah she always says, well, you have to work, you know 12 hour days and holidays and weekends and she likes her nine to five that's what she likes."
191.0,Provider,A lot of nurses only do 312 hour shifts and they have a better life so.
7817.0,Patient,I was reading about that. There was a lot of I was reading like that for like people put the blogs and stuff on and. was reading what other people were talking about and their struggles and how they finally ended up where they were supposed to be and.
191.0,Provider,"yeah don't give up i'm telling you I always knew I was supposed to be a doctor, but I didn't start practicing really practicing medicine to my mid 30s and definitely took off in my 40s i've loved it, you know, and I mean I started Medical School like. 2929 30 and i've loved it and i've always done, science and and did a lot of research so everything was centered around some form of medicine, you know what I mean, so I just kept that alive. Now i'll settle so it's not too late i'm telling you when you get 40 and you get 50 you gonna be just as hungry to do it, but you got to make certain your body can't keep up with it."
7817.0,Patient,No.
191.0,Provider,"way, shape and your kids are going to be 10 years older so think about it, you may actually have more time to focus, because how does your youngest child now."
7817.0,Patient,nine.
191.0,Provider,We 90 you see. The change for you. yeah it'll be a different world and then you. Have grandkids later and you gotta bear to keep up with the grandkids so we got to stay physically fit.
7817.0,Patient,"Now that's that's scary because my my oldest is 16, then I got 11 and nine, so my six year old to be 26 that's crazy."
191.0,Provider,"It it'll come before you know it, but um it's it's not a mistake that you're thinking about these things and and you know. You know where we come from, I was always taught that gotta make way for your calling what you're supposed to do and I you just, but you have to keep it alive and keep. working at it can happen don't give up okay. it's a great journey so wonderful it's a wonderful service to give to somebody else okay. yeah. yeah."
7817.0,Patient,Okay well.
191.0,Provider,"This is a great way for me to end an appointment on a positive note, I like this, but you know if we had something we needed to work through that. Well, but I look forward to see. You tomorrow right."
