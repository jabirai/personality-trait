304.0,Provider,You know what I was.
11501.0,Patient,"you're breaking up really bad is it you. know you know what I did for a little bit I but I didn't get anything I think I just had a cold um but my my daughter, and a science fiction mix that strap it was just like Oh, but I didn't catch any of it, thank God, I think I was just run down from everything."
304.0,Provider,"yeah oh my bad that's the worst you're sick. Yes, and you know. still take care of them."
11501.0,Patient,"Yes, my babies are no heat wonder slick and it's just been so much going on with everything looks like daughter and oh my God. Ah, and you know. What you've been talking about in group this whole organization thing is so cool because I really putting it into you know into effect in my life because my daughter needs a two since my mom's passed she's not been doing good and. yeah she's just it's been very hard to had a lot of other other things too, but i'm just laying on her. And she likes Lisa she's like this neck on her room she comes home from school she goes in her room and she does not come out and she sleeps and it's like, so I think it's so scary okay she's on the left so because she you know she was. depressed for a while winners will have to totally helped. Like it's not 360 that my my mom passed. After that. And then, ever since then it's just like and I tell her I don't think it's working for anymore, but she's like no she want to go off at you so adamant about that. So they finally update a little bit and it's helped a little bit, but she like just she comes home she got in her room she stays in the room and. I tried to talk to her at their her psychiatrist about it he's like that's normal it's just a teenager I like Okay, the sleeping is that normal that is not cheesy should know there's no reason for me sleeping all the time, I mean."
304.0,Provider,she's in her sleeping not full time.
11501.0,Patient,"The whole nother whole time I mean she you know she goes and searches with her friends and she talked to her friends, you know she's but she's in her bed she's in her bed. and laying down. she's just you know and she's she's probably put on 60 pounds, since my mom yes. And that's really, really very concerning to me because you know she she used to be very you know she was. Not doing she she wasn't heading down the greatest path before either okay so some of the changes you've made are great but it's like she doesn't care how she looks anymore, you know I know what depression looks like I mean i've been dealing with it my whole life, and you know I know. I don't know what to do, i'm so. i'm so worried about hurting her feelings by saying something like you know, like my mom was so such my like my go to person for this kind of thing and I don't have her and i'm just really worried about."
304.0,Provider,"yeah but you know I heard you say that a lot of times that of course your mom was support to you, but like you're the mom. Yes, no. Like you're the boss."
11501.0,Patient,"right into it yeah and I think you're still just holding on to like a lot of that guilt and. Right levy that you can do it. every right to tell her. To come out of a room every race ever remember. Every day, you know. Even my son my son's pediatrician is just awesome and I will see to talk to her about he said, oh no, no, no, you know you know, like when my kids are you I take very good away you don't you don't feel that you don't do that you know so right. So that so what you were trying to get at is what you are. That book has been really helping me because me and her, I told her we're both going to work on it together but. You know scheduling our day when she comes home from school when I make dinner and one her down here with matt and that's what time with her brother. and falling below i'm eating dinner, and you know, one of them sets and one of them clears and that's their choice you know and so we've been trying to set that up and. He stayed good sticking to it to. And then really like yes and it's been huge I can to for. them to see sticking to it and then."
304.0,Provider,Knowing so that's.
11501.0,Patient,been huge.
304.0,Provider,"Even though you know the the mission statement Elizabeth like you guys could make like a family mission statement you know, or even. Better. Your family plan like okay on a weeknight like yep, this is what we do we get home from school, we have a snack we do homework, we do chores like whatever it is. And then you know I mean she wants to I know you talked about like she was maybe getting a little bit bullied on. Some of the social yeah yeah some limits on that, though. You know."
11501.0,Patient,"Yes, no right."
304.0,Provider,And you know what you're like all right. 30 minutes on desktop and then or you know the wi fi like just you could even just turn the wi fi off.
11501.0,Patient,"Yes, you can."
304.0,Provider,you give me your phone at you know 9pm or whatever time because she needs.
11501.0,Patient,You know what if he does.
304.0,Provider,yeah night if she's on her phone all night.
11501.0,Patient,"Right in you know she does stay up pretty late but she's really good about she is good about you know, like she's never had she's never had any. Like for amateurs put out or she just hasn't because I did it, and so I know it was a big shock to her, but that's exactly what I did you. Like you, I told her she's got a laptop you know she's got a laptop and she's got her phone so and literally like you know I put my son to bed, and then I go to bed. And I enjoy what you're doing you know, so I definitely I talked to her about it's about trust that once you once you know you don't trust me no it's not about that it's not about the you don't need to make decisions through you know i'm the mountain that's all there is to it isn't."
304.0,Provider,"it's like. it's my job to you know, like you, don't need me to do the little things that I do, for your brother, but it's my job to help make sure that you have enough sleep, so that you can function school and to help keep you safe and. that's why the laptop if. It comes in my room at you know, whatever time or the wi fi is going to get turned off that. Whatever time. And it because I need for it i'm the mom."
11501.0,Patient,And right that's my job.
304.0,Provider,You know.
11501.0,Patient,"Yet, because she really did kind of his first put up a little stint but now she's sharing her grades with from straight a's to like she's feeling American Government, I mean, like everything just. And then she told me, you know mom. I need to take care of my mental health, you know and. Like, yes, but there has to be balance, there has to be you know bail bail ins to your day you don't. You don't go you don't not do homework you something because you're digging here your mental health and it's not it's not you know she she's not. So that's what we did, I think that was huge because she doesn't really should know schedule either she went to school and then it was like a free for all you know so. it's just like i'm 15 there's nothing to do with it, I need help with this to you know organizing my time and and knowing when you know. For hours you know what I mean I I get into that I get it again, sometimes on my phone and I can get wrapped up or something and that's not good it's so bad, you know and just sitting in your back. it's so bad."
304.0,Provider,"yeah and some of some of this is teenager stuff, but I think it's also to like right we get sucked into. Your social media or watching things and we were adults who have fully formed brains."
11501.0,Patient,Right right.
304.0,Provider,"Brain is not even fully. developed and so she needs those boundaries so. yeah I will support you Elizabeth to feel like. Yes, okay. he's back on it and she's a teenager you know but. yeah it's Okay, for you to be the mom and protect her and like just help her learn how to use technology responsibly to right like you're. Getting such a good role model by you doing those things that."
11501.0,Patient,"And that's the big thing too, I think that my kids are for long time with my mom you know not not any way back towards my mom it was me she was enabling she wasn't me. It was it was just me not doing the things because I was so used to her doing them or whatever, for whatever reason, and now they're seeing doing up like in my stuff. Like for some reason Lisa i've always been like this with my kids I feel so bad when they're upset or when like you know my son does something and he's going to get a consequence for i'll feel so bad. And it's like I hate that about myself I hate that I can't let go of or put a distinction between the two like you know. They have to hurt, or else they're never going to learn, you know, and I, with my daughter, and partly because of some of the things that have happened, you know it's just still so hard for me Lisa when things happen when they get you know I don't want to punish them I don't eat, what do. I have to visit. Even for myself when when I don't have a consequence, or something i'm not going to stop doing it, you know or or whatever so. it's been hard for me to do this, but. It this read it really helps you with the guidelines anyway just. I gotta keep in the. beginning on the line."
304.0,Provider,"yeah So how do you respond if you tell your son, you know if you if you continue to do this you're going to have a consequence and then he does it, are you able to follow through with that consequence or. When he started creating your life better."
11501.0,Patient,"i'm getting. Better at it. But what I usually what I what i've been you know the Tories for is just repeating myself. and never happening it's never it never happens next if you do that, one more time i'm going to take your iPad for me. Please excuse with Max okay Jenny can give me right now just dealerships and like for like I don't know 10 chances like and it's ridiculous like i'll hear myself what am I doing i'm not teaching anything except moms."
304.0,Provider,Forward yeah. You need to take a break or was it like it is okay to like go into another room for a minute just you can be like like.
11501.0,Patient,Because right.
304.0,Provider,"Then you're like you know the stimuli like you're trying to think your. thoughts and you have. To constantly like one more time, one more time, you know."
11501.0,Patient,"Even yeah for myself to I just. Know i'll go into the room, or whatever lose myself you're doing something and then to max's right now with next he'll get out as I can, and those are playing games and they'll start yelling. Because he's getting mad he's only stupid games it's stupid roblox it's I hate robots he'll get into roadblocks. they'll steal his stuff or something he gets so upset. And he's yelling. And i'm telling you okay i'm gonna take that in so, then I go and get myself occupied with something else, and I hear him and i'm not going over there and doing anything about it either so. there's nothing to it. it's been like a free for all ever since everything happens if you don't my time Max is kind of still allowed to just be an assignment and that's the thing rose, which said. That there we go that's what I got to start with, we decided this time to the same you can do on your iPad, and I mean i'm in the room, and I make sure he knows Okay, if you know it's been hard for me to do. Something true to stick to what I said, but I did it and he was so upset with me because I took it from him, he was so upset the next day, he was fine he won the vanity, I mean it was Okay, it was."
304.0,Provider,"For you, I hear that yourself say that Elizabeth like he still loves you. You are a good mom like and also for him to Of course they think and it's nice to they think the world's gonna end if they don't. Yet, have a device for one day I mean I probably. feel the same way, but I think. You help them see their like our devices. Help us with work they help you, with your recovery like it's a tool, you know it's not just a toy it's tools so yeah."
11501.0,Patient,"yeah I know I know. I feel so much better, I will."
304.0,Provider,Do.
11501.0,Patient,"That I do and. actually told him to I said, you know after after Christmas is over what we're going to start to because we do family, we tried to family night every Saturday. Every Saturday family night after after dinner there's no electronics and we play games, you know, like I used to do with my parents, when I was younger, you know you play lava you know. or whatever so that's what we've been doing and it's been really good it's been great the kids they get along so well so it's been really good. And so I told them that after Christmas what we're going to start doing is we're going to keep our family night every week, but once a month. we're going to do no electronics for the whole day and that means MIA can be doing stuff in a room whatever she wants to do but there's not gonna be like. Because I want them to also on their own time tonight just you know my daughter is so creative she is such a phenomenal artist she I mean she draws so good Lisa blows me away and then she said her dad her games of first two but um I haven't seen her do any of this and she's like very. Like she. She actually is a tip to get a real tip to get because she. wrote her dad bought her that her 15th. birthday, and I was Okay, with it, as long as she wasn't doing it to nobody you know or herself."
304.0,Provider,And right right.
11501.0,Patient,"And if what she said she's good at it, but like you know that's kind of important or two and it's like all she does he or she's talking so I can. Do I can. yeah."
304.0,Provider,"Because you know it's in the technology to the impact on kids like yes, if there was this guy on snapchat but also just like did I get enough likes or if she's looking."
11501.0,Patient,At filters models that are not real people like that's not going out for self esteem.
304.0,Provider,So yeah I think you know see how that works limiting it and then maybe you can be like muscle if it's a warm enough day let's all go for a walk.
11501.0,Patient,Right yes.
304.0,Provider,Sir let's do a dance party just get moving get.
11501.0,Patient,"More activity, yes it's. Better you know, and I started doing, I know, when my son was born, I was. i've never been this heavy loose I ever in my life, I think I told you, before I was getting almost back into my. I was going to be a personal trainer and. myths that diagnosed with autism I just you know I went back into myself like I always do I stop to hear myself. And so I started doing that, again I started the program two weeks ago it's a. les mills they don't know if you remember, there was no but it's there kickboxing program and I started working out every morning and well every other morning I did three days a week last two weeks and i've already lost six pounds to and."
304.0,Provider,For me that's no because he.
11501.0,Patient,"Never like this is my weight is really weighing on me like i've never been this heavy before you know I put my hair in a ponytail and just being like around I don't and I that's bad for the cto like I hate that I saw I started, so you know. you're going to see yeah so they're seeing me do that too, and I think for my daughter. that's huge to because she's right now she's never been like this before, so I told her you know after Christmas to start doing stuff and effective after school, you know it's going to be called out. or whatever, but my I made my God my basement is like every workout equipment, you could ever want because I was really into that I mean that is what my life was I was a robot and stickers up you know so so I told her that's what she's going to start doing with you, too, and so. yeah, so I think this will really be done it's just really put some like short term goals and long term goals. And you know I told her to hopefully by next Christmas, you know all have a really good routine and get back in there, you know structure your own life and feel better you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah and for like. I think that's huge if she she. yeah. Big yeah get her back to doing her art or drawing yeah like whatever maybe. hobbies or. You know, an activity that she likes."
11501.0,Patient,"your son. To yes. he's very active I don't have to worry about that, but at the same time, but at the same time. So there's days, where he just wanted that the iPad and it's not good, you know what I mean it's like that he needs to he needs, he was he before Colbert started to he was in taekwondo I put them in a taekwondo the most expensive, so it was like $400 a month okay. yeah for autistic kids and this this place, I mean they were overpriced, but they were doing one on one with him, and it was helping with those aggression and. And just with his manners and stuff it was really helping but then cold it happens and. You know, money wise my mom was like listen we can't do that anymore and i'm like I understand it, because they were helping the day for I mean I totally understood. So not doing that anymore, and he really wants to he was really upset about not going back to that, so we are me and my dad my dad actually just found her to spare House does Friday so i'm gonna put him in that January. And you know yeah because. yeah because it happened in it got us out of everything like. That we were doing before you know. outside the House so yeah I gotta remember I gotta get this stuff all going again. And I think that once yesterday's that to with her brother and she was doing cheerleading to put that but you know I think I think it's important for your kids to have something like that, with the Community you don't I mean. I just think it's good for their time, then they don't get they don't get to leave all the time, you know. Right go."
304.0,Provider,back your daughter was doing chair like she has the team like that kind of. camaraderie. And that good influence like yeah.
11501.0,Patient,"So yeah. trying to get it to find something that I. do that again she can do something else you know she can do um, but I wanted to pick something that's and I told you that already to for next semester hundred pick something. That is no school related or it doesn't have any school related purpose related or something somewhere where you're going to. See but she's always had that problem with other kids too, though they she's never had that matter, even when children, children, like the girls were not that Nice, they just weren't. she's native American. she's half native American and Mexican and she's just got beautiful skin beautiful support so girls, I mean she you know. she's just always had that you know so, unfortunately, that didn't really help her. With that particular you know, I understand that So if you want to do like an art class or district, or something i'll be fine with that too, you know just something selected to the House. And you to you know get you to do something that is you know active or just outside of the House and that's important."
304.0,Provider,Exactly yeah and I was gonna say maybe they're having even like some winter break.
11501.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. You know she was she did tumbling forever oh my God she didn't tumbling forever see this to. actually see, I wonder if he's even thought about that, I mean she finally got her flip flop done style and she was doing like for flip flops in a row. You know, and they were going to put her on the flyers and children, but she think God cool and hip and I really wanted to, but I mean no I didn't tell her. Is. Why don't you go back to she's got about 33 classes, because of hold it at the tumbling place where she go to she always to you know one on one, and I mean I remember, there are three days a week, and she went every. it's like we tapped out of all of that so just trying to put that back in her life, I think that would be huge for her, but she loves tumbling."
304.0,Provider,She loved it so.
11501.0,Patient,You know I haven't even talked to her about that I didn't even think. About that that would probably be at the right and. wrong with your week and yeah so.
