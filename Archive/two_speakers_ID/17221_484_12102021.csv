484.0,Provider,oh dear okay.

484.0,Provider,I can't hear you anymore. Oh you're back i've seen a little bit of connection issue.
17221.0,Patient,"And you find that out, or we need Angelica we were on which way I."
484.0,Provider,got it.
17221.0,Patient,Oh we're not on our way.
484.0,Provider,"Maybe that's fine yeah. Okay, just take a minute, and then, once the connection is better."
17221.0,Patient,"Is it good. Okay, now we need her."
484.0,Provider,Wait so. an overdose last week.
17221.0,Patient,"yeah, so I think it was a guy like almost a week ago yeah."
484.0,Provider,So I talked to you Thursday and you had only taken like a quarter of a film and then a quarter of a film okay.
17221.0,Patient,"yeah, so now we took a half of it this morning, so now we have to take a half again tonight."
484.0,Provider,"Well, so the one thing is that so did you feel any withdrawal symptoms, when you took a half this morning."
17221.0,Patient,"I see I don't know because. The stuff that we have a, I guess, my friend mixed it all in a blender and it's hot spots in it so like it doesn't really get us that well kinda like it almost like it makes me feel like which was itself, the actual stuff does, but so I don't know that we're from the other stuff you know."
484.0,Provider,"Because, because what i'm saying is if you're you may need to kind of start from that lower quarter quarter dose again, because if you've got fentanyl and heroin in your city is there anything else is there, like methadone in it, you know."
17221.0,Patient,"I don't I just know it's three different kinds of heroin and it one of them was that stuff that's called. it's like called. Black go or something. yeah it's like a black tie, but instead of the main poppy plant that they use they use they base it off of Vietnam and it looks just like actual heroin but it's the tar, and this is new way that they're making it in Mexico, I guess. New way making fentanyl yeah. it's about it look like heroin because it's cheaper."
484.0,Provider,"got it Okay, so that must have been really scary i'm so sorry that happened. yeah what. Did someone have. Can."
17221.0,Patient,"yeah actually my girlfriend use the one that you gave it the ones that you gave us actually because we had them hang up on attacking my closet, just in case you don't think God, I put them up the."
484.0,Provider,"good for you, for putting them where someone could find them and good for you for telling people where they were, I mean that was the right thing to do. Thank goodness that was the case, I will obviously order you another. Another cat each of you. To the hospital."
17221.0,Patient,"know my dad took my blood pressure cuz he's got high blood pressure, he has a thing, and he kept taking it and stuff Well, this is the first time I ever told him about it me ever overdose and usually I just tried to keep it to us, you know. yeah I was so sick and like so called I came down here because I wanted them to keep you warm and it's crazy and then she was like well should I call 911 and was like no. And then Kelly look that up and she said it says the check your blood pressure, so they just kept checking my blood pressure."
484.0,Provider,"Well, the narcan obviously puts you into immediate withdraw."
17221.0,Patient,"Sure, you find it. I was really sick and she had to hit me with it twice because she's like panics and she doesn't ever do the breathing or the stone roses hit me with it twice and I was sick. In front of the heater usually it. will put me to sleep after a while."
484.0,Provider,"Okay, so. So we can, I think we kind of have to start. My concern is if you've got. A fentanyl if you're using pencil regularly it can. Last a little bit longer in the body, because it kind of stays in some cells in your body. You just make that transition might need to go a little slower so you've only so you. were doing the quarter quarters and then lost it and so. we're just using. The heroin up until today or yeah."
17221.0,Patient,"Like the stuff they got that on it. um well since I want to say, maybe, four days ago because. Because like I had been doing it that whole day, and it was perfectly fine and then all of a sudden, I didn't want, and I just like babe I felt like that was way too much, just like I gave you the same i've been there, I know, but it's not right right."
484.0,Provider,"And then, and then. Oh, goodness okay that's really scary. And so."
17221.0,Patient,again. When do we take them. yeah I think it was the day after. Day after that.
484.0,Provider,"You start again with the low dose. yeah oh Okay, so you did it that way okay i'm sorry I thought you did okay i'm so sorry I misunderstood, so you then restarted at the quarter quarter and now you're up to half. Yes, okay. So Sorry, I understand that Okay, so you. did exactly the right thing, so good for you man you restarted it over. And you did the quarter quarter and now you're up to half as it. yeah have twice per day today. yeah Okay, and so tomorrow you're going to be up to one twice per day. Yes, Okay, and so sorry and so now. How have you been feeling over the past three days since your research."
17221.0,Patient,"What I I don't know if it's a federal or what but I I feel like that's that doesn't keep as well, so. I don't think it's so I feel like it's, not even the suboxone it's making me feel shitty I feel like it's the actual stuff like because it's we don't usually we try not to do anything with betting on it. Right, the person that we get it from music that's all you know."
484.0,Provider,"Okay, and are you using so you know suboxone gets into your system. You know the the heroin or functional whatever you're using will have less effect, but the suboxone should be treating withdrawal symptoms, so what what kind of when you feel crappy what symptoms are you having."
17221.0,Patient,"i'm like runny nose. Like the tea. Like a key bones Oh, he burns too. thick and stuff but this could be a tool we found more than for use by where we sleep."
484.0,Provider,And I know it's hard to know yeah like all the same symptoms withdrawing.
17221.0,Patient,Too so it's exact same symptoms pretty much you guys.
484.0,Provider,"So you know, I think, as you get to the higher the higher doses I think you'll start to feel better because the suboxone will be treating those symptoms."
17221.0,Patient,"yeah I know my dad he did a 24 hour thing for his and he's completely off for me and he said, like the first two times, or three times, he didn't get he felt, really, really sick and then, I guess, he said something about spitting out something or something I don't know like. I supposed to swallow so slow so like oh."
484.0,Provider,We dissolve you can swap usual to just let it dissolve you can have to swallow your saliva otherwise it'll just.
17221.0,Patient,"Sorry, he said, every time you saw you get sick like feel shitty achy like cold sweats and all that, but he would just spit it out like I don't know he said he would let it dissolve and then I didn't really understand what he's saying. He said it, it made him feel great and everything so like he's on it he's smooth riding on it right now and."
484.0,Provider,"I am so glad I look forward to talking to him later, but i'm really glad he did well with that yeah once you get the dose up high enough, I expect that you're going to feel the same way. I think it is just it can be a little bumpy with and also fentanyl axle like the heroin kind of will wear off right away, it doesn't stick around, but the fentanyl can. be boring some cells in your body, a little bit longer. A little bit tricky here."
17221.0,Patient,Oh yeah oh.
484.0,Provider,"So, so are you still feeling good about continuing. I am so sorry that's really scary yeah yeah. Okay. So any shoes, are you."
17221.0,Patient,Are. You still are you. Sorry.
484.0,Provider,"What was that you put out here, we are you having any dire having any diarrhea or constipation."
17221.0,Patient,um no.
484.0,Provider,Can you hear me okay.
17221.0,Patient,yeah no.
484.0,Provider,Is it. When you take the suboxone is making you feel sleepy at all.
17221.0,Patient,"I don't know see i've been i've been feeling like that, like. seem to wake up, even if I do. mess. But I think it's really, really mode thing."
484.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, is that in this place where you live."
17221.0,Patient,"it's like a walk in closet thing and we have a bed in there and that's where we were sleeping and. I found the mold underneath underneath of our bed think because I guess I little pumpkin kicked into there, and there was a lot of Muslim it. went behind our clothes clothing up in the room, like most of a lot of our clothes, but in our my clothes hang like right over my bed, so it was like real."
484.0,Provider,kind of.

17221.0,Patient,"we're still on the on the two milligram ones, because it's the half half a milligram."
484.0,Provider,"yep so you're taking a half film right now, or half a half a film twice a day today."
17221.0,Patient,"Yes. So tonight later on in a little bit, I have to take a half."
484.0,Provider,"And then tomorrow you're going to do one film and one film. Yes, okay good um so and then you have enough to get up to the the eight milligram films."
