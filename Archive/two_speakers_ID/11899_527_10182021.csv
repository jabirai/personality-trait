And some she did say you know you're the first person, I just want you to know you first wasn't called beside hospice. You know. And so I was like Okay, and then the next day I. didn't I just text them and I just said, you know how I I introvert and I still feel when I morning, so I said, you know I don't need to talk, but i'm like if you guys need you know, to talk if you guys need to walk me through all the horrible stuff they've been kind of doing already.

Like why don't you focus on that and call me back and she never called me back she just yeah I need to eat now and then she's like Oh, I think i'll take a shower now so it's like we haven't any of us have talked on the phone yet. nobody's like ready for that. I called I power through to initiate it but nobody's bitten so we've just I guess kind of still been texting. and I. And then she just been like the. morning widow, where she's like cleaning and get on the subway right away that version. And so, like an hour later if you text me like oh i'm went in in cleaning and I found my old my old sewing machine and. it's 35 years old and you're the artistic ones so i'm going to send it to you i'm like Okay, but. Random. And then yeah yesterday I got in a panic because i've had friends that say like oh I knew this one person that within like two days like she had got rid of all his clothes and all of his first of all like that. And so I got like an appendix like Oh, I want you know I daddy's to be a professional soccer player. yeah and I like I want his jerseys and I want you know, I was one that really liked watching soccer with them."

You know that's what I was wondering too if they will actually like."
527.0,Provider,"hear you and what you want, as far as with."
11899.0,Patient,"With dads things they don't normally i'm hoping. That the scenario they will be a little more, you know. prone to I think it's drawing us closer because of. Like for mine I do feel like I felt to my mom. I don't know about my sister but i'm so i'm hoping, you know and i've tried to be as helpful and you know it's in my car my dad cards and I buy things they needed. So I hope that that was like Oh, she really does love us, and she is part of her family, like, I hope it did something for them to like you know that I am over here morning to and. And all that stuff so i'm hoping i'm hoping they they will you know I said I don't want match I don't want to things of value, but I just want sentimental thing for."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, and I think you're probably going to have to be just really clear and direct kareena like. not try to guess that they or that they can read your mind or that they're they know what you want, or that you, you hope that they get the message, or the hint you know, this is, you know you're going to have to really be firm and direct and say I want this this this. For you know for yourself and really stand firm in that for you, because."
11899.0,Patient,"yeah I think the you know I still want to be nice but yeah before it was like I you know didn't want to add more. Sure, is it to them, but yeah when it comes to the few things I did my sister did break down and say that. My will number one shirt that I wanted for my dad and soccer shirt that he was it was the last shirt he was wearing and they had to cut it off. So she was like I didn't want to tell you that positions like since you're pushing and I was like fine I mean like i'm not gonna feel bad about everything you know we wanted him to be comfortable and if you got to. The point to take the clothes off the top of the head and you have to cut it off him, you know. Sure, then that's fine like i'm not going to be offended it's not like you gave it to somebody else you know, but you get my own whatever but. The good thing is. That I tell you the story."
527.0,Provider,"No oh yeah well I. Think yours, but, but I think your dad had one, two, maybe. yeah okay."
11899.0,Patient,"One that he's been restoring but he was the master procrastinator and he. Never did and I thought it was. There for 20 years my mom think 35. Well, when he got it and i'm pretty sure he got it right, when I was moving out of the House so that would you know, obviously make me over 18. yeah he, like I think he's exaggerating i'm thinking, maybe for like 25 years but. Anyhow way too long for it not to be."
527.0,Provider,That shirt yeah exactly.
11899.0,Patient,"So, like I said, obviously. master procrastinator and so yeah so fortunately in conversation i've been thinking in my head like oh my gosh if he. If they got rid of that like she got rid of the ring was like that they like, so I agree, but in in conversation she's like oh yeah, we have to click clean up your Dev shop he always kept you know, it was a bit of a hoarder with all his tools and. stuff because he was a mechanic and. And stuff which is like it's gonna be nice to have that room and get rid of all that junk he would never let me get rid of, like the fear and I was like oh hallelujah and so that I took the chance of like oh good I want this vr. And she's like Oh, you want that piece of junk she's like all right she's like i'll send it to you, of course, she doesn't realize shipping the cars, like 1200. will see. If she like literally since 1200 dollars, I would be floored. I know I don't I don't want her to do that so trying to find different. find a mechanic to fix it. There, so that is grateful, or whatever."
527.0,Provider,So better by.
11899.0,Patient,"step, but the crazy thing was. So he died third Thursday morning I send them attacks, you know Thursday whenever I woke up and then like Thursday at about six o'clock I get an email from dmv saying your car title has been transferred like my mom like put that car and my name, like the day he died, it was kinda like. That. I was just like wow what kind of like energizer bunny issue like."
527.0,Provider,"You know yeah just kind of her way of trying to be in denial, maybe."
11899.0,Patient,"yeah I mean in one sense, it was like okay well now for sure if mine cuz she put it in my name. I don't think so it was like Oh, do you think that means you know, like maybe your sister was gonna fight you for it, and she was trying to give you the one thing you want it and i'm like no she doesn't need my strawberry drive like Why would you. Like I don't think it's that but I don't you know I didn't know her first it scared me because i'm like you're doing some like really big thing."
527.0,Provider,Like when I like some bizarre behavior for. For just grieving.
11899.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,it's you know to act in that way kind of erratic kareena.
11899.0,Patient,"not as bad not as bad. That they you know she's like moms on such a good like cleaning mode and winter is coming, and you know I. winter and snow and the hate that and, of course, and that makes me sad because that was part of my thing i'm getting my dad died quickly. But you know they had him in the basement which is dark and then they moved him up to the sunniest room and then, in my head i'm thinking you know falls are never long enough anywhere. Where it's gorgeous for very long time and, and you know, then it's going to get dark and gloomy and that's depressing, you know and so i'm happy that you know you didn't have to go depressing mode, but at that same rate i'm like. You know the love and the attentions gonna wear down and then we're going to hit and that's when my mom my sister going to be really depressed. You know. House no and now not having a man in the House to like. cloud the snow and all that stuff in the neighbor has been cutting. The grass. Since my dad got sick, so I would hope they would help with like plowing the snow, but you know they have to get out of there they're in this huge house on an acre and. So, but again, they say, not to do anything drastic, for the first year so i'm like you don't. Have it and everything and. So hopefully they'll stay in there for the next year, but they have a second house and misery that's well and would be perfect for them. They need to I think after a year ago that rope but I don't know that's my thought my back ahead Mike you know, is it going to be like a month later, oh yeah we sold this House and we like don't do anything crazy like I don't know crazy they're being. And you can only get so much through text."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah that's what I was gonna say mm hmm."
11899.0,Patient,"You know and i'm gonna try that okay i'm gonna try again to. call the call them today and see if somebody will actually like have a phone conversation with me. And if they're ready ready for that. And to go to go from there, so yeah it's just it's."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, are you considering a trip to go visit for a few days, just to kind of check in with them."
11899.0,Patient,"um that's funny that people have mentioned that and I. kind of always find it funny because i'm like my dad was the one that I really loved. Like to go see him. having to go and be there without him being there and seeing the two people that I don't really I love, but I don't really like."
527.0,Provider,Just being.
11899.0,Patient,"Like crazy to me, let alone the reason why I couldn't go see him was because my mom's health issues, so to go out there and not be able to go into the House and see if my mom and my sister says the door, just like I would my dad. Why bother. You know so. it's all the the health issues, mental health issues with all the phobias so bad i'm like it's the same if I was going to get on a plane, I wanted to get on a plane to see my dad and I make him happy that he saw me."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I just didn't know if it would be something that you would need for just some closure just to maybe go get his things yourself, or you know."
11899.0,Patient,"nope I think could make it harder and make it harder for sure. So, and then I did find out yesterday, my last text with my mom I said, have you told his siblings I don't know he told them that you know, he was thick I know we told her die, and she said Oh, we lost contact with all the many years ago. So I was like wow they really are exam remember me and you talked last time how you know in their head, they were the type of when they left with they left their house of you know. As an adult their families that they've that they were like very distant and they didn't stay in touch with their families much past that. So, since i'm the one that moved away and my sister has stayed with them their whole lives that i'm kind of like the outcast and that's how they always treated their family and I had mentioned how you know I don't really remember him talking to his siblings he would. Like every couple months for a little bit and so now i'm like wow now I realizing that they've just cut all sorts of you know, and that they wouldn't even figure out how to contact them and that's just like kind of shocking. Like I said he had a lot of siblings. For him to not even have been close enough to one of them to keep in touch is really bizarre to me. So I was like okay."
527.0,Provider,dude do we know if if some if if any of them are still living or.
11899.0,Patient,They should be. You know at least all my life I have tons of cousins and stuff so I.
527.0,Provider,mean.
11899.0,Patient,"They all be alive, but."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"He was older kids I mean he was always before, so I would think ELISE."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, would be mm hmm."
11899.0,Patient,But I don't know.
527.0,Provider,I mean is that something that you feel like you want to reach out to the family and just. Let them know and.
11899.0,Patient,thought about maybe his sister because they have moved to Canada.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11899.0,Patient,I remember being my sister going to visit them and getting to like know my cousins when I was like 16. So I have no idea they're still in Canada. But the problem. Is I don't know her married name I don't remember it. So her first name and that's one of the few siblings names actually.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I thought."
11899.0,Patient,"Maybe you know, because obviously the rest of boys, you know girls are more like she might, you know as a girl wants to know her brother died, you know. So. yeah I don't know. Oh yeah I put it a little bit, I think I think a little bit more on that and they then. Ensure pursue her. And maybe I can fly Lee asked what her last name was or maybe I just can be bold and be like you know what I want to talk to a sister so what's. Sure yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah exactly yeah again I think you're just going to have to be forward, you know and you're doing it in a respectful way to Korea I know you're not being malicious about it, like giving her name or else. But you know you have to you have to figure out what what all you need for your grieving process to and your healing process, and if you need to reach out to some of dad's siblings and. And you know talk to them or let them know what's going on, like that's I mean you have the right to be able to do that for yourself."
11899.0,Patient,"yeah exactly that's where i'm at is like Okay, you know I tried to not put too much on their plate not being asked you know, even though they weren't giving me a lot of information moment."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"So now, so now, you know I need to be more direct as in what I need."
527.0,Provider,You know.
11899.0,Patient,"And what I want and again none of its being greedy cuz i'm not asking for something valuable you know. um but if I want something specific, so I even told my sister I said, you know I want his favorite Thai and hanky and i'm like you know what if I ever get married I want my husband were that. yeah oh ask mom which was your favorite Thai or whatever. And she's like oh okay that's kind of interesting and I was like I don't know it's like to be and, like I opened the door, you should probably do the same thing, but I said yeah I said i've had so many friends. Do really cool things and i've always kept them in mind, I said, my best friend in town that her dad died, two months ago she her mom had died, years ago, so now she has no parents, which. So that but she was very close to her mom and she had kept all her clothes and when her dad died and moved her to take all that clothes that she had kept and she. made quotes for her and all of her siblings that are from others close."
527.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11899.0,Patient,"I thought oh my gosh and she that that was always her original thing but it had been like 10 years since her mom died, and she just never, but when her dad died and moved her like I need to get those. done so, I said oh that's so cool and that just puts all these ideas."
527.0,Provider,"You know, in my."
11899.0,Patient,"head, but you know i'm like a lot of times i've heard a lot of people oh I got rid of all this stuff and then I regretted like I wish I have you know. So much sleeping or whatever the cases so. yeah reminded her you know not to let mom be irrational and. Everything that."
527.0,Provider,You might want.
11899.0,Patient,"Later I know someone else said pack it all up second in the garage they don't see it. And then you want. That opportunity to go back and do something out if you. share one and then after at least six months or something so I think that's kind of a good. good way to do it, but yeah. Like so we all grieve differently and I had cried a lot. When. hospice came and they're like yeah it's time and. You know I knew that he heard my recording and my goodbyes and stuff and. And then, when my sister will shouldn't wake me up because I don't I sleep I go to bed really late and I haven't been sleeping but my sister called me when they're good morning and told me he died, and I was like in shock for like an hour and a half, and I just."
527.0,Provider,Say okay.
11899.0,Patient,"You know, and that and just was like in disbelief, even though I knew it was coming I found that interesting and then oddly didn't cry or anything rolled over and slept like a baby for eight hours. I was like I had not been sleeping I would take sleeping pills, I would take praise enough."
527.0,Provider,Yannick yeah. Well it's been through the rough.
11899.0,Patient,"And I was like that piece it's not separate and I just slept and then, when I was day I was like oh my God I can't believe, like I slept so well I haven't slept that will in years. But then I felt guilty because i'm thinking there two hours ahead they're waiting for hospice like they probably haven't even rested yet and they had to like this whole time i'm sleeping. they're dealing with the dead body and all the horrors of that, and so I feel guilty about that because i'm just like oh my gosh I slept and I literally did not cry to like four o'clock that day."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I wonder if it was your your body's response, though katrina's you needed. You needed energy later on to address you know your grief your you knew you your body needed to rest, so that it could grieve."
11899.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah it's interesting how our bodies. respond yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"don't haven't had like a big meltdown, but my friend, she came she lives like an hour and a half, and she came to see me and. She left right before I called you. She said when her father died she did not cry for a month. She was like I was all you know take charge matter of fact. That everything Dan people told me she's like what's coming across super cold and everything and then she said, like a month later, I was like driving somewhere and I hit me and she's like her husband was like you're like in hysterics and she's like yeah just. Like she stayed in the car for like an hour is currently for a. whole month so she's like you never know, and I was like well, I have to two weeks off of work, I hope I have at least a. Partial little belt down before because i'm like I don't want to get to work and then so it's like sorry about your dad and then i'm like."
527.0,Provider,In his yeah yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"Like ah, but yeah so I prayed some, but I just haven't had like i'm a big crier like I will watch some movies, just to cry and."
527.0,Provider,purge and get.
11899.0,Patient,"it out, and so I just haven't been able to my one friend said that she pretty quickly started looking at like childhood pictures and stuff. And I just haven't wanted to do that, I think I feel like that's probably what's gonna make me cry so I guess, I should just pick a day, where i'm home but."
527.0,Provider,I think yeah.
11899.0,Patient,After the funeral but.
527.0,Provider,"sure you know, I think it I think you'll do it in your own time. I think you're aware of where you're at right now with it. My concern is if you're just stuffing it away and not you know not allowing yourself to do any of the grief process. You know."
11899.0,Patient,"I know, and then the hard thing of to having to you know, trying to tie me like that I have to within two weeks so it's like if we prefer. Well, but then. yeah so I don't know we have like that, where."
527.0,Provider,Should I.
11899.0,Patient,"Say don't rush the funeral. You know everything at least the trend now is everyone does it on the zoom. You know, which has been Nice because i've been funerals with it's been like 700 people. You know wouldn't be able to fly and attend a funeral so it."
527.0,Provider,doesn't mean.
11899.0,Patient,"But I did say I hope you know that the turnout seems like people wait like a month, so that they can compose themselves and get everything done and I hope mom's planning on to that. she's leaning toward that so i'm like okay that's good That way we don't have to like rush all of that."
527.0,Provider,And I know.
11899.0,Patient,"My friends, her husband was in a coma. For like two years, and he finally died and then someone was like oh you do it now and rushed her. She had it like three days later. shoot them had, and I was like Why would you listen to them and so she wasn't able to do all the things that you want to do, which is two years, knowing he was gonna go I would have had it all planned out but that's just me. So i'm like you know, so I don't again you don't want to look back and like Oh, I wish I didn't get rid of that item or I wish. I felt like I don't want them to be so. You know, rational about things that. The credit yeah. And I don't know how you know, to convey that and i'm trying to. make up I don't want to you know overstep things and and all that good stuff but yeah it's a lot, I like that it's."
527.0,Provider,it's yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"You know I had my friend drive an hour and a half to see me today, I had a friend pop in yesterday i've had. rises talking to you for different text messages so it's been nice but, at times, I feel overwhelmed at all the attention. yeah it's like Okay, can we can we spread it out. Just like hey I already talked to people today and I can't tell the story good."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"You know I think i'm at that point where I don't want to say it again. So I think. we'll ever hears from now on out i'm just going to be like yeah he died of liver failure and. And it went quick, I think it is, but I don't."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"I don't need to tell the stories of his last words to my mom and you know, like like I feel like I I I i'm not one who wants to tell something over and over. I have some friends that i've heard those stories like three times i'm like Okay, we know that one."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. And I think, and I think again, you just being honest with your friends and and where you're at with that, like. I just need a break, today I can't share this anymore. And and and also you know just being honest where you're at with with phone calls, you know and and recognizing you know if you're not responding in the in the day, you know, maybe the next day saying. You know I I got your message I just wanted to acknowledge that, and you know and and we'll we'll talk soon i'm just not in a space, right now, or today but. Thanks for checking. You know at least. Thanks for checking in you know at least acknowledge for yourself to."
11899.0,Patient,"Exactly well, like the day he died on Thursday I was like. I didn't want to talk about it, I don't want to tell anybody. I try to. Keep it like my little time. And i've read that too, they said, even when someone. And I was just getting ready to tell it to my mom my sister, but then he died so I said I didn't but, even when someone dies, some people go. In action mode and like two minutes later or calling relatives and call it, you know and they're like you should take at least half an hour quietly with them to have that moment to observe before you start like the whole chain. And so, for me it was like I. took all of Thursday, like I didn't at the very end, I did tell my friend that used to be my old roommate my childhood friend she lives in Oklahoma and her dad died 10 days before mine 96. person in a close circle of friends have lost their dad in three months."
527.0,Provider,Oh wow. that's.
11899.0,Patient,"Using our dads this year, and so I thought and so she usually goes but around nine so. Seven a month, I was like you know what I feel like she's the person I need to tell first and and i'm okay telling her. I called and talk to her briefly and told her and felt really good about that, and then I was like okay tomorrow's you know, a new day and then by the time I woke. Up writing the word had got out, and I was just like it was 10 text messages, there was this call, and then I just woke up super overwhelmed on Friday."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11899.0,Patient,This is what you know by sheree levine but it's a lot.
527.0,Provider,It oh yeah yeah.
11899.0,Patient,"And so I you know I I had that moment, which was nice, but I did go the day. Though Wednesday when I knew hospital, I mean I went to. Some friends house and her daughter was my roommate. Her wedding they're like my second parents I lived with them for a year. So I thought okay there's someone who really knows me in a very compassionate and so I spent Wednesday with them, and I was kind of hoping that you know because have to set any moment that i'd kind of be with them when he died. Okay, oh in the wee hours of the morning, but it was you know pretty close and so. It was just Nice, and I was able to tell them all the details because. They know me well, and they know I don't like to like talk so they're like Okay, you know, whenever whatever you want to tell us you tell us we know your dad's really sick and. I filled in all the details and I actually told them all the horrible things I told them my dad's passwords to my mom I told him everything that he was going to die any moment. And I said, the whole thing without crying and both my friend and her husband really crying and she's like happy tell me all this without preparing. And she's like you know honestly i've known you for 20 years and 25 years 25 years and she's like I know you're emotional and I know you cry all the time, but I don't think I like seeing you cry that many occasions. And I said yeah you know the weird thing is, I told one of my friends told me that two years ago when her husband committed suicide, and I was with her and she's bawling and I will comfort her and. I know she's like you're so empathetic or so sympathetic she's like I know you're such an emotional person that. she's like. How are you not crying right now, you know, and I said I cried all the way here and I. I was wondering what your thoughts are on that and I thought you know what your I am definitely if there is a crisis. I will take charge take care of everything, I will be composed, I will make everyone feel better, even though i'm dying inside and. break down when i'm alone, so why do I do that but what's your thoughts on why in front of people I can't be vulnerable or i'm too busy take care of them that I can't have my meltdown but. let's."
527.0,Provider,"Take it. Well, I think it's a protective factor for you Korean I think it's a coping mechanism that that keeps your emotions safe because. it's I mean that's been the biggest challenge is trying to let yourself be vulnerable I think there's a lot of hurt there that's not been. resolved and so it's like i'm just going to keep it inside and then it's protected and then, when I feel it i'm in my safe environment, then I can let myself be vulnerable to those feelings."
11899.0,Patient,"That was healthy is that something I have to get to where i'm like okay just. My thing is once I started crying I can cry for hours. But I think in my head. Okay, if I start crying with my friend, whose husband just killed himself, I am going to be like non stop crying like I will get worked here so just. Constantly you know my little compose. And then i'm going to be a mess and then they're gonna have for me like I don't want to be that person so, is it, how it, you know there's something I really should figure out and change or is it healthy in this just different or like what's your thoughts."
527.0,Provider,"I think there's probably a healthy piece to that, but I think it but, as you described that like I need to I need to hold it together like. that's kind of been your role for yourself like that's I mean that's what your friends expect that's what you've kind of made them expect from you at this point. And so to have that guard come down and really be real with them is very vulnerable and probably feels really out of control, like you need to be in charge, and in control."
11899.0,Patient,"So it's the giving up my control as. That, then the other thing too is like you know my friend, like that drove an hour and a half to come out and see me and and and I was like hey Can you see me like after my therapy appointment they really needed I don't want to miss it. Now I have to do something else, and then. I was like. I told her I said Oh well, I probably wouldn't be good after therapy because i'm probably going to be falling through the whole time that i'm talking to her, but here I am talking to you just as composers i'm talking to my friends. So I really thought okay. When I click on with Andrea i'm going to when I talk i'm gonna be a meltdown, but yet I don't feel like rain and I feel completely so i'm like I was this is so weird because I thought for her with you, I wouldn't be crying. But yeah tell you all that and not even get emotional. So now i'm starting to wonder about myself. Now I don't know."
527.0,Provider,Like what as far as what are you wondering and kareena.
11899.0,Patient,"late because my my my friend who brought this up the other day when they were Gray said, you know not that i'm at all saying you're cold like your mother. But she's like maybe your mother isn't as cold, as you thought she was because maybe you get a little bit of that. guard up natural your emotions in front of people like your mother did so, you know your keep saying she's always issues, I was a cold person. And all that stuff and even when I had like an hour conversation with her on the phone right down within the hospital game, the biopsy she just was saying, like Oh, you know i've accepted it. You know i'm going to miss him, but I still want him suffer so i'm fine i'm really concerned about your sister she's like I was in hysterics I don't think she's gonna make it, you know so she just came across like very matter of fact i'm very cool. And i'm like our whole lives like if I. You know your kids and we'd get hurt you like get up get up your she wasn't like oh come here, let me have you make a better know is my dad. And so my mom has always been known for being you know very cold. And sure, and so my friend was like you know not that you get like a quick hold it but, just like maybe your mom wasn't as cold, as you thought because maybe. You got that part of her personality, where you're cool and collected in front of people, and then you have your meltdown So how do we not know that when my mom's alone she's not having. And she's just. Lady call. putting up her friends so, then I kind of you know, maybe, maybe I am maybe I do have some of that, and in my mom we're going around people. And then, when i'm by myself i'm like an emotional."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. What bothers you the most about that kareena.
11899.0,Patient,"um well you know when you I was when we were I talked to my friends, we find out that we have personality traits are family we love it when we."
527.0,Provider,have to do.
11899.0,Patient,"But will we find out, we have one that's not so good that it's like and i've always been like my mom my sister very much alike and i've you know, been like my dad where the emotional we're going to cry we don't reserve we. get angry we get angry, but we don't you know, nobody would ever know you know everyone gets angry. And all that stuff so i've always had his endearing qualities and then to stop to think Oh, I have some big my mother's. It is kind of interesting and, especially, something that like I said we've kind of hold against her. My you know my friend, where did it perfectly she's like i'm not saying she's like. gotcha the most empathetic person, you know, like you've done so much for you know, a family anybody gets take your food, you know, like i'm on that. i'm not saying it all the coldest but she's like maybe the guard to not show those emotions in front of people so yeah so I was just something to think about I had stayed in like really bother me I was like okay it's it's a common. common ground with my mother and a sense and also maybe understand her a little more than maybe. she's not as cold, as we thought and maybe it's just some of it, you know, so I keep going back to my sister saying we've always said, you know my mom would die first and my mom dad my dad would I immediately because he was so attached to her. During all my dad was still alive I just said, but I really feel like it's good to go that way to like I don't think. I think mom's gonna curl up and die she's really attached to him and I was surprised because i'm like she so cold and i'm like i'm never gonna tell you about the conversation we have she's just like yeah whatever i'm concerned about your sister. So it made me think maybe she's seen the really emotional side of her, you know that none of us are seeing that none of us are getting so maybe you know, maybe. You know she will who knows, maybe that was my thought to like when she puts the fee on my name and they're doing stuff and I was like she just like. You know this is yours, this is yours cleaning everything and make it all the decisions with that she could then curl up and die like I don't know if that's. You know, in her. head like Okay, you know i'm going to work, the things amongst the kids and then. i'm going to check out like no. Other state of mind, because they don't want me in a lot so yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah which is, which is probably why your guard is up to like I you know, I wonder what it would be like kareena to even just say to your mom like how are you doing mom like."
11899.0,Patient,"I better all the time, but you never get the. You never get the vulnerability of how you're really doing my mom would just be like keeping busy just cleaning."
527.0,Provider,"there's maybe, and you know, and maybe you need to call her out on that because, maybe that would help you to call yourself to. Like i'm kind of looking at my own stuff here in the mirror with my mom and wondering if that might it might help you to to challenge that vulnerability for yourself too."
11899.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,You know that's it's that's not working for me today. Like what's what's really going on.
11899.0,Patient,"yeah and I think, too, I think, like you know, a month from now. We can have all those conversations more openly like that, I think, once the the attention starts to Italy and in one that really sets in once they've gotten all the whatever they're in a hurry to do done, then I think we could have those. At least in my head, I feel like. We can conversations better, it would be nice to like have the conversations like Okay, we already love you know, last one person or family, you know I didn't realize that you. Already called didn't. Have any touch with my dad siblings and all that and, like we can't let that like happened to us so let's take this and try to like be a little bit closer, for whatever times love for mom you know. So i'd like to be like take take this and make whatever time I will have better feel a little closer without like the rest of us not being close."
527.0,Provider,"But i'm also wondering kareena if it might be helpful for you to step in and go hold on we need, we need to slow down here like this is. Like we need, we need to stop and take a breath here like we're not in a hurry to go through things we don't need to you know box things up and get rid of things right now, like what you know what's being avoided right now to or distracted so that I don't have to feel the feelings."
11899.0,Patient,"To yeah and I need to say I kind of said that to my sister, but I don't know she's just protecting my mom and not relating messages and so yeah now I feel like I thought of that too i'm like this week, you know he just died Thursday it's just Monday. But i'm like this. Week i'm going to start you know, and she started sometimes are better messages and are lengthier messages or via email, so I noticed she started like emailing me and I will email me like when she's up at weird hours because she'll wake up at five per time which is 3 million times so. You know so she's like emailing me and how she's feeling closer to her sister her sister lives in Argentina and met her, she. says that she you know gets takes her. Her tea, with a craft and stuff in her bed and just like lays in bed in the morning, so today i'm starting the tradition, like my sister. Does just doing that, instead of having breakfast in the kitchen just stay in bed and have you know, and now the socially it's getting cold answer, just like I feel like my sister is like laying next to me and i'm getting really close."
527.0,Provider,To my sister.
11899.0,Patient,"And then the cat that's my sister's cat and it's usually. With my. my sister she said, the cats like now obsessively sleeping with my mom and."
527.0,Provider,my daughter just.
11899.0,Patient,"Give me her love, so I love it you. know, and I mean I know i'm sure he's the poor cats probably like I have two people that are hot mess and I don't know. Obviously wasn't 32 but i'm so happy because, obviously, you know she had my dad and now. yeah sleeping alone, but so I feel like she's opening up a little and she's sending me emails like you know I might just do an email saying like Okay, you know they say don't make any crazy decisions like. You know it's good that you're keeping yourself busy but don't don't just like get rid of everything don't pick up and move, so I think I might be able to like start saying things to her."
527.0,Provider,"And it might be helpful, just to acknowledge what you're seeing with her and and be able to maybe. As much as you probably hate to do it, maybe, be able to connect with her on you know I I can understand how you want to just keep yourself busy, and just task task task I can be that way too, and I, and I need us to really just slow down and. Be be with our feelings for ourselves and be in and talk and talk with one another, like how to process this as a family like."
11899.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"This is. Really uncomfortable you know and it's really uncomfortable like being able, just to acknowledge that, for both of you."
11899.0,Patient,"we've actually been opposite I haven't so. I can get out of my my pajamas didn't take a shower and didn't brush my teeth for like two days. So we're we're dealing with it very differently, well, they were you know my mom was going going going and seem to compose and then my sister said. You know she was going so she kind of forced me to go with her, you know, in a sense, like I going off her watch i'm sure my sister would just be embedded depressed like I was and then she's like and then I would often like ball for like an hour and then i'd go back to like. To our product. that's how my sister said she was going, and I was like well good for you guys, because only Ivan shower like I have verse 14 I haven't thought in my pajamas. Like deal with this very differently, so it is you know we are, we are dealing with it differently."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And that will probably happens between the three of you, but trying to find what you need in this too, and what you need for mom like. what's you know where's the connections that we do have and just you know experience some vulnerability with that for yourself."
11899.0,Patient,"yeah exactly our next appointment, I am working so I have to."
