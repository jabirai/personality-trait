226.0,Provider,Here lunch yeah.
11007.0,Patient,yeah is that Nice it's more my age group.
226.0,Provider,"Airlines really nice carolyn's always been nice and purely and it will continue to grow, they will continue to develop around there they're going to fill My guess is they're going to build more high rise apartments condos and there's a ton of Nice restaurants ran pure land, you know. You can never go wrong with Ireland for me it's it's a little bit too if there's too much congestion, for me, like I I don't live far from carolyn but I I I live in a in a quieter a few rural area and, but there are little pockets around carolyn that aren't as, as you know, busy."
11007.0,Patient,What do you live north of carolyn and that.
226.0,Provider,"towards so no I live, so I live in an area called McCormick ranch so McCormick ranch. you'd hit McCormick ranch first and then you so if you're on scottsdale road and. going up towards carolyn going north. McCormick ranch is first and then, as you drive North you'll hit carolyn so i'm probably 10 minutes from carolyn."
11007.0,Patient,It was that.
226.0,Provider,"You know if that yeah so um but yeah it's scottsdale is a really great place got still is there's. You know it's clean there's nice restaurants, people are nice."
11007.0,Patient,"yeah I don't like. This was a friend of mine, and she wanted, she said, if you ever move, you should move down to the old town, I said that's too young for me that's like you know. And pb Pacific beach where you have a lot of bars, a lot of T shirts shops lot of young everything really hammered all the time."
226.0,Provider,"Right exactly. yeah i'll towns old town you stole town used to be just like super super sleepy like I mean nothing happened in old town and then. You know they came in and they they built some nice condos and they really turned it around and put in some nice restaurants, bars, obviously, and then there's some nightclubs and so that does attract a lot of millennials. Now, living in that area."
11007.0,Patient,yeah I can pass on that. yeah well there's a huge mall said I can't tell me last time I went to mall i'm allergic to polyester it seems I can't stand the smell. yeah I just don't go to malls.
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's that's. that's a popular mall that always has been like it's been there for a long time. It was kind of it was much smaller 20 plus years ago and they just really expanded it and it's kind of gone through a little bit of a transition with coven and we have riots here. We had some of those. antica blm riots going on. Last summer, and they just completely like. decimated macy's and so macy's has it's taken some time for macy's to kind of come back was kind of like a little bit ghetto and. yeah like it just was weird like I was there I was there about a month or so ago, and I was in nordstrom and i'm like what is this like. It very different crowd so I don't know if it was just people coming in town and just kind of leaving, but it was it was very, very different and so and i'm hearing that from a lot of the other locals that have been there they're just like yeah so now it's carolyn you know, like. I went up towards carolyn I don't go towards that mom now when I need something."
11007.0,Patient,"yeah I. Know interest in there, I know you're talking about the ghetto, because where I live in walnut creek. it's extremely white bread. yeah pretty wealthy. yeah and then on weekends now you get a crowd that's."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11007.0,Patient,Were cold Canadians.
226.0,Provider,yeah it's super strange like we're getting. middle easterners I mean there's nothing i'm not being racist or prejudice.
11007.0,Patient,Oh no.
226.0,Provider,"You know, it was just it was just a different makeup of people that was just very interesting to me. Because scottsdale does tend to be very white."
11007.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Very like very, very white. So yeah. I just kind of. I kind of wonder if it's you know, like changing a little."
11007.0,Patient,"Well, I know in walnut creek I get there is some surrounding areas a little further out like called antioch Richmond third. You know that area. Well population, there is a bit darker."
226.0,Provider,Right.
11007.0,Patient,"And so they come into walnut creek because that's where all the Nice shops are. All the white girls. it's just a shit show. I don't know I don't go out at. night I got. You know, during the week because I go to the same place, I used to but. yeah but on the weekends, no I stay away from it. As well too bad thing, we had to we had two shootings this year."
226.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11007.0,Patient,directions here.
226.0,Provider,yeah and I think people were you know they were doing those stimulus checks and those unemployment checks and. You know I think people were just kind of. yeah they're getting paid a lot money.
11007.0,Patient,"The whole purpose, you know sure the stimulus check that's one thing, but. just wanted to just bank that for that rainy day that's going to happen, you know. and not in the restaurants, are not opening because people are lazy of shit they don't want to work."
226.0,Provider,"Well, you know the interesting part I mean i'm kind of. curious like what's going to happen with evictions here because Arizona. Like they don't mess around like if you're California it's I think harder to evict. Somebody right it's harder here it's not hard. And so, if you're not paying your rent if if you're just a little bit on the shady and stuff you know just it's not working, that you're out. Through and, yes, and the other thing here is like, if you have an eviction on your record, you cannot Brent another apartment."
11007.0,Patient,well.
226.0,Provider,So what happens is this my my concern is like these people that can't pay their rent and they get evicted they're not gonna be able to run another place like it's it's not a good scene like like this scenario is not good.
11007.0,Patient,Like typical almost Sir.
226.0,Provider,"i'm. Not like you do in California, but my concern is that it's going to really be an uptick in homelessness majority of the homeless, are in downtown phoenix so they have these encampments and then. The police come and they you know they tell them got to take your encampments down, but they will fill up an empty lot very fast, and you know that becomes a health hazard. And you know and then or they'll go on the sidewalks so again, you know, like what what's your plan here like my concern is this like you're gonna have a lot of people that can't pay their rent and."
11007.0,Patient,"You know what i've always thought would be a good solution, remember that, like the Japanese internment camps. Very well. constructed is city, it was grid like so you had like city blocks. yep Nevada has a lot of dirt."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11007.0,Patient,"You know, set up a big internment camp out there, and you know you get to make a couple of dollars by you know, maybe it's picking up garbage or cleaning the streets or whatever it is, you know just your own little city."
226.0,Provider,"There they're going to have to do something I think they're going to have to do something that is that represents that that's very similar to that because. You know, we obviously have a housing shortage here, so you cannot get you know in Arizona they you know mental mental illness is at the top of the list, like if you're if you're needing housing then you're going to go to the top of the list, which is great because they offer that for."
11007.0,Patient,For people that really.
226.0,Provider,"need that and that that's even getting harder and harder for people that really need that housing, so you know it goes back to we have housing shortage and so you know doing something like that is not a bad idea, you know because. You know what are you gonna do like they're going to get yourself in a situation you don't want to get yourself in a situation like downtown la. know where like. work. Oh, I have to have a plan. place."
11007.0,Patient,"Well, I think my little plan is it's good, because you get up whether it's outhouses or building fields. That sort of thing um. You know, running water that's something that you have to deal with me. draw out of Lake tahoe or pyramids lake up there. You could you could you could arrange for that easily enough. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"You know right, and I know I agree and i'm i'm kind of sad it hasn't been done sooner, to be really honest with you."
11007.0,Patient,Like.
226.0,Provider,"I mean it's just rough to be on the streets, I mean it's just really rough. You know there's some people that want to be on the streets, you know they think they're I do believe that i've worked with homeless and. You know they don't like the responsibility of rent or you know cleaning, you know there's there certain guidelines and stuff like that that they have fallen they don't like that, so you do have that percentage that just want to be out and just kind of wandering. But then, you also have that percentage of people that do not want to be on the streets so."
11007.0,Patient,yeah that's all tricky.
226.0,Provider,"And so, how do you like those a meetings through mail."
11007.0,Patient,"I really do actually. it's a very different level of conversation than we have with Dr pachter. yeah um. How I put this without sounding like a real Dick um the people to amy's here they most of them live in scottsdale. Deliver you know Mayo things. Those are people I could actually see having a Barbecue with. Yes, we're in our group there's really no one there. Except for except for you you're the normal ones. I like Dr pat Tara and I would get along that well and if we're you know in open city situations his personality is not. I can't figure him out. But. it's not my rodeo."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and I think that i'm you know. i'm you know, in the group to talk to factor, you know we have you know there's all walks of life, if you will, right there's all stages of addiction there's all different types of addiction that are in the group. And so. You know your situation is a little bit different you know, like i've like i've said in the past, you know you're not drinking you've been sober and you know. there's no cravings really you know so that I get it like you're in and we talked about this, you know when he first came I was like you know let's. Is this going to work like is this going to work for you any you know and your grade and groups like you know, like you're you participate and you always say things that are really great and inspiring and honest and you know that's that's your contribution, if you will. You know, because really it's about sometimes it's not about relating to people and their circumstances, but what you share and what you give. And so you're you know you're you're great with that so that's you're getting you're getting more than you think that you're getting not not that you say you're not getting anything. But I you know I like that I get the day meetings are probably a little bit more your. job you know, like that's a little bit more in line it's more relatable is what i'm saying."
11007.0,Patient,"yeah it's probably a term for more relatable because i've never played to say outside of. weed is not my gig I had. You know, used to. smoke a little bit way back when when I was like in my 30s but that's never been my thing cocaine was for a little bit. But that's again that was back in. The 80s. Right and now let's just you know that's something I just cut one day I woke up and said there's nothing positive that comes out of this. let's quit that day and never looked back. i've been offered I told, I think, maybe a year and a half goes offered some and I took maybe a half an inch just, I just wanted to see was likes I hadn't taken in like 20 years and I have that half inch at times that that's why I don't take it. yeah it was it I didn't like it at all, it just the taste of it just it just was horrible I just didn't he offered you know that night to say let's party let's have some more is it you know what I needed that one little one just to confirm that how much I."
226.0,Provider,don't.
11007.0,Patient,"know I it's more for you, I don't want any part of this no."
226.0,Provider,Thank you for that reminder.
11007.0,Patient,yeah right.
226.0,Provider,I do not do this.
11007.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,So funny.
11007.0,Patient,Have you ever been a partier.
226.0,Provider,"No was never my deal, you know and it's just kind of interesting I got into this field and actually like addiction is really more of my. specialty if you will. And I think it was really just because fan of family family addiction and just you know it was just kind of fascinating like why one person in a family is. You know struggles, you know why how it skips generations, like a home environment, you know how that creates mental health issues, how that creates depression, anxiety. You know just kind of like how mentally you know how the mind works, and so I think that was why I was drawn to it earlier was just because of drug addiction and alcoholism that ran in my family generations. So."
11007.0,Patient,Like i'm i'm sure my parents didn't drink. yeah.
226.0,Provider,My parents didn't drink either it's really weird like I didn't grow up with parents like I didn't grow up with it.
11007.0,Patient,"They might have one highball at new year's Eve or glass of champagne at new year's Eve, that was it. yeah and other than that there was never any alcohol in the House wow. yeah. yeah."
226.0,Provider,You know and it's just like it's interesting how alcohol can really become a lifestyle yeah you know it's.
11007.0,Patient,"A big time, especially insurance i'm in the insurance industry. yep oh my gosh back in the. Public late 70s early 80s 80s and you know you have these older guys that were you know five Martini lunches."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Oh, and you see the skewers lined up as their little."
11007.0,Patient,You know medals of honor.

11007.0,Patient,1130 and you're into your fifth one right now.
226.0,Provider,"Oh yeah you know that and even here in Arizona like Arizona has always been a big drinking town. it's not not as much as it was you know, in the 80s and the 90s, I mean it was at same thing you know you'd see people sitting at home, you still do like. opening a bar, you know. And in the morning lemon in the morning. yeah not a common. not uncommon at all."
11007.0,Patient,"Costs talking to a couple of friends or not friends, but acquaintances i've met from a restaurant bar and they now live in Florida. And the wife was saying, you should go to Florida you'd love accent like the sale and obviously floor is big in the sailing and motoring but uh. She goes why you've lost lot of weight you look great said yeah like you know I don't drink she has oh you're not gonna like Florida. Like fish. I go I can be around people that drink and doesn't bother me at all. yeah you know."
226.0,Provider,"it's just it's interesting you know Florida California Arizona Texas, you know all those areas where their central. there's water in there sunshine and."
11007.0,Patient,yeah you're sitting by the sea man plod with a beverage.

11007.0,Patient,"yeah that's one of the guys on a Saturday you're going to milwaukee I hope you like the smell of beer it's all over the city. yeah not a beer guy never happened. You know, but um. yeah so and then you know I get to note from the guys are hosting it oh yeah get here about four o'clock we'll have a cocktail tasting of Bourbons and then a nice long cocktail hour and then dinner I said they don't know i'm gonna you know. It doesn't matter."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so okay so you're doing the 3am meetings, a week, so you should get those hours that you need really quickly, then."
11007.0,Patient,"Well, I don't I that's funny that's good that you mentioned it, because I sent a little note to. The person at mail it's looking after everything I do. I said look i'm taking the three meetings, plus the bright health and she goes well i'm glad to take an Amiens but they're more like. I guess support where she gets the feeling bright health might be more really more. what's the word for."
226.0,Provider,My clinically based.
11007.0,Patient,"Thank you yeah. So she wants me to take a bright health, but she said. You know you've been doing this for six months now, on the bright health and whatnot I got said she got 75 pages of on me, I guess yeah cuz I asked him to send my hours, I thought you know it's like I think it's 20 hours."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11007.0,Patient,"And so, but it was 75 pages wow geez Okay, I have no idea what's in it, and she said, look you're on the right track so. yeah keep up the bright health, the a is just icing on the cake, but you know you've been doing it for six months, religiously and you know all my tests come back to give the path test, you know what that is. yeah but pretty intense how far does that go back like three months or something or."
226.0,Provider,"Yes, three months."
11007.0,Patient,yeah and so you know I came up flying colors on that. yeah um and then your urine test which I i've only taken one but. You know if i'm passing a path test your and tested a no brainer. Because that's what 24 hours is 36 hours or something like that. yeah yeah. yeah so the path test is the one I always cognizant of but it's kind of a moot point because I don't drink and so.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11007.0,Patient,"it's, so I think when she puts me up for. reevaluation. Her word goes a long way because she's hands on with me on a regular basis, so I talked to the schema hematology surgeon and their friends and she goes I said well do I need to do this, she said, look if if julie's happy i'm happy. Okay, because they're both part of the evaluation board. And so we'll see."
