540.0,Provider,"transcription I am to meeting with naya wilcox for an individual therapy session, she has just logged into virtual clinic I will wait for her to come on here. hi. Can you hear me."
9058.0,Patient,Hello.
540.0,Provider,hi how are you doing long time no see what's going on.
9058.0,Patient,"um I guess notch. i'm learning how to cope with like my ptsd anymore. But. it's still like really hard there's some parts about it that have gotten easier than there's some parts about that that life gotten worse, but like overall like I learned how to cope with it."
540.0,Provider,"What parts, would you say i've gotten easier what parts, we do say i've gotten worse."
9058.0,Patient,"I guess. what's gotten easier, is that I guess i'm getting used to my a. d realization like the i'm getting used to the fact that. Like. Every day when i'm at work, I feel like i'm kind of like halfway in the dream and my mind is like overwhelmed so I feel a lot sleepier than usual. One on help at work and, like I just i'm just getting used to it's not it's not doing it doesn't help me with my work performance that's for sure, like i'm. i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of a little unprofessional at work in regards to like my maturity if that makes sense i'm like my ptsd makes me like. I like zone out so much a lot of the time because of my D realization because of my ptsd and my anxiety that. I don't even think about like the things that I do or say a lot of the time until after I do them and, like until well after I do. Okay, and it's like it's kind of it's kind of bad because you know you're supposedly like. I worked for students so like you're kind of like when your instructional aid you're supposed to be setting the example of. Like being mature and it's not like I disrupt the class I help the students, where they need help i'm quiet in class unless the student talks to me it's more so kind of just like. What I how I would how I would be if I wasn't in a situation like. Maybe maybe I would be the same way, but like and maybe it's not a bad thing I don't know, but like i'm very like communicated with the kids and stuff like that, and like. I kind of like talk to them like how I would talk to just like anyone and like I don't think you're supposed to do that. So."
540.0,Provider,How do you talk to them would you say.
9058.0,Patient,"Like I just talked to them like how I would talk to like my sister like like i'll be like hey what's up girl and stuff and then like i'll have like a whole conversation with them about like. Like just regular stuff and like I don't know like they'd said that like you're like you're not supposed to like talk to them, like you, are their friend stuff like that. And i'm like I don't know man I kind of just like I know i'm not supposed to talk to them like i'm their friend, but like I don't have any friends and they're close to my age so it's like really hard for me to. And I relate to them too."
540.0,Provider,huh for you to be able to kind of like differentiate.
9058.0,Patient,"And so I thought about getting another job once the end of the year ends, because I just I don't like working with kids like I don't really like. I don't like like having to deal with attitude and stuff like that a lot of the time so i'm thinking about finding another job but i'm by next year, but i'm. Just overall like. it's like affect my work like even like when I talked to like my co workers like I talked to them like i've known them for a long time I don't spill any personal information because, like my ptsd makes me a little too paranoid to do that kind of stuff but like. I still talk to them like equivalent to Hollywood talk to the students and it's kind of like I don't know if that's a bad thing or not. But like. I don't know."
540.0,Provider,"So with work, I mean, at least with the employees are there any employees that are your age."
9058.0,Patient,"um there are two employees are close to my age well actually three but two of them are way more mature than I am they act like they're 28 and then one of. them is just like pretty introverted and so a lot of times like she like she she listened to me and stuff like she thinks i'm funny and everything but, like a lot of times it's not even though she's introverted it's just like she's mature too so it's kind of like I just talked to everyone. Like like they're my friend and that's because I just I don't know I don't really have friends, so I guess this kind of just like what I do."
540.0,Provider,"And do you feel like you could try to work on, like the boundaries or."
9058.0,Patient,"Two yeah I think. I think I could work on the boundaries, I mean i've been trying to get better, I think I have done better from when I started. um so that's good but it's still hard because, like like I said, my mind like runs on autopilot a lot of the time, and like how I cope is I try to pretend like. everything's Okay, and like I act super bubbly and I get really talkative so that way I don't have to think about like my trauma I try to just talk as much as possible to people. Like i'll go from one person to another to another um and. Like I think that's kind of like is what's stopping me from being because, like otherwise my old my old self before all this stuff would happen would be like. One be like that, but i'm just like so like i'm I just like I don't want to think about the pain so, then I just go when I just try to talk I just talked to people like a lot and stuff and. Like hopefully made make like the conversation, let me start thinking about what happened to me."
540.0,Provider,"And, have you found any groups in your area that you can talk about like trauma. Okay. And this one."
9058.0,Patient,huh.
540.0,Provider,What about like the group that you do with bright heart hell. Are you all about the trauma and.
9058.0,Patient,"Unfortunately what's how it works is now we have a very short time to speak, all of us. Because there's like so many of us, for us to have like a therapy session, and so a lot of us, so we only have like. two to five minutes to speak about like our day or like what we're thinking and stuff like that, but like it's helped me like it helps at it relieves the pain that for the moment, because I know that there are other people that are dealing with issues similar to me. So it helps up a moment but."
540.0,Provider,But long term.
9058.0,Patient,"Long term that's um long term it doesn't really do anything that, to be honest, not that I am consciously aware of."
540.0,Provider,"And I know that we've talked about trying to find some things in your area to that you can go to for trauma, are you still open to doing something like in person that can be a little a little bit more like beneficial in person."
9058.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Honestly, I don't know. i'm worried that because I am like super like. i'm just worried that i'm not going to be able to like keep my job, by the end of the year, because they're going to say that, like. i'm like way to like. Like I don't know how to say it like i'm just way too like. I just don't know how to like not be serious. If that makes sense."
540.0,Provider,"Also, sometimes, especially when you go through trauma, you can hit a point where, when you do get serious it your body gets too serious so you're you're you may not allow yourself to get serious because it can be heavy it can be dark."
9058.0,Patient,And that's where they.
540.0,Provider,"are going to start coming. But being able to talk about them in a serious matter in a safe place to to really just kind of allow yourself to move forward. But it's going to take that time because the body, the body does remember trauma."
9058.0,Patient,and
540.0,Provider,"Right now that's that may be, what you're experiencing too."
9058.0,Patient,"yeah probably I mean. The only time I ever like able to like realize how am I how like my traumas affected me is like when I go to therapy or when i'm just talking to someone because, like I don't know why, but like i'm a very like. Like i'm like a big like communicated person like for me to be introverted like I like and like I like i'm very, very communicated at the same time that makes sense. yeah like. When I need my alone time I need my alone time but like when I do decide that I want to talk to people I can like go all out when I am the one that I just when i'm the one that society that I want to talk to someone. Okay, but um. yeah it's just like. i'm sorry."
540.0,Provider,"I thought you froze. So what do you feel like you're struggling most with when it comes to your trauma and being able to. Take it a little bit more serious, to be able to take life, a little bit more serious at the moments that you need to."
9058.0,Patient,"um. Honestly, I think it's kind of like like I said the daylight, with my deep realization because I have to deal with the realization every day but. Now there's like a certain trigger with it it's this for some reason it's like you know when like for some people sunlight triggers migraines or something for people. For me sunlight triggers like the realization for me and a lot of time i'm working in spaces, where it's bright 24 seven and it gets and the realization feels kind of like. For me, at least, but other people I did research and other people say they feel the same way, but for me the realization feels like you're like partly hi 24 seven. Like like the kind of like the kind of high that's supposed to be good, but it doesn't feel good, because you know it's not normal cuz you're not you're not supposed to feel that way 24 seven. that's that's what that's what it feels like it's like it feels like the kind of high that you get after smoking marijuana that has not been laced with anything. But, just like marijuana itself like. that's how it feels it's like you feel like you're I don't know if has to do with my trauma like if my brain remembers like that aspect of. Like I don't even really want to talk about that, but you know when I mean I I don't know if it has to do with like my brain just remembering that trauma, but like. I just feel like when i'm outside and, like the sunlight hits me in this daylight I just feel like i'm like hi 24 seven and. So when I feel like i'm high 24 seven and, and on top of that, I feel anxious, at the same time I just cannot stay focus it's just like I just can't like I can't stay focused I can't take anything seriously because i'm like I have so many problems going on right now, like. I really cannot take care of like I right, and the reason why I have this job is because my mom like highly recommended it. But like I can't have jobs that are like extremely like. are just like pressure pressure pressure pressure 24 seven. And that's like most jobs. But like. that's kind of like what's stopping me from taking things certain things seriously in life that need to be taken serious is that I don't feel like i'm all the way there 24 seven like when i'm at work."
540.0,Provider,"And, have you so have you talked to your provider and group to see if there's any type of medication, that you can be on to help the director ization."
9058.0,Patient,"um I don't I I know when I went to the site or a while back. I talked to him about it, and he talked to the psychiatry is there about it, and he was like well like we don't have medication specifically for that, but. If your anxiety is like what's inducing it then these meds could probably like make it better and lessen it or not, make it happen as much."
540.0,Provider,But have you told I mean have you told and opened up to her provider with us.
9058.0,Patient,"um no I mean I could talk to her about it, I just have a fear of medication."
540.0,Provider,"So I am and it could be something else, so that she could encourage you to do for the realization I mean a lot of that it's going to be groundwork it's. it's trying to get away from that high feeling, so a lot of times what people will do is they'll kind of give in to the generalization and they'll just say like that's kind of my life. But. The more and more that you can practice the grounding work to say okay i'm hearing now. Five senses of looking around you and making sure that your presence so touching the Chair that you're sitting in smelling the air see what smells you can and then what you can taste, if you have a coffee next to you so just trying to. Get yourself to connect with reality and the more and more that you do, that I can help you get away from the generalization."
9058.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I definitely like. The bright side is is that. Because i've been dealing with it for so long now, at first, I couldn't hold conversations with people. Because they were talking to me and like that stuff was like. Because it was just not like it was just not registering. um I think I had a I had a pretty bad panic attack that had maybe have a really bad D realization moment and. I couldn't it was odd, I guess, this is like a new thing because it, I mean, I guess, always been there, but it's kind of like new because it's this hasn't. happened or always happen until recently, but like when my deep realization gets really bad like my hearing kind of fades a little bit, not a lot, but just a little bit like things sound more monthly. And stuff and. yeah like. it's um I just. I really cannot like be, and this is what ultimately like when I developed tcs seen stuff that anxiety. I just realized that I cannot be like a therapist or like do what you do, or any of that kind of stuff like or like a teacher like. I can't really do any of that kind of stuff because I just think I know for fact that it's just going to like. People are going to talk to me or ask me favors and it's going or they're going to try to come to me about their problems and it's going to go from one ear out the other. A lot of the time. And and i'm not going to want to hear it anyways because sometimes being a therapist seems really hard when people, especially if you have mental illness of your own and people come to you about your problems and it's kind of hoping."
540.0,Provider,you'll end up starting to take on.
9058.0,Patient,yeah. It seems like a very triggering jobs have.
540.0,Provider,"Definitely can be especially when you're going through your own stuff so. And it doesn't mean that you won't be able to in the future, but right now you're in the thick of it. And I I wouldn't think about anything like that, right now, but it doesn't it doesn't mean that you won't be able to but you're just you gotta work through. And as you grow as you mature with it, you I mean you may be able to do it, but right now you're you're in it."
9058.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"You have to start. really just taking care of yourself with it, and the more and more when we've talked about it, where you have to address it now. So that you don't have to. get down they. have been down in your life 15 years from now, and say Okay, you know I. I it can consume you."
9058.0,Patient,"And it's like a lot of times too it's like because, like I work a lot and like I work. at a school where students that have like. That have emotional disturbances I don't want to keep talking about them, I guess that's, the last thing i'm going to say about the kids is that. it's kind of just like annoying because, like you know i've been there, because I used to be a kid in high school and middle school and elementary school all that stuff, but a lot of times kids think that like. People that work for school districts have their life together and that they are perfect and that they that they think that they're perfect and that they think that they're saints. And it's kind of just really annoying because it's like you do realize, a lot of all of us have feelings we may some of us i'm not gonna lie, some of us are privileged and they and they never had a day. i'm not a day they've had days, but they never had to like suffer consistently with a mental illness or had or they never had to have dealt dealt with. trauma like to that degree, where they develop ptsd that bothers them every single day. that's not like i'm not going to end our people in a lot of there are there are a lot of people that work for schools that have never had to do with any problems to that degree. But like there are some of us that have had to deal with the problems to that degree and just because we're not you know crying. crying in front of you guys and are like shaking and rocking back and forth and being the stereotype of mental illness in front of you guys does not mean that we are not dealing with our own problems like. These students talk to me like, because how I show up to work, these students talk to me or some of them talk to me like. i've never had to deal with any issues and i'm like little do you know that I. I am so messed up right now that what you're talking what you're saying to me is going for one ear out the other because I barely feel like i'm here because i'm so traumatized most of the time. And stuff and i'm like little do you know that my heart, I feel like i'm like my i'm gonna have a heart attack 24 seven other day, because my heart is shaking so hard and stuff because i'm always in like fight or flight mode 24 seven. So i'm just like it's just like annoying when students are like. Oh, like like like when they try to explain to us their pain, without asking and they think that us making them do their work is like us telling them we don't care about your pain. it's not that we don't care about your pain we have our own lives, at the end of the day, we're all individuals. And we're just trying to get paid, just like you guys are trying to get through your life and graduate high school we're trying to get paid. So it's just a mutual thing we're trying well it's supposed to be a mutual thing. you're just supposed to respect that we're trying to get paid and we're just going to just. respect that you are a student that you're human, but we also have to like respect you have to also respect that we have to make you do your work as a result, at the same time that we were trying to get paid."
540.0,Provider,"On a hard thing too is I mean working with children, you guys do I mean you guys do kind of have a obligation to. guide, especially at the time, where I mean you guys are shaping these human beings to what their life needs to be and they're not I like understanding that you are because their kids. I mean, in a sense, they are somewhat the customer, for you guys so. it's not that the customer's always right, but you do I mean you are serving the person so though you are getting a paycheck to do that it's. you're shaping these human beings to what and who they're going to be in their life and you're you're touching their life on that, just like. I mean, I get paid talking to people, but if I were to think of just the money versus of like actually what I do. Is I I mean I guide people in their life and we go through hard times but teachers, they do that every day and their counselors they they. are somewhat kind of like that role model for people so that position does, I think, have a lot of obligations that maybe also like when you went into the position, maybe they didn't really let you know."
9058.0,Patient,hey dude.
540.0,Provider,How much how much it doesn't tail because it's important.
9058.0,Patient,"They didn't even train me they train the other is the other new ones, but they didn't train me, for some reason and i'm over here like in shock. Because I was not expecting like to hear all like I didn't know that the students were so like so had such messed up backgrounds and were so mentally unstable. So Dana let me know my like I said, like my old self I, like my old self before to trauma like I would have been like shoot like a super super outstanding I, like, I would like. I, but like and like don't get me wrong like I still think that i'm a pretty decent I I gotta tell me do, even though I just like i'm contradicting myself, but I think I do better, as a therapist then IIA. Because i'm not good at telling students sit down do your work. And stuff um. I like I don't know I just I understand that there's the kids they're like kids and, like, I understand that the importance of like. I mean you just reminded me, to be honest, like because, like I said, my old self would have considered all of that, but like i'm so messed up dealing with my own problems. And like I."
540.0,Provider,"mean you may not have the the emotional energy in order of like what's needed because the end of the day, I mean kids they do need that guidance, they need. A lot and I mean if anything showed of this whole coven is how important the school system is for kids and how much they get from it, because sometimes those kids are not going home home to good homes. A lot of kids they are getting abused, a lot of kids are. Being degraded at home, some people are being sexually abused. And that may be a little too close to home for you right now, because. I mean you're you just had some experiences happen to you in this past year. It is pretty soon to not only be helping others but children in itself."
9058.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah that's true, I mean. I. Think, just like I understand and, for me, I guess i'm going to be honest, like. there's some of my old self is still there, because, like when I talk to the students, I tried to like remind the students like. That like even though, like III know what they're going through and stuff and that i'm not going to like i'm not gonna just take. anything from them, but like if they're having a hard time and they need to be accommodated for and not restricted, I would, I would like accommodate to their needs, if it's that bad. But i'm. Like for me it's just kind of like the emotional energy like i'm not like. i'm not as passionate to like help people like I used to like I used to be, because i'm just so like. I just I can't like I don't know what's it like I just want to say I just can't and like like I said i'm not I feel like as long as i'm not adding trauma to her life. And stuff I feel like i'm not doing the crappiest job, just like as compared it's just the professionalism as as far as like. Being relatable to the students that it relatable to the staff, but especially the students because, like I said I lot of the students, like the. Students that are upper age like they were in high school when I was in high school. And one of the students actually went to the same high school as me and I knew her and she came and she came to the school that I work at for kids with emotional disturbance and I was like what the heck girl like what are you doing. And like like we started like like we talk like we're friends, but like I, personally, I i'm like i'm just like I I just can't like I can talk to them like like like it'd be nice and be relatable but like as far as like. I just can't like. Maybe i'm just being too hard on myself because, to be honest, like I do help the students with their work. But I think it's kind of just like I don't know."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I mean so giving yourself credit at night, so I mean you you're continuing with the job, even though you have some of those difficulties you're trying to balance it all but. The more and more that we're aware of our limitations, the better, that is for our life. If you can I mean even say you are a counselor. and met with a patient and there. You can correlate way too much with them it's okay to say hey i'm going to like place you with another counselor. yeah and that's. And that happens all the time and counseling it happens all the time, teaching wise to where you. identify your limitations and. be honest with your supervisor be. Honest person that has hired you to say hey you know, is there something else that I can do, or Can you advise me and work with me through this to kind of like check in with me, maybe every other week to see like what I could do better in the position. And I mean that supervision it's I mean it's pretty crucial for your growth. But your support as well."
9058.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I do check in with via. Their supervisor, a lot of my the principle that works there I check in looking a lot like. I don't know i'm just like I, like, for example, if I find out the student is getting abused or like they're not getting food or like, just like the basic stuff like. Because I am a mandated reporter like I think that's like the positive side, about me being friendly with the students is they feel comfortable telling me. About like the fact that something crazy happened in their life, and so I go straight to the principal after and stuff but, like, I told him like. I told him like key just keep it anonymous though because, like I don't want like drama, I just want you to know that so and so told me. That their dad beats them at home or something like that, and like they look into it, or so and so told me that they're high on this and that right now. And then I but I never ever like I never ever say oh my gosh girl like that's so funny like. it's never like that, like it's kind of like I feel like I played more of like a big sister rule if that makes sense, rather than like a friend role. Just more like a big sister Oh, I feel like and I guess, I guess, I do that with the students because it's kind of like how me and my sisters relationship is yeah is that I do the same thing with like. The students, that I do with my sisters that I talked about things that are funny within things that we can relate on. But like if you tell me something that is not that doesn't sound right to me, I like I like naturally just going to go tell the person in charge of the entire thing or a higher up because it's just I have to do it and it's the right thing to do."
540.0,Provider,yeah well and it's a mandated reporting to.
9058.0,Patient,"yeah. Look at that, but um I like I just like for me like I said I don't think that i'd be able to I don't think like. I would not be able to receive this kind of information, though, if I feel like if I was always like. distant and like oh aloof and pulled off pulled away from the kids if I didn't like connect with the kids and talk to them that I feel like they wouldn't be comfortable enough to tell me about the bad things happen or life and I wouldn't be able to help them because. Because they because they would be like I don't really know her, so why would I trust her enough to talk to her about that kind of stuff. And there are some students that don't feel comfortable to talk to me about it and I respected, and I say okay like if you're having a bad day like you can go talk to a therapist or something you don't have to talk to me it's fine. But I got never pushed him about it."
540.0,Provider,Oh man that's I mean it's important for them to feel safe and they'll come to you as. As they need to. And just being that supportive person in their life.
9058.0,Patient,And I think.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, to have like a friendly relationship with them. But understanding to that the boundaries are pretty important as well."
9058.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I do set boundaries, but like I said there's like. there's only one other IDA that's like has a friendly relationship with the students and, like the students like love that I am. And stuff but my goal I don't my goal is not to get the students to love me i'm just trying to get. And it just so happened that the students feel comfortable talking to me, but like ultimately at the end of the day, I just want the money. it's just like I just treat everyone equally so so like the students like people feel comfortable talking talking people I guess people with problems so comfortable talking to me because I treat everyone equally. Just naturally. I don't think about it's just kind of like the way I am but like I don't like like I can't I don't want people to mistake that for for for like me trying to like get the kids to like be like oh. Like no, I just want the money. I know that sounds really bad, but I mean I."
540.0,Provider,Know for me it's a money.
9058.0,Patient,"But like I realized like I don't want to be a teacher or anything like that, like actually if I were to be a teacher, then I teach overseas like like to but just to like travel, but like only for the traveling not really for like and like i'd still be like. I still be a good like. Like it's even the same thing with like me having kids like somebody like there'd be like oh now you want kids i'll be like I mean I don't really like desire for kids but like, if I have to, then I would. I would still I would be their mom, but I would treat them as an equal, at the same time, and I would be a good mom because, like that's, just like the right thing to do, and I would love my kids so it's like but it's not like i'm sitting here like, please let me have kids. I used to really want kids but now like ever since I don't know how mentally stable i'll be in the future to have kids but. Like and also, at the same time, like I said the job i'm working at i'm just like ill teenagers Is that how they're going to be when it says, I want my kids going to be when she gets older just discussing a little teenager and i'm like no i'm like I don't want kids anymore."
540.0,Provider,"Well, and not making choices now two years and I are young, so allowing yourself to just be on and work through what you've been going through."
9058.0,Patient,"A little by little mm hmm. yeah I know I just like. and I just. anyways that's, just like the only full it's not moving i'm just going on, like a tangent about random stuff right."
540.0,Provider,So tell me any updates on relationship stuff and Guy that your friend her X.
9058.0,Patient,"Oh, oh man my man, my friend we're like we're cool now but i'm still talking to like I I stopped talking to him, but like we started talking again and, like that's like not like that's not like me like i'm not like proud of it but it's. We. I don't know. i'm just not i'm not proud of it but it's like. Whatever I mean."
540.0,Provider,"So how. I mean, so how you. guys are still talking, are you guys dating or."
9058.0,Patient,"what's going on. we're not dating we're just like. With a situation. that's. that's all I were not dating though it just the situation and he's just like a friend like. Like even though, like it's a situation where it's like we're still we're still like friends and stuff like that, like I don't have feelings for him or anything like that, just like. i'm too scared to get in relationship anyways because, like I said it's the same thing with like having kids like I don't really want to like be a crappy person in a relationship. The same way i'm like scared and be a crappy person having kids and I don't want to be a happy person in relationship like with my mental health like I don't really know how i'd be with either of those situations so. I just like."
540.0,Provider,"Until you focus on you and work on you, I think that's good insight phone maybe putting a pause on those type of relationships and not just relationships, but kind of making a choice and commitment."
9058.0,Patient,"to other people. yeah I mean I don't really I don't I think that's like one of the big issues for me, those are like I don't want to be lonely but then also, at the same time I don't want to make commitments with people like friendships. or relationships, because i'm scared that my mental health and my character. Is because of my mental health is going to make them want to run away. So I just like. Like I like I said i'm usually friendly to everyone so like i'm friendly to people and. Like so people want to talk to me. and talk to me about their life and stuff like that, but like. Ultimately, when they say like do you want to like hang out or like like let's like do this together, just like no things and, like, I never ever like. i'll be like oh sure, but then like I will never ever ever like text them or call them are like when I do text or call me I won't get back to them until like it depends on like how bad my. My situation is like I will sometimes I will get back to them for like a week or two because I just don't want them to get involved in like the negative parts of me."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean it's you're going to be closed off to the vulnerability. And how much you give yourself to others. And I know that you don't want to talk about the trauma and. But being able to kind of so we've talked about it but figuring out how we can allow you to be able to I know you're detaching from kind of reality, but instead trying to allow yourself to move forward and allow yourself to be a survivor. And I think. going to maybe some trauma groups around you may be helpful."
9058.0,Patient,"yeah probably. me that would probably be helpful, I mean it would be helpful side and probably would be you know yeah. But i'm going to look for right now I mean there's other obligations that i'm trying to like finish like. i'm trying to like. i'm trying to learn how to drive, as I saw i'm not done. Because because of my mental health, I have not learned how to drive. And I need to and i've been setting up equipments to get my test, so I can get my permits and hopefully pass like you get a permit, so I can start learning how to physically dry and then eventually like a year later, take my driving test and then actually start driving. But. It gets hard because, like I get distracted because of like my mental state so. I thought. I don't know I thought I have like. I don't know, but I just feel like I like I have like a mental problem, like a mental health problem, like, I personally feel like I have borderline personality disorder, but. Like that the Cassandra Escobar she was like that kind of stuff looks like. it's like really, really hard to like diagnose someone with that officially with borderline personality disorder that's what she said, and the other therapists. said it to there was there was a staff therapist That said, it and but, like, I feel like I can relate to like not all of them, but like a good amount of the. Of the traits of borderline personality disorder like I can release them and then like when I look at videos of people talking that have borderline personality disorder i'm like oh you do that too, like. I don't know."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean so a lot of that it's gonna so borderline personality disorder personality disorders can come up from trauma. And that's where like the. Decent size nation comes from as well, or do you realization."
9058.0,Patient,"But I feel like i've always had borderline personality disorder, since I was a little kid."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean and. It is a little bit more difficult, of a disorder to diagnose. It takes a little bit more time to. know a lot of history, a lot of background, but I think that if we start to work on like that grounding work and you're going to have to put some work in with actually like being very mindful of it and trying to. Because if you just keep on allowing yourself to just kind of like trail off and go off, you may have to start bringing yourself back. So we may have to start working on that so that it's kind of like any type of muscle on a type activity exercise the more and more you do it it'll become more of a habit, but it's gonna be hard to start continue but it'll get easier, as you go."
9058.0,Patient,yeah go ahead.
540.0,Provider,"So maybe what we'll do is at least try once a day for just once a day trying to if you're at work, maybe if you're having like that D realization try to do the five senses so try to acknowledge what you're feeling what you're hearing what you're seeing or you're smelling. tasting and doesn't have to be long all you have to do is try to identify them and then just go on with your day."
9058.0,Patient,mm hmm. Okay.
540.0,Provider,All right.
9058.0,Patient,"I mean, I definitely want to be I think it's also because I just don't like the people at my job. I feel, like everyone there's like the workers they're a little tuesday's. Except like except one worker there like one worker on my job, like that workers very, very extremely chill and like I look up to that workers, specifically as like an older sibling kind of way, but like. The rest of the workers are very to except one other one, but the rest are like really to face like to talk crap about each other. And they're like very bossy and it's like a very unhealthy work environment and that's probably part of the reason why I get so stressed and and get into the V realized date. And then I just like don't really care about like how i'm talking and who i'm surrounded by because they stressed me out so much. Already i'm already like I already have to think about my trauma and then they stress me out so much with their drama that like I start like getting overwhelmed and then I started zoning out and then I start living life on autopilot. and Just lands and right now."
540.0,Provider,No it's okay. So we're here for.
9058.0,Patient,You want to know something yeah. i'm going to get a pure state.
540.0,Provider,What Pearson you're going to get.
9058.0,Patient,A an eyebrow one. Is gonna hurt. But it's okay.
540.0,Provider,what's making you want to get the piercing have you been thinking about it.
9058.0,Patient,um I like the edgy look. I like to dress up like very like and like I like alternative lifestyle and stuff and so. I brought piercing i'd like to set the. Set the vibe. And the tattoo.
540.0,Provider,what's the tan to me.
9058.0,Patient,"Oh, the cherry blossom tree."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
9058.0,Patient,yeah. All of my arm so everyone can see it and they'll how edgy I am.
540.0,Provider,Okay. From self care.
9058.0,Patient,"that's yeah self care. But I really think that apple this year i'm going to quit my job I don't like working I don't like being an I. I don't like hearing about other students problems because it triggers me a lot. I don't like working with problematic people, even though every workplace you go to there's going to be at least one or two or three or four problematic people they're like I just don't like that those I just don't like that it's problematic at a school environment around kids. that's like like there was this one, this one is that something so weird in front of the kids and I just got really uncomfortable but like I don't I don't know."
540.0,Provider,What are they saying from kids.
9058.0,Patient,"And the kids were like one of the kids it's like Oh, do you know that there's like Plan B inside pregnancy tests and then one of the ideas was like that's not true, I know because I took so many of those and I was like. Why would Why would you why would you say that. In front, why would you say something like okay what's your coworkers that's like different. The lake. I don't know that just didn't like really sit that doesn't really doesn't really sit well with me, I guess, maybe, am I, being dramatic or is that that that is that a little weird to say in front of like freshman in 10th grade."
540.0,Provider,"Some. boundaries. There, but it's all are into. talk."
9058.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Well, I mean, are you fed other teenagers right. yeah."
9058.0,Patient,"they're to the other teenagers one was nice and what was Ted greater I just felt like I just felt like saying it's the way that she said it, and like I just felt like that. wasn't necessary there, there could have been another way to say it without like saying that she's took it before like you taking it like they said that the plan B was inside of practice and says like if you break it open this plan B pills outside of. That doesn't make sense. And, like the way that. The way that I like. The way that I like the way she said that she liked took those before it was like. Okay, we don't want to know, like we all, we all just kind of looked at her like she was crazy and you're like we don't want to know that you like have had sex and had a guy like. Like do stuff with you that many times that you would need to take pregnancy tests that many times like that's just not appropriate to say like at a school environment, I guess, like, especially if it's not if the topic of like sex is not being brought up. So it was just like it was just weird. But I don't even know why start talking about that I guess it's just because it's been on my mind, like a lot this happened, like a few days ago, but like I think about it a lot like. she's like a big problem. phone yeah."
540.0,Provider,And also stuck with you.
9058.0,Patient,"So yeah. she's just like Okay, this is this is like the last thing to say she's just like she's just like a big problem at work so she's really mean. And like she like talks about the kids like confidence you like brings up confidence confidential information about the students and like she tells everybody about it."
540.0,Provider,She knows.
9058.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know if I should because, like i'm like like the secret little tattletale work and, like not like I don't do it like to be a bitch I do it to protect the kids. And I don't want like I don't know if I should like go if I should just mind my business, because as long as other people don't know I think I should just mind a distance like probably a. Because a lot of times, I think I want to tell the principal about it because it's just not acceptable, like I shouldn't be knowing about a kid. Being like abused unless like like abused and like not really abused, not even that I should not know about a kids like past history if it's like. it's like if the therapists doesn't feel like it's important for me to know, because the therapists are really close with the eyes of the teachers, so they tell stuff to the eyes and teachers if they feel like it's important for to I know. And, like the therapists have not told us any of that and they made it very clear that they don't feel comfortable sharing that information because it's confidential if she goes, and she tells she because she's close with like the the other. she's close with like because her mom was a principal there she's close with like the workers there and, like the workers talk to her mom and her mom talks to the daughter, who works there in a daughter Dan goes in spreads information. And i'm like we're not supposed to know any of that stuff so like when she told me about how a student is like severely suicidal. he's a very like this student like is very prideful at the same time, even though he suicidal it's very prideful and i'm pretty sure that if I told him like go so and so told me that you're suicidal like that you have like a suicidal past he would not be very happy if I knew the hat. So."
540.0,Provider,So I do.
9058.0,Patient,i'm sorry I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I hear you. I can't hear you. You can hear both okay.
540.0,Provider,"um I mean, so there is like an importance to have that background, because God forbid, something happens. yeah they the kids on your watch. it's important that safety scissors I mean there are things that you need to know in order to protect that child, so I mean this just maybe it may be a lot for like a job for you right now. So maybe having. It may be good for you to change jobs until. Maybe good for you to change the job."
9058.0,Patient,"done yeah I don't know I just like I mean. I do agree that it's important for us to know but, like the detail of it all like. I feel like it's like not necessary, like to say, oh the students suicidal so like make sure, like you keep eye on him that's like a professional way of saying it but say oh my God so so and so has like tried to commit suicide like 20 times that's gossiping I feel like."
540.0,Provider,"Okay yeah yeah it's definitely the way of saying it, so I know that we are running short on time. No, no ever be sorry. So are we scheduled rescheduled for two weeks from today right."
9058.0,Patient,yeah I think so.
540.0,Provider,"Alright perfect alright, so what I want you to do is some grounding work until we see each other."
9058.0,Patient,Again okay yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And we'll talk more we'll we'll kind of pick up on like this topic, a little bit sorry okay alright so i'll See you in two weeks."

540.0,Provider,More about like the work.
9058.0,Patient,So we.
540.0,Provider,"had to figure out and then going forward maybe trying to find a different type of position. Okay, all right yeah it's good seeing you."
9058.0,Patient,escape see too.
540.0,Provider,"bye bye i'll see you soon. Alright alright. For transcription That was my individual therapy session with naya wilcox some things to know tae nyah still struggling with her trauma. It does seem like she is struggling with some some bursts of the random thoughts that do come so flighting thoughts. racing thoughts. So just helping her do some groundwork she is questioning if she has something to do with like borderline personality disorder she definitely has some D realization so just working with her through that. I am not able to diagnose any of those would be the psychiatrist and group that should have to meet with to do that, but just continuing to work on that grounding work to help with that deep realization other than that i'm nothing for transcription."
