17564.0,Patient,me yes.
120.0,Provider,"Yes, I understand that very. Very well. So um so yeah so today i'm just going to be asking about you know your situation kind of what the what's going on for you what you're looking for and remind me, are you looking for mainly just an outpatient therapist are you looking for the I O P Program. I can't remember I O P, is what. yeah that's kind of what you're okay sounds good Lucy you're gonna have to move I can't I can't write down stuff when you're sitting on the paper. All right, okay so tell me kind of about what's going on for ya kind of what you're hoping for kind of what what's led to you to this spot that you're in right now."
17564.0,Patient,"So um let's see I had I lived in foster care. From like four or like yeah about four to eight, and I was in like six different homes in that spirit period of time. wow and the the very first home and the ladies boyfriend sexually abused me. yeah at the age of four it was yeah and so not only do I have that but, like the going from home to home, and then I was finally adopted, when I was eight. And my parents to try to everything that they could to cannot like undo that but I kind of counteract that the trauma yeah um but i've always been really picky with food like to. Where I have to have the same brands, I have to if my mom would make it one way, the very first time she has tried to get every other time, just like that or I wouldn't eat it. And so, and I was doing really good until about like a like right before coven hit things started getting really bad and now i'm i'm, to the point where i'm basically living off of the the insurer drink drinks daily. wow my foods tasting gross it's very disappointing I can't eat anything and i've lost like 20 pounds in the last like two months or something. Oh yeah and it's, not because I have a like a little bit of a belly I also think it's some muscle my but my doctor also thinks it's a muscle, like my body is eating some muscle for energy my blood pressure or my my heart rate is about 112 like laying in bed every like all the time. about the shower today and I felt funny so I tested, it was 182. And then it would have to go to and now yeah it's just been it's been crazy like it just goes up and down and, and so I think it's time that I I do need help, like i'm tired of of living off of ensures like I would like the food. I can't I tried to do it on my own, I tried to have a good counselor here in town. she's tried to help me as much as she can but she's like I think i've reached a point where i'm no longer of service have to use So what should you need to find some more help. Because your health is failing and she's very, very worried about me, and so my insurance finally approved you guys so i'm just hoping that I can kind of get back to normal, I mean like just i'm tired of this like i'm exhausted all the time i'm shaking all the time. Well, you can't do anything."
120.0,Provider,"So just out of curiosity, if I just said here, you know have have some cereal like what what would go through your mind like, if I had you bowl of cereal and say hey we're gonna we're gonna eat this today. we're able to do it."
17564.0,Patient,"Some days most days I would, and I would try it at least once and if I if it just didn't taste right because my taste buds are doing weird like i'm a vegetarian, and so I like the morning star sausage patties. yeah um and they tasted like the chocolate donuts like the hostess little donuts for me and it just was really weird and."
120.0,Provider,"Have you had covert itself. No okay guys just wearing it, because sometimes that can throw people's. tasty and weird okay."
17564.0,Patient,"No, I haven't um and then like last weekend I was craving burritos my boyfriend and I made burritos Friday night because he comes home on the weekends, he lives in kennewick. And I was really excited and I use the vegetarian burger, and so I warmed it up, and I saw a little Speck of onion in it. And I told myself don't think about it don't think about it, like you, eaten this for years, I guess there's nothing new it's not and I couldn't eat it and I ended up just throwing my whole burrito away. And yeah the next day I made my homemade vegetarian workers, which are, I never feel I always eat them but I couldn't eat them. There grow God i'm pleased to hear it's just and things are just getting worse, like cheese I love cheese I eat it and I spit it out, because it tastes like garlic and I don't like garlic, and I just it's weird."
120.0,Provider,yeah it sounds like a neurological problem or something.
17564.0,Patient,i'm thinking.
120.0,Provider,"that's we're just interesting i've never heard that before where things. You know that are supposed to taste, a certain way. Are kind of being translated wrongly in your in your mouth. yeah interesting."
17564.0,Patient,"yeah it's just. me like I said, the only thing I can really do is the ensure and thank goodness i've been living off of it for about a year about a year now. And I think I haven't gotten sick of it. And they there's one that I drank that was like perfume me sweet, and I just through the whole package out, and now I don't buy them from super one anymore, I only buy them from like walmart or costco. And though I know it's it's just crazy."
120.0,Provider,"It have you do, you have OCD have you been. Nice enough to be."
17564.0,Patient,And my doctor thinks there's yeah he's he's thinking that there is something. I noticed myself. um yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because like so you're saying the same product you wouldn't eat if it was bought from a different store for what store versus a difference, even though it's the same product."
17564.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean I bought it once from super one, and it was sweet and so now in my head they get the bad. it's weird like I can't buy from super one i'll buy and I bought some from Amazon, and they came in a different box and what I was expecting so it took me a whole day to. convince myself that it's okay to drink them they're the exact same thing it's just a different box and I got hungry enough to where I finally drink when the next day and they're fine like there's. No with them. Well yeah."
120.0,Provider,"help me understand what, what is your mind telling you that, like what are you afraid, is going to happen if you distribute besides it doesn't taste good, but a lot of things."
17564.0,Patient,"I just i'm. don't ever fixated on on taste like if it frozen i'm gonna taste it and then, but if later on, I can taste it again and I don't I don't really know."
120.0,Provider,"that's really interesting, so it sounds like you're almost like afraid of. Something hit not tasting good."
17564.0,Patient,"Like yeah i'm petrified of it. And I only I know I I don't try a lot of new foods, because i'm also really scared of the taste. And that's why everything has to be made the same day as if it tastes different than it's just disappointing and and gross. My mom struggled with it for years with me, I mean I remember, there was one time she was trying to introduce me to a new. meal and I threw a huge fit and like was screaming and crying and shaking and like was like threw myself on the floor like I was so. nervous, and this is the way i've been my whole life with the food is to me food is the enemy like unless it's the exact same brand the exact same way, you know, and I make it I. see all the stuff comes from. And it's just. I yeah."
120.0,Provider,"it's interesting and it's been like that, since childhood. So yeah."
17564.0,Patient,"But it's just gotten exponentially worse, the older i've gotten."
120.0,Provider,"Have you done this is kind of a side note, but have you done very much trauma work on that those early."
17564.0,Patient,"I think yeah my parents put me in a lot of counseling I did go through a lot of counseling but i'm thinking back on it, I don't ever remember them really talking about like the trauma, it was just kind of checking in to see how you're settling with your family, you know and like. I thought I thought I have worked through it, but then obviously I haven't because I can't seem to move forward from."
120.0,Provider,"yeah that's really stuck in that I just. And I don't want to go into too much of it, because I know it's kind of a can be a difficult thing that can go into, but I just don't know if there's an association with eating with your trauma."
17564.0,Patient,"I was yeah I was told as a kid that since I had no control over my day to day life, I took the control of my food and i've just kind of gotten out of hand with it like I just it was the only thing I could control control, and so I ran with it."
120.0,Provider,Right and that's and you know that that will make sense.
17564.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,"And you know that. You know that your brain is responding to you know people putting pressure on you to try different foods it's it's your brain is responding to that like it's a threat. Yes, yes, I know I have to be you know, I have to be in half, has to be this way this way kind of thing you know. that's pretty interesting actually and I can imagine how frustrating that would be for you. You know, and yes, so like you really have an ollie oval largely only able to eat the venture for about a year."
17564.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and then you've tried other things, but they like the burrito you had you just hate audience or something and so you're."
17564.0,Patient,"Right yeah I don't like onions. And then the beans tasted weird like the only thing that was good, because I put rice in it with and i'm like I very minimum, I just had rice beans and then vegetarian burger and then a Tortilla that's all I eat. I think I had maybe some olives, but all of her another issue that i'm having recently too, but. I scraped all the beans and burger out and I just tried to eat the rice, and I was able to finally eat a little bit of the rice, with the breed it with the Tortilla. But it just there's yeah I just i'm so frustrated cuz I was I had been like thinking about it for like four days and I was waiting for my home make it and I was like I need the protein I just it sounded so good, and then it was just so devastating and I wanted to cry."
120.0,Provider,"wow it sounds like it and and for you, having to eat, something that doesn't taste good it feels like torture almost. Yes, it is because there's a lot of things, you know that you can just kind of chew and swallow when you plug your nose and chew and swallow, but you but you can't get yourself to do that. Okay that's what I used to do as a kid when you had to eat, something you didn't like, then you just put your nose and swallow it anyway, just to get it down so that you wouldn't have to."
17564.0,Patient,yeah my my parents were told not to really forced me because I couldn't have an eating disorder. which I didn't and I ended with one.
120.0,Provider,"eat anyway, but yeah."
17564.0,Patient,"But, like my parents were very understanding, I mean they would get frustrated. I understand, like and then even like going to like family reunions the whole family would always make comments about how my plate like there's nothing on your plate, all you have is potatoes and you know and corn like well i'm sorry, and it was just."
120.0,Provider,me i've always kind of I.
17564.0,Patient,"knew about that, and I think that."
120.0,Provider,"sounds very much like a little kid because little kids will do that you know, like I won't be then usually as you get older that kind of goes away but it sounds like for you it's still very much there yeah wow okay. and Have you done any kind of eating disorder type of specific therapy for was this therapist kind of general like. Oh yeah, this is just a regular."
17564.0,Patient,"I thought that yeah no she's just regular and I did try to get into one over in tri cities but it's like $17,000 and they didn't accept my assurance and it was about about like maybe 910 maybe even 11 months ago I tried to get in and i've been on a waiting list for the. Like a scholarship or a donation and they haven't called me. So."
120.0,Provider,"Okay hi you're back. Through the dog is. Very. She was all, let me notice. Okay um and. And this was kind of all it's been going on as far as you remember. So when did it. He said he was kind of managed until right before Kobe and then it got really and then it kind of what was there any particular trigger that kind of restricted it even more when coat what happened."
17564.0,Patient,"I mean, I was in school and my boyfriend was struggling with drinking it mean in so many that high little bit to do with it. Okay, but also i've just been a very high strung person, and I think just it was just bound to happen."
120.0,Provider,"That you know if that theory of. You know feeling like you don't have any control of your life, you know affected food that absolutely would make sense if you were going through you know stuff like, with your boyfriend. Making poor choices and you feeling powerless. To do anything about it, you know that could be a factor is your boyfriend still drinking or did he. change those behaviors."
17564.0,Patient,He just got out of his own intensive outpatient treatment for drinking and so he's been doing really well and as a huge sigh of relief.
120.0,Provider,Good that's awesome that's really hard work to do so. How long have you guys been together.
17564.0,Patient,"About for four years, almost five think yeah. Okay, good. So it'll be five yeah."
120.0,Provider,"um. Right. So. Do you when you when you don't when you're unable to eat the food, it sounds like the primary reason is because of a fear of its taste, is that kind of correct. Yes, the fear of the taste okay."
17564.0,Patient,"But then there's also weird things like I love the smell of tomatoes, they smell so good. That I cannot eat them. For my boyfriend will have some Chinese food or something and it smells amazing, but I cannot eat it like I physically cannot allow myself. it's just yeah my roommate she'll have something delicious that smells good and i'm like oh that smells good here try it no. I won't."
120.0,Provider,that's interesting.
17564.0,Patient,Man better I used to get full blown panic attacks and people would have me trying new food. Now I just know.
120.0,Provider,"You just don't even try it. yeah that's that's really interesting because it's one of those things that. In order for it to eventually get better you know you are going to have to start doing that you know it's not going to suddenly get better until you start working on it's kind of like you have to kind of do it, it it sucks for a long time and then gradually becomes less sucky. Yes, as you kind of get used to it. But I can imagine how frustrating that would be because you're you're right, it is logical, but you know that logical."
17564.0,Patient,"yeah like me knows is logical, but I still can't get the other part of me to just move forward."
120.0,Provider,Right okay.
17564.0,Patient,Just make ED do you need.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, it makes."
17564.0,Patient,She know she's. yeah she's she's part of me.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, I just couldn't look like her tail was gone I can. tell you oh there it is, it is down."
17564.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. Beautiful yeah. she's a little crazy, though."
120.0,Provider,They are a little bit.
17564.0,Patient,yeah she reminds me of me if I were a cat my food issue she's got yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So when you are restricted or the dogs are wrestling now when you are restricting food, what is it just motivated by fear of tasting dad is that kind of what happens yes."
17564.0,Patient,"um and then yeah and then sometimes I will, before I was when I was eating I would binge. Because I was hungry and I always justify like I haven't eat anything all day it's fine like I can just eat. a bunch of food now um but i'm also also really paranoid about gaining weight. and yeah I really struggled like the heavier I am like the worst I feel about myself but it's never gotten, to the point where like. I won't eat something or I will eat something or forced myself, you know i'm not quite there yet, thank goodness um, but I do. find myself thinking like oh man i'm just going to continue on the ensure maybe I can drop even more weight like it's you know it's no big deal i'm not going to eat food i'm just gonna and I was really excited about losing the weight, but like I did it so unhealthily. My doctor or."
120.0,Provider,"I went up when you said you would bend was that, like when was that when when when did that happen."
17564.0,Patient,"And I would say, between like 2012 to about like 2019."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and would you binge on a variety of foods are just those foods that. Like the beans are the things that you knew that you like."
17564.0,Patient,"Yes, and I had like maybe five or six different meals, that I would eat and I if I would like, for instance, even. Like maybe actually earlier this year, and my boyfriend made spaghetti and I would eat a ton of spaghetti and I would eat like like almost the whole platform and i'd go back and get more, but now i'm sick of spaghetti so I can't eat it anymore so. I guess you suddenly stopped liking it or what happened. So, like I said I have like five or six different meals, I can eat. And when I eat them. So much I get sick of them and don't want to eat them anymore. Okay, one of my favorite meals was like broccoli and carrots steamed with rice and then vegetarian chicken. I can't do that anymore I hate it so much and. Just know that if if it was sitting in front of you now you wouldn't be able to."
120.0,Provider,force yourself to eat it.
17564.0,Patient,"And maybe like a little bit of the rice. And I would try to eat a little bit of broccoli because I know it's good and I usually love broccoli but i'm I just yeah I might just ignore it, and then just grab anything."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. um. So i'm just trying to understand the because you mentioned having body image issues and you said when when you would binge you said it's Okay, because I didn't eat earlier. So, so that was kind of about so that sounds like that one was a little bit more focused on calories like you're worried, you were like I can eat this because I didn't eat earlier like it was about your body. But there's other times that it sounds like it's restriction, because of the taste of food."
17564.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,So it's kind of a little bit of both.
17564.0,Patient,yeah. I got lots of lots of different routes here and.
120.0,Provider,yeah it's kind of confusing it's interesting. And do you ever purge like vomit.
17564.0,Patient,"No, but there has been at least once where I ate so much that I threw it up, I mean that hadn't happened for like maybe eight years. ago but then I go right back to eating. Okay, and i've eaten, to the point where i'm so cool I can hardly move, but not to where I throw things up. Within like the last year I haven't done that."
120.0,Provider,"um do you ever like drink a ton of ensure to where you feel like you're gonna explode. No, no okay."
17564.0,Patient,You can most i've ever drank is two models at once.
120.0,Provider,Do you ever restrict the ensure.
17564.0,Patient,"I used to wait until I absolutely can't wait any longer, like a time I have headache and i'm weak and shaky and. grumpy and it basically angry and then i'll usually allow. and ensure."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. So remember cats out. her voice known to um Okay, so it sounds like there is a couple of different elements of this, there is the you engage in some restriction intentionally because you're in is that driven by weight."
17564.0,Patient,And you're.
120.0,Provider,"Trying to lose weight, but then there's also the I can't eat because, for some reason there's a mental block. yeah like that I can't eat it, for whatever reason. But it's not because you're afraid of losing weight, because you said you've lost 20 pounds and that sounds like that's kind of scary you. you're not like yay. kind of thing."
17564.0,Patient,"I mean part of me is like yay I can fit my clothes again. Because like my weight fluctuates so much like a few years ago, I was 202 pounds and I got down to 170 and then I stayed at 177 for like three years. And then I boot right back up to 200 and I lost, you know the 20 pounds, just like last two months and i'm back to like 170 ish and i'm. happy, but I also know it's not fact I still have I guess they'll see the fat in my body that I had, and I think, maybe it's just some muscles or something because i'm also a lot weaker like my legs like. shaved my legs this morning and I had to like literally use my arms to help me like get back up because my. whole week yeah. And it took forever and then like I said after that my pulse was 202 hundred beats per minute. peasy."
120.0,Provider,"yeah that's not good, what is your physician say about that."
17564.0,Patient,"he's very worried I just saw him last Friday, he took a bunch of blood and he's going to measure like my cortisol levels. My MIC my hormone levels to see if that's what's causing it he's like I don't want to put you on a beta Blocker just yet he's like I want to figure out what's going on why. This is happening, but um I think it's like I think i'm just really stressed and, like my body stress because i'm not getting the nutrients I need."
120.0,Provider,And I thought about. They were suggest to feeding.
17564.0,Patient,"No, I I have thought that that would make things a lot easier for me like i've wanted that but I didn't think I was bad enough to ask for that, but like I."
120.0,Provider,"want you to bodies and instead of starvation. Right now, you know, like it's not people sometimes think Oh, you have to be really underweight. But starvation can happen at any weight. You know. I mean i'm not saying that you would have to jump to that, but um it might be better for your body, if you did."
17564.0,Patient,No make things so much easier for me.
120.0,Provider,yeah.
17564.0,Patient,I mean it.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean that's what's so interesting, but it does, it is very childlike because it's like you know if that's what I thought that's why I think it's probably related to your trauma yeah you know but it's it's just interesting that way um. Do you ever engage in using like laxatives or diet pills that kind of stuff."
17564.0,Patient,"So i'm on adderall and. i've been on adderall for years, but since things have gotten worse, I was taking 40 milligrams every day i'm now down to 20 says the word on my heart rate. My doctor said that it's Okay, if I try to get off of it and so i'm slowly very slowly, trying to get see if I can get off of it, because I do worry."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
17564.0,Patient,"i've always thought you know it's going to help me stay skinny is going to help me, you know. bring more. I know, but I also yeah suppresses my appetite to and I some days I think that's amazing but."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah definitely you know messes with you that way for sure. And do you ever engage in like over exercise in order to lose weight.

120.0,Provider,As I think most of.
17564.0,Patient,"Our but it got to the point where like i'm. kind of obsessed like every time I would pass him here I look at myself make sure my stomach was sucked in or um yeah it's and it's gotten so much worse today there's times, where I wouldn't even leave my house, when I was so embarrassed."
120.0,Provider,"wow okay um. And do you, you did already mentioned numbers as far as the scale, but do you do like way obsessively like you weigh yourself every day. like that."

120.0,Provider,"Are you currently trying to lose weight like are you trying to restrict food, so that you will."

17564.0,Patient,yeah i've been researching that.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I think that's probably what you have. It sounds like it, but you are fit is usually not very wrapped up into body image. That so you have a little bit of that going on, too, but it sounds like you know when you when you don't eat a sandwich is not because you're afraid of gaining weight it's because you don't like the way it tastes yeah and that's where the orphan side. Then the kind of you know, typical eating disorders thats related to body image, you know so it's pretty it's different um. Do you have any other like medical complaints that are not related to eating disorder like I mean you mentioned the tiredness and stuff but that's probably related to the eating disorder I bet."
17564.0,Patient,"I mean i've always had a little bit of chronic fatigue ever since um and then it got worse when I got Mano it like the 18 or 19. um and so like things have just yeah there's some days, where like just putting one foot in front of others hard um I sleep a lot, especially like i've always slept so much um I think it's just and i'm always just feel like i'm just."

But then I got really depressed and I couldn't figure out why. And then I had just gotten my adderall fulfilled refilled and I was sitting there like if I just take all these I could be out of my misery. But then I stopped and decided like i'm. Calling my mom and if she answers like i'll tell her what's going on, if not, then i'll do it and luckily She answered, and as soon as I told her was going on, she came over she. packed things for the night and so he helped me move back home, which I lived there for about a year and a half after that. But I don't see like much suicide I just Sometimes I feel like I wish I just didn't exist, like it would be so easy and I just I feel like I just it's too hard to be alive. Right i'll ever do anything about it, but there are times, where i'm just like."

Other little stores in the state will order things through him and they'll ship it over there drive it over there and he's also like a manager when he needs to be like he pretty much does a lot of. stuff."
120.0,Provider,how's your relationship with him.
17564.0,Patient,"it's pretty good um it's it's a little strange right now, because, like i'm just I don't have the energy. To necessarily like keep my house clean and so when he comes home, I think he feels obligated to clean the House and do these things, and I hope you wouldn't. But he hates to see the House in this and my roommate is so busy she's going to school at wall university full time. For accounting and her senior year so she's taking really hard classes, she works two jobs to pay for all this so she's really home so she doesn't really have time to clean also. it's not like I live in a pigsty it's just. Right, like, I mean i'm very big on my room, on the other hand, I have clothes everywhere on the floor here and I."
120.0,Provider,I that's probably that's probably ADHD to.
17564.0,Patient,"Yes, and. I just realized that a few months ago, because I always used to beat myself up about it, like so discussing where you have so many clothes you're like why can't you keep your room clean because i've never been able to keep it clean. And then I was just doing some research. Because I like to know, things about myself, so I was doing some research, I was like oh my gosh that's my add I was like Oh well, i'm not going to be too hard on myself, because I."
120.0,Provider,"it's not one thing you could do this is up for a different conversation, but one thing you know you could do. Is experiment with having one area clean like i'm going to keep this corner clean. And just just so it's very small, you know and then gradually because, after a while you develop something called clutter blindness. Where you become like unaware of it because you're so used to seeing it. And if you start creating like one little corner that you're going to keep clean. Then suddenly it's you become more aware of other clutter it's really an interesting kind of thing i'm trying to get myself, because I struggle with doing that, too, because I have so many animals that make messes over."
17564.0,Patient,Oh yeah I have yeah I have forecasted yeah.
120.0,Provider,yeah so it's hard. yeah um so there's some tension in your relationship with your boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic so is he anybody sitting pretty well right now.
17564.0,Patient,The amazing and so proud of him. Good yeah. he's.
120.0,Provider,A lot of work.
17564.0,Patient,"Right yeah he's he's worked really hard i'm really proud of him and I honestly think this could be a lasting thing for him, he just he went through a divorce and just kind of beat himself up for it, even though it wasn't all his fault and he just kept beating himself up for years afterward. wow and he was self medicate."
120.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
17564.0,Patient,he's kind of healed I think and.
120.0,Provider,"Do you have any you know how many kids do you think it's Okay, and then you said you work at an urgent care. yeah it's a full time or what do you."
17564.0,Patient,"I was full time until about maybe a month or two ago because of my health. I just we work 1213 hour days and it's not easy work, you know there's times, where we see 200 patients a day and it just got to the point where I just can't do."
120.0,Provider,"That anymore, so are you a MED tech or medical system or What do you do."
17564.0,Patient,"Oh, I am i'm a PSI which is like basically a fancy term for the receptionist like I checked and we work with the workers compensation, and so I filed a claim they do all the paperwork for that."
120.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
17564.0,Patient,"yeah it's just a lot of work and it's non stop I mean starting to slow down a little bit now but I went to part time I work two days a week. Sundays and Wednesdays, and because I I need to focus on this, even if I have to file for the F MLA. To. Take my place for me while I work on this, I am not opposed to doing that, like I I just I can't keep doing this like i'm just so weak and tired and."
120.0,Provider,"Right right, you know you definitely need the help for."
17564.0,Patient,Sure yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Okay um. And you said you went to college, did you graduate from college."
17564.0,Patient,"So I went for a year and then I dropped out for eight and then I went back in 2018 and i'm just I had also just dropped out of school to focus on this, too, I would i'm very close to getting my progress, then for dental hygiene. Oh yeah so I can't do hygiene school like this it's really hard and. Right demanding, and so I also need to get this so I can finish my degree there."
120.0,Provider,will be a great a great career he could. Sure yeah. um is your your your best friend your roommate know about what's going on with your.
17564.0,Patient,"unique yes um he just broke up with her boyfriend for years, like a few months ago I moved in and she was really excited to try to help me with this, but she's been really busy. And she like one of the weirdest combinations of food. And there's no way on earth i'm going to eat an onion sandwich or an onion and peanut butter sandwich or warmed up tater tots from the microwave or you know she just eats the weirdest things and so that's not."
120.0,Provider,"yeah it's not. super helpful um. How about financially, do you have what you need right now, do you have food can you can you afford food."
17564.0,Patient,"yeah I have food stamps. Now, maybe like $200 a month, which has been really helpful it's. Good when Michael comes home, you know i've got to feed him to and he said tall skinny kid who eats a lot so okay. Not right he's mad yeah."
120.0,Provider,I see he has he makes money probably where he is and.
17564.0,Patient,he's all i'm gonna have to start paying like a for the thing you put in your car the breathalyzer that goes in the car. After dui which is monthly.
120.0,Provider,Alcohol such a horrible thing.
17564.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,Such a trap for people I wish.
17564.0,Patient,"It legal like, why is it legal."
120.0,Provider,"I know I love push that that would be you know I mean I know they can't really manage it that's why. You can't really do that, but I feel like it does worse things people than podcasts."
17564.0,Patient,"yeah I know I know a guy who. has been drinking like non stop heavy alcohol for years now, and I think he's doing pretty good but his brain is so pickled he doesn't remember, I asked you the question he tells you the same story over and again it's like oh my gosh like I can."
120.0,Provider,Like yeah. yeah so are you on medicaid then or do you get insurance from your.
17564.0,Patient,"Have Molina. But I also just signed up for my work insurance the Providence insurance, which is the blue cross Blue Shield but it doesn't take effect until January 1 and so. Okay, I got to figure all that out to."
120.0,Provider,"January 1 yeah okay. All right, um any legal concerns that you have your legal problems. No okay cool What do you do for fun, do you have any hobbies when you mentioned your cats."
17564.0,Patient,"yeah um. yeah my like my cats i've I haven't really had luck with hobbies like my ad manager so i'm really into it for a few weeks, and then i'm done i'm in right now I don't have the energy, so I basically just hang out with my cats like they're literally my everything."
120.0,Provider,yeah so I get it i'm like that my animals.
17564.0,Patient,I like animals magnetic most people.
120.0,Provider,"So I. I can relate to you on that for for sure absolutely um. Okay. All right. just making sure I have everything I need. So um as far as the I O P program I think it probably could be okay and it's. Monday, Tuesday Thursday. From your Pacific time right yeah so it will be from three to six your time, the only downside, though, is that it's very based on like kind of did you have both, you have the body image stuff. But like you're going to have to be able to eat with the group. Like because we can't sit there and not eat if other people are eating, because it triggers the crap out of everybody. Because we do so one group or one one group. A week we eat together within the nutrition group so like and we usually eat something it's kind of hard like like one group week would be like a donut. or like ice cream something that's a little scarier for most people and so you'd have to be able to kind of do that, and you could do that."
17564.0,Patient,"And I mean I do eat ice cream, sometimes I mean i'm not scared of it. Was not gonna be anything like scary, though."
120.0,Provider,"she'll see well, it will it's it's scary meaning it's usually. Something that a lot of our patients don't want to eat because they want to eat carrots all the time, you know, like it would be it'd be like pizza. That might be an example, or something with pasta, pasta, would be an example, or sometimes it's something from fast food that that would be an example. So it's something that that that kind of stretches your comfort zone, you know. And so I mean so here's my thoughts, as I think you could do it, but i'm a little bit worried just with the severity of your like rigidity around what you can and can't eat that. That it might end up causing almost even more stress because of like you'd be working with one of our dietitians who would be helping you come up with a meal plan and helping you follow it. But I. it's one of those things, because in the end, the group, you know you're with a handful of other people and and they all have different disorders, you know, but most of them are based on like. Our most of them are based on. You know, like i'm afraid of people watching me eat, because I think i'm gross or because i'm too fat or because I, you know I didn't work out enough or you know because I don't have to only eat vegetables, I can't eat. Potato chips. You know, things like that, and so we frequently you know challenge people would kind of food that's considered like junk food."
17564.0,Patient,"Oh, I only. What live off of that like when I do eat food it's usually junk food and."
120.0,Provider,"junk food yeah yeah so so for you it's a little different because, for some of them, although we do have some straight binge eaters they eat a lot of that kind of stuff and. are always afraid they can't stop but they feel so shameful when they do that it just so much shame and so it's kind of an interesting dilemma, but you know one thing we could try to do is see if we could have you meet with a dietitian and like. You know. Not as part of the group, but individually. To see if that if that would help because it is kind of you do have kind of a unique situation that's what i'm just kind of thinking out loud I best support you. Because if you. The other the other recommendation that i'm kind of leaning towards is actually really a higher level of care. Which is like where you go and live there. For like a couple of weeks, and they help you like sit with you, and because, in our program we would say here's a meal plan. And it's going to say like breakfast. eat cereal milk toast with peanut butter. And yogurt and you have to eat that. You know, and then snack would be like a little package of oreos like that. And then lunch would be like. A soup and a grilled cheese something like that, and that you know, and you have to be able to buy those things you have to be able to eat those things, and if every one of those is going to be a panic attack you know. That might be a lot, you know, like I don't know if you'll be able to do that because of that it's almost like it was easy."
17564.0,Patient,yeah and i've noticed it yeah i've never used to notice that it was OCD until like maybe like last couple months like i'm i'm realizing. That yeah.
120.0,Provider,"it's done because it sounds like it's almost like a mental block like. Because like like you would rather eat. ice cream. Because it tastes good then like you know, a sandwich because the bread might be a little bit soggy or something like that. Is that is that a correct statement."
17564.0,Patient,"that's. So true like when I went to Europe after I graduated high school I literally packed like five or six boxes of new terrain bars and then some vegetarian hot dogs that came in, like a can and the. Whole time I was there until I got had pasta and pizza which I could eat, but when you compare it so i'm not going either weird stuff and then in. London, you know it's just I ended up living off and I can't even eat a new to green bar anymore like I."
120.0,Provider,Right yeah.
17564.0,Patient,And that's. yeah and I end up not eating like at parties and I come home and eat well eat before because I don't it's crazy.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean and work more typical kind of eating disorder behavior and I get it everyone's different, but the more typical user behaviors like you know, I have to only eat like. salads and like low calorie everything, but like it sounds like you're you'd rather eat the tire calorie because it tastes better than those lower calorie if it has a weird taste."
17564.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, like that kind of thing like that's that's the bigger fear so it's not a fear of the calories it's a fear of how it can it taste."
17564.0,Patient,"There is some times, where there is a little bit of fear of."
120.0,Provider,"calories yeah that's where that's what the kind of thing is so I mean that's kind of where that that's kind of what our program does that's kind of what they offer. And so I hate to say that you know couldn't try it, but I just I don't know if it's going to be that helpful because you're probably going to feel some pressure. But i'm wondering if they if you're. I mean, because the fact that you've only been really eating ensures consistently for a year there's a good chance that medicaid would pay for impatient, you know that specializes in. You, because then you'd be the people that also understand the same mentality of. I can't eat that because it's yellow or I can eat that big it whatever it is."
17564.0,Patient,pepper in at this time or there's.
120.0,Provider,yeah there's a piece of onion or something like that that's really like almost OCD. So that's kind of my thought. Tell me where you're at what do you think.
17564.0,Patient,"I mean, I was trying to avoid the impatient but i'm not like, I understand that there is. A lot of work that needs to be done, like I there for a while I was like okay i'm going to go to Inpatient care like i'm okay like I had made peace with it and then. My Molina case manager said well let's try outpatient care, first, I was like okay yeah, then I don't need to go to Inpatient like I can try this and then, if it doesn't work then i'll do that but i'm afraid of like getting worse, like if this is not going to help right."
120.0,Provider,"Well that's what i'm worried about worried about too is because you're already having a lot of physical complications. you're already exhausted you're having tacky Cardio which is pretty scary and you don't want your body to to hurt more you know it's already struggling hi. Sorry. i'll see. You are so cool you are you're a good girl, you are it's snowing out there today and so. i'm in utah that's right."
17564.0,Patient,"Okay, I was like."
120.0,Provider,"hey like what yeah it's all a little different. Because one of our therapists lives in Ireland. So we're all she's in a whole different major different times so not just a couple hours different but anyway um so I don't know I mean my thought would be if we tried to an IP. You know the dietitian would kind of set up kind of a meal plan we wouldn't expect 100% from the beginning, because you have a problem you wouldn't be here, if it was easy. yeah you know but, but I do worry, though, at some point you're going to have to you know eat crackers you're going to have to eat, whatever it is that rose really scary to you. And it's not going to be perfect, you know you're gonna have to eat it from a place that made me didn't cook it there you're like a different brand. And you know, and if that if that alone kind of gets you panicky already i'm a little worried that you. Probably would need a higher level of care and then but but but, once you get into a better rhythm, we would be a step down where you could discharge to us, and then we can keep you going and help support you in that process. Because in an impatient they you know, especially one that is trauma focused that's why they will be ideal, as if there's something that does trauma focused and are fed that could help you because I would be willing to bet money that a lot of this is driven by trauma."
17564.0,Patient,Oh yeah my therapist says the same thing and. Like it just.
120.0,Provider,makes sense yep.
17564.0,Patient,"I don't think there's any other thing that really could have caused it, especially since it started, since I was like for him when I went."
120.0,Provider,Right yeah.
17564.0,Patient,yeah It makes sense.
120.0,Provider,"Well, I was wondering, I mean I this might this might be to I don't want to pushing too much, I mean but was there any like like oral sex type of abuse okay that that was what I was wondering, that if. That could because that definitely could be related. And if you went to a trauma facility. They can do things like em Dr which is helping your brain we process things."
17564.0,Patient,My therapist is finishing up the.
120.0,Provider,"Training for that we should. yeah yeah. You know, but if you went to a facility that did that did that you probably get the most bang, for your buck That way, you probably would get the most. support and make the most progress there a lot quicker. You know, because in our program like one week you might be like hey this week my goal is to eat some cheetos or whatever, and it takes a whole week to get you to eat one thing of cheetos it's going to be really hard to make much progress. yeah vs in a treatment Center where they kind of have a lot more structure. And you have like trauma based therapies like em Dr whatever you probably it would be a lot more concentrated, it would be hard, but you would probably do quite well in it."
17564.0,Patient,that's that's what i'm thinking and i've tried everything I can.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean that's kind of my that's what my guts telling me, and I mean I would love to have you, you seem like a wonderful person and I love your nature, I love your. I love that you're resilient I think you're amazing person, and you know but and it's i'm trying to be hundred percent honest with you."
17564.0,Patient,And I appreciate that I really do. owe. me communicate with my end.
120.0,Provider,"yeah so what we'll do is i'll get back to my. Our intake people i'll let them know that I would recommend an impatient that's focused on our food and trauma trauma work. And that and then that once they kind of get that what your case manager gets That, then, then they will look and see what what they can what they are contracted with. With Melinda gates that that they could do that. And then we happy to serve you for it and step down where it would be I like to think of it as. I think it is like learning to swim. You know. But you're on the you're on the sidelines and like went out to the water but you're like you won't and no one can drag you. You know, but. it's hard to learn to swim if you don't leave the side. And, but at an impatient they kind of take you to the deep end but there with you in the deep end. yeah they help you learn to swim and then, when you discharge that we help you keep swimming. yeah the word swim, we have to keep swimming. Okay, that makes sense."
17564.0,Patient,yeah well okay. I will visible yeah. I have to start filling out the SLA paperwork.
120.0,Provider,I think that would be your best bet for your time and your financial situation.
17564.0,Patient,Okay well so.
120.0,Provider,"But keep, if nothing else, keep trucking the insured, because your body needs it desperately."
17564.0,Patient,I yeah I yeah and I don't plan on getting rid of that because that's basically my lifeline.
120.0,Provider,"yeah you need it, I mean you could consider to I mean like I know that's hard but there's a lot other there's other. mean entries are perfect, but they are designed to be supplemental to to other nutrition."
17564.0,Patient,Now they're not designed to replace it. meant for long term.
120.0,Provider,"Yes, yep and so. But if you need to feeding, I mean there's people who only can ever have to feed and but they have different formulas that had everything else in there, so but, but those are nasty you don't want to drink those."
17564.0,Patient,yeah you didn't want to have to Orly ingest it you'd want to have a team.
120.0,Provider,"yeah and it's not a bad thing it just is what it is, you know where you're at I see you. The dog is like buying a music I know they know you saw the snow we're going to play it. Ah prairie dogs okay well it's been a pleasure getting to know you and. I wish you the best of luck and i'll let them know kind of what we talked about, and hopefully we'll be able to come up with a better plan for you."
17564.0,Patient,hey Thank you so much.
120.0,Provider,"you're welcome. night. All right, good night see ya bye. Alright, so diagnosis is our food and then also put. A. Well, our food is probably she does have symptoms of the other, but I think our food is made one she also might have asked fed also the other specified in disorder and then. anxiety. generalized anxiety disorder major depressive disorder. with severe on that, when I was looking at her paperwork at A to Z she tested high on that and probable OCD. And ADHD. And then medications we mentioned wellbutrin and adderall. And our recommendation is going to be higher level of care that focuses on our food and trauma but we'd be happy to help her in as a step down. service if if that. comes to be that way, so all right, thank you."
