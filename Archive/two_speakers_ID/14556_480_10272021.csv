14556.0,Patient,hi.
480.0,Provider,How are you.
14556.0,Patient,"One day i'm gonna get it right, Christine i'm gonna be there at nine o'clock you watch."
480.0,Provider,I watch I watch it i'm ready.
14556.0,Patient,i'm so pathetic and I get up early at getting the I set it all up in it don't work that's it.
480.0,Provider,Work What do you mean it doesn't work.
14556.0,Patient,"I know i'd go at it don't go to you, it doesn't get me to the person is supposed to get to you so i'm going to talk to them today, like because I have so many of these ones that say just launch and that's. I got chair and all figured out like I got group all figured out, but the one that. gets them to check me in because then cook then i'll check I don't remember them checking me into group."
480.0,Provider,"No, I do attendance for group and just."
14556.0,Patient,"So for this one, I had to figure out like okay so which one is it that you know, and then I go over there, she said, oh no it's not nice to go over there and then. That so anyway, with That being said, so I always get really organized before I see because I send you 25 emails and I figured you may or may not get to them, so I."
480.0,Provider,"know I always read them and I got to all of them, I read all of them. um so yeah you you're organized, so you go."
14556.0,Patient,"Okay, so that. I think kind of the problem, maybe the overall issue with me is even though I have a goal board, and I have it all. written down. And, but i'm. really feel like my whole life, the biggest problem is i've never had a support system does that make any sense, you can you connect with that."
480.0,Provider,Absolutely.
14556.0,Patient,"So the biggest things is are used to see my friends like we all compete and let's just use beauty pageants we'd all compete and beauty pageants. All my friends had these radical moms that push them to buy the dresses the makeup would you talk to the judges the pay do anything really and my friends, one I mean they won they broke through and they want. But i'd always be the one that bought all my clothes, the one that you know didn't you know didn't really I didn't understand the whole pageant system as my sister told me this is where you'd be great at you know. And you know I went to beauty school and charm school I paid for everything I put the modeling school I paid for everything, so I always paid for everything. And I always did it on my own and the backlash typically came from my mom saying you're not going to make it you're too dark you know they got to pick lights, if you were light skin, like me, that would work they looking for people to look like because i'm light skin. Which which, in her world that was the truth. Right so, but my friends, no matter what they look like, no matter what they look like they had a parent they had that mother they're like the girl that new in California her mother her mother. And everybody had a mother like that her mother was determined that her daughter was going to have this practice, even a girl wasn't that good look she didn't really have that much talent, but she was discounts for you, because she had that system behind her. And I saw that, with all of the girls who were competing with me i'd always compete, even though I was always no money didn't understand the system. You know what I always get myself on the top group I could always well I get to the top five was number three you know you know what i'm saying I can always get there, but I couldn't win because I didn't know the system if that makes any sense."
480.0,Provider,"So a lot of sense and it's really impressive that you would still make it that far, not having any of the support system or knowing what you're getting yourself into."
14556.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah whatever, and so it just just that I kept doing things you. See like with the charm school I have begged my mother put me through charms go what am I other friends Delta, who was dark like me. was the one that was occurring to me, she brought her book to school and show it to me why can't you do it if I if i'm doing it i'm doing it. i'm dark, like you, she was dark or maybe darker than me and she was showing me her pictures and blah blah blah tell me about the school, she said, you should go, she would always tell me that. And I went home and told my mom look she's dark and she's the know your long story short, that delta was able to move. up into those areas because she had a support system so that's what I surmised since i've been talking to you that over the years and, of course, in my business, I had no support system at all, no lead no mentor nobody that I could lean on in typically. it's hard to even. If it's just hard to even believe that I got it up and going in. yeah."
480.0,Provider,You know.
14556.0,Patient,"You know, I was recognized around the world, is one of the top agents in the business in. it's just hard to believe it and it's like and I came out of it, and you know just. heard Chris paul's brother he's an agent he's a sports agent and I heard him talking he's going to do a documentary. And I heard him talking to the other night and I just started laughing and I thought, all I heard the way that what was going on at the oh that's only the tip of the iceberg brother, this is just the you just got a little bit. But I just so. that's where I need to start it's like I just don't have that foundation so. How do I deal with the fear of having failed every time I think of an idea I think it's something that um you know, I think, because right now there's all this money kind of floating around in in California, the Olympics is coming the super bowl is coming in a couple of months. everybody's there's all this money, if you will, I don't believe in free. But everything comes up, it says Oh, you have to be you have to have a child. Everything and I often think what the hell happens to people like me that don't have children, I made a conscious effort Why am I, being punished because I made a conscious effort not to have time I knew I couldn't take care of and so. I think OK OK, I got an idea, but then, when I think I got an ideal say beverly another one of your bright ideas, because over the years, I had all these bright ideas they did come to fruition, but not in the success that I wanted."
480.0,Provider,"Right. Although I think I already have. So part of the voice, though, that keeps you. doubting yourself every time you do have an idea is probably conditioned from your mom and the way she responded every time you said, I want to do this, I want to do this, she always had a reason why it wouldn't work out or it would fail. So I think that's the part that you have to be mindful of the fact that. Every time you think of something that that doubting voice is not coming from you that's conditioned from your mom so that's not necessarily your own intuition saying no this is going to fail this isn't worth it. And so that's where you have to recognize that Okay, because of how I grew up and because of how. unsupportive my mom was that's where that voice is coming from, and I don't need to listen to that voice every time. Like yes, I do understand that you can't chase every single idea, you have that's not practical either, but at the same time, if you had grown up with a big support system, then. Every time you had a good idea, instead of constantly doubting yourself, there would be a different inner dialogue in your head. You know what I mean so that's trauma related the fact that you every time you have an idea you think you're going to fail, I think that is more of a reflection of your mom not necessarily you and your own intuition or mindset does that make sense."
14556.0,Patient,"I think it's probably mine, I have to take ownership of it now, maybe my mom fantasy, but it either I kept bordering it. You know I kept doing things. Like that that's My problem is that. out do things out when I say, I want to do something i'll go do things that other people would never do they would never do those things. i'll go do those things starting a talent agency like that it I would never tell anybody to do this crazy. And I remember when I got to sag and I had like five national commercials I didn't know what sag was. And they said. it's impossible, I thought, what is wrong with these people. They talking about impossible. And nothing impossible and the guy told me he said well i've done this 25 years. i've never heard this and I thought, why don't I don't I don't know what y'all what kind of said y'all got I had no sense of anything. I would never tell anybody to put themselves under that kind of pressure I would never. So I don't know if I can still say that my mom be a plant, the seed, but obviously now i'm nurturing you see."
480.0,Provider,"Right yeah and that's true and that's what happens whenever we have those kinds of remember a couple weeks ago we talked about that idea of core identity and how it gets shaped by your environment and the people around. You that's that's basically the concept we're talking about here is, you have this core identity that was shaped by your upbringing and. Your mom and your grandma and the other people are identity in adulthood, so that is something that you have the power. to actively change. And I think what i'm hearing from you is the struggle balancing what is a legitimate good, practical idea that I should be going after versus what is this part of me that's just trying to prove to everyone who said I couldn't do it that I can do it is that kind of where."
14556.0,Patient,"that's that's one thing that I got from you last week that I don't have that ability to prove to people that I can do things okay I don't have that. That that sense of i'll show you, it can be done or i've never had that I just. I just needed to get out of where I was Christine I was taking my way out of a hole out of a out of a family didn't didn't have an education people laugh about education. I was the first like I said to get an a post high school education and most of the high school education in our family had just been bestowed if you will. Those kids have been moved around not educated properly and they were 12th graders and the country was changing so they just gave him the foam and got them out. There were black and they were never going to go anywhere anyway. So I actually went to these core schools and learned and learned you see what i'm saying I mean it, you know I didn't get you know I got into the Donna said you get into junior honor society first, but those that's because you learn, and you can take a test and show that you've learned. Right, so we hadn't had that and so, when I was going to college. I was just trying to change the way we work, I didn't want to have a baby by myself, I didn't want to give my baby away. I didn't want to live with a man I didn't like some people grow up and families with a manner cheaters the men were probably cheaters too, but the ones I saw that was changes were when they were. Using my fam, be it was like oh my husband came home from the military and I was pregnant with somebody else's baby. I mean it was that kind of stuff with women. So I knew air I remember saying when here what my aunt Esther that never have a child, with a man I didn't know I didn't like we didn't care for me for just based on economics. or a spade, with that all my life I was always you know men men tried hustle me with the talker have a baby, I thought I baby, no, no, no. laughs stick of dynamite before I take a baby. yeah I know what it takes to raise the baby I got that, no, no, no, and so, and people who sat just give my children to the grandparents, I thought, no, no. yeah I was no, no, no i've never saw it. So with that you know it's it's bloated and it's been all my life, trying to get my wet and now I feel like all that work, and here I am still in the same place."
480.0,Provider,"But you're not in the same place it's so what's different is you have an education, you have a sense of self you're not living in dysfunction anymore so financially you're still struggling, but that doesn't mean you're in the same place, you were when you were a child. doesn't feel the same, though."
14556.0,Patient,"I gotta say it feels very isolating. And I look at myself I think again, how does happen, like all that work and all those. sorted and I remember this, too, I just wanted to share this with you, I wrote it down every time I won something. or accomplish something in the. Business I never had time to. enjoy it was just okay that's then i'll go to the next. Okay that's not then it goes to the next. I never had time to say. After three years. Of all that work and talk to that woman and all that humiliation you actually went in here and got that done you got that you know you know here was. The media came to me and said how are you doing this people they. This can't be done, you know in this area, the area that I was operating out of time that it couldn't be done, and so the story was it couldn't be done and i'm saying well obviously could be done it's just. Yet do all these things, but in that doing all those things, it was a paid properly for it. And that was in the industry hold your money. You can you can only charge 10% well, if I can only charge 10% I should only be doing 10% the industry should be easy in that work 10% is easy, instead of making you do 70% to get 10%."
480.0,Provider,yeah so.
14556.0,Patient,"If 10% is. 10% of 700,000 or 7 million or 77 million that's a that's a deal Okay, but it's 10% is 10% of 7770 $700 or $70."
480.0,Provider,Somewhere in the.
14556.0,Patient,magazine is $100 remember. You cover that $100 to a cover of a magazine. And that's it yes.
480.0,Provider,that's unbelievable.
14556.0,Patient,"yeah the $10,000 and all that you here are super models."
480.0,Provider,wow.
14556.0,Patient,That is volumes. Are in exchange for this or that to some of them are no money but yeah that the cover of the magazine layouts could be 100 or 300 so even at 20% I only earned $20.
480.0,Provider,She.
14556.0,Patient,"So I would send you around the world that you know to New York, where they were shooting it at, and I think my whole I may have made around $60 in it wasn't it was that's net international work to be on the cover or to be in that magazine. Right once you get girls in magazines it stopped it changed the game for me, because then the editors will call me i'll take that girl i'll take that girl. It but the earnings was and I kept thinking that well if I did this, then that would happen if I did, that and it just. So now i'm here, I had this idea just run with me, I had this idea. They don't have this passion for homeless i've been down that road homeless in California so homeless with their their. Anyway, um and there's this House that that used to be a house for mentally. mentally challenged and the guy let it run down and he had some weird old man and then, finally, they shut it down but it's a big house and. When they shut it down, I thought the city needs to buy this House redo it and and put the put homeless people who are sleeping on the street in that house. And I went to city council, I went to this meeting I with it and they just blew me off with somebody else will do it, you know the black men were like it should be me, you know you can't one black I did I took their ideal to about housing. To his his his company is more he bought it himself and in yeah so obviously I can't trust you know so um. But it didn't work, I mean i'm sure he just kept it the way it was the way I was going to do it would have been a totally different thing, but still he had the idea and bought it himself. So i've been looking at that house it's been several years I got realtors I even called production companies and said, if I could get it with you know, would you be would you flip it for me so it's just in their homes sequin there. But then I got so and, believe me, I was homeless myself so but, but I just always believe that. I see all these people come from all these different countries and they're able to come here and get all this money and do all these things like either I must I couldn't get. A nickel out of California even get 100 billion dollars out of California and he's leaving now he doesn't want to be here because he didn't like California anymore. Look at all that money we gave you a yeah look look yeah and now he's going to get up out of here move his entire organization to Texas, where he's going to get even more money, so he made $35 million, the other day 35 billion with 35 million in."
480.0,Provider,One day.
14556.0,Patient,One day.
480.0,Provider,that's insane.
14556.0,Patient,"yeah he sold some of his fleet to hurts so now, you can get a tesla when you for your rental cars, he so some of that into think it was 35,000,000,030 $5,035,000,000 profit in one day here so."
480.0,Provider,that's just unveiled believable.
14556.0,Patient,"Now it's not this the way the system works it's just the way the system works and and I just feel like. So I come up with these ideas like and I had the plan, I went to the City Council the guy wouldn't see he's so easy you just so lazy i'm in. And, and I went to groups, the who knew him and said I can get you in the car and then he sent a girl out to see me who was an intern. And a whole time she was just writing now all these ideas she said, we can really use that I thought, oh no this, this is not i'm not here to give you things to us. Right and I thought, like a camp with this, but if you don't go through him because his in his area then. it's it's hard to get anything to prove but he that House would sit down there with the blackness land on the street and he's paying for a paycheck every other week just because me on."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"And if I say anything about it, then i'm a bad black woman for saying something bad about a black man, obviously, so you don't do that um. So those it again that might be one of those pie in the sky like a run at a talent agency with a pie in the sky."
480.0,Provider,"So do you still is, that is, that still something you're trying to get going, is this House for homeless people."
14556.0,Patient,"it's always in my head and I drive by the House all the time and I drove by the other day and I stopped and looked at it. And I thought, why is this House boarded up like this, when people are sleeping on the street it drives me NUTS it drives me nuts and it's like why why why can't the city figure it out. If he's in that area and that area is just so rundown and bad and what typically happens with black people is. Some other ordinance race organization will come in and buy it and then they'll say oh justification is gentrification well I know it's gentrification, but it was sitting there like that, on the market for years and years, why weren't we instead of like they were in in Detroit. They would go burn all the houses down because they were sitting idle the old black people would do in a black community, they would all come together and put like pennies and stuff and money, all together, and they were buy houses in there that way they kept the wealth. Even back then. yeah but we go in and burn down house or like that that house is sitting there, why not buy that House when the owner. Remember, they used to take our houses that were like that they just take it like they just gave back burt's beach to those that black family down there they take it in eminent domain so that's what they would do to us, they would take it in eminent domain."
480.0,Provider,So we're New York or California. cowboy oh.
14556.0,Patient,"wow they would just take it. it's like with that beach down there Manhattan beach I don't know if you've ever heard of Manhattan beach fabulous place used to be a black resort these black people owned it, it was very successful in the city took it by eminent domain. And then wouldn't allow them to buy any more property. And so, their family came together and sued the city and said it was never yours, it was successful already give it back to us, and then the Mayor of the city came in and said it was never ours it's not like it was ours. And right back and then the governor came in and said. He would overrule any lawsuit he said because it wasn't ever yours not like they've taken it back on you, it was theirs, so they gave it back to them in two years, the whole thing will be done in, and it goes back to the family members of those people."
480.0,Provider,wow.
14556.0,Patient,"yeah so it was never does it's not like you know people down and a half man half beach or this very wealthy. inferior cookies. That is our beach it's not your beach, it was never yours. Okay, they took it by eminent. domain and it wasn't like they had to take it wasn't like because they were running a row through there, or you know because that's The excuse easy to use that you know they're running."
480.0,Provider,some kind of local mode yeah they have to do it yeah exactly.
14556.0,Patient,"But this wasn't that case and they were able to prove that so anyway so that's so a lot of the houses and stuff do you see sitting i'm thinking why aren't you taking these houses that are sitting here that are dilapidated even these businesses. Right build it and what I found when I did all that research as I would go there in the Koreans would come in buy it all up and these. These people from the Middle East will come in and they come in, so when I look at the black Community I always say how much of this is really owned by the black community. Very little."
480.0,Provider,"Because very, very little."
14556.0,Patient,So. wow how do I. I don't know I don't know how i'm in my life that's the problem.
480.0,Provider,"Well okay so here's something that i'm wondering how many of your goals currently are big scale like this, like. Sony issue in La that's a pretty big. task to take on for one person."
14556.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well, so my goals glad you asked it to. To get my get unemployment back on track, allowing me to get through the holidays, at least, without so much that just have food on the table, because now they're saying, are you read my email."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, I have questions about that email, though, so they made you apply in March, when you still had a job and that's why they're saying now, this was invalid. That makes no sense."
14556.0,Patient,"whatsoever makes no and I kept telling her. I said wait a minute, this was may when I had lost that when my other job hit ended, and I said oh i'm not supposed to be replying for March, because marches the month is which I was working and. I know you have to you have to plan for that, why would, I have to. Wait on us just start applying for now for me."
480.0,Provider,Right.
14556.0,Patient,"You know you have to do you have to know and then she she said we're not gonna pay you one more penny until you apply. I had no money I fly in the question on air did you work out that Well, yes I work she said you weren't work, I guess, I am so I called my friend and told her, she said, whatever you do don't spend that money because they're going to come at you and say you you. That you that you sign that and you knew what you were doing your unconscious mind they're gonna blame you so. I just tell you."
480.0,Provider,My question is obviously the worker at the State Department knows that that's not how it works So is there a garden. is going on.
14556.0,Patient,"They don't that's a part of it, they don't know how it works. that's half of the problem and only yesterday this. Since March remember how much. It the same a since May, when I started May, June, July August September, October so it's now eight months later, is I didn't apply anymore, because I kept saying this is gonna. you're gonna say fraud y'all gonna say so I can argue with them, finally I got to somebody who understood the system and said. Oh, I see so you're not applying because you're scared you're going to be obese and you are right, because you are overpaid and you put it on there that you're not working, when you're working but. I sent in a new claim form that showed them that I was working and I attached all the stuff on the so this and I said I don't think I should be applying because I think I got this wrong. Right, so they they never said anything I thought, but they will catch it and, once they do catch it then it's fraud and you get so I yesterday he said just send the money back, and I had set aside, so I just sent it back and. I sent it over I sent it certified so because they'll say they never got it. So I sent certified I put all my information on it, so they can say oh Abu we didn't know where to put it, we didn't know what was going on, because that's another thing does they don't know nothing they don't know nothing."
480.0,Provider,wow.
14556.0,Patient,"And I saw that audit the other day and that lady getting on him at that audit, I thought. Okay, so i'm not crazy."
480.0,Provider,you're not crazy and you're not the only.
14556.0,Patient,"one. at three calls in one day that lady was on the acid I kept telling that governance office something's wrong that you have to call from eight in the morning to eight at night, and you don't get nobody all day long something's wrong with that. doing a NASA this one on and on, so now hopefully he told me he and then also in the notes the guy said well Another reason is is wrong is because the girl who updated your file in she went through it, she put in the wrong date so therefore is wrong. I talked to. I can't even imagine the number of people, because the last good girl before I talked to the girl before I talked to says. Oh, she said you don't have enough, you have earned enough, I thought, no, no, no, no, no let's go through this together, this is enough. So she said okay i'm putting in there there's enough and i'ma put it into numbers she never put it in there, because he told me, is not here she never put it in here."
480.0,Provider,Because gosh.
14556.0,Patient,"This is, this is, this is it."
480.0,Provider,"No wonder that's a lot of trauma to deal with on a daily basis, people lying and people not doing their jobs and then you're."
14556.0,Patient,going.
480.0,Provider,To do the job.
14556.0,Patient,"They don't know how to do the job and that stresses me out and. telling them. I don't know how to do the job, you know how to do to get you need to tell me how to do it. So that's number one number two. I want to move. And I my support system again i'm talking it's not there. Yet i've found that they tell you that if you want to move, you have to go find the place yourself, yet the godfather places stuff they'll help you pay with you to find a place for stuff. So I know we're kind of place, I want to live in, but the way the system is work if you're black, you have to live in the lowest income areas so that's what they support you in if you try to move anywhere else they can't help. It."
480.0,Provider,"Is it 2021, and this is still how the system."
14556.0,Patient,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, how is this. And they think they're so stupid they think that when you don't understand and I was going on, and I said, if I ever hear anything has happened to a child, and anyone that you guys were involved you're going down. I said, if this is the system that children are in it and have to think to myself, like, I said to myself when I was homeless, I thought, if I didn't have an education. yeah never gotten out of that."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"Never i'm telling it was the system kept me in the action have been out of that I could have been added it and, finally, I just push and shove, the last day they stress me so bad, I was moving I had to stop the move and go to the hospital and check in okay that's how bad off, I was. that's how they had. I thought you're gonna date I kept on trying to kill me that's what you're trying to try to kill him that's how bad the system is it is set up to keep you in bondage that's the way it works i'm sorry. So I go to."
480.0,Provider,"This is just California, or is this."
14556.0,Patient,"I don't know i've never had it anywhere else, this has been my nightmare here. So that's My big thing I have no support system they just want to keep me here at this place and, like the the people were. The social workers to constantly change, you know to constantly change like mine change what three four weeks ago, three weeks nobody's come in system, you know. Oh we're hiring people okay why wouldn't you if, when she gave you a notice. There should be if you're going to change like when I was in human resource in jobs, like that, if they were going to change unless they just quit on me if that manager even had a hint that he was going to lose people he had to get to me right away, so I could get requisition started. to hire somebody else. I mean you just don't believe it. yeah human beings for months and years and years on attendance it's just shocking that they do it and I."
480.0,Provider,Know shocking to me.
14556.0,Patient,"And I think it what would happen if it was children. Because children that's the problem, it is children and some sure you always hear like them being killed all time California, they killed, like the killer gamble's. out here is to kill my out it's just it's just so nasty the way to kill children, and I think, because the way the system is and they won't change it. So the last one, is that. I get a job. i've had tons of interviews so now, I just have to accept any job, I guess, no. No don't worry about money, just anything which keeps me stuck in the same place, I probably have at least 20 resumes waiting to be reviewed, because you know. In details you buy even catch indeed in stuff all the time, like indeed i'll take a test right they'll tell you that the important requires the test right and then also to take all these tests send it over to the employer they'll send me a notice saying you haven't taken all the test."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"There you go I just took all your tasks and then indeed will tell me later on, not only did took all those tested above proficient okay."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so why am I not getting hired anywhere."
14556.0,Patient,"Right great and then, when I interview with Indeed I interviewed so well with him, it just sounds so good, and then it was like no not you okay. So I have all these customer service jobs so indeed and career builders i've got at least 20 resumes waiting to be waiting for responses, right now, whether they are interested in hiring me or what. So those are my top three goals. and obviously I don't have a support. team around me. Other things that I thought about was a podcast but I don't want to take on anything that I don't have guaranteed income. So that's a good thing to housing for homeless great, but I can't take on anything that is not. doesn't have guaranteed income. So, so the question is where do I go from here."
480.0,Provider,"that's a big question. And it sounds like here's, the problem is, I know you know this, but me hearing all of this, and I can imagine why you feel so stuck because it seems like it's just dead end after dead end after dead. Because like you said, if you just take any job then you're stuck in a job that you don't love that might not even be enough money so you're not going to get out of your situation with that, but you can't just not take a job that's offered because you don't have a job right now. So Okay, what about support systems, you have do you have any friends that are reliable, that you talk to like I feel like that might be the starting point is let's try to build some sort of support system."
14556.0,Patient,"I go my one friend that we've been for a long time she is just I think it might be cultural with her and she just doesn't connect like that she's not that girl that. She just I think it's cultural because she's Iranian think. And she just doesn't connect like that that's not how she thinks. she's in law school right now to. she's always in some kind of school she's wonderful she got every degree under the book, I mean she. she's just. enjoy when we when we're together, we have a great time but we may go six months. Eight months without talking it's like in. it's just really weird, but when we meet we always have a good time and we're always good friends, and then we spend four hours to catch up on all the time that we have. But that's really it I don't in my family we're just going to keep them where they are away yeah. keep them here and i'm not dating anybody in I can't say that that's the I mean I would love to be dating but It just seems like I. Just don't meet I don't know, like my best friend, there was, we have a lot in common, as far as like we both love sports. And we both have very political minds, but he's more he's more right wing and i'm more in the middle neutralized. and he's a he He really has the ability to earn because he's he's a rocket scientist, so people will remember that remember back in the day when we say we don't have to be a rocket science."
480.0,Provider,"And then he wasn't he actually is. A rocket scientist, but I am yeah, but I am I could say he would say that so often, it was."
14556.0,Patient,"funny we're in a in a group of people and they kept talking about you don't have to be as smart as a rocket scientist and we kept looking at each other. And he said, but I have a rocket scientist and everybody just laughed at that that was so funny First they thought it was a joke, and then it was like No, I am a rocket science so. He moved down there to you know kick pineapple we're all the rock side. So, but. he's just there's other stuff with him he's know so. So."
480.0,Provider,"dating for you feels too vulnerable at the moment just because of the types of people you've dated in the past. Yes, yeah that makes sense. Which is all like with any relationship, not just dating but friendships and stuff. Is you've been burned so many times it's really hard to trust people and it's really hard to put yourself out there."
14556.0,Patient,Right that's.
480.0,Provider,Another level. Right yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"And I keep it, you know when I meet people were taking guys i'm a sports person so most women are not sports women, I mean they just don't."
480.0,Provider,Not like me craziness oh yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"they're not like that, I mean it's like let's go to the game let's not go to the game. So, and I can go to any sports I grew up my dad and we went to everything, so I can go to any sport and talk sports and have a great time and laugh, and that you know, make the guys, you know I go with the going in and. You know, we used to go with my nephew when he played for when he was playing big he's big time baller and Polish. me and my friend, we would go to game, and we were we had tons of guys and they were like wow man with you it's just because we could we talk all the sports yes guys get in our ear and they. got done so, when we because we knew all about sports. So that's my thing online is that i'm always talking to athletes um last year with the lakers you know I had like this relationship on Twitter, with all the lakers. In the people, the people who surround the lakers and we know you ain't got you ain't going Oh, oh no he not want to when he going to be key oh."
480.0,Provider,My gosh that's hilarious.
14556.0,Patient,"Well, oh my God I would I would tweet out these things, it would just I would laugh my head off, but I don't know the lakers they're not my friends. Right, you know what I mean those Those are just those people, and this year I thought. it's a little bit much better, you need to get focused, and so I said unfollow that but I still watch every game, and you know, and the same thing with football and the same thing with in any sport and you know."
480.0,Provider,Have you ever. Have you ever thought about getting a job in some sort of sporting.
14556.0,Patient,"I can't find my way in there, like I been hired at the stadium here. And then I was hired because of the pandemic. They kept pushing it back push back push back and then by the time I was hired they had had a big breakout a covert over there and I thought, oh no, no, no, no, no. i'm like well you better to do."
480.0,Provider,It was just working at the stadium.
14556.0,Patient,"It was just working there like it. Working ticket. stuff it was there I was going to be a manager, but that means like a supervisor but. It wasn't so I don't know. If that's the reason why I wanted to go to professional and have my resume written. To really position me properly if that makes sense to you."
480.0,Provider,It makes sense it's just. I guess I don't have enough experience with that to me it would seem like not worth the time and money to have someone to rewrite your resume because you're very educated and you know what you're doing.
14556.0,Patient,"So, but it's not it's not getting me to the level that I need to be it like the. way I have it and i'm changing it and doing. I need somebody to sit down and like like you said, like another person. To say hey this, this is what gets you into. You know i've seen thousands of corporate. resumes myself when I was working in human resource and that's half of my problem i've done every job. Never my problem like I worked in human resources, I worked in banking I worked in this and that you know so."
480.0,Provider,Do you ever change your resume based on what job you're applying for. Everyone.
14556.0,Patient,"yeah everyone is exhausting. This weekend I plan for this digital something company which is medicine and I changed it every time for every job. I mean. I thought I would get a call or something they say they still reviewing applications and they have so many I even apply for Christmas jobs at Christmas, you know basis, because when I. When I did an in person, though they they would look at my resume and say thank you for coming will call you we need you. And then that's why i've worked with to take everything off take everything off I. So he said don't put your education on it just say I said then i'm a black get an educated person that that may work on live, you have black we move it had the reverse she's an educated that's why we are, as you don't know nothing so it's just. I just don't know like how to get out of it."
480.0,Provider,yeah i'm I can understand why I wish I had an answer it's just baffling to me like I don't understand how somebody with your intelligence your experiences having such a hard time finding a job.
14556.0,Patient,"It doesn't it does all these jobs and I don't know and that, but I still think that it's somehow intimidating like what my last job. And my friend, my friend, told me this is another therapist told me this she said, your biggest problem is that you're able to see the big picture of things you can go on a place. Size it up and say here's what we need to do right here she said Bradley that's intimidating and you've got to. really not do that, you got it and I used to tell my boyfriend that to the rocket scientist he had also the problems that his job like they was in a with the rubik's cube in. That stupid of you, but cool toy, and then they he was they were in a meeting, and it was like who can solve this you know, and nobody could solve and he walked right in the meeting and said oh just turn it this way and. And I said don't do it, and he used to do that all the time, like they will be talking about the rocket and now the rocket gets upon the ground and the disposition of energy. And he was going into oh no here's why crafts and this is why you need to and that say you cannot do that your boss is supposed to be the smartest person in the room, you walk right in there after he told people he can't figure it out and you figure it out. You know, we have those conversations it really worked for him to so. My therapist at that time said, you need to think of that yourself like."
480.0,Provider,don't you can't hardest person yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"Right you can't have the answer you can't know that you have to. And so all your life use you spend learning to have this knowledge and then you need to dumb yourself down and. You can't hurt anybody else's feelings, when I was in with the that the agents in Hollywood I could never talk. The way they've had it was i'd have to submit my questions to the director, but the white people could talk to men in the white people gets all I had to submit to her is she had this. asked a question in 10 years of being in there, I never could talk, but I had to pay, I had to pay those dues."
480.0,Provider,To be and what year these weren't this was 19 or 2000s.
14556.0,Patient,Thousands.
480.0,Provider,What.
14556.0,Patient,"i'm telling you there was no blacks in there, there was no blacks there was no."
480.0,Provider,into the housing.
14556.0,Patient,"That last year that I was there. Another black person came in, there was this there was another there was two other blacks they came in. It was two new blacks and I was pressuring them, remember, I was pressuring them about there being no blacks so, then what they did is they took this new guy who came in and put him in the position that I was pressuring them."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
14556.0,Patient,"So it helped him at least because he didn't know it obviously I never talked to him and he knew if I talked to him, he would just blow me off, and say. You know. i'm new and look I did all this job so he didn't know how much I had been after them, he didn't know that he didn't know that. There had been an investigation he didn't know any of that and I knew that if I said anything to him, he was just Oh, a black moon, you know that blackman all bitches blackman with all this and he would just terrorize me so verbally terrorized me, so I didn't say anything. wow old time in that 10 years that I would say, I never asked the question out loud."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. This is mind."
14556.0,Patient,"blowing to me, I know I went to every meeting. I never missed a meeting to the very end, when I was just done when I was just done, I thought I can't make you."
480.0,Provider,know how you made it 10 years. That strength right there oh my.
14556.0,Patient,"God is mental illness it's a form of mental illness, you get so traumatized by the world that you live in in all the work that you do, and nothing comes back that. I really think is the form of mental illness to. To work that hard for something and nothing ever to come back from it is this a form of mental illness."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"People say it's crazy remember to do the same thing expecting a different result they say it's crazy, so I call it the former loans. So with that maybe you have maybe you have to think about it, to the week like I need to solve I need to you know i'm doing other stuff in but i'm not solving my own problem."
480.0,Provider,"But what OK, so the problem, we want to some folks, though, is out of your control that's, the problem is like. This. In my mind you're doing everything that you're that you can do everything we talked a lot about like what's in your control versus what's out of control. you're taking all the necessary action to do things better in your control in order to change your situation so at this point it's like what else, are you going to do. Because you're already doing everything."
14556.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"I mean is that kind of what you struggle with on a daily basis is like what else can I be doing right now, because i'm already doing so."
14556.0,Patient,"Much, yes, but that was always my when I was in business for myself that was every day."
480.0,Provider,Every day.
14556.0,Patient,God is. that's that's my problems because I always ask myself where's God.
480.0,Provider,Like yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"You know, all those things I sent you this is how this is what got me that kind of thinking that if you just think this way. That that so now I have tested So where is God in all of this, you know I asked myself that when I was in business for myself, I said okay God, you know you see me here look."
480.0,Provider,"Right, you want to know I got myself out of."
14556.0,Patient,"Where I first started out of that little town camera real in that closet I got myself up to beverly hills and said. You know i've done everything i've worked hard at it, you know I just I made poor decisions i'm telling me i'm a poor decisions, Christine because I was desperate. I was asking me for decisions, because I was trying to get myself, out of a place so Does that mean that what God has, for me, is just me, no matter how hard I work it's just that he sent me to the planet just struggle and."
480.0,Provider,"No, because if everyone believed that, then there would be like here's I can't accept a worldview where that's the case that humans are just put here to suffer like that does not fit my worldview at all."
14556.0,Patient,"Because hear me listen to me, I always say when I argue this point is that the crime in the black community is the direct correlation to struggle in the black community."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"it's a direct correlation and that's why they pounce on our Community you don't need to do that in orange county there's so much money down there that they're not put in positions where they're desperate most of time they're never put in addition. So. When you go to other communities like to me, I live in here people struggling they live on so yeah there's gonna be more crime because they're they're coming from the place of the mind called desperate. And I always breakthroughs they're. Always breakthroughs yes there's a breakthrough, but did there the the breakthroughs a disproportionate to the struggle does that make any sense to."
480.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. so well. But in still in my mind, I have to separate that from God right because. If God is supposed to be always a loving always good always forgiving then that's the disconnect I have is the struggle doesn't come from God, the struggle comes from the world and human nature and all of the people in the world that have created the system to be what it is in America."
14556.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"Because I feel like it's not. Like there's no good that comes out of thinking that God is keeping you stuck right if God is supposed to be this entity that is loving and helping and inspiring and all of that, then what good does it do to think that God is punishing you and keeping you stuck."
14556.0,Patient,"No, I guess, it is. Right I just feel like I pray so much all the time and. I try to let me lead and i'm stuck in the world that guess."
480.0,Provider,What do you. pray for do you pray for specific outcomes.
14556.0,Patient,I pray for God to release hinder says.
480.0,Provider,that's a good prayer.
14556.0,Patient,"Things that hinder me yeah. Because people like to him me i'm sorry it's like I told you, the other day, never been I remember the I was in bases and this black woman. She had a leopard shoes and I had a leopard sweater and and she said about leper and I said oh yeah I really like leper and she looked at me like, why are you talking like that."
480.0,Provider,huh.
14556.0,Patient,"Okay, do you know I go to black church and I was sitting in there and sit something good. And without even opening my mouth, she said you're not from here, are you so, how do you know that, and then I go up to bel air you go to church if they're white people say. Why are you here what brings you here it's church that's why or the Holocaust, which is a study remember this is, this is the study of the Holocaust, they say, a free study speak talking about the events at all, we got to think that's interesting, I want to go. Why are you here."
480.0,Provider,Why does it matter why i'm here like That would be my response.
14556.0,Patient,"Right, but where do you fit in the world."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14556.0,Patient,"it's not your that unfortunate for today for you, thank you, thank you God, fortunately, for you you'll never have to deal with that, but yeah. So that's where i'm at so I don't need to move anywhere path."
480.0,Provider,"Realistically speaking, is it possible to take a day off from job hunting calling add just like have a self care day where you only do things that. bring you joy and bring you peace like is that even realistic for you to be able to do, because I feel like that is where we're at is, we just need like. a break from all the trauma for a minute right let's refresh let's do something, you said. You enjoy walking most of the time, and you didn't get to do that, yesterday, so like get some fresh air go for a walk just put this on the back burner for one day 24 hours of not having to struggle, not having to worry about struggling."
14556.0,Patient,Okay. Does that sound doable just to have.
480.0,Provider,"A regroup or reset or whatever you want to call it, you know."
14556.0,Patient,The way that that they don't look through all the jobs don't apply for it don't.
480.0,Provider,"Look don't look on on indeed don't look like i'm thinking just anything that triggers that stress we ignore for 24 hours okay just have a day, where it's like i'm only doing things that bring me joy and peace and that's it."
14556.0,Patient,Okay. till next week.
480.0,Provider,Not the entire week wasn't.
14556.0,Patient,One day.
480.0,Provider,"One day. So just take a day before I meet with you next Wednesday and just. make a list of things that you feel like are going to bring you joy and peace and do those things and just take a break. From all of the stress because part of that, like this is a mental health day basically i'm asking you to take a Mental Health Day, because every day you're constantly having trauma trigger after trauma trigger and it gets really exhausting. So this isn't going to help you find a job, but it is going to help with your mental health and. Your mindset."
14556.0,Patient,"Okay i'm going to do it and i'm over my time it's five after so I don't want to hold it. Thank you, thank you and thank you for listening to my suggestions for group I really appreciate that and."
480.0,Provider,Of course.
14556.0,Patient,"Just remember this is California and things here are different than they are, I mean i've seen i've seen how the inflows it can be very painful when people share each other's information."
480.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah no I totally get it and that's why so if you I from a bright heart standpoint we're supposed to tell everyone, we have to be able to see the whites in your eyes that's what it's supposed to be. But I don't push that because I get what you're saying right so whatever you need to do to feel comfortable in the group scenario you do okay."
14556.0,Patient,"All right, I just I just would love to see people's at least I can see their face. yeah so I don't know I mean I used to be in a group where. I knew who popularized, it was because they were filming and listening into people, so I could get up and move, but. it's just out here, anyway, but, that being said. This is our time."
480.0,Provider,Wait are you saying you want to be able to see everyone's face like that's a good thing.
14556.0,Patient,yeah I think.
480.0,Provider,"Okay okay good. Okay Oh, I will try to encourage that even more."
14556.0,Patient,"Okay, so that's it, and thank you very much."
