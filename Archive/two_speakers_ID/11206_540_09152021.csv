540.0,Provider,How you got on your phone fixed.
11206.0,Patient,"up now, I went I got a new one, I got one guy I talked to them and they told me I get. I get by you know. Well, they you know I buy that the I buy my phones at walmart through track well, I mean they have like you can get like straight talker turtle wireless they all work on the track boom. Whatever and I pay for whenever I buy a new phone I get their little. The protection plan it's like an accident protection thing or whatever. mm hmm all this way so anyways the. Little turnarounds like the accident protection thing. On this was like I don't know it was like $50 and then you had to pay 30 but it's like an $880 phone, so it worked out good. Though I I sent them, the one that I cracked screen back and then I just bought another bought a new."
540.0,Provider,phone too bad though for. That.
11206.0,Patient,"Well, well it's better than and I got it well, I got another thing in my car to hold the phone so i'm not. Taking it in and out of the protected, because I had a protective case, but I was pulling it in and out of my the holder that I used to hold it in my car like was like to see it just didn't hold it well, or was like pop that's why I think that's why I don't know."
540.0,Provider,How have you been doing.
11206.0,Patient,"Oh i'm good good just you know i'm working some and just. Trying to exercise and just i'm trying to get into like you know I really like having like a routine. You know what I mean and i've been really. i'm trying to get myself in the habit it's like really hard but i'm trying to get myself in the habit of going. Getting up and getting ready, because my daughter, I have to drop her off at school at like seven. Their school starts at like 710 so I dropped her off around you know between seven and 710 and then I would like kind of want to work from like. From that that point until like to you know, ideally that's what I will do that's kind of what i'm shooting for it's taken me a while to get there, though, you know that's my. kind of my goal."
540.0,Provider,And hasn't been working.
11206.0,Patient,"I mean I haven't gotten, to the point where i'm doing that yet, but i'm getting closer and closer to it, you know what I mean all the time. Like what I want to do is ideally i'll go to bed early get up you know really early so that I can exercise because, like, I want to exercise like an hour before I leave the House. get a quick shower get dressed get everything ready get out the door and be ready to you know. work by the time she asleep for school, then I don't have to come back home, and then I also have to get that four hours, and I did get them to tell me that I don't have to do that sleep study that overnight thing, though, so that's really."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, and I know you."
11206.0,Patient,"Like the pain of having to do it again. I really did not want to do that again. You know i'm glad so yeah I was really happy because I mean i'm very close like i'm at like three and a half hours now, so I said. If I can get it, you know up to four hours we guys, let me off the hook on that and they said yeah it's fine so pretty happy they actually call it will cancel the appointment yeah."
540.0,Provider,So what's the. what's the next things that you have to do for your sleep.
11206.0,Patient,"that's it, I mean nothing really I mean they don't really have anything else lined up I probably need to. Just I don't know you know what cuz I had set up an appointment with a sleep doctor that's like also a neurologist but they told me that he basically focuses on the sleep apnea too, so I don't know you know I really don't know. How to I don't know, maybe, maybe I can find a psychiatry is to treat sleep disorders, I don't know you know I really don't know what to do about it, you know, basically, you know, because the way they deal with it at the place i'm at now is just like. You know, they just want me to maintain that for hours and then me compliant and then they'll refill my medicine that's kind of what it is with them. You know, to me it's not really a solution, you know it's kind of like treating the symptom rather than although you know I mean I know with narcolepsy that's all that they really do but. I don't know I just feel like you know I don't know it just is what it is, I guess, I don't know I told him I said i'm just gonna take a video of me at night, you can see, I said i'm like a damn i'm like a gremlin me like. I don't pop out I just i'm like Have you ever seen the movie step brothers. brothers yeah. me at night every just about every night it's awful and the more tired that I get the worse it gets but part of that part of the reason why i'm trying to do the routine being is because. I will say that that has helped me with that, and you know and also i'd like to start working on maybe thinking about trying to get decrease my dose a little bit on the suboxone because that definitely impacts everything also it's just really hard to do I don't know."
540.0,Provider,What are you what are you on again for the suboxone.
11206.0,Patient,I am at three day but you know it that's it yeah so that's a high dose yeah. I do yeah right yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Well, so me, I mean you talked to Dr to see what would be more reasonable, even if you went from. Like to."
11206.0,Patient,"wear the regal I got them to take me up to three That was because. I had been it to forever and. And I would like, and I mean I tried tried tried tried tried to get myself on track with it and I just kept having problems, you know. And I was like this is crazy i'm going to end up relapse in because i'm going to run out of my medicine early or something you know what I mean yeah and it's not like I don't abuse the medication and by any measure you know, but it was just. Just just stupid so anyways this i'm very comfortable with and I don't you know i've never run on my medicine ever early you know I mean like i'm not sitting at the pharmacy on pickup day like. You know we're. I hate that it feels too much like active addiction to me, you know what i'm saying like well and even with the place that I was at originally I had. always had extra and they got really bad because I had like refills at the pharmacy so I know I know they they like to keep kind of but that wasn't my original place that I was at. You know, I was always like well if I take less I don't see why that's a problem, but I don't know I guess it's just a matter of like."
540.0,Provider,I think it's yeah it's definitely I think it's like the diversion.
11206.0,Patient,"Right Well, no, but I mean it was at the pharmacy though you know what I mean like i'm like i'm doing something shady with it it's not gonna be sitting at the courthouse like it would be I would be picking it up, you know you get what i'm saying like yeah. I like I had refills at the pharmacy like if I was doing some shady the pharmacy one hand I would have it. When I get what you're saying, though, as far as that's concerned yeah I understand that I do."
540.0,Provider,And I and they usually just like like I think they like the cohesiveness of just knowing that you're taking or taking exactly what's prescribed. Right yeah so it's.
11206.0,Patient,kind of like a follow yeah I get that I totally get that yeah it makes them I know.
540.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, I see where you're coming from now, so I remember, I went on, you know because."
11206.0,Patient,"At the same token, they don't want people to be like well I ran out a day early or. Four, which in and nobody in a perfect world you're never going to do something like that, but we're addicts, you know what I mean that's what we're in treatment for like I mean you know I don't know I just think that's kind of unrealistic and then like. I don't especially I mean if you're at the very lowest possible dose you can be at you know I don't know, I was at eight for a long time, and I did great in it actually was the best i've felt. But, for whatever reason, is just almost impossible for me to get myself back down I don't know why it's so crazy I don't you know oh sorry yeah."
540.0,Provider,I hear you now.
11206.0,Patient,"Okay. I don't know. I don't know where. you're at for a long time, I mean not not since i've been at the same since i've been with you guys, but like back your when I first and I was at eight for a long time, and it worked out really well for me and and I did really well with that for a while and I don't know. If it was the covert stuff I had a surgery, you know there's just some things that happen that kind of like threw me into a weird tailspin and then. Just like my dose kept having to go up until I felt sable to where i'm at right now, you know and that's kind of where i've been out for a while, so. I mean yeah I mean I could probably go down somewhat less, but I just want to be like you know I don't know and and be able to do it, like myself, like, not just through you guys, but, for me, you know what i'm saying like yeah."
540.0,Provider,So more like testing it out person.
11206.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know what I mean I just I mean, I know I can go down a little bit, but i'm just saying, like, I just want to. I don't know i'd like to get back down to age at some point it's going to be a while, because i'm like you know I take most of it almost i'm just saying I it's enough to where i'm not like, I have a couple extra days of medication. You know what I mean. Maybe two or three days extra that makes me feel comfortable if something happens where Isaiah can't get just things happen, you know what I mean that's why I feel like I don't know if that makes any sense."
540.0,Provider,"No, it does, and I think I think that's why I say tries to make it so that people have an an extra days worth because he knows the feeling of the fact that when you have to kind of be at the at CVs or walgreens and you're in with it makes you kind of feel like you're back and addiction."
11206.0,Patient,"Does it feel so much like activation and then like you know the pharmacy is really weird like in the insurance company it's like everybody is really trying to police all this and i'm like. Just and the amazing thing is is like Susan I get the increasing doses, and everything is wonderful I don't have to worry about any of it anymore, you know, does that make sense it's like. Where before I had all those stressors which made me feel kind of put me back in that headspace a little bit to an extent, you know, and you know we're used like you're just at the because the farmers, they look at you funny you know what I mean they just act weird I don't know yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Well, you and I we've talked about it so there's this stigma that come."
11206.0,Patient,"ready meaning substances yeah exactly exactly and now it's real it's wonderful because, like. My refill be there for a day or two and I don't even worry, you should I mean and I it's funny because, like before I know before they they would be like a you can't get it today, you get away or you know what I mean and like yeah and now i'm like. Okay i'll just pick it up on a dare to. i'm sure they're just like oh okay yeah."
540.0,Provider,"So it's definitely I mean it definitely has its pros to have that extra medication, but."
11206.0,Patient,"yeah I would, and I would never ever even think about doing anything like yeah no that's I don't know I still think I mean, even in my active addiction, it was a stretch for me to think like that, but I definitely would not do it now."
540.0,Provider,"how's everything else, been."
11206.0,Patient,"Good good Bella is still going to in person school but. Definitely i'm gonna I, so I was going to put in the paperwork last week for her to start this coming week, but then. Her my mom were talking and she's like well just stay for another week and i'm like okay that's fine, but I knew I know she's gonna I know she's gonna switch you know. So I mean which i'm happy where they're going to imprisons well that's What if it's gonna work out, you know what I mean I just. I don't know what to see what happens I just kind of playing it day by day with that kind of stuff you know."
540.0,Provider,"How are you feeling some I like emotionally about it, like her, going back to school with coven and stuff."
11206.0,Patient,"Well, you know, of course, I was kind of freaked out and then. You know I kind of sort of stopped reading stuff on the Internet, about it because it's just that. there's too much there's too much like people bickering and too many differences of opinions and. You know I just they make them wear masks or she's been vaccinated so it's like I don't I feel like i've done everything I can do to protect her. yeah and her household you know what I mean like I do feel like you know I think i'll be more comfortable with her being homeschooled from the coven perspective. And, but, but at the same time, I feel like. Her getting up and going to out of the House school every day keeps her like up active. doing more productive type things you know what I mean."
540.0,Provider,"I think it's so important for children that a lot of people didn't understand is going to school there's it's it's, not even the school work that's really the most important thing, but it's the dynamic of getting up going to school. The structure, yes."
11206.0,Patient,"I need structure is a big yeah and, and that is the big thing like I think well one thing they said the school that i've talked to. They say they have to do a five hours a day, where they're on the computer so that's going to create more structure than what she had before. Because like i'm not going to go with one of these places like Oh, they can go on when they want the end on you know. I don't she has to have so many hours a day that she has to be doing for online, you know, like she has to be on there so many hours a day, and then. You know when i'm going to do is if she does you know if, when when and if we do this, I think i'm going to just tell her like no TV for. No, you know no TV no phone between such and such hours you know what I mean like so that I don't just i'm just trying I just need to figure out a way to create more structure for she's gonna be home, you know. that's the biggest thing I think is important, were the social side of it i'm not as worried about because, like. At this age I don't know kids are just like I don't know that I don't know if I think the influence is great or not, you know what I mean like I don't know."
540.0,Provider,"And stuff like I mean it's hard right now, especially with everything. That they're they have like accessibility wise social. shares."
11206.0,Patient,"A story that she tells me like when she comes down was just like well this kid said that are like kids and i'm like oh my God wearable but it's like yeah that's good for you, though I know."
540.0,Provider,And it also does come from my children and their reflection on their home environment and if they are just thrown in front of TVs and. yeah so it's such a combination. of different things with our society right now.
11206.0,Patient,"I know well in Bella Bella has seen things and in her things and I, you know I don't I don't know i'm pretty laid back about music and and like what what we watch and things like that, but like. As long as it's in contacts like I make sure that we talk about things to that she understands context, like. You know this is this is expression, this is, you know I don't know I try to talk to her about that stuff and then like but as far as like she she's lived a really sheltered life. Which i'm really grateful that she's been able to you know because I didn't, and I mean lot of kids don't you know but she's not really been exposed to a lot of stuff that like a lot of kids are you know, like she's been really fortunate in that way. Sometimes good sometimes bad she has zero fear she's so like yeah like i'm just like she doesn't even realize like how like almost like sometimes she's like she doesn't think bad things can happen on a my, but they can, and they do you know. Where the bad things can happen like I don't want her to fear it all the time, but just that awareness, sometimes but it's like she's just like takes it for granted, somewhat I don't know but but I guess that's a good thing you know it's like it's good bad stability yeah."
540.0,Provider,"shows yeah and shows the stability, but then also. Being able to give the insight, to be able to navigate the world. And it's ugliness at times."
11206.0,Patient,Yes.
540.0,Provider,"Exactly yeah but now. I mean we do the best we can guidance wise as. moms and and that's that's The thing is a lot of times you can do the best things and the great things as a parent and then your children, sometimes they'll decide to make their own decisions and it gets into. them into shifty bad situations and then vice versa, they may have a very, very bad life growing up, but it turned them into a great person because of that."
11206.0,Patient,yeah right.
540.0,Provider,So yeah it's it's tricky and parenthood is tricky.
11206.0,Patient,"It is, I don't think there's any. I don't know I don't know that there's it's not black and white for sure there's like definitely shades of grey and different different. It was contacts everything it just all I don't know oh absolutely."
540.0,Provider,yeah it's always contacts.
11206.0,Patient,"I mean there's just so much to it yeah yeah. Well, things have been going pretty good I mean pretty much all the same stuff that we had talked about before you know yeah. nothing's really changed the last couple weeks everything's pretty much the same stuff yeah."
540.0,Provider,that's good yeah.
11206.0,Patient,I made progress on stuff that you know I mean like that yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And, and definitely just keep me in the loop So if you ever want to start trying to decrease, you can always just talk to Isaiah a lot of times providers they'll continue to just give you what you are taking. Say they'll kind of give you like a be like hey like take try to take two and three quarters, a day. And then right, yes it out so. um."
11206.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I don't think I would have an issue with that it, the only thing is, when you start going into the you know it just I know it starts kind of like throwing it's like. We just got to the point where i'm sorry like it's been weird like all get different amounts every time. yeah like so since i've been with you guys i've had like never I don't think i've ever gotten the same prescription twice it's been like this, many or I don't know it's been weird numbers, but at least it's always like three a day but it's been just like."
540.0,Provider,weird numbers.
11206.0,Patient,"yeah so that's kind of white also unlike me it was leave it as like I don't know I don't want to start throwing me off at them and watching them. grow and like you know for actually I don't know sounds bad, but yeah."
540.0,Provider,"And I think that's why most providers they'll still do it yeah, especially when you first started they'll still just do this, like the three. And they'll just tell you. What to do yeah and but going forward so do you want to. I know that you're pretty stable wise when it comes on my end and I always am going to leave that on the table for you to have like the once a month counseling."
11206.0,Patient,"If we, if you want to switch it to that that's fine with me, I mean i'm okay with that yeah."
540.0,Provider,"I didn't know if you wanted to do, maybe like two times 30 minutes or, if you want to do like once a month and our."
11206.0,Patient,"I think, once a month and hours fine if I even issue, we can always like good because, like really I don't know I feel like an hour is like a good amount of time because, like I ramble and it sometimes takes me that long to get to the point."
540.0,Provider,So one.
11206.0,Patient,"You know if something comes up, we can always like yeah sure thing or something yeah."
540.0,Provider,"yeah so that's what most of the people that I have on so whether or not they're on monthly or even like quarterly some people I only see every three months. yeah sometimes they'll just plop themselves into my scheduler and it'll be before like our our session that we scheduled. Just so that it kind of if you're having a tough month or if you're having a tough week it just allows you to have that support. yeah so i'm very open door policy, so if you ever need to see me just plop yourself in my scheduler."
11206.0,Patient,"OK, I will yeah five crisis, I will, but I mean you know everything I mean yeah and a lot of times i'm able to work through things sometimes though you know if something's like an ongoing thing it's. It helps me to be able to bounce it off somebody else you know, like I don't know but, like most the time I can I can work through stuff you know. I, and I like I needed i've got a few you know i've got a few people that are like really supportive, but like I needed like makes I but i'm so nervous like one, I have one friend that i've been really. Close with since like. Because like she and I are kind of like in the same place with our recovery like and we. I met her like when I first started and then like we kind of like danced around becoming friends, for a long time because i'm like so. i'm very nervous around like it sounds bad, but it's because that has been my downfall so many times like meeting people and being like oh yeah let's support each other, and then we end up in a high together like I don't want to. You know, it just I will so like."
540.0,Provider,So you've seen where it's led before.
11206.0,Patient,"yeah like I mean as much as I think like I understand little 12 step recovery and attic. Supporting each other and all that but. Sometimes, I think that it can. work against you to you know, like I don't know. I don't know what the answers are but. But like like."
540.0,Provider,yeah so it's also readiness so sometimes when I mean and that's.
11206.0,Patient,Already back then yeah right.
540.0,Provider,But it's always the tricky part where it's it's a Community based recovery system. But then there is the domino effect so if one person relapses the chance of that domino effect happening.
11206.0,Patient,"I think, maybe, maybe back then I Maybe it was where I was I don't know. I guess i'm just so like i'm so scared that now it's like I don't I just like have a fear about like people you know. meeting people, and you know, like people being dishonest about their recovery like i've had that happen, a lot, where I you know might think it's one way, but it's another you know what i'm saying, like you, don't know until you're on a risky situation with a person and then. You know just I just have to be careful that's all yeah so I tried to be super careful, but like I mean I, I know I need to reach out and make some new friends. But like before it was that big of an issue because, like Bella was younger and it was she kept me so busy with being mom and, like, I felt like that kept me. fulfilled and like I was, but now that she's older and a little more independent, I need a little bit more of a social life, you know so that's something I probably need to work on."
540.0,Provider,The social life.
11206.0,Patient,"Well, just maybe like trying to figure out safe ways that I can make new friends like that. You know, ways to test like, how can I, I mean because there's got to be ways like test that. You know, do it safely so that i'm not putting myself at risk, you know."
540.0,Provider,So I mean I mean I understand where you're coming from too so it's I mean So do you have a sponsor.
11206.0,Patient,"I don't know no no yeah no I would really I mean i've done some of the the murrah online things and stuff like that, but I don't know, I find that in a is kind of like. I know it's kind of excludes you know the whole like they don't really know they're not good about suboxone no not not in my area they're not really very accepting of it. I mean there are you out of the meeting, but."
540.0,Provider,"yeah they only just got accepting on suboxone and like different MIT methods harder they won't really accept that yet, but i'm around like New England it's started to come, except in like maybe like a year year and a half ago. yeah, but if you go to like those old school and a na any type of yeah they it'll kind of be like a test test."
11206.0,Patient,"Right yeah. Like I don't want to go somewhere where they're gonna make me feel bad about my. mean not. Like. I mean, I understand the concept didn't I don't know, Sir, I know i'm not where they are I get that like. You know if somebody is completely clean that's completely clean and that's wonderful and I think like wonderful like break I tried that for years, you know. And I mean, and I would get a certain amount of time and then I would you know I would have died, if I hadn't done what I did you know, I was gonna die so like I had to make a choice."
540.0,Provider,And I am I think that it's all in like the eyes of the beholder so. It doesn't yeah it's.
11206.0,Patient,I know.
540.0,Provider,"Some people what works for them, I mean you and i've talked about a million times but it works for some people doesn't work for the other and vice versa, so it's and that's why addiction is so complicated because it's not just one way."
11206.0,Patient,yeah it's not a one size fits all individualized zachary.
540.0,Provider,makes it so.
11206.0,Patient,"Every part I mean there's a lot of similarities, but every person is different, you know."
540.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah and just. Really understanding that. there's no right way. Okay you're covering. it's just whatever way works for you.
11206.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I don't doubt that eventually i'll be you know become you know, probably more active member in that Community you know, and I mean just I just have to like do it in mind when my own time because, like I just don't want to you know feel bad about that you know you."
540.0,Provider,can spend your time. writing this is key.
11206.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean like I go to church, I mean not every week, but I go to church and that's a good support and then like. You know, like i'll do the online more meetings stuff like that that's good and then like I told you i'm. i'm a member of like different online groups and stuff like that, but that this doesn't feel like like I would like something that's more you know in person type person yeah they don't have any of those in my area I."
540.0,Provider,don't have any of them in your area.
11206.0,Patient,"Mara now, not that I know of any ways I mean I could. not the last time I checked they done it, but I mean I haven't looked recently I mean I haven't looked the last few months, I don't think I don't know when the last time I checked, or maybe like six months I don't know you're like back. It may have changed since then i'm not sure. I mean, I know that they didn't have any more groups not you know. That met in person, they just had the online stuff yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully i'm obviously I think that things will start to shut down again, but hopefully once things pick back up."
11206.0,Patient,How is it in your area or are things really isn't bad.
540.0,Provider,"Not, no, no, I it's actually funny because I going to Florida and see my family I expected that you know Florida on social media everyone's talking crap about Florida. I more masks being being worn down there than I do, in New England."
11206.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,You really that you don't see them down here. everybody's just loosely walking around and Florida like they're they actually like I saw so many people with masks on that. yeah it just I feel like social media has made this representation i'm sure it's like that political gain but.
11206.0,Patient,"yeah right. And I think we'd be the way, is the best way to know you like to go to a hospital eat what that. that's probably the only way you'd really know how bad it is honestly, you know."
540.0,Provider,"Like and that's the same thing too is. Even in New England, they were saying that the hospitals were like loaded and that everybody and everything was loaded with coven patients and my my significant other he worked at the hospital at the time. And it was like ghost zone, nobody was at the hospital yeah so yeah."
11206.0,Patient,The representation get that information on how they're able to like just. Put that out there that it's not I mean I don't know.
540.0,Provider,yeah it's it's hard that's why we have to understand that some of the stuff that we see is skewed.
11206.0,Patient,yeah sure.
540.0,Provider,yeah but.
11206.0,Patient,"And then there was like confirmation bias so like whatever he did, I mean yeah it's like whatever you already think you're going to just get more of that kind of do, though, yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Well now's The thing is, when code first had come out they connected up most deaths with coven regardless if coven was involved. And they. So when people were seeing all of these deaths, they had to kind of retract that months later to say Oh, you know I like there wasn't this many deaths. But there are, so there are deaths, but it's very hard for them to say that it's pinpointed to coven nice some people don't even have coven they just had like a respiratory infection. yeah so it's um. yeah it was definitely by I also think that in crisis, we do the best we can, and it's like playing like telephone tag. Usually if you're that last person on the line that's getting information it's skewed and it's going to be yeah so there was some truth to it, but we have to understand that once it goes down that line of communication, sometimes it can be twisted and turned. Absolutely, but but yeah so it's not it's really not bad down here, if anything, rsv is pretty bad right now. i'm saying like that's like kids kids get rsv pretty bad day so and that's been significant but i'm not really coven right now."
11206.0,Patient,Well that's good that's wonderful yeah.
540.0,Provider,"i've heard, I have a lot of my California clients. A lot of people have been positive, some of my groups so. I think there has been an increasingly certain areas for sure yeah yeah."
11206.0,Patient,"Well we've been fortunate in my household I mean because, like. I told you that one day I think I don't know if I my daughter came I don't know did I tell you, she came home sick from school that day with like I don't know."
540.0,Provider,You know you didn't.
11206.0,Patient,"yeah that was like not not this past week, but the week before that, like that Thursday, it was like a third Wednesday or Thursday so i'm like anyway, we went heading out are tested following week, and she was negative. Though I think she was. But that's part of it, too, is like so hard know it's like I don't know."
540.0,Provider,I know you never yeah that's the hard thing.
11206.0,Patient,"is well and it was like my with us live in here with them and their order and then i've got you know i'm a smoker and i've had bronchitis, for years, like on and off penis it's like I don't know, but it is what it is, you know you just have to."

540.0,Provider,appointment for next month.
11206.0,Patient,"I haven't I started to try to do it before we came on and they were like you're in the wrong. I don't know it's like I it's so weird sometimes the way they do things in the virtual clinic it's because you go to one virtual clinic. Then they transfer you to someone else and then that person transfers you to another area which feels somewhat redundant don't you think kind of sort of I don't. say. Like Can we just get like one trains, for I don't know it's just."
540.0,Provider,"Well, that makes sense. yeah always, whenever you do those surveys we're always trying to get better with our process."
11206.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"You ever have recommendations for our process always just put it in that survey, like the comment section."
11206.0,Patient,"I mean, I will say, though, that, like, I mean comparatively to like the place the one place, that I was with was like it in person place that that that basically switch to a virtual place. And they were a hot mess, so you guys are way more and I. wanted that way like I they would be like we're going to do a zoom group and i'd be sitting there for our like hours like and nobody would ever let you in and like. I would be like trying to call and nobody would answer the phone it was I mean it was a train wreck yeah so like I mean like on the day that I would have an appointment I would be an all day event. So yeah that's that was very frustrating that's part that's why I ended up switching honestly, because I was like. I can't i'm like this is making me a nervous wreck well you know it was just me because, like i'm like how do I can't really prove you know I mean i've been sitting here since like you know, whatever i'd get on their way before I was supposed to and just be like didn't error. And i'm like I don't you know I just don't think they knew how to manage that yet, and you know and but nobody wants to say they can't do their job you know when. Nobody wants to say they don't know how to do their job you know so like I just was always scared that somebody was going to not take responsibility at some point, and it would come back on you know what I mean. yeah so you guys have been way better about all that stuff though yeah way better yeah here."
540.0,Provider,But we always want to do better.
11206.0,Patient,Right.
540.0,Provider,ever have anything that you see that we could do better to we will always take it in and we're always we're we're always changing so it's.
11206.0,Patient,"Right, and you know it may just be something you know, maybe I need maybe i'm not i'm maybe i'm not doing it right, I don't know you know because I just always go to like i'll go on the website where it says existing patients and i'll go into that. Virtual clinic and then they'll say you know i'll transfer you to whatever other area. They put me through to another room. And then that person comes on and then that person will say i've got to put you through to somebody else, so I don't know why that is, you know I don't know. Hello."
540.0,Provider,There you are. yeah sorry okay sorry i'm.
11206.0,Patient,"A big deal, I mean it really doesn't take a long time. I just think of it from a business perspective, like it seems redundant, but that's just my what. Whatever."
540.0,Provider,And sometimes it's like some things are algorithm some things. Are. The system itself so.
11206.0,Patient,I mean i'm not in the business I don't know the systems that we.
540.0,Provider,Know yeah so but.
11206.0,Patient,But only higher perspective.
540.0,Provider,yeah whenever we. get any comments back they always they analyze it and then some sometimes obviously if it's if it's obviously a need for the system to change they they'll start going at it.
