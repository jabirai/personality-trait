16686.0,Patient,"i'm doing well, how are you."
740.0,Provider,i'm doing well how's everything going.
16686.0,Patient,"All right. i've tried done some of them, like some of the advice you gave me about them taking breaks in between."
740.0,Provider,and
16686.0,Patient,"A little bit more, but i'm I realized like when I turned myself for the brakes I tend to go overboard with my brakes. hmm yeah so. i'd spend too much time taking a break, instead of actually getting back into it."
740.0,Provider,You said you went over the wall which I breaks. yeah it was a time in a five minute isn't a five minute was go back to your day.
16686.0,Patient,"and go over. I even like tell myself like Ari bring it back, but um. It isn't always hope yes."
740.0,Provider,Okay. So what did you find helpful.
16686.0,Patient,"Definitely warm. him free I did find hope was just I guess I needed a little bit more time. So, like instead of five minutes I muted to 10 minutes."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
16686.0,Patient,"Even then, sometimes I go overboard."
740.0,Provider,Even pay me.
16686.0,Patient,it's also because i'm like a bit of a procrastinator.
740.0,Provider,"Oh well, yeah i'm like if this if you procrastinate and I. mean those things that I gave you me, it it helps to. Practice self control and discipline and honestly. You just got to keep practicing until you get it."
16686.0,Patient,Right sure i'm. Not that strong.
740.0,Provider,"Right and so like I said that's why you have to practice, I know that since we just saw the last week because you're trying to get you two sessions, and this month, then of course you know, is not enough time, it is not enough space to see any kind of progress. Because of the fact that it takes 12 days to form a habit. So. Within our forte when within 14 days straight thing yeah you're like Okay, when I shadow 14 days and then blah blah but considered I just thought you would last Thursday."
16686.0,Patient,Like that yeah.
740.0,Provider,"I mean you can't get too much progress and six days. Six seven days so. I wouldn't say give up on it, yet I would just say practice some more. A lot of times you know your willingness to do it is is is. A lot of your your willingness to do more style is is, as you keep going and keep practicing, then the willing the wilderness for will change but it's really difficult em so like I said to do it in such a short period of time. So the best one thing I will tell you to do is to look at. To look at how like to look at your like infractions and the little things that you couldn't keep keep up with or look at. Just the patterns that you had during the past few days, and then you know you tell me what areas do you feel like you need to fix was some things you feel like you need to tweak. survive it so you said."
16686.0,Patient,"gotcha um. Do we plan to keep on trying to sell because we, I can make like you said better discipline myself. hmm yeah."
740.0,Provider,"um. So what are some I mean, how do you feel like you can improve. What do you feel like you can do different."
16686.0,Patient,"I guess. I guess I could just constantly try to. keep trying to tell myself, like all right, you need to do this, and like stop procrastinating or something."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, so what's the source of your procrastination Where does this came from."
16686.0,Patient,"I think it's usually because I come, like whenever I do school work i'm like oh this isn't too bad like I could do this fast i'll just do it later than. I think that's usually the case with. remembered by do school work i'm. In terms of chores though I don't really progress me those know."
740.0,Provider,"So you tell me. The difference, like the type of. The mindset that you have towards your choice versus your schoolwork so you tell me how you able to stay discipline which are chores but now we're just to work."
16686.0,Patient,"With chores always kind of see it like you know it's like something that has to be done and I don't want my like my area to be really dirty like dishes piling up in like crumbs all over the floor like that. isn't really things that need to be done at that moment when like a spill happens, or like things all up or you know just kind of make sure my living area is tidy. Rather than with like school work, I guess, like Oh, like the deadlines like I don't know like a few days, I can just. Like do it. Maybe like a day before, or the day of as long as they like, because I usually think it's not that bad."
740.0,Provider,huh so basically. You feel like they. You have all the time in the world.
16686.0,Patient,I guess.
740.0,Provider,"You could. Say because you know that if a spiel stays on they can attach it is going to see being and then you will have a sign of your kind of thoughts, so of course I need to go ahead and get this feel at the way. Right, no. You know i'm saying that that if I if the slowest dirty and I, and I and i'm not walking through the House with no shoes on and, and that means my massage don't get dirty on won't get chrome's in the feet and I don't want homes and what he said, every I got a sweep it up right away. You know i'm saying. So I mean we got dirty dishes and forth dirty dishes bring up next to it kind of serve you know gotta get rid of stuff don't want to say some books okay so, then I got. No, no, so that's so that's understandable, however, we look at school, what it was that. I got time. I mean it's not doing to this dude you know so. I got time."
16686.0,Patient,And also sorry.
740.0,Provider,Go ahead.
16686.0,Patient,i'm thinking about that is like when the deadline starts to approach I go into like kind of like a little panic mode with her fear.
740.0,Provider,"Of it yeah so, is it possible, I just ask this is it possible to adopt. The same mindset that you have, for your chores to your school work."
16686.0,Patient,"I think it's possible but i'm usually I don't know I don't know if this sounds right, but like i'm. Like one um I started earlier with schoolwork I get even more distracted I guess."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So basically. You just have to wait for the last minute can go to a panic attack and being able to be used to work. yeah oh. Well, you know I don't have no remedy for it. Oh, Anna remove fit because you know i'm you know my thing is it just more so i'm having the same sense of urgency that you have, for your chores that you do, for your schoolwork. And to go ahead and get it out the way, because if you get it out the way, then that means you have more time for yourself. Right, but you choose to have more time for. yourself first and then wait until the deadline approaches and then now we got, we need to go ahead and do it, so we can get it out the way. Right, so the attitude needs to flip."
16686.0,Patient,Definitely.
740.0,Provider,How we do that.
16686.0,Patient,question.
740.0,Provider,"Unless you got to make their hair, but I, let me say some, all I can do. Is give you the guy, but you have to make the habit and like I said, as I say, is practice practice practice practice press. And then in like you have to continue to practice it, I mean, sometimes we fall short or whatever like that that's fine, but my thing is like this i'm gonna be real honest with you. If you start your schoolwork earlier, and then the deadline, even though you get distracted if you keep doing it. Either way, it go, you will still finish way earlier than the daylight so you're finished way earlier, even with the distractions then, then you will, when you get close with a deadline and start having a panic attack."
16686.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So, like. it'd be different if you get distracted somewhere, so that you never go back to it."
16686.0,Patient,versus.
740.0,Provider,"dating they're doing it, and then you know watch the TV and then you go back to me like i'll have to go back and watch the show or was five shells when you go back to it. Okay, and then you i'm saying like even in the midst of distractions you're still able to be productive that's one thing versus to not be productive at all, and then way to the data to the to the day before it's due, and now we sweating in and we am about to have a fit. So um so even with the distractions it isn't a to me if that's how it has to start off then that's fine, because at least you're getting it done."
16686.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"But to push it all the way off suicide and be like No one on that. thing about it is, is it the same way, the crumbs on the floor has a benefit if you pick it up. The same way you go on to college is a benefit if you finish. So you gotta look at the benefits of it, not just at the work."
16686.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"If you don't see no benefit in what you're doing, then of course you're not going to do it. i'll see no benefit me why do I have to do my school work, work, why do I have to do my schoolwork and now. where's the benefit of me doing my score right now is not due until another 14 days, so why just can't wait to the 12th day to go ahead and get it done. I know what to do, I can just wait and kind of procrastinating and kind of do a you know lollygagging around and all that kind of stuff and then on the 12th day you know, then when time has gotten away from us and we realize oh my gosh is doing two days. They will start the painting. And that's the thing. i'm you know if you don't see the benefit of course you like to do it, I don't see no benefit in it wow. now see the video and clean up this feel on this counter that. Because see this is the thing. I oh oui oui this, the thing the people can see your spiel bacchanal by the CEO procrastination."
16686.0,Patient,Interest yes true.
740.0,Provider,"So yeah i'm going to clean up because you know I you know these things can be seen. But if you procrastinate don't know I don't know, but you. it's a hidden secret. So that means you can keep you can keep procrastinating you know the crazy part about it is, is it as long. As you turn to your side me that's all that matters why because people will see your Professor will see the my my son was completed, however, he will see that i've been procrastinating for the past 10 days. And that I have to, and then I went into a panic attack when I realized, it was due, and I didn't have my research journey and I really had to stay up late at night and I couldn't sleep. And to myself, was done and he he didn't seem that today all he sees is the finished product and see if you clean up your i'm saying, then at the end of the day, it allows it to to to. To. It allows others who you are to see the finished product, but they didn't see what it looked like before you claimed it."
16686.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"And people can see it so that means yeah I gotta clean it up, so people can see it, I can see it I don't want to see it, and I know other people to see it, but my procrastination to say that they just see my finished product. Right, so I gotta change why I gotta change something came by to see. But you can see. But you can see it, though. we'll see, this is a modern. Oh, you tolerate it is so much salsa where it becomes take a picture. it's like yeah I can see it, but you know I know what to do. I know what to do right i've had enough panic attacks Hello. There hi you know I keep doing what i'm doing and then."
16686.0,Patient,"I guess, I think it also comes back around to like you know, having better willpower. So i'm hoping that after like doing more like. Like these degas and drills and like conditioning myself. But I. Hope like what the willpower just like staying on task and like what I do is start early I continue with it, rather than I don't know going to YouTube or something."
740.0,Provider,So. What can we do different. What do you think.
16686.0,Patient,"By now continued like trying out like the break method, I think what i'll probably start doing is a. Meeting, starting at like giving myself longer breaks, but shortly like. Lowering the break times as soon as I get into the habit I guess."
740.0,Provider,"yeah you don't want you don't want to put too much on yourself too bad it's, especially if you're not. um. yeah, especially if you're not. What is the word news to doing it. If you're not used to doing it is know what is no point in trying to take on too much too fast."
16686.0,Patient,let's see.
740.0,Provider,"So if you push yourself. that's why I say, even if you distracted and you do your schoolwork you i'm saying, and you get distracted wondering your schoolwork it's okay Lisa doing it to work but it's not going to get distracted because that's what you used to do it. It just it just more so, being able to pull it back when it's time."
16686.0,Patient,gotcha okay.
740.0,Provider,"Melissa data you'll have to have an opinion and you'll have a little bit of an American thing and those little hats wits and on this kind of stuff. yeah when I was in college, I used to do, I used to write papers, with the TV oh."
16686.0,Patient,Really.
740.0,Provider,yeah because it seemed like I couldn't do I couldn't it was crazy like I literally would I literally will do my homework better with TV oh.
16686.0,Patient,That wasn't distracting at all.
740.0,Provider,"nope because yo and the crazy like if I would do without anything like I either have a TV oh Oh, I had like music to my ears so like that more so the TV on. And I would you know, and when I will take a break from writing I didn't have to go nowhere, I will just look up and I was watching before a little bit. And then I go back to writing or were really it was kinda like a soothing thing I know is weird but I didn't have to see it to hear it. So it was like my music."
16686.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"So yeah I literally did it, oh no alyssa APP our past I got I mean, I made a."
16686.0,Patient,you're here yeah.
740.0,Provider,"I mean, I think my GPA was a three point saving something no, no, but uh but yeah literally that's how I got through Grad school. I would do right my papers. With the TV. i'll tell you."
16686.0,Patient,The words.
740.0,Provider,"yeah now undergrad is too far to remember, I can't obey but. For right yeah yes, I do. So. To eliminate the distractions out together when you're not accustomed to, that is no point because that what that does is that it puts that puts too much pressure on you to be in nature, not that you haven't attained yet."
16686.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"And if you never attained it and to and to put that kind of pressure on yourself, of course, you want to over break, of course, you're not going to come back when you need to."
16686.0,Patient,make sense.
740.0,Provider,"So try. To do your work. and Try to do your work after notes note try to do your work. Earlier, even if you get distracted just keep just just try to find your way to go back to it."
16686.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,"now try to do that. First. And then, once we made these once we see each other again they you can tell me hi nice to you know, I was able to get a lot me, I was able to get some work done yeah they get distracted but I was able to put myself back in. And then we start with the other stuff down the road, because sometimes we kind of saw a little by little and that's fine. Of course, right. yeah so um so yeah just try it check to see if you have the potential. to pull yourself back in from getting distracted or if it was like it was too, or if it was too difficult for you to have more challenging for you to pull yourself back in after you got district."
16686.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"And that just that's just part of kind of practicing. That is that just part of practicing. Self control, instead of this. And, to see if you can, I think you can but I don't know if you think you gain. But what do you think."
16686.0,Patient,"not too sure um I think I kind of need more time to practice, and then I guess i'll be able to like come to conclusion later yeah. i'm definitely willing to like continue trying to help."
740.0,Provider,Okay. So how's everything been since. Last week.
