The lady I spoke with I told her that I was having those thoughts and feelings. But she wanted to put me into a I forgot the name of the facility.

And aside House, who was able to get you on out and get you in the right direction and i'm happy i'm happy to hear that so Mr haven't let me ask you this growing up what was your family life, like going up."
16906.0,Patient,"So growing up my father died at a very young, when I was a very young age, I was nine years old, so my my mom raised me my two older brothers. On her own hands Thank you so much to her growing up, I saw my mom working all the time. and The little time she had left when she wasn't working she did spend with us, she cooked for us so she you know she did it because she wanted to. provide for us. Which, which I appreciate greatly. In that environment, though it's my my mom instilled in all of us at a very early age that everybody has to pull their weight. So we're always working hard always making sure no we did our tours and and things like that she kept she kept us all three of us a very narrow path like we none of us, you know gang affiliations, when I. Listen we're we're sneaking out at night, and you know. I think she did a great job in. gaming meeting the household. I did struggle, a lot with missing my father I didn't have a father figure my mom tried to be both. For us, I didn't understand it at the time, so I I grew up. kind of shying away from relationships. Because I knew from from that moment that I could lose whatever person is always had a hard time connecting with people I had a lot of friends, I was friendly. But I never wanted to connect with people because it felt like I could lose them and I don't want I didn't want to go through that hardship again. It took me a lot of years to come to that realization when I was going through it, I didn't know that's what it was, but I like to. i'd like to think a lot, I like to think on my life I like to reflect and see what I can improve upon. So, after many, many years i've come to realize that had a lot to do with my upbringing, I did feel sad a lot, when I was when I was growing up because of that those major sadness for me. i've come full circle come to realize like I mentioned what it was what you know what affected me, so I don't have that I don't have those feelings anymore i'll get occasional sadness. Because of my father not being here, and you know what did I miss out on but nothing that I dwell upon nothing that I that I think Oh, you know my life was terrible growing up. So I feel kind of have a good baseline for myself, I kind of have my head on an okay place. Just because i've done a lot of self reflecting growing up."
740.0,Provider,"lily kudos to mom okay. who wrote the mama for right, you can for now."
16906.0,Patient,"yeah well, it was three of us my mom did eventually remarried when I was about 13. I didn't connect too much with my stepfather I did have a terrible relationship with them. But you know I just saw him as a stepfather. I never called him dad you know our it's called him by his name, he was my mom's partner and I respected him for that, but. outside of that my mom was both my father and my mother."
740.0,Provider,"Be tomorrow it's a it's a strong one me. To move a husband first off. And then to raise children on her own for the extended period, it should be. So kudos to mom for that i'm so happy that you felt like. They did, even though there wasn't there but mom never missed a beat. Right, I think that's amazing. Are you feel. Is your relationship feel good with your mom and your sibling."
16906.0,Patient,"Yes, it's actually been the best it's ever been. Up to this point. yeah when I started having these feelings of anxiety and breaking down they quickly became my support system they quickly talk to me, you know help me made me feel at ease. Nothing that I was going through was a burden to them. They were they were there immediately."
740.0,Provider,"that's amazing so you do have this support system from your family, what do."
16906.0,Patient,"I do, I do and i'm also married, so my spouse is a great support system."
740.0,Provider,"You got it all together, you got mama but you. got a wife, I mean we are. Okay, so. did anyone if anyone in your home every struggle with mental health substance abuse or any eating disorder or any other addictive behaviors."
16906.0,Patient,"My smile, so my sister my younger sister. my sister she did struggle through that in her late teenage years she's now 24. But she went through through something like that she's gone through therapy she's currently seeing a therapist so she's she's on a lot better place outside of that no."
740.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and she went through mental health issues. And so, how was school for you what was cool like."
16906.0,Patient,"School is great like I mentioned, I had I had many, many friends. I, like my personality is kind of free flowing I like. To make me laugh I like to you know joke around like I never took. things too seriously when it came to my own personality, I took school serious enough to graduate and i'd go through some college, but as far as personality wise I I like to be a fun person. yeah again. at a distance, because I didn't have close close relationships, I went my schooling was a few cities away so I busted school so whatever friends, I had was outside of my. Living city, so at the end of the school, I would go home and then you know no friends, I didn't really have friends that would go home take care of my the chores like I mentioned that whole make sure my homework was done all the home things so be school good time fun times home work."
740.0,Provider,"Basically, and did you I mean did you ever consider or did you ever see you saved in this frame."
16906.0,Patient,"For some time, because my siblings are six and nine years apart, when I started being older, they were already moving on with their lives moving. out so my my younger sister was my closest relationship, and we continue to have a really close relationship."
740.0,Provider,"So, in your neighborhood where they're not like using a neighborhood or."
16906.0,Patient,"anything like that there were there were some and I made some acquaintances but like I mentioned, I never really wanted to want it. I guess, I think one thing you like you like to. write, so I think I I stopped them myself from becoming. too deep friendship."
740.0,Provider,"mason and you didn't complete a high school I heard you say yes i'm college. And, did you ever struggle with any learning disabilities and go. No okay good deal and Miss average to serve in the military now."
16906.0,Patient,I did not.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you currently have any financial or any legal issues you're concerned about."
16906.0,Patient,"No, no, maybe I don't know. My wife and I recently purchased a home, six months ago. Okay, so i'm not having financial trouble, I just have the the weight of a more knowing, I have a mortgage on me."
740.0,Provider,"And not only do you have a mortgage to have it, but you have a mortgage in California."
16906.0,Patient,and
740.0,Provider,"No, I don't live in California i'm in the great State of Texas. So learn so from that's a huge weight that you got a mortgage. In camel right born yeah. So apparently yeah must be doing pretty well with. It and get a mortgage again."
16906.0,Patient,"Right. In California yeah yes. My my position at work is one of management ahead of my department so i'm able to i'm Okay, but. that's what led to the point where I got to because just the. What initially set it off was there was a reduction in staff so many scrambling to make up for that loss of a person just added more work to me and that's. When it all just. came right in front of me. Some with that coupled with knowing, I have to sustain a family i've seen a mortgage that's."
740.0,Provider,You know that's what I love about. him is that.
16906.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
740.0,Provider,"And I think one of the hardest things for people that are in managerial position is the fact that realized that over to me and people have walked off the job. Who, and so I think every business has kept me here in the crazy part about is just like you save it, you know we're in the manager position you send a leader position, maybe you gotta you gotta hold the line. Right exactly saying and so there's a lot. There is a lot. And I can see. Where. Where the anxiety and the panic of take him from. However, i'm saying, as my boy universe, but I do have suggestions and tips you're not my only you're not my only client who has this issue. And someone to give I want you to try out something first and just tell me if it's doable and then that way, I know how to better maneuver moving forward so i'm offended a nice person first and then we'll talk about we'll talk more about the the job stress. Okay um Hello have your wife made."
16906.0,Patient,Going on 12 years.
740.0,Provider,We have any children.
16906.0,Patient,"Two children, yes."
740.0,Provider,And so what is something you want to work on why you hear me.
16906.0,Patient,"I honestly don't know I mean like like I mentioned in my in my survey, this is the first time i've come to fix something like this, so I don't know what what tools to look for. Ultimately, I don't want to feel this I mean that's the ultimate goal I don't want to feel anxiety or stress I I know those feelings exist for everybody at different points in their life, but the level that i'm feeling. Well, let me, let me say this i've this week i've have felt a lot better. I I. My support system my family, you know I speak to them on a daily how i'm doing what i'm doing. How. You know, whatever is going on, that has helped me to bring me down a lot of levels i've been sleeping a lot better. I haven't gotten a full night's rest yet. But i'm working on it, I can see improvement just just on my own. I am taking lexapro."
740.0,Provider,"Firstly, I was, I was living with a to identify who your provider would."
16906.0,Patient,Not lexapro excuse me. tries it down.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, if it works or know."
16906.0,Patient,"It helps me fall asleep, initially, but then I wake up at. Like three or four in the morning and the neck I have trouble falling back to sleep after that. Okay. Sometimes I do fall asleep, but on all the time."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, like I mentioned it."
16906.0,Patient,Like I mentioned it's been it's been getting better i've been sleeping. i've been finding that i've been sleeping more as the days progress.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm and what's on the US is going to be.
16906.0,Patient,About 930 to 10.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and they would do, then you end up with three or four."
16906.0,Patient,"yep correct and so like I said, sometimes I ended up falling back asleep, maybe a half hour later. And then I wake up at five to prepare for work."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm working on more tired now, and do you feel like you're more rested."
16906.0,Patient,I feel more rested. I definitely don't worry.
740.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm a little i'm a little place for us i'm not gonna meet you i'm awake. Okay, so i'd be put down basically how to manage will work on and we'll discuss how to manage anxiety and stress, so this is what i'm going he is in this is a thing. As a manager i'm sure you feel like you got a whole line you got to cope with the department you got to do all these you got to fill in the blanks you got to coach the whole do I do all this kind of stuff. yeah and i'm sure i'm sure that's a party i'm sure that's the part of your responsibility i'm sure, and even even if what are your thoughts i'm sure you make it your responsibility. Correct now, the issue is that you can only do what you can do. So this one i'm gonna tell you, you got to know your land ID. and your and the thing about it is, let me look at me look at my face when we go up. To someone and say okay you got to know your limits right you started now us out there means you almost 40. Okay. Look, you have to know your limits and see a lot of times since your mom in field work ethic in you all. And that you give it all you've got and that you don't come up short in that you don't let manager I would never tell you this like I would never say you to have do a thing I would never say to come up short but what I am saying that you got to know your limits."
16906.0,Patient,"yeah so that was a cold hard reality when this happened that's. Yes, I realized it's my body telling me hey. You need a breathy."
740.0,Provider,"You need a break and messy and i'ma tell you some be honest, which is good, I like that, if they if they say, if you find a director for you can try to school so Moses, and feel forced upon you played it for. Right and so, if anything, if anything, you need to take things off of your plate."
16906.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"So if that means as a manager, if you see somebody who is trustworthy and who has good potential and things like that, so that means you say part of managing is being able to properly delegate. Right delegate give it to other people, young saying it don't mean obviously the risky bet that and I remember my mom, no, no, no that's not what they made. Because the thing about it is, is that, even as a good leader i'm sure like your sales you're saying they didn't give you their position, just because i'm sure that you have shown it, you have proven to be a good leader. And so, even as a good leader you're saying, maybe you're able to identify other good leaders in your department, so you can delegate. Right give it to other people, because how many people do you mean."
16906.0,Patient,"Currently, five."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so that means instead of you've taken all. seven. Seven roll by yourself, we can delegate so that means we can have, we need to have a fast meeting, we need to have a team meeting I don't know if you got to bring some people, some people in some bonus before you. load them they new words, the new the new job and. I don't know, maybe you got a little people or something this album but all I know is is that you can take this on yourself you're going to have to delegate. Right, so if that means you got to take a step back and you have to look at the department and what the department me. And how you can take off your plate because we're not at the place you've already put more on your plate that's not what i'm here for i'm here, so you. Provide your perspective of how to take things off of your plate because right now, even though you still in beta and we got the medication this code, but the thing about it is I don't want the same thing to happen twice. So that rain. Between now and the next time we meet you go and tell me how you been taking things off of your plate."
16906.0,Patient,"OK, I can do this."
740.0,Provider,"And so I want to, I want to know the next time we meet of like nice you get for your gift what I said, this is my plate, I took a day off. I worked half day on this day me the keys went over here and me and the wife had a date night that's what I want to hear. Right taking things off of your plate making more spending more time with your family have been baked night with your wife yeah be made between you. me that that makes you want to be pursued even up out of time Okay, I mean you know I don't know what it is about sleeping getting comfortable but. But but being able to take off being able to take off your workplace but add more. And more on to your home plate like more okay well how can I take away from my workplace live in a more my main which okay well how can I take off my workplace within a would this be more how old are your children."
16906.0,Patient,They are 12 and 13.
740.0,Provider,"yeah but so spend more time with my children, young saying info, mind you it's not it's not taking from one and then just leaving it no it's taking from one, so that you can have energy to add to other places. Right right your home life and your family, I mean that that that is just as important as your work, and so the crazy part about it is distress that you have on your projects and your family to me means you're not coming alive like he used to so then keep living my, why did. Why did you and your wife, are the big China trying to figure things out, you know i'm saying, because the thing about it is, is that your project that strip on your family because they look at you, and they realize what he will. My husband is not not the not the energetic man that I made it. For me, you know what you were looking like well why did he did not doing what he used to do. Right and so death death death that's what I want us to start. Okay, so as you think about it is, is that I believe that, even with the five people that you have says, you are their manager and, since you are their leader, that means you have equip them so that you can be able to delegate. When there is a me that all mean i've been to the rescue their means, who can who can I am or who can appoint. To meet this need this matchy. matchy who can I point. Okay that's that's what I want you to start working on appointing delegating and taking stuff off your plate we're going to start there."
16906.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"crime and then you'll be surprised, of how your family response when you say how to come up with on a day, a day. Well, so like you're saying, but but but because what happens is is that I want you to be able to add more stress free activities to your life. And i'm sure your wife don't stress you out I hope not."
16906.0,Patient,To go.
740.0,Provider,"To the hokey as soon as that it's like okay good if you're saying it seemed as if you know you love your family and you do things and you work really hard you know i'm saying to be able to. To have to give your family, the best life possible, which is amazing this out, I applaud you for that you know it takes a good you don't have to me to give me and I here. And so the fact that you're doing that for your family I think it's huge and so. kudos to you for that, however, I want you to be able to be there for you can do, though, is one thing to provide for your family and not be able to be there for your family, I want you to be able to provide and be there."
16906.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,So anytime you can do both.
16906.0,Patient,"You can do about yeah I I think most of my working career, I focus too much on work and I do realize that it's almost like i'm borrowing my family's time to work more with that."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, because you can you can do both and it comes with delegating. You got to trust the people. That you lead. And if you came to us from being replaced."
16906.0,Patient,"always told me, I have to."
740.0,Provider,"But I mean I mean, but the thing about it that's what that's what we start because honestly, mind you, that i'm not going to call this the easy fix. But this is a lighter case. we've been what i've had right because this one can actually this one can actually be resolved. Just based just based off of you taken off your tape. and Take this time to look at your department to look at your employees. And to figure out. How can we make the department function efficiently and effectively without me taking going so much. So that's what I wanted to do."
16906.0,Patient,Okay i'll take the homework assignment.
740.0,Provider,"Thank you appreciate it so let's go ahead and schedule your next session. I want to see you again, of course, because I want to I really I really believe they.
