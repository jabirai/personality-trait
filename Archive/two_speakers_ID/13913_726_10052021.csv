13913.0,Patient,"Alright, Stephen King so she has a lot of mental problems, so my husband has done like he'll get panic attacks he'll get and sometimes he'll just kind of get a build up, and I can usually feel it when they're coming on. And it seemed like with the coven it just really made him extra paranoid so he's always afraid that, like it like his whole biggest fear is that i'm going to go to this get through this RT school and i'm going to like leave them for a doctor like weirdest freakin paranoia is like. he's not on anything like he's actually through the ages program so he's he takes suboxone to, but he does it through the other program that I used to do it with yeah. Anyway, just becomes a handful and with. Dealing with school and stuff and then he he I could feel them so because I was I kept telling them like maybe we maybe you should call your counselor you know because i'm like you're paranoid starting to you know i'm just honest with him when I can feel our tents that come up so. Wednesday you just complete well, I guess, whatever day that was that I was supposed to do my meeting with you that was his name that he had at one of his explosion days, where he could just."
726.0,Provider,be like.
13913.0,Patient,"There was it's just like impossible like he's a straight case you know i'm not like that he's not suicidal but he just becomes straight crazy and it's it almost like I know it passes, but. i'm just his object of like what is the, what do you want to call it like he doesn't treat anybody else like that i'm i'm sort of the punching bag when he does explode to that level. And so that day it was like I had so many assignments do that I couldn't even my eyes were so swollen from crying so much because he just can be really hurtful. With his words you know what I mean, and so, but I knew I mean i'm not ever like scared of him it's just more of like an emotional thing or like screaming and just and. So I don't know it seemed like the code made it like way worse and then with him like i'm supposed to be driving him back to work on Thursday, finally, after all these weeks he's been out luckily he's like still got his payroll checks and stuff like that so. But it was like it's just been like super scary because it's been like taken forever and then there's a lot of like people will call it like they're getting cloudiness or something or they're having like this mental fog go on. and his kind of triggered is anxiety and Hispanic and his. Just and depression really like he kind of all in one so he's he's definitely feeling better this week, I mean. And that's one thing about it, too, is once he, like does that explosion then like hours later, when he finally comes down he's super apologetic and. that's when I finally came back to him i'm like this, I felt you coming on for like a couple of weeks, you know I felt it coming on that's why I kept suggesting because I said I can't be your punching bag for forever, you know. And we've been married for 19 years but it's like that's not fair to me yeah. yeah i'm like. i'm like i'm smarter than that i'm going through the school for like us not for you to like think that i'm doing this for some ulterior motive or. yeah you know. So it was just that's what happened so and then I was so scared like because I literally had like I was like in and out of the hospital with him is pull socks I kept it like checking on it, and it was like going down to 86 and they usually intubate people at like 82 so I was. super getting nervous, but then I was falling behind in my studies, I just felt like a lot of pressure, you know."
726.0,Provider,With yeah.
13913.0,Patient,"One on but anyway, this week, spent a lot better. Some."
726.0,Provider,"Well you're a lot going on with cuz you have school kids and the kids are yeah cool and all this other stuff so. Right, how is he feeling a little more settled with the kids being in their routine. yeah."
13913.0,Patient,"That that's this week has gone way better way in all very well in terms of the kids are finally back into the swing of it. I still haven't brought CD and just because i'm not gonna pay that daycare those daycare days, if I don't have to so she's able to just stay with Gary but i'm supposed to be driving him, the only thing I wanted to know if I need to talk to the doctor about."
726.0,Provider,yeah but.
13913.0,Patient,"I there's not a pharmacy like in the Bay area that's why I tried to when I first signed up, I tried to get it through walmart so I could easily flip flop, because I am in the Bay area, a lot like we only have two cars. So my daughter state my 18 year old daughter will sometimes stay, so that I can like drive my husband like he can't i'm going to drive in there, just in case it's like a three hour drive so. And he goes to work, like all weekend so i'm supposed to be taking them on Thursday morning, which I could still do like my Friday session like that's no big deal, but I, but I just worry about not getting my script for Friday. Because, if I am down there there's only one pharmacy in my town that I can get my script from. And I can't like if i'm in the Bay area like I. can't get it from anywhere down there does that make sense."
726.0,Provider,"yeah no that doesn't make sense, so. Usually on the Friday groups do you when he does the resellers and he sends about it that that Friday that guys go get it or yeah okay."
13913.0,Patient,"I do my like i'm pretty much out by every Friday i'm pretty much out and then I pick it up Friday night, so that I have it again for Saturday, when I need it i'm not really I mean I have it for Friday, but then i'm after Friday does that make sense, so I don't know. Saturday Sunday, I don't I like."
726.0,Provider,Which pharmacy or do you want it to be transferred to that we can send that out.
13913.0,Patient,"that the only one that I can go to in town, because I guess it's a controlled substance is crystal pharmacy so it's my regular pharmacy but. I know, when my daughter had surgery, because I opted to go in the Bay area because I hadn't be down there anyway, so I I opted to have her surgery done but, like my pharmacist is actually pretty cool he has allowed me before to pick it up like a day early you know he went it went ahead. With the doctor's notes. yeah so I don't know. If if you know, hopefully he'll, allow me to do that again, so I can because, like I said we just have the two vehicles, right now, so one of. my daughter helps me get the other kids to school, while I can drive Gary to his yak so."
726.0,Provider,"If you want, so we, we have an option, you can tell me which pharmacies, like you, like the medications that we set out to, and I can send off an email now and because we're still at the beginning of the week so there's plenty of time to get it set up. Or you or you can wait till group on Friday and and let him know and he can send it off to be on the prescriber that you would want to me the place where you would want to pick it up."
13913.0,Patient,"Well, I won't be here, potentially until late Friday night i'm. Dr Gary down on Thursday, so I won't be like, so I won't be able to get it, or even not till Saturday, it just depends he's supposed to work Friday because he's been out so long that he was going to work. But he he I do have to return him, he was just going to probably try for like a short week of just working a half day Thursday and then he was going to work Friday and then Saturday and then. He has to actually come back to his doctorate ages, on Sunday, so I needed to drive him back up this way, but the only the only pharmacy I can pick up at his Christmas crystal pharmacy. yeah and there's not there's only in its that we have a hospital it's our local hospital pharmacy."
726.0,Provider,Okay there's not.
13913.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"What I could do is I can send on Dr want a message um he's pretty good about getting back to people, so if you're okay with me. him calling you or something like that. Oh yeah yeah. Alright yeah."
13913.0,Patient,that'll work.
726.0,Provider,So you need to pick it up early basically yeah so I.
13913.0,Patient,"I could pick it up Thursday, then I can drive Gary down I don't have to worry about, just in case because. they're limited on there they're open in the mornings on Saturdays that's why I usually go ahead and describe it Fridays. And the pharmacist, I know i've heard of everybody else complaining about pharmacist, but i'm actually pretty lucky like. Even when my doctor sends it over like my my pharmacist fills it or he, like they're pretty good about even one time, I actually actually missed a meeting. And they had it ready for me like early that morning but they're only open like for a few hours, like on Saturday so they're just limited on hours like I know some pharmacies are open like. Every day of the week, and it makes it a lot simpler, but yeah so but I don't want to complain because, like the pharmacy himself is like super cool like he's not like, I know, everybody else was like dealing with such horrific annoying yeah. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Well, I mean, I think the thing with the pharmacies, too, is like some of these pharmacist, even though they're in pharmacy and that's their job there's a lot of judgment and not a lot of understanding of addiction and or anything like that so. I know I am not surprised hearing that i'm honestly not surprised I."
13913.0,Patient,Right.
726.0,Provider,"i've heard i've heard plenty of people have. Really negative experiences with doctors, nurses and most of them are."
13913.0,Patient,"Like against it and it's just their their lack of really yeah I. I totally I literally probably my i'm actually quite personal with my pharmacist even like I didn't actually call the doctors on all Gary situations, even this whole coven thing I just felt my pharmacist. I if I had a question I only called him so he's so I kind of have a personal relationship with him, but he's super knowledgeable I feel like he's more knowledgeable. Then, even sometimes we we end up like our primary doctor is supposed to be one doctor well they switch hands, it seems like every six months, where we have a new and it's not a primary doctor it's actually a physician's assistant, so we have. A every every five or six months and I can't ever even remember their names, and so I just don't really have that trust in him, but, however. i've used the same pharmacist for. You know all the for number of years, so I just didn't have my pharmacist and he's super knowledgeable. And I don't think he's never like at first, because that was one actually That was one thing that I was kind of like oh crap he's going to know, and I just felt like he was going to perhaps pass judgment because i've gone through ages, but we pick up our scripts over there and ages so. Personal I kind of felt like oh God is this going to ruin my relationship is going to judge me different and. No, not at all like he's. super super I much I feel like i'm pretty lucky in terms of in terms of pharmacies and pharmacist for sure."
726.0,Provider,Well that's pretty that's good.
13913.0,Patient,"I was worried about that too yeah. yeah totally it's it's. Common for sure it's not common. yeah but. he's got maybe he had family members or something so he understands it, you know what I mean because that's usually, when people can have some empathy or some sympathy in the areas if they have gone through themselves or they have family members that have. Standing about the situation so."
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so. i'm glad that you are having a better week, the last week. Like oh you're like you're happy go lucky and last week, I was like I don't know if this is right, maybe like."
13913.0,Patient,"Literally since I started school, only four of these workouts are since I began already midway through the Semester now we're next week we're literally halfway through the Semester. And I will have four full day for half days of where my two year olds been watched so that's really, really hard like In fact I. i'm supposed to go down it's like under a new facility that i'm going to use that are open like because I was doing this in home that I knew of this this person personally, but because of code like. purple facility or like a couple of kids she had in her home for six so she had to close. down so. And then between and every single one of my kids did have posted as well, so."
726.0,Provider,I went ahead and made sure.
13913.0,Patient,"That I that I waited because when I I actually bought the home Gary went in also for his confirm test, but I bought it when I."
726.0,Provider,that's positive.
13913.0,Patient,"Within like three minutes of performing the nasal little testing, I mean it came up so quick so quick. That it was they were all positive so as soon as I confirm that everybody was positive, I. I sort of started self quarantining and especially my family members. I didn't ever amazingly test myself, because I didn't want to, I had a couple of symptoms but I could literally could not miss school, so I just made sure I like stayed way way for everybody i've gotten i've gotten the vaccine for it."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13913.0,Patient,"And I didn't feel like super bad, but I definitely like lost my sense of smell, but I don't want to say nothing because I literally couldn't miss likes I did miss end up missing two classes, but like labs and stuff like you can't like miss a lab like that's super important. yeah, and so I kind of stayed away from everybody and told them that listen i'm i'm I feel fine, but like people in my home, so I went ahead and but at least I didn't have to miss out on on that knowledge, you know because I can better burner i'm a better like hands on type learner anyway. yeah so. it'd be hard for me to get what I can get in class out of like reading it out of a book like I can't get the same you know what I mean."
726.0,Provider,it's not yeah.
13913.0,Patient,it's just not.
726.0,Provider,"Well, so yeah. I know, like last week, you were saying how things were happening with your husband and everything, but if that. ever happens, please, I know. You know, like there's no judgment, if you ever need to talk, please just you can call virtual clinic and even if you missed the appointment i'll if I have time and I don't have any one scheduled i'd be happy to see you because they know some time. To talk."
13913.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, but the thing is, though, is like I have been convinced me so i'm able to talk to you about this now because we're actually very private about because he likes to paint this picture that were like perfect So for me to even if you for you to know what I just told you even."
726.0,Provider,i'm like hiding in the bar because I can't.
13913.0,Patient,"So that I would have probably called well for one I can talk that Dallas he was. He had a bad episode that day that was really bad episode that whole day not like I didn't feel scared at all for like that, but it was just like he was complete like I I could see that that is and he I could see it as the mental case that it is, I guess, I could say and i've been. known for so long that I kind of know the the pattern, you know. But well I, and I will say that I, I do realize oh my mom like I will tell my mom so I know I called my mom like on my way to school, one day, and she she always kind of gives me like. she's like don't worry you just gotta keep pushing through and she's like honestly I don't know how you she always thinks, I should just like leave him or something like that too. Much, but I do, I am able to. Like mentor cousin she's. she's always like well, let me just help with the kids i'll just come grab safety or then because, on Saturday, she did she took like all the kids and I was able to. To really like devote like six hours to studying, so I do I do rely on her, but I can't sometimes like I can't like if if he were to know that I wouldn't even I mean he would be really."
726.0,Provider,So that was that.
13913.0,Patient,The other hard thing is usually he's like if i've noticed he's very obsessive very obsessive have a husband like if I when i'm at school he'll text me 20 times.
726.0,Provider,30 times yeah.
13913.0,Patient,You know when are you gonna be on i'd like you said you're going to be home in an hour and a half. I didn't know that this class was three hours it's like well they're all three hours every single one of them and i'm literally like I don't go anywhere I don't get dressed up I don't go anywhere but he's very paranoid.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13913.0,Patient,"I mean he's a super good husband, but it seemed like when he kind of with this coven thing, and he lost a lot of his own self or he just got depressed I don't know how to how."
726.0,Provider,I don't know.
13913.0,Patient,But it really it lowered his self confidence and.
726.0,Provider,"He was just paranoid, so it was just."
13913.0,Patient,"A rough week and I don't like usually, when he's like at work or something i'm able to go ahead and talk about something where I could I would have been able to like home but because he's been home right there right next to me it makes it. A little bit deeper. into I don't you don't want to don't be I didn't want anybody to know you know my business and it's like well you've actually quite made it mine but Okay, you know."
726.0,Provider,i'd yeah.
13913.0,Patient,You know what I mean yeah or.
726.0,Provider,"The lack of control when you're sick and not being able to you know, do the things that you're used to doing on your oldest. Just frustrating i'm sure yeah."
13913.0,Patient,"Oh absolutely like even from I mean even he's he's got serious severe and he tries to work through it, but I mean his control issues are like so bad like. he's one of those that like even if i'm if i'm the one driving he'll be scared the whole entire time because not having that control even. To not be the driver like he's he's very he only has trust almost like within himself, you know he used in augie so bad, and then, once we started until the whole drug scene."
726.0,Provider,Then he's been there.
13913.0,Patient,"was a few episodes that he. kind of lost the trust in me, not that I ever lied cheated on him, not that I ever did. But I lied and I abused, drugs and I didn't tell him that I was abusing and then, when I came clean, I can link to them well ever since then it's almost like this has been six years but ever since then. In the back of his mind, he has this feeling that I just made and honestly it's people in himself he's done the. same exact thing so then that while I was trying to encourage him. To you know, like deal with it through his counselors and stuff like that, like that I am in the same way that I do but we're just it's really hard for him to let loose up that of his own. yeah it's one controlling issues you know, but even though yeah totally. And he'll always realized that like he was super apologetic and because, at first, I was like I mean I. don't really think you want me to go through that he was trying to tell me to quit and i'm like. This is the reason why I will, I will make sure I get my independence back because I won't remain in that situation like I won't stay married if you were to behave like that all the time, I would definitely leave them."
726.0,Provider,there's just no way.
13913.0,Patient,"there's no way you're not fair to me and it's not fair to the kids to live in like a tension filled, we all have to walk on eggshells, because we don't know if dad's gonna have an episode or not."
726.0,Provider,Like I make him run through.
13913.0,Patient,"It otherwise you know, all the more reason why I need to get through this freakin school and be like get my independence back again. yeah but i'm doing it. For us, but I also I don't want to be like I don't need I don't want to have to depend on and it scared me to like with this illness, because i'm like what if something were to happen him and I I can't like provide for my kids even I mean i've just been staying at home. I mean I 15 years and I had a really good job, but then I quit that and went back to school, but it's been like nine years literally I started school nine years ago and i'm just now able to finish out hopefully finish out this program."
726.0,Provider,So i'm just not gonna let it loose.
13913.0,Patient,"Now that i've worked so hard. To get here, you know what I mean yeah. i'm doing. Thanks I am maybe me so."
726.0,Provider,"I give you so much credit, you have your kids you have your husband and here in school, it is not easy to do all those things at the same time, so give yourself a pat on the. back too seriously it's not it's not easy yeah."
13913.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you yeah and thank God for like the suboxone because I really don't see my mind in my old world would have gone to probably substance abuse, had I gone through a week like that."
726.0,Provider,But I.
13913.0,Patient,"don't want to ever go there, my mind and that's what I worry about with Gary because he'll always reminisce Why did we do this, or what and i'm like I never."
726.0,Provider,"looked back, whether it be a bad thing, I never think about the good of."
13913.0,Patient,It because there was a lot of good of it to you know.
726.0,Provider,To the. Statement of like i'm going to try i'm going to get away with that was a weird excitement I don't have explained yeah no I from that.
13913.0,Patient,"Just in itself just sneaking a summit and. You know. And you know, but he will always like reminisce and i'm like I have to move on, like I don't even allow I feel like that was way back when I used to be like some fair or something like way in some other I was like a turtle that I was like I live. It doesn't occur into my mind and thank God for. suboxone that's why i'm so thankful for it because my mind will never it honestly like never even going through that week that I went through last week, I never ever ever think God like I drink would be so that are gone, you know what if I yeah."
726.0,Provider,Like.
13913.0,Patient,"His sacrifice or. If I could just like get a pill, right now, or you know what I mean like my. Ever, thank God, because I really firmly believe it's just because of the suboxone that I don't. Have that has I guarantee you I. don't underestimate I don't ever let those walls down to like disregard that because I know for a fact that I found myself deep into a lot of different things and i'd be like how did I even get here, you know but i'm. super self aware of it now, and even when I do have those rough weeks like i'm super aware of like thank God for like this medicine, because I would probably have gone off the deep end. Like seriously."
726.0,Provider,So yeah.
13913.0,Patient,"Did I miss Oh, I was gonna ask you two things so yeah. keep telling me that my. urine sample should be in however it's it's still hasn't came in. I need to get like stickers on my on my mailbox but i've got one before, so I know that the it does arrive."
726.0,Provider,Let me check yeah. i'm going to check into your chart and see because it'll save it mailed out or webinar.
13913.0,Patient,"Or maybe that doctor I know the doctor had said, like last week or something he's like you should be receiving one and then, when I was just on the phone with the. check in people, they were like Oh, you should have your thing i'm like yeah they keep saying I should have it, but I haven't got it yet so it."
726.0,Provider,looks like. When was the last time you got one I.
13913.0,Patient,"seems like I just have well because I went in literally because I was kind of I couldn't make it in, so I did that blood sampling and I did the urine test and then literally like a week. But I didn't do it was already in the program for like three weeks before I was able to finally go down and do that, so it was literally like a week later, that I got my first at home one."
726.0,Provider,Oh. So.
13913.0,Patient,"But it doesn't seem like it was maybe it's been I don't know my mind so like. Think that's okay. i'm I don't even remember the last time that I, I feel like it's I was surprised I was like dang it's already been a month already."
726.0,Provider,"Right, but I figured. I would talk to virtual because when I see on the screen right now is if there was one that was sent in August that was."
13913.0,Patient,August 28.
726.0,Provider,"yeah, but there is nothing else in here, so you should have I don't think the it doesn't look like anything was sent so it's weird. So I would talk to them and sin let them know that."
13913.0,Patient,They can reach them on if me okay.
726.0,Provider,"yeah that's the last one, you know you talk to your counselor and on your chart and so that the last one that was delivered was in August and it's October, so there should be something coming in there."
13913.0,Patient,"Absolutely OK OK. And then I forgot The other thing I was gonna ask you about Oh, is there anything else that i've missed so, then I know that i've literally everything's been due to the stupid freaking coven thing I swear you. know there wasn't that I was in the er like all day with Gary That was when his pulse ox super fell and he was very, very, very sick so i've missed. A Friday group men that I hold on this one of the appointments with you but. That was your last week on other than that is there anything else that i've missed."
726.0,Provider,um let me see so. September 29 was on the data that we talked about already. September 23 also it was a no show and September 17 no show the group. So there was.
13913.0,Patient,There was another one that I missed on the 23rd.

13913.0,Patient,"All that was all. When we were all super sick too, because I know that that's when it first began when I first 17th of that was, I was in the emergency room that whole entire day, so I. think that i've missed that during that time was when everybody was super badly because look open like oh that was. My kids I literally had to I was trying to like survive in school and then like keep everybody alive the House, which was a daunting task."
726.0,Provider,that's probably why.
