706.0,Provider,"And then. Going forward, what did your use look like."
9236.0,Patient,"Going forward, how far."
706.0,Provider,"So, like through your teenage years like through high school with is that how it was was just kind of like."
9236.0,Patient,Oh so so probably 16 and a half 17 I started smoking a lot of weed. Drinking probably every weekend started doing a lot of coke. um and that's kind of how my high school years my.
706.0,Provider,"OK OK, and then, when did that, when did that change how long did that so did that go all the way through high school and I OK."
9236.0,Patient,And then I kind of fell off didn't do anything for years um and then I was probably. In my early 20s when I started taking. oxy cotton. And then I was in a really bad marriage. And that became a problem when I was about 23 that's when I got addicted to oxycodone and. That was just kind of all downhill from there.
706.0,Provider,"So when you started taking oxy cotton, was it simply just for that euphoric feeling or did you have an injury or something that caused it to happen, where."
9236.0,Patient,"well. So. I used to take. Action I had purchased that when I add two sections i've had, for now, but i'm in my early 20s and I, my ex husband used to take him a lot he's 6% tax code owns a lot. And I did not like them, but she was such a jerk it was more like a control thing to him, he would like make me take them, it sounds so stupid, but he did, and I hated them. And then, when I had my first C section, when I was 21 I took them because I was in pain. But that's what I was kind of like wow I really like it that's kind of when I decided that I liked the way it felt that didn't lead it so much. and From there once I decided I liked it, it was just you know, a matter of time before I got myself. You know what I mean yeah."
706.0,Provider,So it happened pretty quickly.
9236.0,Patient,"I wouldn't even say happen pretty quickly, it took a couple of years Okay, I have been mostly I think when I when I had when I left my ex husband. It was very traumatic when I the way I had to leave him and I wasn't ready so and I had two little kids so I started using more to kind of get myself through that period of. Just complete I mean, I was in a really abusive really I didn't know I knew who I was you know what I mean so i'm trying to like navigate the world now is like a broken person with two little kids so that's kind of how I handle that you know."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so during that period of sobriety that you were talking about where you didn't do anything what was going on in your life, then."
9236.0,Patient,"um I was in school, I was in college, I was. me I was manager at a pizza place out here. and You know just I was, I was college kid you know I didn't my I was, I was we weren't I wasn't married yet, but I was with my ex husband, we were still together and. off and on and he drank a lie, he was an alcoholic drink a lie, so it really turned me off to drinking, so I wasn't like a drinker you know I wasn't a college kid in that way, but you know, I was college kids hanging out. I knew in smoke weed really I just I was pretty much just sober all the time, but you know. that's how I don't know if."
706.0,Provider,You just had bigger I guess bigger dreams at that point.
9236.0,Patient,"yeah I had more to so my life, and at that point, I I didn't see us, you know he and I, you know I relationship, you know I don't know what you know about abusive relationship they don't they'll start out like."
706.0,Provider,"A, no, no."
9236.0,Patient,They don't mean the crap.
706.0,Provider,You know what I mean with.
9236.0,Patient,People I think they think that.
706.0,Provider,Prince charming.
9236.0,Patient,"And the beginning, as exactly so it was a good relationship in the beginning, so I was happy, I was young, and you know we're doing well, so um yeah I was just you know, I was happy is what it was yeah he. He was."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so that makes it harder to because. You find your Prince charming is your first love everything's all happy, so you don't mean to nominee bad feelings are trying to."
9236.0,Patient,Get.
706.0,Provider,Through the day because you feel like you're in a really great place.
9236.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
706.0,Provider,Exactly and one day Prince charming turns into. A call and. True pillars and then your whole world comes crashing down.
9236.0,Patient,yep that's exactly right.
706.0,Provider,"So yeah and then we'll and then you have, and then you have the kids, and so I mean it's good that you got out of that because."
9236.0,Patient,With kids.
706.0,Provider,"I mean, even if they don't know what's going on, they can still feel that tension it's unhealthy. And then, if you actually stay in a relationship that's unhealthy kids grow up thinking that that's normal but that's."
9236.0,Patient,Just how I ended up in mind.
706.0,Provider,"You know. What that's what mom put up with, so I guess that's how it's supposed to be."
9236.0,Patient,"that's exactly right, I thought that was love you know I thought that's on me and showed you he loved you so my mom she was doing y'all stay with me my my my dad was never like my ex husband, he was nothing like that, but um that's exactly what happened, you know uh huh."
706.0,Provider,"yep it's a pattern. Has a cycle, so when you get the strengthen you leave and you break that cycle."
9236.0,Patient,"So, good for you, thank you."
706.0,Provider,Now. So during the time that you were using opiates. And up until just March has it been pretty consistent and then all the sudden you.
9236.0,Patient,Know did.
706.0,Provider,"Or did you have different times, where we."
9236.0,Patient,"are now. Free yeah i've had several. bouts of you know i've had several. Periods of. abstinence recovery, you know. We I was you know, we had almost a year, almost a year clean just not not taking methadone or suboxone or anything. And then we you know, and then I started using the Ad and then I was on methadone for a year and a half and that worked really well but methadone is not really you know. It wasn't. It wasn't a good option for me, even though I did keep me clean, I was still miserable you know."
706.0,Provider,"Why, why do you think that was what was with the method."
9236.0,Patient,"Because it It makes you really like groggy really like have no energy and then you put on a ton away. I put on probably 50 pounds and it was ridiculous I was so uncomfortable and so like I felt bad about myself, you know and on the and then I kept trying to tell myself like you know what's a few pounds compared to being I would rather be overweight and not using drugs and be you know. Be skinny and out getting high, but that really wasn't the right logic, I mean I was miserable I just I didn't feel good you know. So, then, I stopped taking the methadone and started using again and decided, maybe suboxone was a better route to take. You know because I kept trying to go into detox and I would say no, I don't watch the box and I really didn't want to be on anything you know, but I wasn't successful I mean as many times, I tried it and done it I had never come out of it successfully. You know, so at that point, I felt like maybe i'm just. banging my head against the wall, for no reason you know."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no I understand. yeah yeah you know, and the one thing is is you got to find what works for you and something that you can maintain you know, some people say you know they they plan on staying on you know their medication for as long as they can because it saved their life, and I mean if you. don't why fix it if it's not broke if it's working, then why change it. Oh no other people are like I can't wait to get off, I mean I just all on you know who you are how your life is, and you know what your what you believe, is what you need."
9236.0,Patient,"My doctor gave me the best advice like just my regular my GPA out when I first went into I was really embarrassed you know I didn't want to tell her, I was like a recovering addict she was so amazing. And she said, listen, I was on method on at the time and I kind of looked at it like don't judge me, you know, and she was like. You know if you had diabetes, you would take insulin the rest your life if you had high cholesterol cholesterol medication. You have a disease, and if you have to be on medication for the rest of your life for it. it's no different than anybody else and you're taking medication to treat their disease, you know what I mean if you come off of it and you die what's the what's what's the good in that you know you. Can you stay on as long as you need to stay on it, you know don't put a timeline on it just listen to your body and your. You know, go with the flow of life and see where it takes, and that was the best advice i've ever gotten I was like so much sense I never thought about it that way, I was always kind of shamed myself, you know, like. Oh, my. God i'm on suboxone you don't mean but. yeah."
706.0,Provider,And that's what I tell. Everybody i'm you probably hear me say it in groups to. me and. it's it's The thing that you really have to wrap your head around it's a disease.
9236.0,Patient,In the whole.
706.0,Provider,thing when you started it was a choice you can either or i'm going to do this.
9236.0,Patient,But I will.
706.0,Provider,Point it did not become it's not a choice anymore it's a disease. In your brain rest wired to have to have it. yep you know and it's no different she's right than any other disease that you would have. And it's really saying that your your GP told you that because i'm a lot of general practice like physicians they they don't believe in the medical model. yeah she believes in it and wholeheartedly embraces that.
9236.0,Patient,"Yes, awesome that's what I thought I was like you know nice it's hard to find yeah it's impossible to understand they kind of look at you and they're like okay well this, but she was like yeah no, you know, whatever you have to do to make your you know I just I think that's her she's. yeah she surprised me, and I think she's that she's actually a nurse practitioner, which, at first, I didn't like you there, I was like I really want a doctor, but what's the difference, but um yeah I love her you know just for that that standpoint, you know that was great yeah yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and the and the thing is is you know it all it all goes to your quality of life."
9236.0,Patient,mm hmm exactly.
706.0,Provider,"You know it's whatever you need for you to have the best quality life, you can have."
9236.0,Patient,For you.
706.0,Provider,For your kids and so you know if this is what it takes and it takes you behind suboxone forever then. You know. Like she said it's going to keep. You healthy.
9236.0,Patient,"that's exactly right that was. I always type everything i've ever gone into I put a timeline on it, you know, like well I don't want to be on methadone for more than six months I don't want to say suboxone for more than a few months. I don't want to do a trial for more than a couple months but that's just not the right way to look at. You know I can't go into it and decide how long you I don't, how can I possibly know in the beginning, how long i'm going to need to be on something that's. You know I don't know where my life is gonna take me from that point, you know so yeah that was literally the best advice i've ever gotten it changed my viewpoint on my own my own treatment my own recovery. You know what I mean uh huh."
706.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely so um so did you ever go through other treatment, besides, like the methadone and now you're on the suboxone program did you ever go into like an Inpatient treatment or anything like that."
9236.0,Patient,"I did um when I was, I have a four year old daughter, and when I I also have a five year old son So when I got pregnant my five year old I I was using and I quit cold Turkey I just kind of like sat on the couch and I just I did it. And when I had my I got pregnant my four year old like I just couldn't I kept trying to try and try and I wasn't able to do it. mm hmm so I went to NBC and. They tried to get me to take the box and I wouldn't do it, but um. I. So, then, I I did impatient and I was, I was really far along before I decided to do that, which is that good but um she cannot find she came out with no drugs no system so she was she was good, but. yeah she um I was, I was clean for about a year. Nothing because I didn't want to take I didn't see the point I mean come off drugs and take like suboxone or sub you text or whatever they give you I just didn't want to do it so. When I had her, and I even I mean they gave me, you know percocet I had the C section and I gave them my mom my mom came and stayed with me for a couple months when I had her."
706.0,Provider,But you were trying to get off of the opioids they gave you opioids after you had your.
9236.0,Patient,"Well it's a lot of pain, they actually we tried to do it with just you know the Viking it's it's a major surgery, you know they cut you open and take it, and then I also had my tube side, and it was my fourth one. And I was in so much pain that I just I mean I threw up, it was terrible, it was the pain was awful. But I took them the way I was supposed to take them. And I didn't have a problem. I never problem with it, I gave them my mom she gave them to me at the right times. And when they were gone they're gone, you know so that's fine."
706.0,Provider,"that's good no that's great so when you went into impatient, did you do it like to do have to do a detox."
9236.0,Patient,"I did it was they did the detox they had didn't it was kind of a new facility, they kind of we're kind of goofy but um. I just detox there I yeah I detox they're just kind of laid on the laid in bed and sweat it out for a couple of days."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh okay. yeah um. And then, have you done like a meetings or na meetings or anything like that."
9236.0,Patient,"I have um I don't like them Okay, we have racing for recovery, I, like the I don't I don't know where you are probably don't have received her recovery there do."
706.0,Provider,"um I don't believe so, no i'm an iowa. I mean there's like a lot of different. meanings but that one doesn't sound familiar."
9236.0,Patient,that's a big one out here on that I really I really like that one so that's that's usually the one that I that I go to.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so you found us kind of. And an option that works for you that's not the a and a model and that's perfectly fine because that model of meeting does not work, while for everybody."
9236.0,Patient,yeah it's just not for me.

706.0,Provider,"quickly, how it goes you just can't you I mean, and you know better than anybody you can't force somebody into something they have to be they have to have the buy in they have to want to do it."
9236.0,Patient,"yeah he sees like going to see a therapist or being even just getting on medication for is like I know he's bipolar I know is. You see there's like a weakness, you know I mean like a flaw in himself and it's not it runs in the family, I would. bet my mom probably is to just not as clearly as him, you know what I mean I just probably feels his alcoholism, you know what I mean but he'd be much happier reason miserable he's so he's just very sad person, but."
706.0,Provider,yeah that's unfortunate.
