10439.0,Patient,"Oh, that sounds really nice, especially for $20 um what was I gonna tell you I don't know if i've ever told you this or not I can't do this because I have an iud. I would like to get that taken out i'm not sexually active I feel like it definitely probably is not healthy having copper and your body. yeah um but anyway That being said, I can't do it because I have an iud I don't know what your deal is but it's called yoni. Oh shucks it was just right on the top tip of my tongue, basically, you know yoni is like what they call a woman's privates lingo is what they refer to as a man a male's private part. And I guess that's like a yogi saying, or like a. I don't know, but any who so that's why it's called a yoni I want to say goni cleansing, but if you sit on a chair that doesn't have like a seat on it and you get a pot of steaming water. Then you can put whatever essential oils like for women, you know, like rose even rose petals things like that, and if you sit over it with a towel completely and it, you would not imagine the stuff that comes out of you like just it comes out like oh. yeah old period blood a seaman I mean whatever you know, like. I don't know what else will be in that. But yeah I might do that soon I love to do that i've got girlfriends that have done it and it just says, I mean it's so powerful that it can actually make your your I usually come out but. it's an all natural thing. So, but I don't think it could be harmful at all unless of course you burn yourself but."
480.0,Provider,Right.
10439.0,Patient,I don't know.
480.0,Provider,i'm gonna have to Google that because that sounds like a fun activity self care act it.
10439.0,Patient,"yeah, especially when your girlfriend comes over like for the every weekend or every other weekend i'd be fine to do with a girlfriend and like. I don't know how to spot. Because while you're driving and you can sit on a chair, with a towel over your love."
480.0,Provider,I love it. that's great so i've actually been doing Borg assets.
10439.0,Patient,i'm.
480.0,Provider,"To like cleanse that area, you know."
10439.0,Patient,Oh.
480.0,Provider,"I didn't know it's over the counter and my my friend that lives here half the time told me about it and she's a nurse. And she's like you just take these Borg acid pills there over the counter and you shove them up there, and it does the same thing basically like cleanses everything and. restores your pH balance."
10439.0,Patient,So then well i'll look it up i'm gonna write it down.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10439.0,Patient,it's really know what Bork acid is I thought you said borax it first.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
10439.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,No i'm not putting more accept there that would be so dangerous.
10439.0,Patient,"You look for me, whenever you said I was like."
480.0,Provider,"yeah no it's really helpful because then I had. I had to go to my guy know for a biopsy and I asked her about it, I was like I just want to check that this is safe she's like oh yeah that's the best and she's like I write prescriptions for it all the time, but it's cheaper to just get over the counter because it's the same thing."
10439.0,Patient,wow How often do you do it or does it tell is it so just for that by say or.
480.0,Provider,"It doesn't say the doctor told me to do it every day for seven days if there's something going on, like a yeast infection or uti you do it every day for seven days."
10439.0,Patient,I wouldn't have.
480.0,Provider,"Just one time because, all I can feel if I have something coming on you know. yeah and so that's what i'll do it i'll just do one pill when I start to feel I get yeast infections kind of regularly now I never used to, but all of a sudden."
10439.0,Patient,Our body.
480.0,Provider,"But i'm so i'll just do it. All the time when I start to feel it coming on and it's usually like once every two weeks i'll just do one of them, and you do it at night when you're about to go to sleep and then let it just."
10439.0,Patient,"Oh. you're not walking around. yeah oh. yeah wow just saying I wrote it down i'll check into it i'll have to make sure that it's Okay, for it with the iud but thank you for reminding me I need to go see it get my see my woman Dr. I do, that once a year, and I, you know. Again, just trying to get back into the flow of things and. everything's been pushed to the side, I was flossing I was like Oh, my goodness, I need to go to the dentist. yeah but where are you Okay, I know you were sick Wednesday."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so last week, I had a stomach bug it was like three days of misery. Oh, and then, this morning I woke up really stuffy and like snotty and one of my guy friends that I was with last week just tested positive for coven yesterday so i'm like praying it's our cities and knock. Co bed, because I slept over it is how night last week. And now he has good so that's a bummer. But i'm doing. Fine, other than like this stuff enough i've had Kobe yeah and i'm vaccinated so i'm assuming if I get it, I probably won't have many symptoms but. it's probably just allergies, because the weather's been like so all over the place lately."
10439.0,Patient,"Definitely yeah. Tell us i'm really better for sure. that's good i'm sorry that you woke up sick and I just found this really. cool Nicole touching back on aroma therapies and CVs um. It was like on the end of an aisle and it was all the different essential oils and it's like a little stick like what is that, as the other thing that clears your head that's like a menthol thing. That you stick up your nose, not a spray but it's like a plastic cylindrical saying with a hole in it, and then you can it's got something in there, like menthol."
480.0,Provider,You know what i'm talking about ever heard of that.
10439.0,Patient,Oh okay those things are awesome.
480.0,Provider,CBS. CBS.
10439.0,Patient,"I well, you can get that any yeah like any kind of pharmacy probably but CVs is where I found what it's like that that I was telling you about except for its they have one for anxiety one for kids. or kids like a calming so I got one for stress relief and you just stick it up your nose smell it on both sides once or twice and it's like an instance I love it so i'm so glad I found that because you know I told you i've been having a hard time feeling like short fused and. yeah just that they've been cool just because you know I don't want to have to take any more medicine and. yeah and plus like that, and stress anxiety medicine is very addictive."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, you."
10439.0,Patient,"Like the xanax I mean there's no way. I wouldn't want to get on anything like that that. we've margin for addiction so. Yes, I just celebrated seven months seven. days ago."
480.0,Provider,Congratulations.
10439.0,Patient,"and Now I am. I worked really hard all weekend that was wonderful I loved working all weekend I was kid free, and so I kept my. My weekend busy working at the art gallery and it was such beautiful weather and there was a guy outside two doors down busking so he was playing his guitar and he sounded so good, so that was nice had the door open and it's just so good for my. Confidence or whatever you know my mental state just to go to work."
480.0,Provider,yeah for sure.
10439.0,Patient,"I have much as i'm used to i'm trying to but so that being said, does and money is a little tight, because I know i've been. charged before for the $3 I don't know if you got my texts whenever I text to check in so I was just letting you know if you did see that about. So, since you weren't there last Wednesday, they still charge me for you being there and I know it's only $3 but like right now it's like i'm penny pinching so I did text them that day to."
480.0,Provider,tell them that they shouldn't have been charging.
10439.0,Patient,"I did, and they said, and I just texted the number the care navigator or whatever the that I used to check in, and I said that I would need to go on to a zoom for compliance or something I can't remember exactly and I just haven't. I haven't done that, because it's just like it's always kind of takes forever, so the waiting. I haven't blocked out time to do that so anyway, I said today, I said I don't know if you can do this or not, but instead of charging me. For today if you can just make it, you know, make up for last Wednesday, but there might be a lot of red tape, it might not be that easy with insurance and things like that, so I understand if it's not but."
480.0,Provider,"I just was letting you know because I didn't know that they charge you guys because I did, let them know that Dr marcia was doing it by yourself, because a lot of times. I try to get some line like if i'm out i'll try to get someone to fill in for me, but. I did, let them know that, with all of our North Carolina groups, it was just Dr Marshall. So yeah they shouldn't have been charging you six they should have only charge three."
10439.0,Patient,"And only happened one other time over the summer, when Dr Marshall was at the beach. Remember, it was just you. And I didn't say anything I wouldn't worry about it but yeah but anyway. So no big deal no worries."
480.0,Provider,um well I.
10439.0,Patient,"know for sure I shaded if it's not too much trouble and then look at my let's see is October my son turned 15. Yes, so."
480.0,Provider,that's terrifying.
10439.0,Patient,"Oh, I know yeah yeah. I can't believe it and he just wants money for his birthday, which I think is cool I was like that, so now he's got his own. style since and a taste and so he's got to the point where you know it's like hard to shop just give them some money i'm like I guess that's that's cool anyone's a polaroid camera though unless he's changed his mind. Yes, Lee."
480.0,Provider,polaroids are so fun.
10439.0,Patient,"yeah I know I thought that and that's not too expensive, I mean that's a great because usually he'll ask for like something that just came out and we always make it work and get it for him, but it's like you know. he'll care he doesn't. worry about money troubles and things like that, and for us to be like we can't afford it, we make it work, you know so yeah."
480.0,Provider,So why have I been working a lot is it just they don't need you.
10439.0,Patient,"Because the three jobs that I have that i've been with for over 10 years our family ran and operated I am the only employee there there's not family member that's actually living in the House with everybody and code is. has affected them because their rent never changed the rents like 1500 dollars a month and that's not including their private parking spots so they're just working their family members, instead of giving me my usual hours, so I am working it's just like very sporadic. And it's not my angel i'm used to working two jobs six days a week, and which is like four hours and then four hours you know, but still i'm so it's hard for me to find anything going to work with my schedule for me, I need to be out of there by three. To get my son from school and things like that so and also is nice whenever he can go to work with me so that's. that's been my thing. trying to find something everything will all work out I know it will you know, so I mean they're trying to get me on the schedule, as much as possible i'm working on my jewelry i've got a music festival coming up that's usually pretty lucrative so. No be. not trying to stress out."
480.0,Provider,What. Is it coming up.
10439.0,Patient,"leap is the lake EDEN art festival and it's in black mountain and it's such a beautiful. Property huge lake with like a big dive where you can dive off and then rope swings that go into our zip line that goes into the lake and it's so family friendly. it's pretty expensive, so I usually volunteer for my ticket trade for harper and I, and they specialize in cultural it's like music from around the world, one year there were Tibetan monks speaking, and it is so cool."
480.0,Provider,And I find out from you.
10439.0,Patient,How how far as like mountain for me. yeah i'm 25 minutes whoa. East. yeah.
480.0,Provider,"I had to learn North Carolina geography like up by you, because my parents are building in flat rock which is like. Okay 30 minutes from you, I think."
10439.0,Patient,"yep yep, I think, is that is that going towards Tennessee do you know. I haven't really I know flat rock is a really beautiful place, though, and there is a music festival there but it's been years since i've been there, but. I don't know, do you know if it's off of 26 or 40."
480.0,Provider,"i've no idea. If you haven't been there, because they literally like just bought the property they haven't even started building, but I do know it's like 20 minutes from hendersonville. So hendersonville the closest town and then asheville is like 30."
10439.0,Patient,minutes okay cool.
480.0,Provider,i'm excited to have a mountain now.
10439.0,Patient,"When you come up meet in the middle. yeah i'll take you to my favorite tea spot dirty you sit on the pillow on the ground, and then you get this this book and it tells you about all the teams from all over the world like people get obsessed with teams they're cut they call them devotees."
480.0,Provider,Oh that's so funny.
10439.0,Patient,"Like little bell and then, once you find what T want, and then you ring the bell and then they come and and yeah and it's like each team has made it's not like your regular run of the mill tea bag, it is super like heady."
480.0,Provider,Well that's. So fun.
10439.0,Patient,Is fun it's really nice it's so fun I used to take harper there for valentine's day that would be our valentine's day date every year. that's okay it's cool it's a really cool place and it's on one of my favorite streets in downtown asheville lexington that's one of the like I think it's like the coolest street with the most whole shops and clothes and artwork and.
480.0,Provider,You know.
10439.0,Patient,You know that asheville vibe.
480.0,Provider,And i've got to get up to asheville Sam that sounds amazing.
10439.0,Patient,"it's going to be really crowded right now, because of leaf season everybody comes from all over oh that's right, but you just moved up here so you've seen leaves change before right. Because you're not from Florida."
480.0,Provider,i've seen him before but it's been four years since i've seen.
10439.0,Patient,You so you'll enjoy that.
480.0,Provider,yeah they started.
10439.0,Patient,out up there.
480.0,Provider,Like a couple of trees very sporadically are starting to get a little yellow and orange but that's it.
10439.0,Patient,"that's good, because some years when it's really dry the leaves will turn and fall and then we don't have any leaf season at a lot at all really I know if it rains a lot, we have a longer leaf season and it's so beautiful."
480.0,Provider,Has it already started up there and changing.
10439.0,Patient,"same as like what you said just I noticed like drive this morning, just a couple trees are starting to but yeah."
480.0,Provider,"that's so cool I love fall So what are you guys doing for her birthday, is he having a bunch of kids over."
10439.0,Patient,"Well, he gets in by nine kids and we're going to go on a trolley ride a haunted trolley ride, because his birthday, is the day before Halloween. So all the kids come out costumes unless they're too cool for that I don't know that 15 but I his. friends are all great I just took him to a birthday party two Sundays ago and I ended up being the chaperone somehow, and it was awesome I loved it I love doing stuff like that. And so, anyway, you know, a trolley when you go to a town, and you can take the trolley just didn't have a guide so it's going to be like that, except for the haunted version and so we'll just have to try to ourselves. But then. If even be on Halloween i've really yeah so his best friend her name is OSHA since kindergarten. The mom and I are she's going to help me she's always helped me coordinate his birthday party she's always filmed it every since like he was five. yeah it's so cool she's so helpful. And losing my spot and she opened a kava bar up here. A long time ago and so she does well as that i'm sure, have you heard of kava since you're from. Florida has like a I don't really. I don't do that, but I think it's great that she you know is successful."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's awesome.
10439.0,Patient,"What are your thoughts on like that, for people in recovering I mean that's not something i'm interested in but um I worked at a head shop, if you will. For four years and there was a guy we sold crowd them freedom or whatever and. There was a guy that came in and bought some and then, when he left somebody came in and I asked, have you seen somebody and he gave a description of the guy. And he was like because I was like well i'm sorry I was like I don't know if i'm supposed to give out information like that and he's like well i'm the House. Halfway home halfway house and he said so i'm just making sure he didn't buy create a crowd or whatever you know it's like Oh, it was like I don't know I played dumb. I don't want to get involved. Anybody stuff. yeah but I realized that that wasn't. You know, and so I talked to him about it. And I was like well I don't know how is that you know against the rules and he said well because whenever you're in recovery you don't want to alter your state, you need to be with your. Self instead of just one thing for another now like if my grandma needed something for pain and that were to help her versus taking opiates I think that would be. yeah I think. Fine, if it's as long as it's not harmful but."
480.0,Provider,"You know. My thoughts on that are always examine the motive behind why you're doing it right so like I know plenty of people in recovery that. use some of that stuff medically because they have legit medical conditions that that helps with but. For my personal experience i'm always curious about motives right are you treating pain, are you treating mental illness, are you treating depression and is this the last resort, have you tried other things so like. Realistically, if you are thinking about doing this, I would say, well, what therapy techniques can we try first. And then, if those don't work then. Try it but make sure you stay accountable with somebody because that's the difference it's like the motives and the accountability, because you don't want to have secrets you don't want it to be addict behavior in the fact that, like. This is something i'm sneaking and motivation, am I doing it to escape reality, am I doing it for a high or am I doing it to legitimately help with anxiety because things like marijuana people use that for a lot of like. it's really effective for ptsd it's really effective for arthritis and fibromyalgia. But. The differences are you using it medically and then stopping when medically it's doing what it needs to do."
10439.0,Patient,Oh no I mean always a lot of people do that yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so I always err on the side of caution, like don't do anything for a while first like first year sobriety. And the pressure don't try anything and then after that just make sure you're. Checking in with yourself and your motives."
10439.0,Patient,"yeah well I did try both the credo, and the Kaaba years ago and I am highly allergic to broke I broke out in the high. I lost my hearing, I think I almost went into into galactic shock so i'm like no desire it was."
480.0,Provider,never actually tried either of those guys often than you.
10439.0,Patient,"But it's rare to be allergic to it, but I am and i'm like less fine you know, I was just being polite because my girlfriend keely she offered me. A Shell, or whatever you call it a libation I can't remember what they they've got their own lingo but anyway yeah just curious that's that's a good point."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10439.0,Patient,"I mean I haven't really once I have more room clean time I definitely want to get involved with you know, helping other people and, obviously, if anybody. If I got put into a situation currently where I can help somebody than I would but i'm just saying I don't want i'm not strong enough I don't think that anybody has any business trying to guide somebody until they've got their selves good. Even though it'll be the rest of my life. A choice, have to make every day, but you know what I mean it's just like. No, but so you had you had a slumber party was a boy."
480.0,Provider,"Only lasted half the night he snored so loud and we're going. To music Park, the next day for my kids birthday, so I ended up going home at like 230 in the morning because I like i'm sorry but I have to sleep tonight. So see ya. I hear you are friends, though he didn't tell you about the friends with benefits situation now."
10439.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know I don't think so because last time I seen you it's been two weeks, and you had found out that the gynecologist was a narcissist now, is it the, nor is it the gynecologist."
480.0,Provider,"No Okay, so I was already seeing this guy so this guy I met like three months ago and it's been kind of a slow build, we had a couple days I was kind of like he drinks a lot and I was like that's not. I don't care if people drink, but I was seeing alcoholic tendencies i'm like that's not something that I want to get into obviously so. We ended up having a conversation about his drinking and I said i'm like, how do you feel about the whole friends with benefits thing because i'm very. into him I just can't do a serious relationship with someone that drinks like you do, and he was like yeah that's cool we can try it so like for the past month, we were just kind. Of hanging out his friends like fooling around whatever and then. A couple weeks ago, not a couple weeks ago last Sunday, so not this past Sunday the Sunday before that this was two days after I spent the night at his house or attempted to we had plans and I was like are we still good for today. it's like no the boys are begging to come over because he's a single dad and I was like okay cool didn't hear from an all day, which was weird so 730 i'm like are you alive, he says, I did coke i'm flying he did cocaine on a Sunday afternoon he's 41 years old. i'm done."
10439.0,Patient,Peter pan he's never gonna grow up.
480.0,Provider,never going to grow up.
10439.0,Patient,"At least he was honest with you, but if you. Have a problem I had your system."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's the thing the problem I had was that he lied about his boys coming over if you would have told me."
10439.0,Patient,hey it's over oh now his kids didn't come up for.
480.0,Provider,"His did not come over, but he lied and told me they did, and then later he told me that he was doing coke all day with friends and I was like I. have a problem with boys you think he was trying to be like my boys, no."
10439.0,Patient,"No Okay, because you know how semantics. or whatever, I mean okay."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, he definitely lied about that, and I mean we're still talking we're still friends, but."
10439.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
480.0,Provider,"i'm done i'm done with it, it in anything like right now he has coded so I was like let me know if you need anything and whatnot but like i'm done with the benefit or."
10439.0,Patient,"Really sharing stalls and they all go coven. Probably hopefully he's all right, well, I was gonna say oh my God it sounds like he's going to use you for designated drivers what I was worried about I wasn't even expecting you to go far left and say who is doing blow."
480.0,Provider,"No, but he did tell me today that he's gonna try not drinking for a while, because he already has tried to cut back, and that hasn't gone well so he's gonna try not drinking for a while, so like you know he's held and I don't mind being a supportive person I just can't. Forget it can't be doing any more sleep overs with him."
10439.0,Patient,Right yeah hold on I think I heard my dogs. Okay i'll be right there. she's knocking on the door ready to come in.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I love it. Well, we have another appointment scheduled in two weeks."
10439.0,Patient,"yep or the 21st oh my God hold on i'm sorry yes 1919 yep and then I think Dr Marshall has dropped me down to. monthly what what monthly although for some reason, oh okay. I guess she gave me the option of doing either the 13th through the 27th and I have the 27th circle, so I don't think it really matters, but I don't know. Does that sound right to you that I can, as long as I make it to one."
480.0,Provider,"long as you make it to one, so it usually you just want to time it so you don't run out of your script so however many weeks worth of read he gave you. You want to make. sure you come to a group before you run out."
10439.0,Patient,Oh yeah she'll start giving you a month of meds like next time you give you a 30 day supply so just make sure you calculate so.
480.0,Provider,you're coming like before the mess right now.
10439.0,Patient,"That is totally a good point um do you know if my surveys that are required are going to change now usually, I have three different ones that are do twice a month one that's do once a month, and then I have the every 30 day one."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so the twice a month ones, are they the anxiety and depression ones."
10439.0,Patient,yeah the yeah probably.

480.0,Provider,"Actually, with dropping down to a month. Because if you don't say in the green then your 30 day supply gets. Four days, which is so good, but like there's no way around that with our system."
10439.0,Patient,"And that is like with anything, or does it have to be something."
480.0,Provider,"or no, it has to be like a no show or like not doing your uds. The surveys don't affect prescriptions the survey is. Like it'll show that you're non compliant but it doesn't actually affect the prescription. Okay, but. I don't know. And you're in like not doing you're you're not testing positive on your own but not doing your urine well coffee yeah."
10439.0,Patient,"that's total sense, though I really like this program a lot i've told a lot of people that have asked us on social media and things. Because there's a group in there's there's a few groups that i'm in for sobriety but I know is your person there."
