And that's because of previous no short appointments and then your bps evaluation has not yet been completed, it says. So what I would highly recommend is when you have a moment definitely log into the cure navigation vc or the complaints vc. and see what they can do to get you scheduled for a bps evaluation, which is your individual therapist one on one it's basically just. Have that very first appointment and come up with some type of treatment plan with your individual therapist that's it's a fancy acronym for something super simple. So I highly recommend doing that, as soon as possible, and then, once you attend your bps that that restriction will go away the uds cups are now being sent through I believe millennial or they're recommending you go down to a quest. Let me double check to see if they did a lab order for you. i'm."
17620.0,Patient,"order but I told Jerry when I was on there that my lab order wasn't valid when I bring it up, so I was in a car accident that's why I was, I was no showed my appointments, but I was T boned in a car accident and then had pneumonia."
386.0,Provider,"know everything you know. I when it rains it pours that's what I say um yeah, so I would definitely what I would do is I would when you're talking to them to schedule for the bps let them know that it's coming up in as invalid and they can get a new one sentence for you. Okay okay um so what i'm going to do for you, because your next appointment isn't until next Monday i'm going to do a four day supply with one additional refill just to get you taken care of so it'll get you from today for one day pastor appointment. Okay Okay, so you won't be out of meds and then you should be good to go from that point on, do you want me to text you once that prescriptions been called in."
