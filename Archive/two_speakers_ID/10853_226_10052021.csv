10853.0,Patient,Hello. Good good.
226.0,Provider,I know it's been a little bit since i've seen you.
10853.0,Patient,yeah sorry I missed an appointment because I had to go do something for work and then I just never rescheduled one so.
226.0,Provider,How are things been going film in.
10853.0,Patient,"Very good, I mean I definitely feel a lot better on the lexapro than I did on the camera. So I stopped taking the wrong completely and i'm just taking the lexapro now I still take the gabapentin. um but you know, like I don't wake up hating my life so that's good. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"All right, yeah well."
10853.0,Patient,"You know I don't harp on the same feeling over and over again so that's good I can definitely see more things positively. And a little more nicer to people so like is that that's definitely helped a lot i'm still smoking a lot that's the one down I haven't really slowed down on my smoking at all, even though I keep claiming i'm going to."
226.0,Provider,"What do you think like the barrier is for that, like what do you think what's the hardest part about stopping."
10853.0,Patient,"i'm just always like oh so tomorrow, I always just keep putting it off, and like. Lately, though i've been getting really bloated in the afternoon and so like I feel really a lot of pain in the afternoon and I feel like kind of nauseous so that's been like motivated me to smoke when I get home from work. Trying to like figure out what's causing all this bloating but."
226.0,Provider,Have you been drinking enough water.
10853.0,Patient,"um maybe not I mean I have been drinking water, maybe that's one of the things that's causing it to be so that i'm not sure I mean it gets really painful like whatever i'm wearing like. Like you know, like I changed clothes, when I got home from work and, like an hour later I touched my stomach it felt like I had a bruise where my pants were. So it's just like."
226.0,Provider,Take.
10853.0,Patient,But.
226.0,Provider,You have constipation.
10853.0,Patient,Now I still have my normal diarrhea is what I normally have not constipation. So yeah I know it doesn't make a lot of sense. I mean i've had this problem before on and off it's just gotten kind of that I think the heat makes it worse i'm not sure.
226.0,Provider,yeah it can it can inflame the body is it hasn't been hot there.
10853.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. You know you really want to try and you want you want to try and work through that and figure that out as best as you can I mean, I know that. I know that stomach issues are like you know you have a history with you know that's just where you carry your stress and everything just kind of parks itself in your stomach. But you really want to try. Like working through this in another way. You know whether you're changing your diet again whether you're drinking more water, whether you're you know exercising more."
10853.0,Patient,yeah I haven't been good on exercise instead of like every day it's been like two or three times a week so and I think exercising does help a lot.
226.0,Provider,And just gets you know. The party.
10853.0,Patient,"Was gonna say it gets things out yeah the sweaty I mean I remember in one person said she's like your body was made to sweat every day. Maybe not every. Day, but your body feels better once it gets that sweating this."
226.0,Provider,"yeah because it removes the toxins to. You know the toxins that don't come out through the you know, through the kidneys in the colon and all that so it's just another form of detoxification. So you really want to stay committed to that you know you really want to so you know, looking at this as like like health and wellness you know not only like mental health, but just like physical wellness as well as really. Why it goes together yeah."
10853.0,Patient,I.
226.0,Provider,"Like you know the medication will work for certain point it's working it's a good medication for you. And then the rest, you know, has to come from your your lifestyle lifestyle changes, you know, incorporating other things into you know healthier things into your life cheap into your diet. it's really, really, really important now just is because. You know the the remedy and the solution isn't to go home and smoke more weed because you're having stomach issues, because what you're doing is you're just kind of masking that anyways right so. You know sure it takes away that discomfort but then the next day you just still have it until you're figuring out what this is about and how you can work through it, the weeds just like this big gargantuan bandaid."
10853.0,Patient,"yeah no, I agree that it is just a band aid that's like. yeah just kind of pushing me through the pain discomfort of feeling from not be consistent with working now taking care of myself."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so you know depression, anxiety all of that stuff has to be managed so even when you're on medication and you're feeling better you still have to do those things that you know make you feel better like it's just. You know it's just it just is. It you know. that's never going to change and so. You know, and also, you know when you're in an office and you're sitting all day that can also create you know dissension you know and the abdominal area, make sure you're getting up and walking around as often as you can like even stepping outside and getting some fresh air and. You know just kind of you know, trying to move your body throughout the day is really important, so. Like really try and stay, you know stay committed to the things that you like to do. Okay, because the weed is going to be that's a bigger obstacle here the weed is the weed is a part of who you are the weed has been a part of you, since you were 18 years old, so it's really difficult to have a breakup with it. yeah there's going to be like it's difficult to find a reason to part with it. You know and and some people, you know that's just how it is you know, like some people are just like hey you know I just i'm not willing to give it up and it. is useful in some ways, and you know that might just be where you are with it, you know it's it's it's it's about you coming to terms with either like having it completely out of your life or in your life because I don't believe there's going to be a happy medium."
10853.0,Patient,"yeah I keep on thinking, I can find a happy medium, but."
226.0,Provider,"And I think that's where the I think that's where the barriers coming in, like kind of that The difficulty is that there's an A goat you're negotiating with it like okay. You know i'll only smoke a joint once a day and no there's nothing that's holding you accountable right in terms of like. You know the other at the other end of it there's nothing. Like."
10853.0,Patient,Nothing holding me accountable for it.
226.0,Provider,Exactly.
10853.0,Patient,"Like it doesn't matter myself today or tomorrow, because it's just like tomorrow's okay."
226.0,Provider,yeah exactly so it's I think you just have to.
10853.0,Patient,discipline.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it takes a lot of discipline and. yeah I mean it takes, you know really what it is, is like you just have to really want to stop you just have to just be really sick as some okay that's what it comes down to. Safety just have to go, you know what this is no longer serves my my lifestyle and you know until you're ready to make that decision, not much changes, just like with anything. it's. it's hard to have discipline when you don't really want to stop."
10853.0,Patient,yeah in last year was when I had the most motivation and I hadn't was discipline is about a year ago and that's when I cut it back to the mouse cut back. It did have some discipline that but yeah right now.
226.0,Provider,"So you know you, you know that there when you do cut back there's there's a difference in how you feel and your motivations better it's you know so. You know that's. kind of what i've been talking about you know, as we have these conversations know. You will find, you will notice a huge difference if you come back you'll notice an enormous difference if you completely stop. And like i've said before that's always been my My guess is the Lead is what's really kind of holding you back from like jumping in full bore and just like having this life that you love. But it's a process right it's a total it's a total profit."
10853.0,Patient,yeah yeah just a total process. And yeah I mean quitting all the sudden I feel like i'll go and like this draw some. someone like. me to paper. yeah hey Brian has been what i've been having a hard time doing. So.
226.0,Provider,I wonder if the gabba penton have you talked to. Sean town is it chantelle that's the prescriber in your group.
10853.0,Patient,"She was the prescriber in my group, but I have another psychiatry say yes."
226.0,Provider,that's right. Have you talked to the psychiatrist about like ways that you could stop is there anything that you could take for that.
10853.0,Patient,"stopped to gab a ton of stuff stop the wheat when. The gabba is what they. The the weed and she's like last time I had tried it when I talked to her, I was trying to go down on the Gala again and she's like no I think you should keep it up for right now."
226.0,Provider,"yeah I agree. yeah. Okay, so."
10853.0,Patient,"I mean the goblin does help, especially if I take like if I take two pills over one I definitely don't crave as much. So I mean that was my plan for a while, is to go up on the goblin pen to stop completely, but then I didn't stop completely, of course, so. That was back in June. So."
226.0,Provider,Oh yeah listen to that right before your trip or some yeah yeah.
10853.0,Patient,"On up on the gabba again trying to stop completely. And I didn't really stop so. I get the excuse that I was pretty stressed and depressed right before my turn. my head. Over the place so. I can definitely focus a lot more, and I mean yeah I just need to stay disappointed and stay with the yoga and meditation and kind of stick with that stuff."
226.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it's just really about replacing. You know, just like incorporating things into your life that you can. replace with the weed smoking, you know it's like. routine, you know that you have to break right."
10853.0,Patient,"yeah I have to do, I should do audibles again that kind of help me break a lot of the routine because, like oh take the edibles that broke the routine of the smoking. And I wouldn't really crave as much."
226.0,Provider,"As you do that. If you do the edibles is that is that, like last hoops thing that you're actually in."
10853.0,Patient,"Interest yeah that's it see it seems to be less it seems to like edibles it seems to be less than it seems to last longer like I won't crave very much frantic. I won't really feel it either like i'll take such a low dose that I don't really feel like i'm high, but I don't."
226.0,Provider,Okay. yeah that might be something that you can try.
10853.0,Patient,"yeah I need to go back to doing that and just for a couple of days, and then I stopped the audible so that's what I did last time."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, are you still able to go to the group what's happening with that."
10853.0,Patient,"yeah once a group last Monday that was actually a good group was a good one, so um yeah he just talked about you know what tools do we have when we have our anxiety and depression and, most of us like we're still looking for tools so. Right now, so that that was a good one. I went to the one in September also so i've gone to the one once a week once a month."
226.0,Provider,"Okay okay good that's great. Okay, and then like social life, like how's that going, I mean."
10853.0,Patient,"i've had things going on lately so i've been seeing friends on a regular basis, so that's a little better like I went. like this kind of by now i'm supposed to go backpacking two weeks ago, is the first time I was going to go backpacking since I was in college like we were going to go to Yosemite and stuff but I guess the night before."
226.0,Provider,You did.
10853.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean, I know I had a lot of anxiety because, like Sometimes I get altitude sickness, I already knew as a kid I would get altitude sickness saw. And I just had a lot of anxiety about like well what if I throw up, and this is like bear country like everybody's worried about bears and everything i'm like we can't really control where you throw up like. Right and. That and that's like bringing bears into my camp, or something like that, so I don't know if the altitude was giving me bloat it, but I was like I was getting really bloated and I felt bad and so yeah I got six The night before. yeah I was so excited about that trip to like I said I hadn't gone backpacking since college and like that was one of those things over the summer I was like yeah I want to get into hiking and camping again so when I got the invitation to go backpacking I was so excited."
226.0,Provider,"Did you just. What so what happened, so you."
10853.0,Patient,"I stayed in a hotel and my friends went backpacking for two nights because I was like wait all just taking one car and I definitely don't want to ruin their trip so. But. I had been done up the night before like I couldn't walk for miles, with a 40 pound backpack. yeah."

You know we'll just keep setting our appointments and you know just kind of talking about. Whatever comes up you know. And it doesn't have to be about the we'd like. You know.
