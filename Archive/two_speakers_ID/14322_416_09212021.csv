416.0,Provider,"Yes, yes it is."
14322.0,Patient,"I mean home. Okay, so I gotta tell you did I tell you that there was someone that I kind of MC."
416.0,Provider,"Yes, you told me about the military man. The soldier, yes, you told. me about him and about how that sort of. got off track for a while and that, but your family doesn't know what that you're still talking to him."
14322.0,Patient,"yeah Well he found out that we're talking. and It happened today. And it was. know it happened yesterday, and he stayed home today from work and we talked it out and he's like. This person is not real he is like this person is not real I don't know what you're doing you're I don't know why you're doing this, but this person is not real it's a fantasy that you are just wanting to make it happen, make it real. And he says. And we went back and forth back and forth and. The conclusions that came to was that. I said that I agreed with him and I said okay fine you know i'm i'm sick. I need help, I don't know my i'm having this kind of behavior. I just like caved in basically."
416.0,Provider,Those are things that you believe are those things you were saying to just a piece him.
14322.0,Patient,"Both. Part of it, I did feel like Okay, maybe he's right because I was so emotionally just upset and I was like. You know, when I got caught so there's a side of a person that when they get caught they're like oh they're going to try to defend themselves, of course, you know, then, if they can't defend themselves, they can't they cave and then just say Okay, you know and they'll just. And so I had that feeling and then there was a feeling that I was like you know, maybe he's right, you know what am I doing you know, this is something i've never done in the past Why am I doing this now in my you know. So I started questioning fault. But then I thought. I don't like that happy he's like fish he goes, you were so logical with me about when we talked about this, you know. The first time he goes, you were you were so logical and so like understood like you agreed and you were saying all the right things he goes how. Because how did you do, that I go I don't know Gary maybe i'm manipulating you know, I was like manipulating you I don't know. i'm like maybe in mind when like in my life living a lie or believing a lie myself, you know, so I started questioning myself i'm like oh my God in my just manipulating myself, because I want to believe in this person, and I want to believe in this happiness because of. What I went through in my life that I had told you, you know with my husband, the now and i'm like in my trying to make this happen."
416.0,Provider,I mean it sounds like your husband kind of said that to you to write that there. Is that that there is this fantasy of this other person and because you're unhappy with your current life that fantasy is just overwhelming and appealing.
14322.0,Patient,Right exactly.
416.0,Provider,You feel you feel it's almost almost the way you describe it and I heard this last time it's almost like it's an addiction.
14322.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and so I told you know my husband's like you know that's it don't even contact him. we're just gonna he says, you know, like i'm going to take all the electronics away from me i'm going to take your computer away from home and take your smartphone away from you i'm going to take everything away from you so that you cannot. Be on any electronics he goes, because you, you are used to be a technician like a computer technician so I know all the electronics and know how to. You know, he thinks he doesn't know he's not savvy. With the computers, where I am and so he is like i'm just gonna have to take it away from you, because I don't know how to recognize things and he goes, you know how to do it, you know how to hide things. In plain sight and he goes I don't want that so mom okay so i'm on here, because my husband knows, I have this meeting with you, and he wanted me to tell you the truth, so I am doing my duty i'm telling you the truth, i'm telling you exactly what happened.

416.0,Provider,So um.
14322.0,Patient,And so.
416.0,Provider,"You considering this offer, or I mean i'm confused."
14322.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Man, because nobody offered that see before or you know when I was talking to him. But she's already locked but um when I was talking to my husband, you know, I was like Okay, you know what am I doing you know yeah maybe I shouldn't you know I shouldn't be with this person because of who he is he's a very well known person very prestigious I mean my God. And I when I first met him i'd even know who he was because I don't pay attention to reality shows, and I don't pay attention to all these things that go on TV, so I didn't even know who he was when I met him I was just thought that. He was just a really, really pretty guy you know that had a really big heart and was really nice until I found out like later on, I just stumbled you know looking. on the Internet, whatever I don't know I just stumbled on it and i'm like wait a SEC, is this the same person and I realized i'm like wait a second I was so mad at him and I said. You didn't tell me that you are a celebrity i'm like what the F, you know I got I went off on him and he got real sign he goes I don't know what to say i'm like well you better say something, because then you're pissing me off."
416.0,Provider,I was he a celebrity.
14322.0,Patient,He was in 2007 he did the. The bachelorette. And and. he's 44.
416.0,Provider,How did you meet him.
14322.0,Patient,"I was on instagram and he requested me. And he was on it, because he's working on, because a lot of people have a lot of hackers have been using his images his pictures and wanting in used his images to. Real you know women, you know and to to get them to. Give them money and stuff like that and they're like acting like they're him so he's been because he's had so many hackers that hacked his. pictures from online he's been working on him in a team of people are working on these catching these people these hackers that are, and you know basically all over the world, but and trying to stop it, you know so women are not."
416.0,Provider,going to think that he's.
14322.0,Patient,"The really. yeah because I talked to him, like i'm talking to you. Okay."
416.0,Provider,So um.
14322.0,Patient,"I didn't talk to him, like, I was talking to you because I told him I said. You know, at the time i'd even know who he was I didn't even know he was this luckily I didn't know he was Andy baldwin I didn't even know like anything about this man, you know until like I said I stumbled upon you know I don't know, was it was like a. YouTube or something that popped up and I looked i'm like wait a second that looks like Andy. And then, so I looked it up and then I found out all this stuff about him i'm like oh my God and then that's when I told him like wanting to tell me, you are so everybody, he told me that you're this big guy. He goes I didn't i'm like say something i'm on what you gotta say something goes I don't know what to say because i've been looking for a woman. Who can understand me and he goes and you're in I said, but you like you didn't what are you doing, why did you didn't tell me who you were either I mean. You didn't quite like tell me all this stuff about you, you know I just thought you were really, really good looking guy that was just very nice, you know and humble you know because usually good looking guys like you. Are with beautiful beautiful women and i'm not it, you know I know it and I can't compete with all these women that i've seen you. With you know in in these pictures that I see you know these slavery pictures that you've been these slavery people that you've been when. I need said he goes i'm not interested in that, and he goes i'm looking what's inside, not on the outside, because I care more about what's inside in goes, I, like everything about you inside of you. And I said okay so anyway, not to go off on the subject, but the The point is, is that I told him that my husband found out today and I told them, you know that. it's over you know I can't keep my husband's going to take all electronics away from me, I can't communicate with you i'm sorry, is it. And he says, I can't lose you, and then I said, the only reason why I have my phone with you is because i'm at a doctor's appointment and i'm able to talk right now I said, but when i'm done, I have to you know pan back my phone him back my computer and. I won't have any communications with you and then that's when he says well why don't you. Do what we talked about we'll just have to do it sooner and he goes why don't you just move into my home."
416.0,Provider,Has he given you like an address for that.
14322.0,Patient,"This just happened like. Within hours ago and it's hard it's not like he can talk to me like all the time, you know he's working he's and 11 hours difference from me he's working he's. You know. I still have to get his address, and all that stuff and you know information, how to get into his place because he's not there, he won't be home until the end of November, is. Because he's doing his left this is his last mission in Afghanistan and then he's retiring from the navy he's not gonna be any doctor anymore."
416.0,Provider,"So i'm. i'm wondering, because you you your flip flopping a lot back and forth right i'm so sorry to my husband and then it's back to Andy and then. And kind of acknowledging that you're not sure if this is really a real thing with Andy or if you believe it is but you're there's a part of you that doesn't so you're kind of back and forth, with a lot of this."
14322.0,Patient,"Now, and that's because in the. First, before I got this before and he had told me because I didn't know what Andy was going to do, I didn't know if Andy was gonna say Oh well, then that's it, you know, and that would be it, I really didn't think that Andy. really wanted to be with me. I didn't know how serious he was with me, I mean he kept telling me, you know he loved me and everything but I didn't I didn't know, I was hard to believe you know because of who he is I mean once i've learned who he was and. I did my homework on him I was like oh my God, this has got to be a fantasy, this is just not these this this kind of stuff does not happen to the ordinary woman, you know, like me, it just doesn't happen to ordinary women, so it can be. It happens to other women, you know, and so it was hard for me to even believe in that you know i'm like no this. And so I just figured once I told them what happened that my husband found out and that you know all communications are cut and when cannot communicate anymore and that's it. I thought that maybe he would be like Oh well, okay that's all you know that's it and he would just be want, but he didn't. He didn't he freakin told me, you know man, I was like. Okay well. Then that changes everything for me how I was originally from."
416.0,Provider,"So then, how will you. How will you have this conversation with your husband, if this is now your choice."
14322.0,Patient,"Well it's a good thing, because I mean, first of all I have to. Make sure that Andy is serious, I mean, he says that you know he wants me to live in his home to move into his home, but until he gives me actually gives me his address and gives me all the information I need. To do to go forward with this i'm not going to open my mouth and my husband until I get all the information once I get all the information that i'm going to tell me Hansen. The truth."
416.0,Provider,"So, so why would you wait. If you're really confident and Andy. Why would you wait."
14322.0,Patient,"Because even, no matter how competent I am with Andy you never know when what. Is around the corner. Until I get completely around that corner and I see what is around that corner, I am not gonna make any rash decisions like."
416.0,Provider,"So what will you tell your husband if it's. This. You intend to keep online right that you intend to keep on. finding a way to talk to Andy it sounds like. right if he finds out again what's happening, what will you what will you say because he's likely to given that. This is been going on, you know he's he's already found out a couple times."
14322.0,Patient,"um. If he finds out again. Which. i'm, then I just told the truth, like, I had to tell him truth today, you know. i'm one of those people that Okay, if I do something that I know i'm not supposed to be doing if I get hot I own it I don't mind owning my own shit even when it's something that is bad, you know what I mean I I don't. I that's one thing. That, I do have integrity in the sense of if I am doing something that I know are not I should not be doing or I know that it's not good. And if I get caught doing that I, I am the type of person that will say okay yeah I didn't do it and i'll accept all responsibilities of whatever it is that I did. You know that's just how I am i've always been that way I throw myself under the bus."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean it seems like, no matter what your husband says, you are pretty committed to doing like continuing with whatever. You know these relationships are, whether it be with Andy or the other guy or even somebody new right there's something that's fundamentally not getting what you need. In this relationship with your husband which you've been. Clear about. And, and I think that's understandable. But if that's the truth. And I believe it is, then, why would you not address that also. Right, because you are still. kind of living under this. you're living under this. This deception that's got away heavily on you. have to sneak around and and you're hurting somebody that even though you're not in love with him, you genuinely care about him."
14322.0,Patient,that's true.
416.0,Provider,And so. I think you're so caught up in this slide kind of high it's a dopamine rush is what it is. Right of this of this Andy of this idea of Andy that it's allowing you to not face what's right in front of you. Which is this massive a relationship with your husband. and it's I mean I see what you're doing. It. Because you're unhappy with your husband's. But it you can't ignore one thing and just move on to the next right let's not giving anything. away.
14322.0,Patient,"I told my husband, I said, let me let you go, let me let you go and deal with my own shit I told him that, let me go."
416.0,Provider,"You guys, did you propose to do that."
14322.0,Patient,"And he goes you can't he goes I can't let you go he so because you can't take care of yourself right now financially. Because if something happens to you, then I will be screwed because I had to live with that, for the rest of my life that something, because I let you go. And something happened to you, you saw, but if you stay here unscrewed because they're doing what you're doing anyway you're hurting me he's though so i'm screwed either way. And i'm like well. You know and. I would make it work, I mean, I know, in his mind he thinks I can't make it work, I will find a way to make it work for me."
416.0,Provider,So why haven't you.
14322.0,Patient,i'm trying.
416.0,Provider,"what's kept you from doing that well you're you're proposing that you stay in this unhealthy situation with your husband until you're sure. That andy's available and you're able to move in with him, but that's different than what we're talking about right we're talking about addressing first thing first, which is this very unhealthy."
14322.0,Patient,relationship that you feel like you have with your husband's.
416.0,Provider,So first things first I mean you're not going to be really truly. candy candy if that's the decision you make.
14322.0,Patient,"But the one of the things that you know that my husband had told me that if I leave him, he says he's gonna take my car waiting for me. If he takes my card if I tell him right now Okay, I want a monitoring up a don't want to be with you then he's going to what he will do and he's done he's threatened me more than once, about this, he goes that I will take her car away from you. Okay you're legally married right."
416.0,Provider,"Yes, and to see have any conservatorship over you or anything like that."
14322.0,Patient,He did the title of the car well on the loan isn't he's the primary person on the loan and on the secondary person on the wall.
416.0,Provider,"So I mean I can't answer the legal questions about that, but. If if that is an interest of yours. If you're interested in moving forward with leaving him. Then, probably discussing the realistic aspects of all of this with a divorce attorney would be. A step, you could take."
14322.0,Patient,"You know the way I look at it, because I know what he's saying is thinking cuz I bring home only my SSI which is my disability. And I bring home 1677 is what I bring home every month actually pay for taxes and everything that's after paying taxes, paying for my insurance and everything that's my take home um I paid taxes, because I have his income to and with his income, it puts us on a higher tax bracket and. I didn't want to. Be in that higher tax bracket so I did, I decided to pay taxes on my SSI. mm hmm so, but if once i'm separated from him, then I don't have to take this is just my income I don't have his income, in addition to my income, so that tax bracket changes but anyway i'm going off subject sorry i'm just thinking out loud about that um."
416.0,Provider,"So those are questions that if, if you are so what I hear i'm going to be i'm gonna be brutally honest with you. i'm not normally I really."
14322.0,Patient,"love you being brutally honest, please, I am sorry that is like that, please."
416.0,Provider,"Well, here, you go here's my. Thank you, that I think that you are miserable in your relationship. And you don't. haven't yet developed a reasonable realistic plan to get out of it. So these guys that you're meeting you're seeing them as hope."
14322.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"And you're willing to put up with a lot from them and. Maybe even put up with the fact that you're not entirely sure they're even real. or above board, and just to hold on to that hope because the. prospect of leaving. With just your income. Is. and sorting out all of the ugly details of the divorce is. unappealing it's easier to think about the happiness of. Going and living in andy's mansion and being his beautiful right. So, but do you see that that road leads you it just."
14322.0,Patient,"It doesn't it doesn't end that's exactly what I didn't want because I actually told Andy I said Andy I don't want to go that route and that's why I don't want to move in with you. You know, when you come back to the States I said don't because he wanted me to move in with him when he came back to the states, and I said no, I am going to get my own place i'm going to live i'm going to leave my husband with living in my own place. settle all the situation you know everything with with that give it a year of living on my own. getting things settled with the divorce and everything like that, because it takes a year to get to go through a divorce once it's finalized and the year is over, then. You and I can talk about us getting together and living together and he because he says he wants to marry me, you know I to be I say it like that, because I still in my mind I can't comprehend that this person. Looking at him and seeing him and knowing everything about him i'm like why me why me, I am not. i'm just. On the girl next door, there is nothing that horribilis about me."
416.0,Provider,I mean I I.
14322.0,Patient,Just.
416.0,Provider,"there's a lot to be said for the girl next door there's nothing wrong with that. and And, and maybe all of that is true, but again like. Just like a just like a drug that you get addicted. To this like dopamine rush that you get from. talking to Andy and feeling like. You know the super hot guys really into you and likes to marry you and just wants to take care of you, that is. That is a big fat distraction. That and it's a pleasant. distraction don't get me wrong. But it's not helping your you. be the best version of you."
14322.0,Patient,"Know it's not, and this is an email, and if this is really going to happen if, like this is really, really going to happen with him and I. don't want us to start my marriage like that, with him that's not the way I want to start my relationship with him, that is not healthy way. To start a relationship and that's why I told him I said no, I don't want to do that, let me, let me get through my divorce live on my own it's going to take a year to get through the divorce anyway, so let me live on my own for a year, go through my divorce and then. And then you know. It if it's still happening between you and I, and you know, after a year and. Then, making you know get married I guess you know I say it like that, because it's still."
416.0,Provider,"Well, because it's not It really is in a in a healthy timeline of a relationship people don't usually talk about getting married before they've ever actually been met in person."
14322.0,Patient,yeah it's just.
416.0,Provider,"That is, I mean, I think you and I can agree that that's a red flag."
14322.0,Patient,that's weird it's just weird.
416.0,Provider,"Right, and these are the things that come up as red flags. For me, for your husband, and I think. For you, because you're a smart lady."
14322.0,Patient,I know. that's why i'm like.
416.0,Provider,red flags that make me go um. I don't know about this guy this sounds pretty.
14322.0,Patient,suspects yeah so that's why i'm like. i'm do need to I need to move on my own. I can't keep I can't live with this with him.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, I can appreciate that if that's. The way you're feeling I can totally appreciate. let's. Think about let's think about what is realistic, as far as. As far as that goes, so the distractions aside right the distractions make you feel good it's like it's like a quick drug that you're getting. yeah it's like it's like you know your favorite drug. But that is keeping you stuck in your reality. yeah so. If your reality needs to change, which it sounds like it does."
14322.0,Patient,It does.
416.0,Provider,"Then what is one step, you want to take this week to just. move forward a little bit."
14322.0,Patient,"I want my husband to agree with me, I want him to let me go."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, but you can't you can't make him agree with you, or not agree with you, so it has to be something you can control you can't control what he does you don't have. You don't have. control or influence over that."
14322.0,Patient,I need to move.
416.0,Provider,Okay me that's probably not gonna happen this week.
14322.0,Patient,I don't know.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, if you want to know about whether or not he can take your car or whether or not he can control you. What about starting out by contacting a lawyer i'm getting the answers to those questions."
14322.0,Patient,"Okay that's what I need to do I need to find a lawyer, I need to I gotta start somewhere I don't even know where to start that's why i'm like I don't know where to start because."
416.0,Provider,yeah well and you've spent a lot of time in your life relying on your husband to take care of things and so it's also understandable that you feel a little paralyzed around being able to do these things yourself. So hopefully part of this sort of reality.
14322.0,Patient,change that will get from you is.
416.0,Provider,Helping you realize that you don't need. Other people to do things for you or take care of you that you can actually take these steps right.
14322.0,Patient,"yeah I mean the only thing that my husband did for me in these 33 years is cook clean and watch over the kids but all the business aspects he relied on me to do it. And to this day, he still does like you know he just changed insurance he goes, I need you to I need to fill up the hipaa form, so that you can handle my. doctor appointments and you can handle talking to my doctors and setting me up and taking care of my insurance and everything because he's so used to meet taking care of them. will use demean taking care of everything he's never took care of the Billings he's never took care of the insurances and never took care of any of it, I handled all the business aspects, as I was working like I would literally have to work and do. All the things that a woman would do at home and handling the business aspects of things I would have to do that at work. and which he was really good at was cooking."
