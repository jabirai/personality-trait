12584.0,Patient,not really.
510.0,Provider,"Okay well let's talk about like I said I know you've been in group, but I I always like to formally review the group rules, so no one is surprised and they can't say no one told me this because. I often hear it, but I just like to say it out loud remind me when is your group, Michael when what day."
12584.0,Patient,Tuesday
510.0,Provider,"Tuesdays okay all right so obviously one of the big ones in group and again you're not in one of my groups but i'm hoping it's enforced is, you have to have earbuds or headphones, that is to ensure confidentiality is that something you're aware of, you have those when you're attending."
12584.0,Patient,um I didn't I didn't know about before. They told me last time i'm still not have some budget in this Tuesday coma.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, good yeah the other piece is, you have to have visual you have to be visual on camera at all times, if you have to step away it's important that you notify. Julie, or the therapist who facilitates just so they're not wondering what you're doing that is a requirement as well. Making sure that you're in a secure room, because without distractions right, and no one else can be in the room during group it's absolutely imperative that the confidentiality is adhere to. The other it's only happened once I had a client, he was a passenger in a car. can't that's not a security environment, even if you had your headphones or earbuds on that's not secure so make sure you're always not you can't be driving can't be a passenger car, you have to be in a secure environment and. I, are you a smoker at all, are you do you cigarettes or anything like that."
12584.0,Patient,No.
510.0,Provider,"No okay I just for some people, they do smoke I you know no smoking on camera can be very triggering for other clients. and obviously group is there, so. You know you're not the only one right so participation engagement is really encouraged to provide support to not only to you, but to others. how's it going. Do you tend to participate in group Michael do you share. What what's your level of participation."
12584.0,Patient,"They usually just go around and ask everybody same thing. mm hmm get everybody's opinion on certain stuff Okay, and do you tend to."
510.0,Provider,Okay okay good any questions about the group rules it sounds like you're now aware of the earbuds headphones and you'll have that taken care of any other questions or concerns that you're having with group.
12584.0,Patient,No.
510.0,Provider,"No okay good, then the final piece, I wanted to chat about now, obviously I will get you on my calendar and we'll have one individual session before. i'm no longer with bright heart, but I really want to emphasize that bright heart is a three prong approach, meaning, you have weekly group that you're expected to."
12584.0,Patient,participate.
510.0,Provider,"You have individual therapy and for now i'm your individual therapist you will be assigned a new one, though eventually. At a minimum, I have to see you twice a month or the therapist has to see you twice a month. And then the third part is. medication and obviously I know that was the biggest draw for you to participate with bright heart. But you are expected to participate in all three."
12584.0,Patient,If you don't protect.
510.0,Provider,"And all three you are in danger of being recommended for discharge eventually like I said you had missed so many. Of these appointments, you are really close to being referred out so just keep in mind. I know a lot of times people aren't super excited about working with a therapist they just want the medication, but the group and therapy is a requirement okay so just. And I know we're just starting to meet each other and you're going to have a new therapist, but please know that that will be. required in order for you to remain are you liking bright heart, are you feeling like it's a good fit."
12584.0,Patient,yeah. yeah a lot easier do from home. have to go out.
510.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah cuz i'm. The last thing I wanted to review and that's why I asked you what your thoughts were about bright heart. Because I, you must have recently completed a survey and you actually had listed."
12584.0,Patient,Some.
510.0,Provider,"Some concerns around quality of service and service desired so, can you tell me because you're telling me, it is a lot easier, are you are you unsatisfied with the services do you feel like there's things you're not getting that we could be supporting you in."
12584.0,Patient,answered it wrong.
510.0,Provider,"or something oh cuz I only remember it okay. It was submitted looks like August 14 yeah quality of service and service desired were very low, meaning you weren't happy, but you're saying, maybe you entered it wrong okay."
12584.0,Patient,"One week um I did without medicine for five days that might have been what it was, maybe."
510.0,Provider,Okay yeah this was August 14 I know. it's about a about a month ago okay.
12584.0,Patient,And i'm sure that I don't know.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right well i'll, I just wanted to make sure I review that with you, it sounds like your overall you're you're okay with bright heart and the services you're getting. Okay, and then really Michael the last piece is getting you on my calendar that last week in September so in two weeks we'll do a 30 minute session, just to sort of check in see how you're doing. Do you have a preference of time of day that we meet, I can tell you, some of my final slots I have."
12584.0,Patient,"This time, any. Day."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, let me see if I have. Like so 130 year time."

Okay, you need to check, in just like you did for this assessment, through the virtual clinic and they notify me in that way I let you in my my room so and I don't send reminders for appointments so did you write that down, do you want me to repeat it."
12584.0,Patient,September 30 at 130.
510.0,Provider,"You got it that's exactly right. um so I have you in my calendar, did you have and that's really all that we need to go over today, did you have any other questions concerns. Comments no Okay, then I will see you in two weeks and have a great rest of your day then."
12584.0,Patient,Thank you.
510.0,Provider,"I Michael nice to meet you. Especially when Michael Preston is over, he used to be listed as a no risk for safety, he denies any history or current thoughts of suicide homicide self injurious behaviors.
