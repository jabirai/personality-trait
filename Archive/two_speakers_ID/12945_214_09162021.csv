214.0,Provider,"There we go, how are you."
12945.0,Patient,Good how are you.
214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking how have things been."
12945.0,Patient,pretty good. pretty good i've been pretty good mentally but pretty tired though physically.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but what have you. What have you changed has anything else changed, I saw environment changed."
12945.0,Patient,"A little bit i'm. Like just and then I have talked to you when I first right after I talked to pretty sad for a good like four days. I wasn't crashed my depression test came out say like thinking that I don't know, I guess, like a trauma is like having trauma is okay. Coming trauma responses like just thinking that I did. I have that much of a family, but like to my family made me feel really bad for a few days, but. I guess i'm not no. not really I don't."
214.0,Provider,know and I wanna I want to process. So we had a trauma response that we feel we were responsible for the something in the family.
12945.0,Patient,"No, no, like you, let me know, like my test came back that i'm only like a like a moderate rate for depression and i've gone, since I was 12 years old. 10 years now, like making my mom's life like basically how because I I don't know how to control my emotions, I guess, the only problem with me."
214.0,Provider,"But, but so just to be fair, we have depression and we have emotional regulation they're not connected."
12945.0,Patient,"uh yeah I guess but i've just been like Mary suicidal and that's like Ben. Like a lot for my mom she's like it's just been a lot for me and a lot for my mom like like feeling so much and not feeling like anything for myself and yeah just. Now I feel really felt really guilty for a few days, but i've kind of like process that it's because of like i've just been thinking about everything that's happened to me my whole life and, like, I guess, but that's the result. Of that, and no."
214.0,Provider,"But has anything in the environment changed. Okay. So, when you say everything is pretty good does your words, so you did something to make it pretty good so if the environment didn't change and you had to do something."
12945.0,Patient,been. I don't know i've been pretty like regular type of I guess. Different depressed joining thing.
214.0,Provider,"And when we look at that, is there a benefit to that."
12945.0,Patient,And then we.
214.0,Provider,"know what i'm what i'm saying is like. When we start to get in that downfall that roller coaster that hard drop, is there a way to say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I don't have to go on that ride, I can go on the ride that's going up, is there a way to use a challenging. To to combat what the brain is trying to portray as real versus what the facts are telling you the real."
12945.0,Patient,yeah yeah i've been able to like differentiate that. More recently.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and why more recently than not like so more recently like it's useful to do that, or is it difficult to to implement."
12945.0,Patient,"yeah and it is useful and it's something that i've known before it can do, but like it was just a reminder to do after talking to you, I guess, just like rationalize things more and like not blame my emotion on. yeah not blaming happening."
214.0,Provider,"So, so are you feeling guilty, for having emotions. So you don't like what you stir up. Fair enough, so how about this. Why are we mad when life is pretty good. that's an emotion."
12945.0,Patient,Is no one can be upset with me.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so. I knew that's where you're going so i'm going to take you right there. So this is more about when you're in homeostasis you believe everyone else is in homeostasis if you if you walk around with lollipops and cotton candy everybody's gonna be happy, but you're the reason everybody becomes miserable."
12945.0,Patient,"Okay, I think I go."
214.0,Provider,"By cuz you like, I put my mom to hell, but but wait a minute wait a minute if if you're having difficulties. juggling emotions why, why should you feel guilty about that maybe you haven't found the right therapist maybe you have just having enlighten yourself to. Why can I manage all this turmoil what someone's got to help me figure this out, maybe that's the missing tool you shouldn't be guilty, we can be guilty if we're not good at math. We, the good at, it will moderate will Okay, we just make it, but we are what we are in until someone can teach us something different to get us better right, so I want you to try to. Less lean on guilt, but lean on like so you know what I haven't found the right teacher. I realize I can manage it. But maybe there is a teacher that will help me find peace and be proactive to managing life, so I can have a better quality of life, I think I think you have in an emotional era. it's an irregular emotional like discharging they fire wrong and then it becomes like I don't know like a like a bad mix bag of tricks. And I think you you then you can't regulate and then the only regulation is you know suicide ideation is probably that's a regulation skill. You got you lean to that to stop that right because that's what happens you start thinking about suicide than these thoughts, no longer are overwhelming now we're in. I control suicide i'll say when it's gonna happen that's why I, this is about me I can't control that but i'll lean into this and what i'm thinking is we probably can find the medium to how to control that."
12945.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"And I think you can do it, I do. You know if we haven't been taught to walk as a child we're not going to walk right it's really the same concept here somehow another. Either attentively, maybe not irresponsibly someone wasn't helping you adjust in you growing up. I then you had the situation with the bar like he you had a couple like real ripples. That maybe wouldn't have been so much of a ripple if we could have worked through a process about what we're feeling, but the problem is that. Ultimately, the feeling comes, and now it can get released and the way it gets released as we go up here and we'll say Okay, and I stopped that i'm going to go here, this is my go to right and I rather not. Have that be the go to I rather be able to say I can be a piece, and this is what i'm going to do the be at peace, so I think we should work on unjust manage ability of self regulation. I think it would be, I think it would benefit you tremendously to to like incorporate almost what people would parallel to exercise. practicing self regulation all the time, so your your body's always in homeostasis It can never get upset I just did an hour session with someone very similar to getting overwhelmed over anything you know, a bad apple just to tell spin. And the idea here is so we were not doing any prep work right, we can call it silly and we can say what do we care we buy an apple but to this person this. This apple this bold is is a big impact, so we have to teach them So how are we going to prep what's the exercises we're going to do, every day, so we can regulate the heart right. You Paris Sim. Sim your Paris symptomatic system is going to put you in flight, we have to make it fight we have to make it well okay. I got to get the heart rate down because I feel very coming on my chest up if that happens to my anxieties takes off and then I launched right. So I think if we could, and if you open to it, we can bring in some exercises that we do every day and then what happens is your body just comes becomes very calm just by itself, because. you're exercising these Vegas nerves to say Okay, I need you to help me control my heart better does that sound like it's it's it's something you want to do."
12945.0,Patient,yeah actually what does. That mean I was like the first well I don't like this advice is is is that was the first thing that I was thinking about.
214.0,Provider,"ya know I but, but you know when we say exercising or it could be negative. But, but we know that will when most people talk about exercise you're talking about a regimen to talking like getting up go to the gym having a power drink i'm incorporating self regulating techniques to care for ourselves so it's it's. We don't connect it with exercise it, but what i'm saying is, we have to do it to three times a day, whether where i'm. Not regulating correctly over regulated correctly now we're going to train the body that this is how we want the heart rate to be all the time as low as possible. No impact, no matter what happens we're just going to keep moving moving moving and what we learned is we can't use them. When we're in crisis it doesn't work it's not powerful, but if we do it two times a day three times a day like they talk about meditation. You know people like you should meditate it's like meditating at the time it's a problem doesn't work. And then you find people who say you know I meditate before I go to work i'm going to go see they're doing they're doing a structured exercise they're incorporating something to build up. You know, a regulation, and I think if I can get you to pick up one or two of them you'll find the big difference. On you know the world won't impact you so much you'll be able to be like yeah it's not a big thing i'm not gonna sweat that and I think that'll make you somewhat you know more comfortable."
12945.0,Patient,Right yeah. I was looking for like yeah that's what I was gonna say I was looking for anything that I could do like to really like prepare myself for whatever is going to happen to me throughout the day because it like it can be really like anything that could. send me off like I can see apple. plastic day. Exactly yeah. I completely it could literally be an apple for me to.
214.0,Provider,"It really is there's no rhyme or reason. We can identify something over and over again it's constantly manipulating changing and moving what bothered me two weeks ago will not bother me for another three years, something new, will come up right. So I think you're right, and I think you know when we think about it is, we need to start to get you probably I don't want to say. You may be high impact high energy, meaning the mind is always. Just running and running and running what happens is you're increasing your heart rate, too, because you have populating thoughts, then you can stop them, then these mood swings come so the really easy regular heart rate. is increasing what may seem to be anxiety, but the reality is we're stimulating all that adrenaline and what we gotta do. is pushed hundred we don't need a gentleman we're not going into a fistfight actually what we want to go into asleep on the world around us is caving in we're just going to go into a very simple posture and it won't bother us, I think this could be very helpful feel."
12945.0,Patient,"Something, though, that I wanted to mention is that I struggle, a lot with I don't I I overthink things, yes, like all in like. The most like literal terminal over think things like all think about something, just like over and over and over again, but I don't have like many. thoughts, like my thought my brain will run empty for a very long period of time and I, I find it very hard on most days to like form or to. articulate what i'm thinking in any way Aaron like my feelings in any way and it like that's one of my main problems too is not being like i'm not physically I feel enabled to say what i'm feeling or thinking and it just like makes the problem worse and worse."
214.0,Provider,"But I want to validate you by supporting you with something. This is the this certain alignment or disarray of emotional regulation, everything is just moving. And in simple things that we should be able to see the feel of, say, we can this there's too many missing pieces and pieces that are moving and not moving correctly, so your homeostasis your mind body and soul is totally a turmoil at all times. Totally I don't like you're in an internal war that you may not be aware of, so when you speak to something like that that's what that reminds me like there's an internal dispute isn't upsetting of the nervous system, the Vegas nerve. Possibly the neurons that are firing in the brain everything is just off like we need like a hard reboot of reset and then bring up so i'm thinking, even more, this will be beneficial for you, because you need to be grounded."
12945.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, I feel like my it's. Like i'll try to like it, I can't even connect with people like it like I haven't really connected with anyone."
214.0,Provider,"know because people can't. Just just think about the world today people just don't believe in things. That others don't support, so if you know you know we think welcome back with just healthy people who say what's wrong with this person that's crazy nobody does that. And it's like easy because this person, it may work for we're not we're all humans, but we're all built very different and not all of us take the same fuel. Whether it's optical whether it's audio whether it's it's it's communication we all really function different we all look like we got hearts and lungs. that's an exterior similarity but the way we actually fire very different, and I think what's happening is you know for a while you you're just not in a resting place. Like you've you've got to truly start to feel like oh my God i'm like i'm like really present I I can my hands are shaking I. there's no fear in my mind i'm actually sleeping through the night Okay, so what how did I get there, well, maybe I started to incorporate these things and I started to give my body right that reboot that he needed right, because if we can't call the body. it's just problematic, and I think mostly it's it's probably the mind not working correctly, with the body and there's some discord there. And and it's just an alignment thing, and I think you would really benefit by it, but you know you got to be into it like do you have a ritual in the morning coffee cereal and you gotta, what do you got."
12945.0,Patient,I do yeah I I pretty much shower every morning I have like a smoothie and tea every morning.
214.0,Provider,"ritual. Like that yeah so you, I would ask you that either pre or post that ritual that's another part of ritual."
12945.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,"And then every day, the body's going to yearn what you told that you're going to do that's how we get people. To you know drink teas and have smoothies we tell them start incorporating and before you know it. The body's making you do it versus you wanting to do it now becomes this pattern, so, if I can get you in a pattern in the morning, I think it's more important for you to. Be chilled in the morning to take you through the day and then we got to figure on the day, where we can slip one in, but I think that would be. very beneficial."
12945.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then our next session really is going to be watching. Part of the Vegas nerve and the sympathetic system on you know what are the things we can do to reduce heart rate. right but not have to leave a room my there's there's relaxation techniques for the eyes on this, what they call bear down and it works, but you know. i'm just asking you to be open to it, because on the onset of people like you gotta be kidding me i'm like I know it looks like you think it's not going to work, but if you do that, it won't work like. Give it one shot for a week, you know, so I have a couple of people on different routines some of saying they've seen the proven someone like. i'm finding it hard to do it i'm like so this isn't a good one let's go to a different one right until you figure out what a smoothie is you're not going to know what you like in the ingredients. So you know, then you start making your own elixir all right, I never liked tea. And I only have one coffee day and then I have to tease I forced myself to start to realize So what are you trying to do, what are the benefits, what are you trying to get out of it. And then I enlightened it by what it provides me and it becomes palatable and I look forward to my two t's now, but I have to change. A little bit of my belief system so i'm hoping you're open to just understanding that you know part of this is you being open to seeing how it is and then not saying like well this should be working already. You know it's I have to go back to exercising you know people gain weight and they're like what i've been to the gym every day for seven days i'm like okay that's not the way this works. However long it took you to gain weight. it's double to get it off very easy to gain weight is not that easy to get it off and it's not easy to maintain weight. But structure and what your belief system is anything can be beneficial. Right, so we believe that are breathing from the belly or these I movements or changing peripheral vision, making forcing the eyes to look. As far to the left as possible, it starts to decrease heart rate and we get calm so i'm going to do that, next time for you, because I think you would truly. benefit by, especially if you're into the team smoothie in the morning, so you're into a ritual and that's good."
12945.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,yeah. yeah i'm a ritual guy too if I don't get into a ritual I won't do anything.
12945.0,Patient,yeah exactly I.
214.0,Provider,"Like. I mean i'm not a dd or ADHD but I swear I am. But I know that the only way to be committed is to do it, and do it every day and. Over and over and over and then my body just takes over and I don't even realize that i'm setting a pattern i've done so it works for me, but in on the answer was a little tough okay so let's see we got so you didn't do any of your surveys."
12945.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
214.0,Provider,"So, would you like me to email you you the surveys, just to help out. Yes, yeah because. This is this is going to cause a slight dilemma so we'll take care of that you'll get that either tonight later tomorrow don't worry about either or those what is next week look like feel."
12945.0,Patient,I don't know yet work wise. When we all work in the mornings.
214.0,Provider,"Oh. So then, you have evenings available. But when we say evenings like what's your Max time."
12945.0,Patient,Like how a LIEN.
214.0,Provider,yeah like you know when do you stop operating.
12945.0,Patient,Probably like 988 30 is like.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I think we can accommodate up and I want to make sure i'm not double booking. So that's my seven. that's why so much is my. My master calm, oh no So what do you think about eight o'clock at night. The reason i'm also suggesting it. This may be a good one because you're going to practice, these techniques and then i'd love to know on our next visit. Was sleep any better was waking up in the morning anybody because you're you're telling out into the night, and this would be a good time to introduce and they're not really like 40 steps to every exercise of basically one stop, but I think it'd be beneficial, what do you think."
12945.0,Patient,yeah I agree.
214.0,Provider,"Okay cool so i'm putting you down for Monday. At 11 my time, but it's actually. Eight your time. Perfect let me get that into your chart as last."
12945.0,Patient,"night I just recently started yoga maybe like a few months ago, and that is something that, like my body is really like set to doing now every two or."
214.0,Provider,"So this. This is actually going to be super beneficial feel. This is actually, this is actually what I call the ancillary spice you know I give you an example, we you know. Unfortunately it's a little biased and and meaning i'm going to pick on males males think they need to live to have the the heavier weights. And you know they you know we got a bench press 1000 pounds and they don't realize that you can get the same amount of muscle tone and shape with a minimum model weights, with more defined repetitions and exercises right. So when we think about yoga. I like yoga stretches only because i'm older and it's good for my back, but what I say is everything i'm doing to regenerate. My body my heart my mind, is a plus and that's how I do it, so I have multiple rituals to today, but when you're doing yoga and you got into yoga. you're going into the mind body and soul posture right you're not going into being able to run 100 miles and. You know bench press you know 300 pounds you're you're about this alignment right because yoga is a button alignment it's about a breathing and it's about you know what do we benefit where we at right, so this will actually complement the yoga and vice versa, so I think it's. really good yeah so we're we're actually good then. Just let me get shoot in here yeah i'm glad you did that. um. Yes, we need to do the surveys. Are you still seeing an outside therapist. come up again anyway don't matter so it's Monday right so Monday, it will be. The 20th we said 8pm your time awesome. Get 30 minutes got me an. awesome."
12945.0,Patient,Or the 20th is Monday. Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Is that not good, because I won't book it done."
12945.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"i'll change it to another, you want to change."
12945.0,Patient,I feel like you're so far into the process is there no.
214.0,Provider,I have not begun to cut the heart out. We are so good.
12945.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"So I do have. we're going to cancel that we're gonna leave that I want to look at something else, it looks like I have another date. I have to match two counties of and that's always problematic so Thursday."
12945.0,Patient,Thursday group.
214.0,Provider,"Oh, so this is all. hold on, let me start off with some it's it takes a while."
12945.0,Patient,"Oh yeah actually I could do it at like eight on Thursday, like my I think my group starts."
214.0,Provider,"It can do and individually, at the same time."
12945.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"So what, what do you think about. Five or six on Friday, the 24th. So can we do. So six is nine my time. Okay perfect, so I got you for the 24th. Now. We go back to your chart and just. secure that date so Where are you. 24 and we said six o'clock. Yes. Yes, oh perfect. Alright perfect so then we're straight i'll have the videos ready. And we'll go from there. Any questions, for me, before we leave."
12945.0,Patient,"I appreciate this, though."
214.0,Provider,"Not no problem at all, and if again just a friendly reminder the surveys will be appreciated."
12945.0,Patient,yeah I know i'm gonna i'm gonna go with my ego.
214.0,Provider,"No problem Okay, other than that I look forward to seeing you on Monday."
12945.0,Patient,Thank you.
