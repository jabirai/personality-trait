13272.0,Patient,Hello.
462.0,Provider,hi Bernard how are you.
13272.0,Patient,Good how are you.
462.0,Provider,doing good Thank you. So how has everything gone for you over the past couple weeks.
13272.0,Patient,"i'm not so bad, I think I had a good time um it's the holidays, I feel like. i'm definitely feeling a lot. festive."
462.0,Provider,Okay.
13272.0,Patient,i'm.
462.0,Provider,done any holiday activities or anything festive.
13272.0,Patient,"yeah I think I have gone to a few. holiday. Well they're not really parties but holiday get together and it was fun. And then I called a couple of friends to my house probably this week so hopefully that'll be fun. yeah so it's it's really nice also like a few of my friends surprise me, too, they didn't tell me where they were taking me but they ended up taking me to six flags so that was really. cool magic mountain tree yeah it's my first time there. So yeah. The rfp because of like all these social things that I have been going to I had a few thoughts that I became aware of. Though so maybe I was thinking we can. go over them, so I don't know when I hang out with people I am constantly worried that. i'm kind of I feel like i'm thinking about. I have to work hard to keep the conversation going and so that people are not bored."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah, this is actually a pretty common social anxiety thought. So just kind of one easy rebuttal to that a way to kind of give yourself another thought to replace that with is that it's a two way street right so. you're not 100% responsible for carrying forth the conversation, but others are also you know, responsible and able to take part in that, and also that silence is OK to I know that we have this thing that it's like so awkward and horrible and not Okay, but it is."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah That was the other thing to like normally when I am by myself i'm okay with silence that means I don't really have to have anything going on in the background, and I can just be fine, but why is it that with other people um, even though I feel like. Sometimes people would prefer silence, but why is it that I think that silence might be a little bit weird and I don't know people might be."
462.0,Provider,"We have a societal. thing about silence that it's like awkward and boring and bad so just first of all, breaking through that and then you know from my connection, you have. Some core beliefs of kind of like being a burden or. Other social core beliefs, that are leading you to think that the silence is your problem, your problem and. If it's there then you're not good enough you're not doing something good enough you're being a burden or boring so i'd say it's partly a societal thing and partly related to some of your core beliefs, what do you think about that."
13272.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah I mean I thought that I mean i'm trying to change my core beliefs right so um. I feel like sometimes I I feel like i'm doing a great progress with changing a few things but also like Sometimes I feel like maybe I have to work a lot more on myself, and that is kind of discouraging a little bit. yeah I know that I understand that that's. that's how the process works, but i'm trying to change it as fast as i'm able to, but then it doesn't happen."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's not something that happens overnight, we everybody has core beliefs. And some of them are really ingrained in us and have been kind of hammered in just hammered over and over and over again, with all of our different experiences. So it can be really hard to reverse them you've done a great job right we've been doing cvt work and you've done a great job continuing to work through that. But it just you got to kind of keep going and keep reminding yourself and these specific examples that you're giving are a great way to start right so. you notice that coming up now, maybe next time you challenge yourself to just let the silence be there and affirm yourself the silence isn't because i'm boring. it's just it's okay right."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay. we'll do that. Speaking of progress, I said no to people that I didn't want to do, hang."
462.0,Provider,Okay. How was that experience for you here laughing.
13272.0,Patient,"um it's because I feel like. Some people don't expect me to say no, because I usually come up with excuses very down excuses. Though um I don't know I felt it felt good because I felt like okay I, I am in control and I don't have to feel like. It is my my job to I don't know it's just I feel like I have the right to say no, if I don't want to do something and that's Okay, and I feel like part of the reason why I don't keep saying no it's because I want to please everyone, and i'm like a no I don't want to do that not anymore."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah that's it's the people pleasing thing right and. yeah and the. The guy that goes back to the core beliefs, as well, so what invitations did you turn down."
13272.0,Patient,"Oh, this um this guy just asked me to come over and sleep with him and I said no, I don't want to."
462.0,Provider,"good for you. I start, and I know that was something that came up last time was you not wanting to be. romantic with certain people and trying to kind of set those boundaries."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I am Okay, with the romantic stuff, but I just don't like when people just asked me to come see it's just so straightforward and yeah. yeah that's I don't I don't think that I like that as much as I wanted to do that, or I as much as I wanted to be that person who doesn't care. um, but I feel like that's just not me."
462.0,Provider,"that's a great thing to acknowledge and recognize and stick with so yeah it would be great to not care, but you do and that's okay too so. yeah down did it bring about any anxiety when you turn to that invitation down."
13272.0,Patient,"not really because I know I don't think so, I mean I reasoned with myself that, even if this person doesn't invite me to hang out again it is going to be fine because. I I feel like i'd be okay, if I have not known this person for the rest of my life basically."
462.0,Provider,"Okay well that's good so you accomplished a goal, there you accomplished, you know, one of our ongoing goals of continuing working through the cvt and trying to kind of reframe those thoughts. How do you feel about trying to move forward thinking about that kind of fear of silence and trying to work through that when you're in social situations."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I would be okay to work on that yeah um, how do you think that I should be going or working on that just let the silence be."
462.0,Provider,"Just noticing the discomfort when the silence is there. letting it be there for a second. And when the discomfort comes up, rather than just like trying to blurt something out to fill it just taking a deep breath and being like okay I don't have to be the one to fill this silence it's not your sole job."
13272.0,Patient,"Right okay. I can do that. That would be a good thing, I feel like you work on."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that goes directly in line with. Just what you've been noticing and the cvt work that we've been doing so just continuing to reframe your thoughts notice that they're coming from a core belief and giving an alternate alternate perspective right, so the alternate perspective is. it's not just your job to fill the silence, silence is actually okay."
13272.0,Patient,"No okay. So the other thing also that came up this week, this one I don't know how to navigate this one, so a lot of my friends will be leaving soon for the holidays and they will be gone for a month or so. And I feel like i've been having thought that, in a month, a lot can change and maybe we won't be friends anymore. That was a little bit worried. I don't know why this came up but yeah that's why I need help navigating, this is it that i'm boring that i'll be alone, because I feel like that might be a part of it. I don't know."
462.0,Provider,yeah i'm just hearing a lot of fear surrounding. friendships. it's like you're afraid of losing friends you're afraid of. telling people you just want to be friends you're afraid of being boring to them or being a burden so there's just so much fear wrapped around friendships. What. Where and when did this start.
13272.0,Patient,"This started, I feel like. i've ever I mean ever since I got. got back from India and also like now that I feel like i've been developing this really good friendships and relationships that I want where I can be friends with people. And also like right around Now people are leaving for like the holidays and stuff and i've been like wait, what if things change."
462.0,Provider,What are you what are you thinking could change what what changes are you afraid of.
13272.0,Patient,That they'll forget about me.
462.0,Provider,"they'll forget about you, so you think you're going to be just forgot."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah hi I feel like I, they will hit me up anymore or. When they get back or just things like that and it's weird I don't know it's it's a weird thought. yeah they might like move on from me, because they won't see me."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's look at the evidence against to this what alternate thoughts and what evidence against this can you provide and write down."
13272.0,Patient,"alternate parts. I think that the best case, the best hot or the best moments or things that actually happen is when I don't see my friends for like a whole. 10 to 11 months and we barely talk to each other, but when I still go back to India it's feels like. Nothing changed, and I feel like we prioritize each other and yeah."
462.0,Provider,"that's a perfect one, so rooted in reality, the reality is is that you were recently gone for a while and did they forget about you."
13272.0,Patient,know they did not.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so there's a really good thing you can bring yourself back to that you weren't forgotten because literally recently, you were the one that was gone and it was a good period of time, so that's a good start."
13272.0,Patient,Okay.
462.0,Provider,"And also. You know, obviously the thought of being forgotten isn't rooted in reality, but you can also do things to stay connected, we have. messaging and instagram and. You know, all these different social media video calls, do you ever send messages out just to say hey to some of these people."
13272.0,Patient,"I have been starting to do that, yes. Okay."
462.0,Provider,"And you can always challenge yourself to do that. reach out, you know, especially on holidays Christmas New Year, etc."
13272.0,Patient,Oh yeah that is that's a. yeah I feel like I will definitely be doing that for the Christmas and New Year.
462.0,Provider,Then you know that you're not forgotten because you're actually talking to them.
13272.0,Patient,"Okay. yeah I feel like this is, I feel a lot better."
462.0,Provider,yeah no that's that's great and again this is still just kind of working through that cvt processes seeing what's thoughts coming up. Maybe seeing what core belief it's rooted in what's another thought and what's true evidence against it right rooted in reality and the reality is the one you came up with is great that you were gone recently and now you're back and. Nobody forgot about you.
13272.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"yeah, but I want to since this seems to be a pretty prevalent thing and fear, I wanted to see if an assignment around this might be good. Maybe you writing an autobiography about your social life throughout your life so starting back when you were a child, maybe your first memories of friendship. How that developed through kindergarten elementary school middle school high school college. In the present day, do you think that would be helpful to just start to kind of look at where is this all coming from socially and how did this, develop and what were some of these experiences that in themes that stick out to you."
13272.0,Patient,"Oh, I see yeah that would be very helpful yeah I can I can already kind of gas what's gonna happen."
462.0,Provider,Do you think you would want to do that as an assignment.
13272.0,Patient,"yeah i'll do that as an assignment, I think this is going to be helpful. Okay, I usually don't like going. To these places, but. I think it's time to do that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah I don't blame you, it can be very painful, but sometimes it's helpful to see where all these patterns start to build up and again hammer in those core beliefs. So it can be your social autobiography and you can just start from your first social memories and work your way up to present day. Since it like you said you know you're like Oh, I can see where this is going I don't really. want to go through these memories, this would be a good thing to make sure that you. aren't doing right before you have to go and do some serious work or something like that maybe make sure you have some time to do some exercise or breathing afterwards, take a walk just to kind of decompress after you're working on that. You."
13272.0,Patient,Okay yeah I think i'll i'll be able to do it.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so that'll be an assignment for between now and next time."
13272.0,Patient,"That will be good. So the other things that I worked on give some thought was how were those abusive feelings felt in my relationship. So I feel like when I think about it mentally I it felt very exhausting. There were a lot of days and yeah a lot, a lot of days, where I would. just want to be by myself and. yeah a lot of things would go on and mentally like I have to be careful, I have to be, I have to make sure that I don't say something that is going to trigger. So yeah Those were some of the things that was going on mentally and physically, I think I was always very alert and on guard. For the most part and. I remember, there were a lot of times, where I would be spending a lot of time I work. Like I would leave work late, even though I didn't have to, and then I will park the car and I would sit in the car for like. Half an hour or so until like I would be like Oh, I need to go now to the park my end and they are so Those are some of the things that I do remember, because it was very heavy and I never wanted to confront these things so usually I would just suppress all of it. And just go on about my day and try to avoid conflict as much as I was able to."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you did some reflection on that and it sounds like you can remember it being very heavy trying to walk on eggshells, a little bit avoid conflict. And you know, like I said last time that can set a standard in your mind and body that relationships are very up and down. And if things aren't up and down like that then something's wrong and it's boring or it's just not right so it's just kind of a matter of retraining yourself to look at that the reflection that you just did and see that that isn't the standard."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah no I think i'm able to see that that is not how i'm supposed to be feeling, you know relationship. But i've also been reading a few stuff. Like whenever I get time that it is like I don't know like after like an abusive relationship, it is going to be hard for me like this is what I got the sense from some of the reading. is going to be hard to get into a healthy relationship, and I feel like that also like means that I don't want to be in a relationship, for now, because I don't know like do you think like there needs to be a time in between when. I left this abusive relationship and then there's there needs to be a time period where I am not in a relationship and then. I started thinking about a relationship or because I feel like i'm not understanding this like, if I am going into a healthy relationships say whenever i'm a whenever i'm ready, does that mean that it's going to be very rough for me because I don't want it to."
462.0,Provider,"You know, it really varies person to person having that time in between typically is helpful for reflection and healing and doing what you're doing exactly what you're doing. And there's no way to predict how it's going to feel getting into a new relationship, unfortunately I can't I can't predict. I can say that it's definitely difficult feelings can come up ptsd type things can come up. But knowing how to manage them and having the awareness makes all the difference so it's not like you're going to just be repeating what you went through before it's totally different because you're empowered with this time right."
13272.0,Patient,that's right.
462.0,Provider,So just reminding yourself that it's difficult things do come up you're empowered you're able to work through them you coping skills you're in therapy you're changing your thought patterns.
13272.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trying to unlearn, so much so many of these patterns these toxic pattern."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and try not to overwhelm yourself with it, you know it's okay to just let yourself live too I think it's important what you're doing, but sometimes you also just gotta let yourself let yourself be."
13272.0,Patient,"I think I think i'm pretty happy with. I mostly i'm pretty happy with where i'm at, and I am trying as much as i'm able to like let it be and not force anything. As much as i'm able to."
462.0,Provider,Do okay so that's a good start any any more thoughts on that reflection on the abusive relationship and the kind of roller coaster nature of it.
13272.0,Patient,"No, I think that's all right."
462.0,Provider,Good yeah that's great so you can keep those thoughts and. Did you say you feel like you are ready to get into a new relationship and that's something you want.
13272.0,Patient,"No, I am I don't feel like i'm ready to do this. I mean, I told people now there is this one guy that I have been having. You know that, but I told them that I just got out of a relationship. of very intense one and i'm not looking for anything, one of them as a friend now so. We hang out and it's. fun when we do. And the other guy he likes to go on dates, but he knows he knows like more of it that I am going through divorce and it's been i've been in this abusive relationship for three years, but it's all it's all fun for now I guess."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so that's good you're communicating you're thinking about it and you recognize that you're not ready so then maybe just focusing on the social relationships is a good place to be, which is kind of what you're doing, and in line with that. We talked about joining a hiking group. Were you able to learn. more about that."
13272.0,Patient,"I haven't looked into a hiking group just yet, but I did go on hikes."
462.0,Provider,Okay.
13272.0,Patient,i'll probably have to join a meetup group. I can do that yeah.
462.0,Provider,hey I know you were just wanting to join some type of the group in a theater because the Kobe didn't seem great right now is that still something you want to do connect with people in other ways other groups.
13272.0,Patient,"I would. i'm may want to join theater at some point, maybe in the new years. But I right now I feel like I will be okay, with just hiking or I i'm actually considering I mean this is probably not a group activity, but I was considering joining like singing lessons my friend, told me about this. This teacher that she takes some classes from so I might actually do that just for myself my thing. I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"That sounds perfect so you've got some really great ideas and you're moving forward with everything so just kind of with all of that, what would you say, are some of the things that are going well for you right now it's the things you're struggling with."
13272.0,Patient,"I hang. The social anxiety is probably something that I know that I struggle, a little bit with I mean it's not a huge thing, because I can see myself having fun and enjoy it. But yeah that's still there. and I feel like there are a few words that always come up in my mind. That I need to still process and work on. And every time those words come to my mind, I kind of shut shut down easily. it's hard to come back to the present but. yeah but those are the only things that I can think of, but other than that I feel like i'm doing pretty well."
462.0,Provider,yeah I would agree you're moving along with the goals really well. You know everything that we add to your treatment plan each week we pretty much circle back and you. follow through with all of it so that's good do you have any questions about your treatment plan or the goals that we set together.
13272.0,Patient,I don't have any questions I guess so. I guess that was this one middle term goal that we talked about something that was like a sense of purpose that comes from perfectionism. Is that something that we're also going to work on and at some point. yeah and my sense of values that come from these achieve. achievements and.
462.0,Provider,yeah I feel like it's important.
13272.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, as I guess like i'm not in I think i'm like at a point in my life, where I don't care about this at all that I need to constantly be achieving something um but, however, I really want to address this a little bit, because I do see a pattern where i'm like. Leaving job in a year or so and. Then, and it might be, because I have this. sense of purpose, where I wanted to achieve more and more."
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah so i'm glad you brought that up because that was one of the more middle term goals that I do have listed down so. It might be a bit much to try to do that, right now, with the autobiography the social autobiography assignment I just gave you so what would you think about kind of. working through that social autobiography sharing it with me next time we meet, and then I do have like a particular assignment and thoughts on the. achievement and perfectionism."
13272.0,Patient,I think the social autobiography is something that I wanted to know so yeah I think that's more important for me to work on.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so we can start there and then keep that perfectionism and achievement thing as a middle term goal. Okay, and maybe that can be what we address next after you share your social autobiography."
13272.0,Patient,Absolutely that sounds good.
462.0,Provider,Okay. yeah so that's good stuff how about anything else that's come up for you.
13272.0,Patient,"um. Does the other stuff that comes up is like i've I think this is also something that I was thinking about recently, is that I feel like i'm such a good liar. And that's not good, because I don't want to be, I mean, as it makes me feel so so here's the thing and I had this conversation with a friend. So I might not be lying, but I will be hiding some information and my friend said well if you're hiding something that means you're lying and. Well, you know we all have these definition and for me i'm like well for the most part, I grew up like hiding my sexuality and not like because of like my safety and things like that and that made me probably a very good liar. And this comes up because. Because. There was this person, I think I told you, the story my coworker ex coworker he told me that it's very difficult to trust me because i'm very secretive and I hide it and i'm like I get that and I understand where he's coming from. But I don't want to be a good liar and I don't want to hide myself like that or hide anything in general but it's just so easy for me to do."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that's a really good point you made that you had to hide things and you had to lie, you know with your sexuality throughout your life so it kind of put you in that place of feeling like this is how I need to navigate the world. So sometimes we do for safety reasons or privacy reasons need to do that right, and maybe there are times, where you you don't want to share your sexuality sexuality and that's okay. um but are there places where you feel like you could be open and you could encourage yourself and challenge yourself to do so."
13272.0,Patient,"yeah I think in social situations, I have actually been trying to be open, and I think I feel a lot better to be open um. But yeah that just some talk came up and I was thinking to myself, like well, I must be a really good liar if i've been lying all this lie all my."
462.0,Provider,it's it's again there's sometimes lying and maybe it's not even lying it's hiding things to protect yourself serves a purpose.
13272.0,Patient,surviving yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Exactly sometimes it's surviving and that's Okay, especially in a world with a lot of homophobia and judgment and all of that you've kind of had to navigate this way to survive. And you don't need to feel shame for that so maybe it's just a matter of letting go the shame and not even thinking of it as lying but thinking of it as surviving."
13272.0,Patient,yeah I think that's that's The conclusion I came up to like now. I wasn't really lying I was doing everything. In terms of surviving really. Right oh. Right I didn't want it to get killed. or.
462.0,Provider,fashion fair yeah so. Because lie.
13272.0,Patient,"yeah it wasn't because I remember like I I was physically assaulted ones, because people suspected me too big day and i'm like well if I if I were to be like oh i'm actually gay that I would have been like you've been in. Forest situation on those though I feel like i'm okay it's something that I had to do at that time. yeah well i'm glad I did anyone would have done that, to protect themselves, especially because you were assaulted you said, I think, before you even really knew. Your sex yeah before even I knew."
462.0,Provider,yeah that was just like that's just horrible.
13272.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so all I did was to survive, but that's okay see I I was thinking about it and i'm okay with that i'm Okay, with my life decisions."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's great um so just trying to reframe that out again that this wasn't like lying. You can think of lying as like someone doing something to harm someone else right you lie to someone else to harm someone else you weren't harming anyone, you are simply protecting yourself and possibly your life. mm hmm which anyone would do in that case."
13272.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and that goes in line, a little bit with just your your harsh on yourself. very, very harsh on yourself, you know to kind of feel bad about That just shows that there's a lot of harsh thoughts so. You know, see if you can develop some self compassion and."
13272.0,Patient,"Yes, I an acceptance, yes, I am trying to understand and trying to be kind to words myself."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so what would you summarize as your goals between this time at our next session, which is the pull up pull it up, but what would you summarize as your goals."
13272.0,Patient,I think my goal would be to work on the social autobiography and just. try to understand where the. Social anxiety and those thoughts come from and why have double up this pattern right.
462.0,Provider,"Perfect that's a really good start, do you want to keep the joining a hiking group on there."
13272.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah I can do that if the weather is nice it's.
462.0,Provider,"Terrible I mean you don't have to do, we can scratch it off, but I. i'm just looking at my mind so."
13272.0,Patient,"I can, I can try to do when is the next time i'm seeing you I think in two weeks right."
462.0,Provider,It is it's the.
13272.0,Patient,28th at 930 and that's what I have one of my calendar.
462.0,Provider,yep 28th at 930.
13272.0,Patient,Okay yeah I can I can try to join actually beta might not happen because that's a holiday week.
462.0,Provider,yeah that might just be a bit much will put that on hold for now. Okay.
13272.0,Patient,"All right, yeah and. I don't think anyone's going to be here during."
462.0,Provider,yeah so you can put that on hold and you can think a little bit about maybe just researching groups or if there's a theater group you maybe want to do instead. But we can put that on hold and then just continuing the CBC evidence for evidence against alternate thought for some of these things that come up like you've been.
13272.0,Patient,yeah i'll keep on working on that Thank you.
462.0,Provider,And Have you had any suicidal thoughts.
13272.0,Patient,No suicidal thoughts.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's been quite a while, since you've had any suicidal thoughts. Do you consider yourself to have any impulsivity with suicide like you just feel impulsively drawn to. Think about that or have any method or anything like that. Okay well that's good that's progress too."
13272.0,Patient,yeah i'm glad. doesn't happen.
462.0,Provider,"All right. yeah So is there anything else, I can support you with any other questions any other things to process through today."
13272.0,Patient,"No, I think that's that's that's good work today, thank you."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you're welcome, then I will see you next time you got a few things to work on have have a good holiday between then."
13272.0,Patient,"You too, thank you."
462.0,Provider,bye now.
13272.0,Patient,bye bye.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, in his treatment plan short term goals.
