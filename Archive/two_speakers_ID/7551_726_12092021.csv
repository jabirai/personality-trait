726.0,Provider,Tired or is it just feeling like depressed tire.
7551.0,Patient,Like. What. would be like the difference between the press tired and.
726.0,Provider,"Like the press tired it's like the fear to press them. But you're feeling tired all the time, even if you sleep 12 hours you're exhausted like. You feel sluggish or like just not motivated to do anything. Or you just not sleeping very well that you're tired."
7551.0,Patient,I feel like it's both like I haven't been sleeping well. But then I haven't i'm also feeling motivated. Make with the word. And then. They just want to like lay when i'm like doing yoga or something like I want to lay just lay on the floor I don't want to do anything but I still kind of force myself to do something.

726.0,Provider,"little bit better. And you know that. That you were scheduled only for half hour, I just wanted to make sure haha."
7551.0,Patient,"Okay, no that's fine that'll work."
726.0,Provider,"On only because I I always tell tell people before we start because sometimes I don't want them to think that, like i'm trying to not do their full time that they get on yeah so just to. weird thing going. On yeah. How much clearer now okay."
7551.0,Patient,"Okay okay. yeah so let me i've been trying to like save that just thinking about it for next month, but. Still, I have to like I guess remember like request that they often still think about it, and some ways."
726.0,Provider,In the most nervous about.
7551.0,Patient,"Like what they're. going to say it is. Since I did like put hands on my mom I don't know. I don't I don't know if, like people do time for that word. yeah."
726.0,Provider,yeah. He practiced hard to learn.
7551.0,Patient,I have no idea of knowing her probably. Probably. I don't know.
726.0,Provider,"Well, I mean I feel like a solid presence on you, they were telling you. But if you haven't heard anything that may be not. i'm not good with um I don't know that much about the legal system, so I don't know exactly how stuff like that works, but. I imagine that if she did people have known by now."
7551.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,But I mean you're wonderful for so I don't know. Something apparently yeah. How did you hear about court.
7551.0,Patient,"And when they took me in they did I did get arrested, so they. or. yeah I think yeah since they did get arrested them, they did tell me that. I had to go to court."
726.0,Provider,"Probably gonna how you are asked you what happened. In your own words, so I, I think that may be like you could prepare by just. kind of like I don't want to it doesn't it sounds bad, but it's not it's more like practicing how you're gonna. Tell the Court. on how that event happened. And why why you did put hands on her."
7551.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. I mean. Some, like I just. Not that I don't press like. Like any of that but. i'm. Like family members and. Then, my dad and. Like going to jail and stuff so. But I was never there when when it happened."
726.0,Provider,"We can do that, right now, one talking about it."
7551.0,Patient,"don't. know why, like I put myself in situations."
726.0,Provider,"Right, why do you see yourself in that situation at all."
7551.0,Patient,"I felt like I should have just ignored her. And, just like went to just started working instead of. escalating the situation. Just like a form of way to shut up no it. It tissue. Like I did. And then later I just really like a today meet it works."
726.0,Provider,"Well, I would think. I would ask why are you taking responsibility for. That whole. That whole thing. When there wasn't just you. escalated herself first she herself with the escalated first. So if you're like really thinking about the situations like you're taking responsibility for the whole thing. Making you feel like you're like you're the bad person, but it sounds like she was already like. Acting a certain way or being really. I don't know like yelling screaming whatever she was doing she was escalating the situation before you do anything."
7551.0,Patient,"If they. feel like it's week ahead, I have it. Because, now that I think about it. I mean i've been reading a book in. And it's called. don't adult children of emotionally immature parent."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
7551.0,Patient,"And I feel like it's always been like a habit that every time she would. Get upset or some feeling. Like she made me feel like I was my dad. They would they would obviously fight and be violent towards each other. Like one of the reasons why he was in jail. He got. He got. He got out when I was like 15 or something. So. I think, since I was when I was three he was in jail and then. So for 12 years he was in jail. And then at 15 he got on he tried talking to me. And then he just stopped. And then. We made me cringe but he's he's probably scared of my mom he'd want to like contact me again because he probably thought that. Like she would find out or something. yeah I don't know and then he tried contacting me through Facebook and. another time. um. And I guess I got but hurt from when he didn't contact me after after calling me the first time, so I told him that, like there's no point in like having a relationship or I was i've been fine like without him so. So there was no need to like have another person in my life."
726.0,Provider,Like I don't have anybody who would understand your feelings about your mother. I don't know I mean it might be worth it to you know. reach out to someone that's not in your family that nobody mom the way that you know your lungs and I think he's the only person that does to see lift with her.
7551.0,Patient,"In so may the sisters, like all the men that's been in a man's life they know that she's just say she's a real person. Like me, SIS both my sisters to it. she's already tried to play. nail the youngest sister Stat in jail too and."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. mean. I mean, I think that, out of anybody. I mean. What are your feelings towards your dad now."
7551.0,Patient,Have any like i'm not. Like upset or anything at all. I don't really have any thing. Any feelings towards.
726.0,Provider,"start preparing yourself to think for sure, because if you're if you're upset talking about it now, and you don't talk about it at all you're going to be upset when you talk about it in court in front of a bunch of other people. it's like the avoidance isn't going to make it not happen, the avoidance is just avoidance."
7551.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"I think I would, I think I would just like. Maybe this could be like homework for you it's like write down word by word what happened on paper and read it to yourself. Because it's still obviously very triggering for you, when you think about it, and so it's almost desensitized and it's like the more you. Work or if it doesn't feel good if you feel really uncomfortable to do that it might just be too much to like read it, but it might be good to maybe just write it down and leave it for a while and then go back to it a company's leader and just read it over."
7551.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,I think.
7551.0,Patient,it's good.
726.0,Provider,"Well, see that that's what you that's what makes your thoughts more powerful is your fear your fear is giving it more power of yours thoughts they're not real they're just thoughts. I can have you can have a thought anytime of the day it's like. Like I have somebody one time, like years ago and they were like I just had thoughts of you know he's cheating on my wife and and they felt really guilty about it, and I said. No, I said to them yeah but those were your thoughts it's not like you did it in real life, like. And they were like oh oh that's you're right i'm just thinking about i'm actually doing anything so if if you have fear about the thoughts that we think you're getting your thoughts way more power. Because you just because you have a thought of something it's not the thought that some that's triggering you it's your emotions that trigger you because you you're emotionally attached to the thought, but if you. Stop stop interacting with the thought and become the observer of the thought don't be the thought being observer of the thoughts because that's how you can pull yourself away from the thought of something. But it takes practice it's like you have to do it and it feels like like a lot, but then, after a while you start to notice that you just start doing it naturally like you have to work that hard at it after a while you're like oh. Oh i'm doing that thing again that I always do i'm always oh oh. i'm scaring myself about something that hasn't happened. So you just become more aware of it, but you know if you're engaging with your thoughts and just because you're thinking of them. you're getting triggered well instead of getting scared of your thought start writing down how you feel about that thought. So, if my thought is oh my God i'm i'm so worthless I can't do anything all right, but where does that come from all right well when I was five this happen either you start jotting it down like find out where it's coming from your thoughts are not going to kill you it's your actions."
7551.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"You know I talked to people where they were like I was in a lot of grief and expired drinking and so it's like well grief itself is not going to kill you, but if you keep drinking the way you drink that may kill you. So don't track your own prison just because you're thinking, something it doesn't mean that it has passed and don't give it the power over your you that you have over you."
7551.0,Patient,that's yeah. that's.
726.0,Provider,All I was.
7551.0,Patient,"yeah. really appreciate it, because it's like a reminder like like we. Somewhere along the days like I guess. I forget the just. Just the thought to Convention. Because I was watching. It. A few days ago and. I was like that's. Have a new one by I finished the old one, and I wanted to see like what was the difference between the newer than the old one, and then I saw the part two, from Milan. And, and I just like for some reason, like It reminded me like how they don't know how to describe it, so they just say it, but. I felt like it to them was there."
726.0,Provider,Or what they were scared. yeah. Like that guy remember that guy i'm. A comedian.
7551.0,Patient,Who.
726.0,Provider,"Is he, like. Is cloud would come up and created the worst his worst fear his worst fear and his actual worst fear was coming out of the closet the whole time. In and so so don't don't let your mind become it your mate like it's it's become a thing. Fear, you have control over over years an adult now so when you're thinking about the things that you're scared about it's more that is coming from childhood that's trauma. you're reacting to trauma you're not reacting to like where you are now as an adult so if you're thinking about your thoughts and you're becoming aware of them, you need to remind yourself that. i'm kidding i'm an adult now I am not a child anymore, I am just feeling scared because, as a kid I feel scared a lot."
7551.0,Patient,yeah. Casey Thank you.
726.0,Provider,"yeah let's make another appointment okay. Okay, for two weeks from today okay."
7551.0,Patient,Hello is your thanksgiving.
726.0,Provider,"How if you're a. Nice yes. Yes, i'm glad. So can I have whose day December 21. I have a two o'clock or have a penny em."
7551.0,Patient,timmy you.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
7551.0,Patient,"Really quick to I mean I don't know if, like. They. Would would saying like that, I mean you mentioned that you're not not too sure from the old make the legal system, the same week that i'm. working on. Like when the state does that help at all like. yeah you can go to court."
726.0,Provider,"yeah you can say you can say. You know, I have a long history with my mother, but our traumatic childhood, I was witness to domestic violence on. You know, and you could even say, like my mom has a history of of. of things really violent relationships like i've grown up with this my whole life and I felt really unsafe, I felt scared. And, and I reacted in a way that i'm not happy about, but it's only because of all my new pro and con that's all i've seen. You could say that, I mean or you could just say you know i'm i'm working through some mental health issues that i'm going through i'm in a lot of it stems from my past with mother um you can say something like that, but we'll get you ready for core, I think that this is on. Our in our next session I wanted to processing, I think we should move ahead with end arcs I feel like you really need it, and I think it'll be helpful for you, because no matter what I say to you. Your brain hasn't is not getting the memo because you're still in your mind your trauma is taking over like. Like there's no separation between you, as a kid and you as an adult it's all like link dog so, even if I if I you can you can talk yourself out of something you can. As long as you have the skills to help make yourself feel better after the end of the session but you're never going to change the way you feel if you don't process it you're you're always going to react, the same way, over and over again, unless you work on the trauma."
7551.0,Patient,So our next session.
726.0,Provider,"Our next session we're going to do processing Okay, so I want you to pick a memory, it could be a recent one, or can be an old one, and we can um probably do the one that from with your mom okay."
7551.0,Patient,it's. Okay okay yeah.
726.0,Provider,"All right, i'll See you in two weeks and practice coping skills before we do them Okay, because you're going to need them after."
7551.0,Patient,Okay thing alrighty okay talk to you later bye bye.
