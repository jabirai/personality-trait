540.0,Provider,what's been going on.
16823.0,Patient,"yeah sorry it takes me. I need to get better how about. Joining early or because it always takes longer than expected. theory that. or whatever. i'm things have been good it's like a little bit of. transitioning I got home this morning. To me and. Pretty. Pretty smooth travels. Rather, not really be traveling will be a plane and going through busy airports and stuff right now, but it is what it is. But. i'm safe this morning. And then i've kind of just been. scrambling a little bit to. Try to finish some work ahead of. kind of vacation and the holiday is we're. All home here now and then man we're gonna. We are planning hit the road to Vermont. To skew for a few days before Christmas tomorrow morning. So it should be a set should be fun."
540.0,Provider,And so you guys are going to be going to Vermont for a few days and going coming back to me and.
16823.0,Patient,"Yes, we're for for Christmas yeah. So. not be good should be good yeah."

540.0,Provider,And How has it been.
16823.0,Patient,or. How has it been. Good I think I lost you use after you said how's it been.
540.0,Provider,Sorry. um any cravings at all.
16823.0,Patient,"that's been. it's been good, and the cravings fun. So that's that's continued to be. I think a positive and. A bit of a surprise, but that's been. that's been consistent."
540.0,Provider,"And, have you been taking the medication more consistent or a still sticking to the weekends."
16823.0,Patient,"i've like in the last. Really week it's been. marking system. And having. continue to not. notice anything like to. To material, but will continue just in terms of like your sensations or anything relative to some of the other stuff, I think, but both kind of continue to to monitor things, but overall it's been fun."
540.0,Provider,"Has there been anything that's been bothering you lately, like the past few weeks. And that you wanted to be able to talk about."
16823.0,Patient,"um. yeah I think um. yeah I mean i'm not sure that there's anything in particular. it's been it's been bothering me per se, I mean, I think that. it's like a it's like a testing stretch where like i've. made some changes and. kind of stick with some some new things such. As been going well, that i've been happy with, so I think. A lot of it's been trying to stick. You know, to that there's been like some back and forth with. up between being home and between being in. San Francisco but you know, overall I think of. manage that pretty well and obviously it's sort of like the holidays now. And so. So yeah and then I think like. And I think i'm I think that was, I think, was good is like. Last couple weeks or last month there so i'd say. I think generally was was. Good and to the year work wise, I think. That was it wasn't super busy, so I think. Overall, have been able to be. fairly balanced and try to like kind of like focus on myself. which has been good, so I think I a warm hoping to you know enjoy some time off. yeah between now and the New Year. And then, like. I don't know that it's like. anxiety creeping in, yet like explicitly but it's sort of like. Knowing that. yeah stuff will just like naturally be. Probably pretty busy. As it usually is like getting getting back in January, so. Making sure i'm kind of been. The right, the right mindset for that, but I think that, like some of that i'm feeling, you know pretty. pretty good about that I barely even thinking about it too much, but um. I think I think I should be in pretty good shape for that, but we'll see."
540.0,Provider,"So what does it entail so like the beginning of the year, I know you guys are going to be crazy busy, but what does it entail for you."
16823.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think. For me, and all that well actually to see technically because we were actually kind of got our back to office are strapped for my back office plan kind of. pause to I mean it was going to be like January 4 but they kind of push that back and definitely with the new way of. But I mean, I think that. it's kind of I think my focus is just sort of like making sure that i'm on top of my game, I think that, like there is always the desire to. kind of start off strong and then you know you know progress, and so I think yeah I think a lot of like my mind frame and just in terms of like focus in business is like work wise now, I think that. it's I think that will consume a fair amount of time and energy. yeah I guess is that something my thought is like. You know, key is just being able to. to manage that well. And so. I think that. I think the good things are that. You know. i've been around a little bit to just experience wise in my role yeah it's evolving but it's something where like I know what to expect in some senses, so I think I can yeah pinch myself and do a good job, just kind of like. Understanding sort of know sort of what to expect and then making sure that i'm just like handling. You know, myself and a. And a positive healthy way, so I think frankly a lot of that is just like some of the basics. From a day to day thing that i'll. You know, add up and kind of keep me saying. and which would I would imagine just help me with. Overall kind of. You know stress and anxiety levels. which should, I think, be pretty. be pretty important, but I think that. I can try to be. more explicit and. Just just thinking about like if i'm if i'm not going to be busy like if. There are a handful of things like on a daily basis. That, I think that I should record I should be heading whether it's. Exercising or. Getting outside or like. You know journaling or like eating healthy or something like that or whether it's like a daily the daily things I should strive for which I think. Probably makes sense um."
540.0,Provider,it's like the we've talked about before like finding the balance of like life and work.
16823.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think it's yeah I think it's that and. And just. yeah I think some I think something has. it's talking about somebody else's just like. Just stuff like I wanna make. Progress against or like just have stuff I can like point to say like I feel good about or I like accomplished even that some like. You know weekends know could just be like relationship wise like staying in touch with people and stuff like that, because I think sometimes if i'm not as. thoughtful and intentional about that. And i'm sort of like busy work wise then. i'll kind of just like. let things slip and. kind of things at a high level wonder. So that's something that. I should figure out how to manage."
540.0,Provider,"On and I know that you said that that was one of your goals have you been trying to whether or not like message people back call them back at all, like the last few weeks."
16823.0,Patient,"yeah I think that. i've been doing a better. job of that generally. So, hoping hoping to keep that up. And I yeah I mean I think that's just something like a handful of things. On the priority list. that's something where it's like sort of one of those if you think about it, if you step back and think about it it's like a pretty easy thing and so it's kind of just like what's kind of like your. default habit is it's sort of like not really. pay attention to that stuff or D prioritize that stuff. Or is it like. i've just been buying potential and saying like I like prioritize best slash like. Like nothing is gonna other other things, a lot of times it's work isn't necessarily. As as urgent or like necessarily more you know important, on balance, and so. Those are some of the new sort of the trenches and have been taken."
540.0,Provider,"Well, and I mean like we talked about before is it's going to take a little time a little bit more than time to create the habits, but then once it's there, but right now you're building that foundation."
16823.0,Patient,So.
540.0,Provider,"Getting rid of those habits that you're working on, I guess the bad habits and then trying to recreate and make better ones."
16823.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,And you're still doing weekly counseling right.
16823.0,Patient,Yes.
540.0,Provider,"Yes. Like on top like being on the program here do you feel like it's like too much, do you feel like it's a good bounce."
16823.0,Patient,"No, I think it's a good balance. I think like we're BV ship and doing it. Like Friday evening so it's. Usually good to go to both like have the week go all bad and i'm able to touch on different things. So I think. I think it's I think it's been helpful. yeah yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Is there anything that you, I know, on top of like the goals that we've set in places, or anything that you wanted to know more about like substance abuse wise or like getting to know."
16823.0,Patient,"um. yeah I mean i'm not. i'm not sure explicitly. You know one thing was like. I know it was it was sort of good I think i'm usually looking for. always like open for like. Good like content and people to listen to, or good like perspectives to get. On on the subject I know a lot of times it's like some people are more. Targeted specific bad stuff and then some some of the people and things you'll come across as like actually it's more. holistic, like my other like therapists have any questions and stuff from gabor Mattei. which was sort of which is sort of. Interesting yes, a lot of like. very long, long talks so I was trying to get into them um. I am trying to think and there's other other folks along those lines that. i've been trying to check out I don't know if there's any other sort of particular. You know, people are things along those lines that."
540.0,Provider,"Sorry, like Ted talks are like podcasts."
16823.0,Patient,yeah just stuff like that i'm.
540.0,Provider,i'm gonna make myself a note because what i'll do is all start kind of getting like my list together and. gabor Mattei I mean he is he's a good one.
16823.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, a lot of he seems to have a lot of. stuff so."
540.0,Provider,"i'm just gonna write myself a note and just. Because there's also many times that too, if I can think of them now i'll think of them later and then i'll make a note. At some point, to tell you on. But I think podcasts are nice Ted talks are nice um but, especially, like the podcast because you can download them, you can listen to them anywhere, so I know you don't have like a commute right now but."
16823.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,be able to just listen on the go.
16823.0,Patient,I agree with that yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"All right, i'll definitely think of some of them for you, though."
16823.0,Patient,"Okay, great awesome."
540.0,Provider,"And how are you liking, the program are you liking group."
16823.0,Patient,"I think it's good. ya know it's it's helpful to get other folks perspectives and i've obviously. Earlier on, and so you have other. folks you've kind of been around and have. have some good experience to. To speak to, and I think it's it's it's good to sort of have that. That support of folks who are going through it's it's clearly all sort of. yeah different different things, but you know, obviously some some constant threads yeah um."
540.0,Provider,"We I we kind of have like a poly group where it's some people are out call, some people are substances, then end of the day, a lot of times that that core of why what what we're using the substances for. It all sounds."
16823.0,Patient,Right. Right yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Is there anything that you would like to see like being added into group, like any top topics that you'd like to listen in and like that that support on."
16823.0,Patient,"huh. um. No, I mean I that's that's a good question i'm not sure that I have any. any specific. any specific ideas, I think I think it's a good. I think it's a good format where we're all able to kind of provide general updates and those can go in different directions yeah and then there's more of. That dedicated dedicated topic to speak towards I think is helpful yeah I think that's. yeah that's generally. A good format, but i'll definitely let you know if there's anything i'm not thinking of yeah."
540.0,Provider,"And I mean, even if it like POPs in your head and we're in group and you're like Oh, can we like like just do more on like that topic, if you like, chat to me. because some people will do that too, and then i'll jot it down and then just remember to do it and then like upcoming weeks."
16823.0,Patient,So yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And sometimes it can just be like random ones, even just like anxiety through like anxiety through the holidays, that was asked for a few of my groups, so I did that but i'm always open to suggestions for you guys. Chris from you guys."
16823.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,Is there anything. else that you wanted to talk about today.
16823.0,Patient,"No, I mean, I think that. I think. That probably covers it, I mean I guess i'm. The only one because I don't really think that just i'm just trying to pull back a little bit. Can can you just remind because we're just talking to her stuffs going, can you just remind me how. You guys approach this at a higher level, just in terms of. Like the ongoing commitment and assessment of that. I think last time we talked about which. We may have had a conversation about it. yeah earlier earlier on, it was like you know there's some sort of continuous assessment and then some some folks basically go longer like time periods between meetings or this."
540.0,Provider,"So I guess i'd be. It may be easier to explain to you if you tell me kind of like what you are seeking plan wise for yourself, so what would your hopes be for treatment for yourself. Next."
16823.0,Patient,"I mean. yeah I mean it's a good and I don't know that I have the best. perspective around it. But I mean I think my sense coming in, is that for. You know more of a dedicated thing like this, like I guess that was my perspective, was that. To have kind of like a. You know. Several. Like several months ish like timeframe. And like basically. You know that's all like I contingent upon three, I think that it's contingent upon by me feeling good about managing things and like. understanding that it's. You know it on an ongoing thing, and so you kind of contingent upon like being you know, in a place where I feel like i've gotten a lot of support i've good continuing support and like I feel like i'm just able to sort of. You know, manage things properly and that there's some sort of ongoing. Support in other. capacities like i'd imagine like i'm just continue. Have the perfect way to think about it, but i'd imagine kind of like continue to like go into like therapy and like you know weekly or something like that. And like. It is this is sort of like an important topic and not that it's more holistic but. i'm not sure that's that's just sort of. that's just sort of my perspective, that's just sort of. A perspective but."
540.0,Provider,"So your perspective is completely I think accurate so. So the thing is, I always I don't know if I brought it up to you, like we have two columns here, we have one substance abuse and the other ones underlying issues that brought us to substance abuse. So. A lot of times, a lot of people just try to treat the substance abuse, but they don't treat the underlying issues and which you already have been treating so you are going to counseling weekly. And now you're figuring out Okay, I need to manage my life, a little bit better I need to manage the stressors I need to have a better work life balance. So all of this is creating kind of like a package deal for four years sobriety sudden you're going to hit a point where I don't know if i've ever gone over like the stage of change with you have ever done that."
16823.0,Patient,I don't recall I don't I don't think explicitly.
540.0,Provider,"Let me if you have any do you have an email, by any chance i'm guessing you do right."
16823.0,Patient,"yeah my email is just last first at gmail so powers, Seamus at gmail."
540.0,Provider,"Sorry i'm just trying to find. share my screen with you. Alright, so. This is like the stages of change of substance abuse, you can really use this with anything in life so. The initiation is going to be like pre contemplation so when you're talking about like substance abuse alcohol use this is before you even like consider that there is like a problem with alcohol use. contemplation so when you moves contemplation that's when you're like Okay, I can see that there may be a problem, but i'm not going to do anything about it. And maybe like my relationships are more of the problem, so you really like contemplating determination so that's going to be when you're really like determining and like you're preparing for like doing something about the problem. So this is when you're kind of like looking into programs you're starting to call around and see Okay, what can I do about the problem. Action is doing something about it so like you are right now so you're in this program you're still in counseling you're starting to kind of like dibble dabble to see what's going to be helping you sobriety wise. And so, this is where it's kind of going to be leading to what you're talking about so when you figure out everything that is going to keep you sober. You hit maintenance stage of change, so when you hit maintenance stage of change that is when you can start gearing away from whether or not this program and say you're going to the gym. You are reading every day or journaling you're doing and whether or not meetings you're doing your counseling that's when like you can start to whether or not kind of like discontinue treatment or it's just like it's like that readiness, where it's like Okay, I have everything."
16823.0,Patient,in place.
540.0,Provider,"You sober and I can kind of let go of this program. And then recurrence so there's always a chance that there was going to be a relapse. So many times so maintenance and that's The thing is relapse can happen like at any point in time, so you can go in and out of these. So you could do pre contemplation relapse and and then you can go and back to like action from relaxing. But you like the key component is usually if you've got into action stage of change and maintenance. and have relapsed you usually have to just question like what was I missing did I let did I stop things that we're working like what do I need to do to get my sobriety back and then continue it like what was I missing. So for you so for you so like having that gold plan and saying, like several months it's not. Like that isn't like a capability so really what we just have to do is figure out what is going to keep you sober. And I think that, especially that you're going to be continuing counseling outside of here that's just going to be like another stepping stone that you have that it's not like you're ending all treatment. So I don't think that that's necessarily going to be like a. Like a non possibility, I think that will be like a really good possibility."
16823.0,Patient,Okay that's. that's helpful context and explanation on all that excited sense.
540.0,Provider,"And it's feeling it so you'll start to feel the things that you need sobriety wise but that's kind of why, like our program is made the way it is because, as we start decreasing your time like say you come to group bi weekly. that's going to test you to see like Okay, can I do without this group each week. And that. When you get to once a month you're like Okay, can I do without it, for every other week, and now I only see these people for every four weeks. And then it's quarterly so then it's every three months you're like okay can, and then you kind of like drop it from from there really. But you don't have to really do like the whole program you just stick with like myself and Dr and if you have like that end game to be done with the program after several months, then we just we make sure that you're all set and squared away. Before you would leave us."
16823.0,Patient,Okay. Okay that's helpful you got it.
540.0,Provider,And the medication you're on with Dr you should you should be able to continue that with primary care doctors as well.
16823.0,Patient,got. Okay.
540.0,Provider,"I did want to ask you, before I let you go, how are you feeling with the holidays coming do you feel any type of like. triggers or cravings to does anyone in your family drink."
16823.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it hasn't been an issue like what I mean cuz I. It was like a similar situation with. But thanksgiving hey that really wasn't an issue i'd say it's like they bought one they're like very understanding and like to it's like it's like quite like casual so like they, like all of them like well we'll drink or something but it's something where like. My mom like does doesn't really drink a chat all like my dad might have like. That like and it's not like anything remotely that has had ever like they'd be uncomfortable or whatever is like by data like have like a beer with like dinner or something like that, like it's just it's not really that that big of a deal okay and i'm basically going to be. Like with them like i'll see like some extended family that's like similar deal actually I like there I had there's like I get together the extended family when I was home in November. Like that was, and it was like you know people have like, why not like beard and stuff like that, and whatever. But that I mean it was. Like I was, I was comfortable with it so."
540.0,Provider,Your family's really. supportive with your sobriety right.
16823.0,Patient,"yeah totally. that's I mean, I think, is. Is you know, important and i'm talking about that, because you know there's not always. You know conducive situations or like helpful situations in that respect so. that's good."
540.0,Provider,yeah absolutely and it's it's going to help you through all of them having that support it's crucial. Seamus are we scheduled for our next appointment.
16823.0,Patient,"I don't I don't believe, so I think that's a good. thing that's a good point. yeah let me."
540.0,Provider,And when do you go back home to home.
16823.0,Patient,"So i'm going to be back in San Francisco. except the 30th. December 30. So, I imagine, like the week of the fall, the first real week of January, maybe. There is separate week. Something like that."
540.0,Provider,And Ari I mean you're going to be in Vermont so you're not going to be in group this week or next week right.
16823.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's. it's. it's unlikely, but be able to."
540.0,Provider,"Absolutely and spend time with your family it's. it's the holidays, so the server's not working right now, is there any way at some point when you get home or something to schedule your next month's appointments with me."
16823.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,yeah just because it's down at this point in time.
16823.0,Patient,yep okay sorry.
540.0,Provider,"All right, well, I can let you go and just enjoy your family okay. And if the cravings do come just trying to say I mean you have a lot of support around you, but just knowing that they are temporary just working through them. But. that's been that has been an issue, so far, so that's good."
16823.0,Patient,sounds good appreciate it hope you have a good. Good holidays as well.
540.0,Provider,Thank you so much all right i'll see you and group and two weeks for a little bit over two weeks.
16823.0,Patient,"Great sounds good, thank you."
540.0,Provider,"always enjoy the holidays. All right, for transcription That was my individual therapy session with Seamus powers just something to notate he's continuing to work on the goals that he has in place. He wants to try to really work on like those bad habits that has formed and try to. Have that better life work balance, which is a little tough and his industry, so I think that he is starting to learn that. I would like to put a potential for long term slash short, so I yeah long term goal is to be not have to be in the program so he said kind of like several months side say whether or not seven to 12 months is his hope to be able to kind of. graduate from the program here with bright heart and and I think that would be doable with all the support he has. and continuing with his therapy treatment outside of here. um other than that nothing else for transcription."
