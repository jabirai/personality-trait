741.0,Provider,"All right, so did you come up with five affirmations."
10462.0,Patient,"I did, I really did okay um. I have probably a few over five but just because it might have something to do with something else, or like I mean.

Really, you know, try to be grateful every single day, you know or for even small blessings that I have or anything you know, and I said i'm actively working to forgive and forget my past and i'm trying to everyone. Because I am you know i'm respectful unkind to people and I try to help those who need me and respect myself a lot more today than ever. i'm focusing on my recovery and being open minded on certain issues in my life. And I tried to do my best and be the best I can every day, so I think there's about six or seven there but. Right yeah but I. Thank you yeah I hope that's okay.

10462.0,Patient,yeah okay.
741.0,Provider,"Today I couldn't do it, I can look myself in the eye and I can, I believe the affirmations that I tell myself. yeah but it's a process, and we have to do it over and over again."

But today, you know, two weeks later i'm not as overwhelmed as up what I was. So, and that just goes to show what you said you know you have to just do these things and kind of get them out of way, and you know so i'm trying to really do that yeah."
741.0,Provider,"yeah just one little piece, at a time."
10462.0,Patient,and
741.0,Provider,"Look at all the big picture, because you look at that whole big old ball of yarn and you're going oh my gosh."
10462.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I do that sometimes I just kind of catastrophizing things before it even happens, you know or whatever. yeah I did. An."
741.0,Provider,awful lot of us oh.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I feel sometimes. But you know, and I always try to look at it also is like things can be so much worse, you know I don't you know i'm blessed you know. blessed. To be where i'm at today and to have what I have now from you know, working on my sobriety and working on my recovery for eight years now. So, like you know, often on like I don't know if I told you, but often on i've been on some box and you know and it's been about seven eight years and, and I know a lot of people. You know, may not call you clean or sober you know, whatever, but to me in my mind, and my heart and my whole being I believe that. That is something I have to do right now, you know, and I might have to do it for rest of my life I don't know but that's okay with me, you know I don't try to worry about that, right now, you know."
741.0,Provider,"Well, one way to look at it, somebody who has high blood pressure has to take medication."
10462.0,Patient,"me, you know."
741.0,Provider,To take okay to make sure that your blood pressure doesn't get out of control. Now this is the same thing.
10462.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,This is the same thing your body has built up. A dependent a an a custom. idea that it's got to have this opiate. Right we've given you something to satisfy that body. But it doesn't give you the euphoria. And you can still function with a clear head.
10462.0,Patient,"I know I actually worked, you know, like I said I told you, you know I work. Every day and but I was function, you know I function well on it and I get things done, I feel, almost normal. You know how when you're dope second, although you don't there's no normalcy about it so yeah."
741.0,Provider,Publishing anything is almost impossible. yeah when you don't feel that you don't feel good and you. You can't do what you need to do.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely I lost a lot of jobs, good jobs back to you, and you know, whenever I was out using and stuff you know, had a lot of good jobs, but just cannot hang in there because i'd be sick and I wouldn't want a better work or you know so yeah. So i'm proud of that part two, you know least I can do things now not have to worry about all that so yeah. Right yeah."
741.0,Provider,"So do you have a list of things that. That you need to do that, you need to take care of."
10462.0,Patient,"um it's kind of like all over the place right now don't actually Oh, you told me write that down there didn't you I did write a couple down, but now I think it's out in my truck. or in my brother's truck actually hey long he learns to his truck when since minds work down right now. and say that's another blessing i'll have right there you know my brother helps us so so much too so um you know, and he just lives up to he'll hear from me, you know right the road so that's a good thing right there. But yeah. yeah I kind of have a list you know but i'm i'm working on that. Okay yeah so."
741.0,Provider,"yeah that. One of the things that you can do is take a piece of paper. and divided and force. yeah and then the top the stuff that's urgent. Okay, that stuff at the bottom that's. And then that stuff on on the left hand side that's important."
10462.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"The staff, on the other side that's not so important. Okay, everything that's important and urgent is going to go in that top left corner. Okay, and that helps you prioritize your list of things."
10462.0,Patient,Right yeah. yeah it's.
741.0,Provider,"urgent and important than it needs to get done. Something that that you want to do, but it's not urgent and it's really not all that important, and it can go down here, and this other."
10462.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,You get everything else done. Maybe you can say okay i've gotten all these things that now let's do this so that I can reward myself.
10462.0,Patient,I gotcha yeah I might chance to yeah definitely.
741.0,Provider,yeah that'll help you prioritize your list.
10462.0,Patient,Okay yeah I gotcha that sounds good.
741.0,Provider,sounds like. Obviously transportation is important.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah well, that is for sure, and like said I don't i'm telling you because I know, last year, at this time. We were still on the road, but our I think in november's when it broke down so it's been almost a year and, like I said, luckily, you know my brother was in his truck sometime you know, and I don't like to overly ask or anything so I just don't. do that but. You know I mean it's it's kind of hard and it's he's got an older truck too, and I don't want something to go, you know."
741.0,Provider,But I wanted to break down and. While you're driving it.
10462.0,Patient,"that's how I feel you know all the time i'm like oh gosh. So, but it's been almost a year and, but last year we were just struggling really hard with a lot of different. Things so in a year we've come a long way, you know as far as like stress and stuff but."
741.0,Provider,Everybody has been very stressed out.
10462.0,Patient,In the learner.
741.0,Provider,I know it has not been kind.
10462.0,Patient,"To peak, no, no. I know it's been really, really rough."
741.0,Provider,I know Evan prices up his. wages down jobs are almost non existent it hasn't really taken a toll on us.
10462.0,Patient,or no.
741.0,Provider,"has changed the way we live. yeah and when we already have stressors like trying to learn to live without using. and other types of stressors like being depressed or anxious or for any of that. And then. On top of everything it makes it a little more challenging. Yes, but. But we can be grateful for the challenge."
10462.0,Patient,Now.
741.0,Provider,You know hasn't least we're here to experience it.
10462.0,Patient,"Oh yeah you know what yeah I didn't look at it like that, but yeah you're right um wow."
741.0,Provider,yeah it's amazing how many times people get frustrated and everything and and they don't they're not grateful for the challenges. As you grow.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely that's gross yeah absolutely yep you're right you're right I didn't look at it like at my be either so yeah it's a great way to look at it, because. We have grown a lot, you know just from the struggle we went through last year, you know so yeah definitely um. yeah i'm just trying to hang in there, I guess, like. And then he heard his thumb and i'm taking urgent care yesterday and it's not broke yeah I know he couldn't go to work by sight. And he was already off for three days this like Monday, Tuesday, he usually off, but then he got Saturday off for a for a reason you know for family thing but and then he heard he's done so i'm the healing makes 725 an hour like. And with those little bit of hours like it's just not getting us to where we need to be but we're going to figure that out too and. I may end up having to go back to work or I just don't know yet you know, having. Where I have congestive heart failure and things like that I need to get i've got see that's one thing I need to get on that, I believe I can probably get some sort of help you know with that so yeah that that would probably be on my list as urgent."
741.0,Provider,"Right right and you might I don't know, but you might qualify for disability."
10462.0,Patient,yeah a.
741.0,Provider,little bit of money. Right and. I will say that I know that nami. Has connections and people who can help with.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah you did actually wrote it down yeah. And I say to like our our county like opposite what like welfare offices or whatever here in Kentucky. They actually have advocates or whatever that will help you on the phone I heard so that I don't even have to really you know it's about an hour on the phone of answering questions but that's nothing compared to you know getting help every month. You know what i'm saying exactly exactly. yeah and I don't care to do that at all, and she said that they will literally feel everything out for you, you know you just have to answer the questions over the phone so."
741.0,Provider,that's the best that does that answer the questions because they know how to fill out that. paperwork and saying just the right thing.
10462.0,Patient,"You know our social security to accept it and. yeah and that's that right there i'll probably go that route, with that so. I try my best this week to literally get on the phone and do that because I know you know and his back is messed up like we have a lot of issues, and I think a lot of it is probably from 24 years of drug use, you know I mean our bodies are going to."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. These are are not. Really, designed to take that kind of abuse. That and and it does it harms your liver and destroys a lot of the major organs um yeah it does a lot of damage to our bodies and then on top of that all the risks that we take out there, doing all that man."
10462.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
741.0,Provider,The body just isn't isn't equipped to handle all that.
10462.0,Patient,yeah no that's that's right.
741.0,Provider,"And mess up, I mean we messed up our metabolism, I mean you name it. we've done a number on our body."
10462.0,Patient,Now.

10462.0,Patient,I know I know.
741.0,Provider,We get in there and play God I mess it up.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah you're right we're good Oh, when I got I got some other good news to speaking of all this stuff but and I got our doctor back that we had had. Someone we got our medical card back this time he's already got like all of our records everything and I called and got an appointment with him for October 11 Thank goodness. Because, yes, so we can kind of I can kind of get that going also on that and because he's just a really good doctor and he cares about his patients, you know, and maybe he could even help me. You know, be an advocate for me to you know as far as yeah and let them know what all I have and what's wrong or you know he already knows. Three and Plus we haven't been saying for a couple years now it's been two years you know not that she said, since it's been less than two year or like right at two years she said, if it had been anymore, I could you know, we had we could have saw you, but it would have been like a a renewed. Now she said it's kind of like just having a follow up you know. She said I don't have paperwork again or nothing. So that's really good."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
10462.0,Patient,"And I got that done, I did get that accomplished That was one thing on my list I had to do so, I got that done but he'll send me to my heart, Doctor again and get my medicine going again all that. And then he can send us to the back doctor and all that too so special space for that. You know yeah and he he does all that you know he'll set it up and get your appointment for you and. i'm and give it to you right there before you leave the place and everything so he's he's really good I like we liked him a lot. he's always like just don't go see another doctor if you lose your MIC part he said just don't go see any more doctors or nothing. He said, and then i'll say you know I mean every time if you, you know, and this is the third time we're saying he's taking us back, but I told her on the phone I was like. Well, so any more doctors, you know or nothing like at this he knows that I, you know he knows someone's boxing you know I tell."
741.0,Provider,My right.
10462.0,Patient,"Oh, this you know, and I was actually going to another doctor like three four years ago, you know, then, and he doesn't care about that he just don't want to go into another like family physician, you know. He does or whatever so yeah so that's worked out to, and I wanted to tell you about that I got an appointment."
741.0,Provider,taking care of your health.
10462.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yes, I am doing that. yeah yeah yep."
741.0,Provider,"Alright, so what challenges, do you think you're going to face in the next couple of weeks."
10462.0,Patient,"I would say. that's a good question. Probably. try to get our hate when when we get for winter. Because we've got to come up with the money for we. We my husband he built a wood stove, but we need the rope that goes inside the thing and, like some other things to go with it. And you know getting our stove and Plus we gotta you know, put the hallway and you know do all that stuff so it's gonna be a big project there, but as far as like. Challenges you know I don't know I hope there's not a whole lot I mean I guess you know."
741.0,Provider,there's gonna be some.
10462.0,Patient,I mean.
741.0,Provider,"You just accept that there's gonna be a challenge to do. Yes, why don't you challenge is probably isn't going to be. Working on that list okay what what has to be done."
10462.0,Patient,"Well yeah yeah. Yes, I gotcha yeah that's definitely gonna be my biggest one for me, you know personally yes. i'm not sure for format, but hopefully when I talk to you next time. You know, maybe. i've gotten most of that or even all of it, hopefully outweigh. I am trying, yes, I am definitely actively working on that yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and you'll continue to do your affirmations. Okay, and and. So how you, you have the preacher helping you with the finances of fixing the truck have you got plans to go attend the Church."
10462.0,Patient,"Yes, we're. we're my daughter she's getting her license back like really, really soon, and she said she's gonna come over and get us, so we can go so yeah we do have planes yes them."
741.0,Provider,yeah awesome.
10462.0,Patient,"he's got a car and she's only about like 1215 minutes from me, you know so she won't come and get us and and we'll go yeah. Okay yep."
741.0,Provider,"um so you're going to get actively involved in the Church. yeah okay well. We don't want we don't want to take on too much. So it sounds like you're doing pretty good. One foot on the other, and that's what it takes."
10462.0,Patient,I know I know and i'm glad I have you to help me with that too so. Much.
741.0,Provider,"you're welcome alright, so I guess the next big thing is to finish out the transportation and start working on the heat. Because that's going to be necessary in the next couple of months."
10462.0,Patient,"yeah because where we don't like our House says really it's where we have a lot of trees right now. We don't have no sunlight, you know we have barely any sunlight so it's keeping like when you walk in my house it's 10 degrees cooler i'm not even kidding you I can literally Texas monitor. And it's about 10 degrees cooler in here, so all day that coolness is just kind of gathering and and then by evening it's actually chilly enough for us and, here, to be able to. us something you know so yeah we've definitely and I know when it gets real called there's a way we can even so, we gotta get that done too and i'm going to try to work on that, but yeah. Right yeah."
741.0,Provider,"yeah I think i'm even starting to think in terms of that I we don't ever have a winner last winner, we had a horrifying winner."
10462.0,Patient,"yeah yeah you did, did you."
741.0,Provider,yeah but um and I burn through almost. All of my would.
10462.0,Patient,Oh wow.
741.0,Provider,i'm gonna have to get some more word this and i'm already starting to think in terms of okay I got a plan out my budget to make sure or.
10462.0,Patient,I know honey it's terrible and you know you go to storm people just start talking about how hard they're having or you know. it's just a bad situation all over.
741.0,Provider,i'm actually very blessed i'm not i'm not struggling that bad i'm i'm okay.
10462.0,Patient,that's good.
741.0,Provider,So you know. I don't and I am able to help other people and that's. Actually blesses me and.
10462.0,Patient,"Turn now. yeah see that's how I felt whenever I did that job there, you know it was great it was really a good thing for me because. Like when I was working everything I just mentally I was I saying bad or you know, but then I got stress there, but I don't think it was as bad as maybe what you know what I mean someone I either. So i'm gonna figure it out i'm gonna have to figure it out, because we just cannot make Milan yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Well, if you can get if you can get some assistance. Because with any job there's some stress. And if you can, if you qualify for assistance, then that's probably the best way to go. Yes, if, for whatever reason it's not enough, then you can look at possibly going to work part time. I know along that line yeah. First things first get the assistance first. yeah, what do you qualify for."
10462.0,Patient,yeah I will do that yep. Okay.
741.0,Provider,"Thanks right well, you have a very wonderful day. I look forward to seeing you again."
10462.0,Patient,"um do I set up an appointment with you or do I do that, like those I think that was the last one that they actually had you know, on foot. By yeah."
