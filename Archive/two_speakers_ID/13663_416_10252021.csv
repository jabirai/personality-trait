416.0,Provider,what's going on.
13663.0,Patient,"A lot. A lot to talk about to be honest with you. A lot to me it feels like a lot. Yesterday, I think it was last Monday, it was our last appointment."
416.0,Provider,That we talked yeah.
13663.0,Patient,like an hour to after appointment my little sister called me and she was in the hospital because she she's tried to kill herself. On last Sunday.
416.0,Provider,"she's the one you're really close to. Oh sorry don't be sorry, please i'm right here."
13663.0,Patient,"I don't know that really wasn't that hard in the moment. back on it now it's hard. To get about it, I guess it just to. register my mind at the time."
416.0,Provider,But uh did she call you before or was she already in the.
13663.0,Patient,"hospital she she called me and she. wanted to keep you informed and. I just let her know that I love her it's like. I don't know. I just I. I get where she was coming from to. be put in that place. I know how hard it is for people to go through stuff like that so she's trying to make her feel better apparently I helped her a lot talking with her, I can't honestly I can't remember what I said chappelle to see i'm trying to think of what I said at the time but. That actually ended up cutting my. brother and my. dad they were on a hunting trip last week and actually cut their own ancient short he had come home they came up early I guess it hit them a little harder moment at the time to me. It just kind of set the tone for the week and guess, who was. kind of rough. Saturday I finally got my vacation. I started taking on Saturday morning. Sorry Sunday we're really good. I had a ton of energy. I helped my little brother. He put in a leveling kid on his car tires rubbing and it helped his car, so I help them install that on it for suspension and. I don't make my diets been really weird. Like week or it's probably been going on to has to have been going on longer than that. I just I guess it didn't really realize it. And it's just gotten, to the point where like half of a sandwich fills me up just because i've been eating so little I guess."
416.0,Provider,he's losing a lot of weight.
13663.0,Patient,"Losing weight, I might be I don't have a scale at this House currently that's something I normally do off my back from California. Is I like to weigh myself a lot, because I can, I can tell a lot by my weight. I fluctuate a lot, I could fluctuate up to 100 pounds from going from 250 to 150 pounds it's it gets kind of scary what i'm that while you're really skinny."
416.0,Provider,you're you're really tall aren't you.
13663.0,Patient,yeah i'm six foot three. My healthy way it's about 195 pounds 200 pounds yeah. But. I.
416.0,Provider,"Just, can you tell, by the way, you're close to its worst."
13663.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I have i've closed from double XL all the way down to large like I will. kind of larger wardrobe just because of that I don't wear that many clothes and we were like the same five shirts pants but I, of course, just. dropped years at all different sizes."
416.0,Provider,So you haven't been able to eat much.
13663.0,Patient,"I just haven't had an appetite and like when I when I do. Like i'll wake up in the morning just feeling not like, I think I remember saying I thought I feel nauseous in the mornings. If I remember telling you that but. I wake up in the morning, so i'm pretty nauseous. Current clicked why i'm feeling that it's just because, like i'm going to bed hungry, I guess, even though I don't feel hungry i'm. going to bet on an empty stomach and it's just what I wake up my stomach just start remaining i'm making."
416.0,Provider,Some really low blood sugar in the mornings.
13663.0,Patient,yeah and that just creates. All sorts of. I don't know.
416.0,Provider,how's your day in terms of healthy normally.
13663.0,Patient,"Recently it hasn't been very good, to be honest with you. it's been a lot of fast food which isn't healthy. If it's not fast food i've been eating a lot of like pizzas which is not good for my stomach because, like just Jesus and dairy make me like gassy and a cat hurts my stomach a little lactose intolerant I think. My brother's been home the past couple days and I kind of got my back on track i've been eating like granola bars for breakfast and like today, I had a Turkey and cheese sandwich. for lunch and tonight we have tacos we've been cooking hot chicken and stuff like that. i've been doing better I think my diet past couple of days. Saturday and Sunday we're like I felt really good yesterday, like really good. I just wake up today and I have no energy and."
416.0,Provider,"So you, you are you're you're a very sensitive guy right and that even if you weren't. This information about your sister would have sent anybody for into a loop right, that was a big big big deal, but you have some vulnerabilities. Because you're particularly sensitive but also because you are depressed right, you have depression, so I can only begin to imagine. What went through your head when you heard about that and it's interesting that you say that you can't even remember what you said, which just tells me what a state of shock, you were in. it's kind of kicked in it sounds like."
13663.0,Patient,"It kind of hit home this morning, I think. i'm my mom likes or my mom and my sister they like they show like an instagram account with the dogs and they post pictures of the dogs really helps me. Like going on there, and just checking I got off instagram for years because it wasn't good, for I acknowledged wasn't good for me that's all because I would compare myself to other people, and it makes them happy and just. I got off on social media for. years and it helped me time. But when I moved out here, I. Just checking on instagram just to see pictures of my dogs, because it helps a lot. And I. know that my mom had a video on there with her with my sister with dogs and out of it just clicked it."
416.0,Provider,"What goes what goes through your head, if you could slow down your mind during. Like when you saw the pictures of the dogs and your sister and your mom this morning. If you could you know if we could freeze time and just make it go really slowly. What can you describe what was going on in your head when you saw that what were your thoughts that were connected to that."
13663.0,Patient,"I remember I sit, I sit on the toilet hopefully phone and uh. I just pulled up instagram because, like, I was disappointed I just super down I guess. Like a better word and normally when I opened my eyes to the instagram thing it like it's normally like my mom's post at the top, and like I didn't see I didn't see like."
416.0,Provider,Like.
13663.0,Patient,"Just kind of bumped and that's what I scroll down, I saw I think it was actually there but. I don't know, I was kind of just like. Was bummed that I wasn't any like new pictures of them, they actually saw the video, it was a dog. So."
416.0,Provider,"Far it's like. Usually when something happens, we we try to figure out how it translates into us right. And then you have some self talk about that too. Can you recall what those thoughts were."
13663.0,Patient,really had any thoughts at the moment is kind of overwhelmed with emotion. turned into a like a mini break down. And normally will kind of like talk to myself i'm having a breakdown that helps a lot just.
416.0,Provider,Like What do you say.
13663.0,Patient,"Just try it like like reaffirms trade be nice to myself, because I could have easily. Myself and just. Talk okay."
416.0,Provider,She wanted to do that now that's okay.
13663.0,Patient,But it just. A comfortable spot right um. Just mentally not comfortable.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So, for us, does this bring up any worries that you might lose your sister or worries that you might try to take your own life."
13663.0,Patient,"No, it just. It brings up thoughts. Like in my mind of. My family's kind of like my acre that makes any sense. It feels like."
416.0,Provider,sure.
13663.0,Patient,"makes a lot I don't i'm not I don't have very many friends. And like my mom my dad my brother sister no I don't think the people I talked to. And, just like I don't like losing my sister."
416.0,Provider,yeah so what I mean i'm hearing fear like. Terror right. and panic in this.
13663.0,Patient,"I read something online, the other day, and it was. I can't remember where I read it. It was smooth along the lines of. Somebody put I was reading a post, she was like like the guy was saying he was on reddit like I was saying. My parents died and like I don't know how i'm like kind of like go on like I just. Like he was like in a. Really. dark place and, like the number one voted Comet was like along the lines i'm going to butcher it, but it was. It was all like the way you're feeling right now is because you love them so much and it's not that feeling is love and it's not. You kind of. Look at it that way. And that's helpful, I think."
416.0,Provider,"that's exactly what it is. That feeling is love. yeah if you didn't care, then. It would be there. I mean the purpose of emotion right is to give us information about ourselves and the world around us that's the only reason we have emotions. They function really well for us most of the time. But sometimes they're just really overwhelming and some of us feel. them much more intensely than others. And you're one of those people."
13663.0,Patient,"I can remember, being in school okay. And it really have like Kevin what they call. And they get everyone together in like the gymnasium and they do like a shadow."
416.0,Provider,Like assembly or something like.
13663.0,Patient,"That and assembly were like the band. player, they would do like a show or something like that, and I can remember every single one of those I would always get like almost like the goosebumps, I guess, and I would like to start. i'd have to fight myself from doing it, but I would I would start like just like not crying but just been so overwhelmed with emotions that like I was embarrassed as time as a kid but I was just overwhelmed with emotion. I. i've kind of always been this way, just like you said oversensitive."
416.0,Provider,didn't say sensitive. and never said oversensitive.
13663.0,Patient,"I just said yourself. yeah um. I guess it's, just like the way I put it my whole life, just because I guess. that's one thing like one of my dad's. that's one thing my dad would say as a. kid you get thicker skin and that's it. that's it pisses me off, but."
416.0,Provider,sure it does.
13663.0,Patient,"He get he get his get he understands better now yeah. yeah he doesn't say those things anymore, he gets it but."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean being a really sensitive person makes it hard to walk through life right. It makes it hard to get out in the world, because yeah you don't have that thicker skin or whatever you want to call it that Armor, but a lot of people put on. I mean the good part about. The way you've experienced life is that you're open to all of the emotion, so you get the most extreme highs and lows right you get the good stuff and the bad. yeah um. Oh, my gosh it just started pouring down rain, again, I thought this."
13663.0,Patient,cornea. California it looked at the radar and it was like a whole state was just like a nice even sheet of re.
416.0,Provider,"Oh no it's been nuts, the last few days, but then it was supposed to be that was that was weird now it's done but it's just."
13663.0,Patient,It just important.
416.0,Provider,"For a second anyway sorry I just got distracted and. So a lot of times when people are that sensitive, first of all, I just want to normalize it it's it's not a bad thing to be the sensitive but it's a hard way to walk through the world when you feel so exposed right and so vulnerable to these really big emotions. But it doesn't it's not it's not an inherently bad thing right you're very sensitive to emotions and there's a lot of really wonderful stuff about that. yeah, but there are, it would be functional for you to kind of start to learn a little bit about how to. How to find a little bit of a shield when things are too much right or how to get away when things are too much, but I would rather have you put up a shield because I don't want you to get away so much that you start to withdraw from the world, and it was really tempting."
13663.0,Patient,that's what I tend to do.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13663.0,Patient,"Like family events, just like gatherings like parties in general, I always drive myself I can't I can't like carpool somebody. it's really convenient I don't drink alcohol. So I can leave whenever I want. I never normally always one of the first people to leave from any like get together because I just get really. Still comfortable. The whole time, even if it's people like really good friends with him that's kind of like part of the reason why I think I. A struggle so much like hunting trips, for example, know at my age, just because i'm locked in at a certain location and normally like where we hunt there's no cell signal so it's like i'm stuck in my thoughts and there's no escape and it's. scary."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13663.0,Patient,yeah I start I start making excuses on like wanting to go home and then I start feeling bad because i'm bringing everyone else down and.
416.0,Provider,"Right, then you have a lot of self talk. yeah."
13663.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah. i'm sorry but. I think it was two years ago. So everyone had left behind, except for. me my brother because of my grandpa. Like I don't think I was intentionally. Trying to be an asshole but it just. I feel like an asshole situations, especially when it's like my grandpa box I love I love my grandparents, but I just. don't know. um."
416.0,Provider,You mentioned was it your uncle or your.
13663.0,Patient,grandma my grandma.
416.0,Provider,Is he. goes to lunch is pretty harsh.
13663.0,Patient,"No, no, no, you like he's not harsh it's just like I was going through like one of those phases, it was like like i'd already been there for like five days and there's like you weren't seeing any animals, and also my go home and stuff like this and. I was like legitimately depressed on the hunt and. Actually ended up actually getting an animal like two days later, no super happy, but and that's kinda like what makes. This kind of what makes that whole situation just feel really weird because it was like a super low and then a super high and people were all like, why are you so down and. explain it to them that I. sky can be freaking grey one day and i'm going to be depressed like a cake okay I don't want to be down like I want to be happy, but. I can't be that way, all the time."
416.0,Provider,"No, you can't nobody can and feelings are normal and highs and lows are normal The difference is that your highs are really high and your lows are really low. Right. And, most people have. more of an ability to start to influence their mood, by the way they interpret events you know what I mean by that. So. Okay, let me give you an example. So the things that happen in our life are often not in our control right, we know that right. yeah but the way we respond to them is within our control. give you an example, so the example is somebody my car's parked out on the street and somebody comes and hits my car. Somebody smashes into it and you know, whatever it's it's a mess it's mush. So there's different ways I can respond to that. I might respond by going cause damage this, why does this always happen to me i'm magnet for trouble. Now i'm not going to be able to go to work who's going to drive me how am I going to get my kids to school, this is going to cost so much money that I don't have this is horrible, why does this stuff keep happening to me, I am do right. So that's that's one extreme the other extreme or not extreme necessarily but the other another sort of option on the flip side of that is. Thank God, nobody got hurt. i'm so fortunate that this happened, and nobody was in the car and I have insurance and While this may be difficult, I am going to focus on the things that I can control here call my insurance company get repair started and function through this and just be grateful that it wasn't worse. So exact same circumstances. Different interpretations, one would lead me into quite a lot of despair and the other leaves me pretty functional. And not happy happy, but fine right."
13663.0,Patient,yeah like I call it almost in different.
416.0,Provider,"sort of neutral, it is possibly neutral with a side of gratitude. Even right yeah neutral yeah will say neutral with the side of gratitude so exact same situation, though."
13663.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And this is where the choice lies and. This is where you, you do have power and control in choosing how you interpret events. and choosing how you talk to yourself, about the situation. and choosing how you talk to other people and describe the situation. That is where your choice lies, and one can lead you into deeper misery and one can keep you afloat."
13663.0,Patient,yeah. I see that.
416.0,Provider,"So. Our self talk and our filter through which we see the world is critical in that right that's what allows us to do these things. And when you get an a pattern over many years of seeing the world through a pretty dark lens and having a lot of negative talk to yourself about. about the way that the world is going and what you're capable of, and what you're not capable of, and all of that. We can talk ourselves in pretty fast, we can talk ourselves into a spiral."
13663.0,Patient,"anonymous I can talk myself into a. spiral really easy when it's something. Like you're saying like completely out of my control when it comes to something you just see on the news like something that comes like political or. A lot of like historical stuff I like going back and like reading about historical stuff and history isn't always pretty and there's a lot of ugly it comes to history and it kind of just makes me. That that will leave that one of those like an instance of that has led me, just like in like deep depression. But I noticed there's a lot of stuff like. When i'm at work, for example, and. I don't know i'm trying to think. On the toilet it's overflowing and it's. disgusting and they need somebody to clean it I can, I will just have the attitude of it is what it is and i'll go through it. If i'm not happy about done it but i'll be in different and that's kind of what I kind of tell myself to get those situations, is it is what it is and. You get through it and wake up tomorrow and it's a new day and. That helps me okay."
416.0,Provider,"I like that here i'm going to share my screen with you. For a minute I mean zoom out. alright. Have you ever seen this circle of control and influence. I love this I keep a copy of this next to my desk actually because, for me, this is important to I have to remember. To do this, this inner circle circle number one, this represents the circle of things that we can actually control. And not only can we control them, but we are also responsible for them."
13663.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I might argue with mood a little bit.
13663.0,Patient,what's gonna say like sometimes my moon just mindset.
416.0,Provider,"I feel i'm not sure your mood or entirely within your control. I would put them in here, I think you can influence your mood I don't know that you can do it."
13663.0,Patient,"I understand why they haven't surrendered, though. Because some a normal person is."
416.0,Provider,normal people have the ability and.
13663.0,Patient,We.
416.0,Provider,"know not everybody else. yeah I mean, so we can influence our mood, but I don't know that we can entirely control so i'm going to take. It will ignore that one, but your reactions to things are within your control. And some people will argue that the thoughts are not within their control. But. it's a skill that you will learn. And you will be a lot happier when you do. Your words, your actions your behaviors your your work ethic, those are things right your behaviors those are things you can control. The second circle is are things that you can influence, but not completely control. Right so like you can influence. Whether or not you get promoted, you can do that by controlling your actions. And working really hard and doing the best job you can do, but ultimately, whether you get promoted is not under your control somebody else is going to make that decision and they might be considering factors that are outside of your control. Right, you can influence, whether or not people like you, but it's not really your decision. Ultimately they might not like you for something that has nothing to do with you, though, right same thing right who follows you on social media other people's actions, how much somebody loves you, you can influence it, but you cannot control it."
13663.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah. And then circle three are all of the things that we find concerning often but that we can't control at all.
13663.0,Patient,Right so yeah.
416.0,Provider,"History. A sports match, whether or not they're animals in the forest for us to hunt that day. yeah. Right traffic government policies War world peace, none of that stuff but what happens is when we try to control all of this stuff which people do all the time right. When we when we spend our time and energy trying to control all these things that we have no control over and spending all of our time and energy, focusing on means this stuff in the middle goes by the wayside, the stuff we really can control starts to feel out of control."
13663.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So i'm actually going to give this to you because I want you to there's a whole worksheet with it. And this is your homework, I want you to do this. To draw out for yourself in any given situation in your life, right now, what are the things you can control and i'll send you this whole thing and all the instructions are in here for us but. What are the things you can control, what are the things you can influence and what are the things that you're concerned about, but you can recognize you have no control over and will ultimately have to let go of to spend your energy somewhere else."
13663.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Right. Okay, so i'm going to give this to you i'm going to email it to you it's not the easiest fire shy put it in the screen or."
13663.0,Patient,In the chat normally the best way.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, let me stop sharing. And i'm going to put it in the chat for you real quick. So kind of right sizing you know, putting things into the proper perspective around what we what we can and can't do in our lives is a good first step to start changing our mood. Right and last time you identified triggers and you also identified things that really help your brain function optimally right things that you really enjoy. So that's a really good start we're going to keep going with recognizing things we can and can't control and we'll review this. Next time we meet. And then I think we're going to move into. into sort of the decisions we can make around changing our response to things how we change our self talk how we change our how we pause and change our thoughts and challenge those. will talk about some of the stuff in group this week to actually but. So real quick the situation with your sister. Now I don't think i'm not i'm not delusional I don't think that there is a positive way to interpret this. Very scary situation with your sister."
13663.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"If you were to find the most positive way to look at it possible through a lens of gratitude, what are some of the message that messages that might come out."
13663.0,Patient,"I was just happy that she didn't I firstly I I can remember bits of like what I said but. I remember just saying that I was like happy that she was. At least able to. Just. talk to me, I guess, and be open about it, one yes. that's huge being able to say. my mind goes everywhere right. it's constantly. I didn't bring I I still don't know. What she did to. put herself in that situation, all I knows that she tried, I still don't want to know."
416.0,Provider,I think that's my.
13663.0,Patient,"I basically just said, like how important she is for a lot of people and. let's just try to be. try and change the subject to. Know situations like i'm pretty sure I tried to like. joke around a little bit just try to lighten the mood she she she kind of has a dark. humor which I tell her that. it's probably not the best thing to joke about certain things but. hey whatever works. yeah it makes her happy. Sometimes I feel like I. need to take my own advice and I tell people. Like."
416.0,Provider,I talked to my grandma situations and I.
13663.0,Patient,"what's your. favorite thing to. tell people is just it is what it is, I like what you're what we're talking about today is like one of my things like like one of my go tues is like. I have no control over this so. I shouldn't be worried, is what it is man. just keep doing your thing you stay in your lane and it'll be okay, and I can't even. Their situations that like blindside me almost just."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13663.0,Patient,"The only way I can scroll is just being blindsided by the sneak up on you and. yeah as much as I. As much as I like. I think I can. see it coming it's just there's certain things like today, oh yeah I thought I was totally. Fine, when my sister. Like I talked to her, and I was totally fine on the phone with her i'm like i'm sad but it kind of it didn't hit me until I will talk with you, to be honest with you, I think."
416.0,Provider,"there's a part of your brain that goes Oh, this is a place to let go forest do it here."
13663.0,Patient,that's okay.
416.0,Provider,"So coming back to my question from before if we were to look at your sisters, the the scare the terror that you experienced there and we were to do our very best to make it a little less scary. You know what you said before about Thank God you're reaching now and you're able to talk to me about this right that's it that's one way to focus on the positive you could think about, thank God, she went to the hospital and she was under good care there. Thank God she made it right and she's open to help."
13663.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,So. Changing the shift of where we put the emphasis on to some of those things changes the way we can we see them.
13663.0,Patient,yeah. I feel like that's kind of what helped me get through like up to this point. Was I kind of just. know.
416.0,Provider,You focus on your gratitude for her.
13663.0,Patient,"yeah. I didn't want like I like I was trying to say like I don't want it, I don't want to. know the details I cares that you're Okay, and that you're doing good that's. that's basically all I really said. Like I didn't even bring up I didn't even ask like I don't want to. I don't know I don't want to plant, the seed in her mind start thinking about something. So I just. kind of blank right now i'm sorry that's Okay, for us, we actually need to wrap it up again for today."
416.0,Provider,"And can we go ahead and schedule for number. Okay, do you have your calendar with you. Okay, so. let's see two weeks from today would be this November eight. And I have a couple different openings. I have 7am open. And I have 10am open."
13663.0,Patient,let's just 7am.
416.0,Provider,"I love it I love that you're an early bird Okay, and then you."
13663.0,Patient,guys when I forced myself to wake up early I wake up.
416.0,Provider,Okay. And so I have an eight at 7am and then I think I have probably that same time open on the 22nd which is two weeks after that.
13663.0,Patient,i'll be in California by them to.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so let's do 7am on the 22nd also. perfect. and So. homework. is to work on identifying in your life, not for everybody else, not in general, but your actual life what you can and can't control right. And what you can influence."
13663.0,Patient,alright. that's good that's good. But actually probably will help me a lot because i've some of my darkest like. Periods like depressions I guess we're just from thinking about outside stuff past couple years i'm sure that's been a pretty common with a lot of people.
416.0,Provider,"It sure is and this pandemic and world events have been help people so. yeah, particularly when you're pretty sensitive. notice, I did not say overly sensitive because that's negative you're too sensitive it's who you are it's a beautiful thing it's just hard on you. yeah."
13663.0,Patient,yeah it's not something new.
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah do with your life.
