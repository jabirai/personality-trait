Which i've been doing pretty good I haven't had any issues and everybody else. hasn't had any issues with me so that's been going good."
527.0,Provider,"Good, what do you think's made a difference, or is there anything that you've been doing different or."
14228.0,Patient,"Just spin like email. I think i'm a lot calmer now than I was at first like I used to be like kinda like really, really. angry and. Even when you know I didn't really know how to control my temper before I even started. Getting therapy, but now that i've got the therapy, I noticed some changes like. You know. More calmer now and I talk in a very calm way I don't you know pop off and get any added suits anymore like I was doing that first."
527.0,Provider,"Okay woody, what do you think was was the triggers for the anger before."
14228.0,Patient,"I think I just didn't at the time, at the time before I had the therapy I didn't really. know how to. Keep myself from. Having like you know anger. So yeah."
527.0,Provider,yeah Do you know what your anger was about like what what you were feeling angry about.
14228.0,Patient,"Just stuff that was being said or. or even, like me, taking it like the wrong way like. that's probably like that's probably what it was. But it's gotten a whole lot better like i've noticed changes, like every single day. With myself so."
527.0,Provider,"Good good sounds like you're able to see and be proud of your progress you're making to. mm hmm mm hmm. yeah has has your family made any excuse me, made any comments or your grandma recognizing that that things are different and better."
14228.0,Patient,yeah I had to ask my grandma and my mama asked them like not too long ago if i've been doing pretty good and they said yeah. That i've been doing good by my attitude has been very good so.
527.0,Provider,yeah. Well that's good feedback to get from your family.
14228.0,Patient,uh huh.
527.0,Provider,"So I know we talked about like you and grandma having some conversations and just checking in with each other, pretty regularly about how. You communicate with one another, are you guys still doing that are paying attention to, because I know you said grandma was more of a loud person, even if she's not upset she's just. has allowed tone."
14228.0,Patient,yeah we still like check in with each other.
527.0,Provider,"So how are you doing what are you doing to work on your listening skills, you said that your work still continuing to be consistent with that."
14228.0,Patient,"Is you know just listening to what people have to say. And not like you know, cutting them off whenever they're speaking. Okay, just letting them speak and then afterwards when they're done speaking, then I then I say something."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Do you ever catch yourself. already thinking about what you want to say before hearing the other person out.
14228.0,Patient,"Sometimes, but i'll. i'll still like listen to what they say first."
527.0,Provider,"Okay. Good yeah because, because I know, sometimes that can be hard, you know that you've already maybe made your decision or were decided what you're going to say. Or how you're going to respond before the other person finishes so then because you're doing that you not really even paint excuse me not really paying attention to what the other person is saying. So it is trying to stay more open minded. versus closed minded to conversations mm hmm."
14228.0,Patient,"yeah I know i'm sorry. I know, last week, when my after. My mom had brought me back home, a. Like I remember her saying something like before she left or you'd be like she said, oh you'd be good to your grandma and I, and I said oh i've always been good i've been pretty good so. And I don't know why I was kind of bothered by that I mean I just I guess. I just wanted her to you know, let her know that things have been going good with my grandma with me my grandma so."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Did you did you let her know that that. bothered you when she said that.
14228.0,Patient,"When I just told my grandma about it and I just asked her all have you been I just asked my grandma. Have you been. thinking that i've been doing a good job and then she's kept saying yeah you were you've been doing pretty good you're not you know, having any attitudes or anything and just don't let what other people say like. Get see you. Okay, so."
527.0,Provider,So when you heard mom say be good to your grandma. What What did you hear in that for yourself.
14228.0,Patient,"Well, I just when she said that I felt that I was already like you know doing that already. Like being good."
527.0,Provider,"So Okay, so it made made you feel kind of questioning like Am I am I not doing okay or am I doing okay like did you feel like you were trying, maybe questioning if you were doing okay or not, when she said that."
14228.0,Patient,"I questioned it, but then I turned around and said, all I know. And thought I know i'm doing good, so I shouldn't you know, let that be no. get to me so."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good good, because I was going to say like, how can we, how can we work on. How where to go with that thought when you have that because I know that that. This is something that you're really working on, is to not. Think something negative when somebody says something like and i'm sure i'm i'm guessing mom said was just saying that just as a reminder like. Do you know be good to grandma like kind of like a just read the you know, reinforcing that for you versus i'm guessing she probably didn't mean it negatively intentionally like you're not doing what you're supposed to so you need to be good to grandma."
14228.0,Patient,"Oh no I didn't take it, but like that I guess I did when she said that I I knew that she was reminding me of that so."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good yeah because I know, sometimes you can hang on to those things and kind of flip them around and then you're like wait a minute I thought it was doing Okay, but maybe i'm not doing okay and. kind of questioning yourself so good, because I think it is you know if you know you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, then it's easier to let some of those comments kind of kind of just brush them off."
14228.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah. And not keep like going back over and over and over and thinking about it. mm hmm. Good i'm glad you were able to do that because that's definitely progress for you.
14228.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah and I think it was good that you went to grandma and just asked like you know how do you see me how do you see me and us doing. And just getting another. Clarification or validation that you're that you are doing okay.
14228.0,Patient,Because that's going to help you feel.
527.0,Provider,"Like build your self confidence and feel better about yourself. yeah mm hmm yeah. Good work Vanessa. yeah. you're learning learning how to be assertive not aggressive. yeah huh. And how do you notice things like when you do have conflicts in instead of reacting in a more aggressive way, how do you notice the conflicts or disagreements. Improving for you."
14228.0,Patient,"um. By me just like responding like in a in a way, by saying I feel like you know, like I say like I feel statements just. saying I feel. Instead of just like. Taking it like or saying it in a harsh way."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah and it sounds like you get a better response from the other person to. huh yeah like they're not having to get angry or defensive and like like like this butting heads. yeah. yeah and things get resolved in a much calmer state too. mm hmm. yeah.
14228.0,Patient,"I wanted to stay a little longer over at my parents House like for the new year, but I had to come back here at home so. My mom wanted me to stay longer but. My grandma asked me to come back home for the new year, so."
527.0,Provider,uh huh. That was a hard hard place to be when. Like haven't haven't having a couple options there so. yeah so what helps you make that decision.
14228.0,Patient,"well. My well, I had to come back home, I wasn't really upset about it really. Since I was over there for like. On Christmas Eve in all the way up to like last. Friday so. I spent enough time with them, so I just came back home and. I was satisfied to come back home, but at the same time, I was like I wished, I could have stayed a little longer."
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah. yeah that's hard when you have those both of those feelings like I wanna I i'm excited and satisfied to go home but i'm gonna also you know kind of sad, I have to leave to like both of those feelings, you know both of those feelings. You you know are true about yourself. yeah. So it sounds like that didn't impact, then how things like you weren't mad that you had to come home to grandma's so it sounds like you were able to be okay with that decision and and not let it affect like rest, the rest of the weekend, for you, with grandma."
14228.0,Patient,mm hmm.
