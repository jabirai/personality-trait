One tablet twice a day field on January to six patients states that she picked the Madison up on January six, which was a Thursday. But she started her medication that Friday January 7 she said that at least two to three times, she states that she always pick some medicines up on a Thursday and start them on a Friday, she showed me one pill remain. Okay, and she said that she had taken her last text earlier that day she had that one pill for the rest of the day, so with that information. she's had seven days of medicines and so she should have taken 13 pills and three pills, should have been remaining so 16 minus 13 is three. Now, after I share with her that she had fewer appeals than what she should have had she had one pill remaining should have had three she later said that she may have taken some extra may is due to have a more pain and hurting and she also reported that she's been having cravings. Please document that we did reiterate again to take the medication as prescribed she can continue continue divided doses at low dose tolerance tolerance for pain and to definitely talk with her primary care provider Okay, and the dictation Thank you."
