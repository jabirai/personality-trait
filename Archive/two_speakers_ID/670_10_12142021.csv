10.0,Provider,hi Melissa. hey how's it going.
670.0,Patient,i'm. just going through the motion.
10.0,Provider,yeah.
670.0,Patient,"um. I feel pretty good um. You know I feel like the I mean I don't know what maybe it's different for everybody, you know coming off of this, but I just. You know, every time I think about coming off of that I just I have a lot of anxiety and I I you know, the more I think that is why I feel like i'm not i'm not there yet like i'm not ready, and then. You know, but it feels like when I do you know the two or three days a week, where I take a quarter last you know it, it makes me feel like i'm progressing or getting somewhere, you know, but I mean."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so I mean yeah there's I think it's totally normal to have some anxiety around weaning down off this. But when you so when you take. A little bit the quarter less do you feel any withdrawal symptoms, or do you feel uncomfortable in any way."
670.0,Patient,"I do, I feel like I feel like. You know, like like I don't know like I didn't take I know my rain like I didn't take the folder so like. You know I start I get I think I get too much in my head about it, you know, but I do occasionally like i'll feel like i'm like i'm hot or i'm feeling like i'm like a cold sweat kind of but you know that's. that's probably the extent of it, and again I i'm not sure if that is that from anxiety or is that, from the dose a lower."
10.0,Provider,"weight so so you do feel different on the days so are you still doing it like Tuesday Thursday Saturday. And do you do that most of the time, since we last talked last month."
670.0,Patient,"yeah there's been a couple times, where i've just done. For Tuesday Thursday and didn't start with Saturday."
10.0,Provider,"So yeah I think at this point. let's just hold it at how you've been doing it just try to try to keep it, you know, one in three quarters on Tuesday Thursday Saturday and then. Until until you adjust because you're still it sounds like you still haven't like leveled out at this new decrease dosage, but I think the fact that you feel good about making that transition and going in that direction. is a good sign, and so you know we can just. take our time and slowly slowly slowly wean down the dosage so you know take as long as it takes until you get comfortable at that at that dose I think the most important thing is, are you having cravings to use on those days."
670.0,Patient,"No um I think I don't know if that's like how everyone is, but I feel like there's this level where i'm. You know, obviously, like i'm always at risk for it just because of you know where i've previously been but I don't ever feel like. I should go get you know some health or you know I want to, I want to drink heavily and you know just block out like I never feel that way you know, and I mean it's like. I don't know i've been doing for a long time now, and, of course, you know there's still days, where i'm just like you know it's just stress or anxiety, but I, I never I don't like even let my brain go there, like you know i'm not I you know it's. I don't know it just feels like I don't wanna i'm not going to be going back there you know what I mean like."
10.0,Provider,"that's a good sign, so last time we talked you had made us a little goal Do you remember what it was."
670.0,Patient,The. Was it the breathing exercises. You were talking about time.
10.0,Provider,Five minutes a day.
670.0,Patient,"yeah there um i've been i've been doing pretty good with that you know I get up early to go to work, but I, you know even just when i'm logging in for the day I just take that minute you know it's not always five minutes you know. But I do, I take like at least like one even there's just one minute, you know I just sit there and I just kind of take a moment for myself. You know, and I feel I was built like a little better, when I do that you know I feel like i'm it's like a you know, like a routine in my day at this point, you know where I just kind of. You know, even if it's in the middle of a sometimes you know I just have this like you know i'm working you know something has to get done right now, but I just take that minute and just. Try to relax and have a second to myself and then go into what I need to do."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, great yeah so. I think. that's a good sign, again, that you know sounds like it's helping you I would recommend that you continue to expand on that so make it a little bit more formal and connecting with the breathing and. You know that's going to help with the anxiety and the more that you build up your mindfulness practice. The more. Second. and The more that you spend time on that and commit to that, the stronger you're going to be and the better the anxiety is so. And then also making sure you're getting your exercise to."
670.0,Patient,"Do. You and I uh I make sure I walk every day, but you know I probably do about three mile. ride I do that two to three times a week. Just like a. steady job nothing, nothing too crazy."
10.0,Provider,yeah so that's good is that you find that helps too.
670.0,Patient,"yeah I, like you know I can just some yeah most of the time I I like to listen to music, but sometimes I can just go and kind of this my what's around me and. kind of try to get out of my head a little yeah."
10.0,Provider,"yeah perfect and. So yeah I feel like like I said. it's going to take time don't rush it and you're doing great you know you're able to get it down to that quarter less of a film a couple of days a week. And we'll just stay there, and continue to do your exercise build on your meditation practice your breathing and we'll check in do you want to check in next month and see where you're at."
670.0,Patient,"um yeah I know I think I told her, I was gonna go to Maryland this week i'm leaving on Thursday and he said you would have to do a. An early release on the medication."
