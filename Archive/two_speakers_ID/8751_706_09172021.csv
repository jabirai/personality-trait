706.0,Provider,hey Jim.
8751.0,Patient,john.
706.0,Provider,"pretty good, how are you. i'm here yeah. So what's been going on since the last time we talked."
8751.0,Patient,"Maybe a couple calls, I sent a couple emails about stuff we talked about."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8751.0,Patient,Not my child really okay.
706.0,Provider,So what did you find out with making the calls and sending the emails.
8751.0,Patient,Not much so far. I talked to. One person who is familiar with some of the assisted living things. hmm and she was gonna like. She if she could find any information. I haven't haven't heard anything. More.
706.0,Provider,So what have you been doing to fill up your time.
8751.0,Patient,"Mostly my usual stuff my stretching exercises taking care of the House. Trying to do the at least get out. get some of my stuff done but. Still. Still overdoing it by. One of what I do that. As kind of finally came up in group, the other day. And he came he he put the name to a day. boom bust."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8751.0,Patient,"yeah pacing all that so i've been looking into that a little bit that's pretty much what happens is like wait until I have a day, where I actually feel like I can go do some of these things, and then I try and get as much done as I can, while i'm out."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8751.0,Patient,And then I overdo it then i'm like toast for days.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8751.0,Patient,"And so it it's like a yes, I accomplish something, but it sets me back. You know, sometimes days, sometimes longer."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So I think, maybe what you need to look at is limiting the amount of time that you are out and about just because you do have issues with fatigue and it kind of knocking you down for a few days."
8751.0,Patient,You know.
706.0,Provider,Just kind of a gradual like exposure therapy gradually you know just for short periods being out just not to overdo it. i'm. Did you look into any of like the grocery delivery services that we had talked about.
8751.0,Patient,yeah I found anytime yeah I think. I think safeway has a program. But you have to call them and get set up.
706.0,Provider,huh.
8751.0,Patient,able to set it up on your account.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
8751.0,Patient,But I think I think that's a possibility. Like for. For some things because they're definitely overpriced on. Most of their online pricing so.
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8751.0,Patient,"I mean, I had them deliver. When I still had money. and You know, we said. Is there is there is a pretty big difference in price from. What you would pay at the store."
706.0,Provider,hmm okay.
8751.0,Patient,"hey wouldn't it would be nice to have you know eggs butter cheese. I should, I have an ad in three or four months yeah."
706.0,Provider,So um were you able to look into anything in regards to your social security like somebody that can kind of help you navigate that process.
8751.0,Patient,"Well, I just got the. updated file. uh huh so the. A hearing judges has finished collecting so. Whenever she makes her decision. Okay, a little figure out. The next step, and then in that process. Which which will definitely either be. An attorney or. Where they approve my. disability and then I can actually look for a place that you know mm hmm. yeah that's that's the thing I I love having my own place it's It gives me a feeling of being my own person still. The problem I have is that I can't really exit my building. mm hmm without hitting the point of fatigue."
706.0,Provider,Just because of how inside out.
8751.0,Patient,"I have to go up hill to get the parking lot. So it's a I mean like that. Basically, a ground level in the back, but the parking lot is up in the front. So there's not really. Any easy access way for me to do that. Which is, which is part of the problem of you know, trying to do, like the pacing thing like. If i'm hitting the point of fatigue God my you know hips and one bar and knees before I even exit my parking lot. i'm already toast I mean that's you know anything I do is already above and beyond. And that I know that holds me back mentally because I know it's going to hit. So. That it becomes that okay. Which point is it is it the point that I built up in my head, or is it the actual physical point. And i'm having trouble distinguishing those two."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and why do you think that is."
8751.0,Patient,"decades of back page. And the last 10 years of having excruciating back pain, if I do something wrong."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
8751.0,Patient,That that pain level that that hits when I move wrong or. Is. it's a big deterrent.
706.0,Provider,"So, would you. say that it would be safe to say that part of your lack of motivation to go out of the House and kind of go out of your apartment is maybe due to the fear that. Something would happen to physically and you would be not able to get back like you know, like you, leaving your apartment and you have to go up hell and maybe you hurt your back or you fall, or you know, and then you just you don't you can't get back."
8751.0,Patient,yeah well and that. The best descriptions. that people understand. would be like maybe a touch of. agoraphobia.
706.0,Provider,board is kind of.
8751.0,Patient,"Being here, this is this is. It, this is a safe space, I mean I don't like crowds. And, and some of its that I don't like crowds of its that there's too much sensory input with a craft uh huh and that overload size. You know, and I, and again it could go either way the descriptions of both are pretty accurate so."
706.0,Provider,"And I know we had talked about exposure therapy kind of a little bit at a time, you know because we had talked about well if you can't get. Certain things delivered you know, even if you went to the store once a month and God like butter, eggs melt you know. And you just went in specifically for those items and you just got them and got out, it would give you exposure therapy, of being outside in a social environment, maybe being around some people. but not to the point that it'd be completely overwhelming, because it would be short stints of time."
8751.0,Patient,"yeah but I that's actually the. Part of the reason i'm suffering today is is actually Wednesday right before group I. went down to write a because I needed to pick up some like I needed dishwasher detergent and I needed toilet paper like I literally ran out of toilet paper, so I had to go. And I got to the end of the street and with a dad go to safeway. And the parking lot was packed. Or you go to rite aid. parking lot I was busy but not packed right he never that busy anyways. I was like Okay, let me do rite aid. and get what I need yeah so I did, that the. The problem I ran into was was the physical limitation a. Even. I wanted to get more things, while I was there, but I didn't trust myself to carry them, so I only got what I could fit my backpack. And that still was too much for me."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8751.0,Patient,That was still like more of a bird. watching then uh huh. That it was what.
706.0,Provider,Do you have like one of those like cards or anything that you can put groceries in.
8751.0,Patient,You know that might be something to look into yeah someday.
706.0,Provider,"Well there's there's someplace sometimes there's agencies in town like. That can help with that stuff piece it's kind of like an accommodation to quality of life, and there are some places that people will donate things like that it might be just something to look into. When you talk to these different agencies that you've kind of made phone you've made phone calls to for assistance. That I gave you the last time, maybe ask them if there's any kind of carts or anything that they know that's available at lower no cost that could help you potentially maybe do some activities of daily living that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do. So how have you been feeling the past couple weeks how's your depression."
8751.0,Patient,Sam. Yes. done a lot more. shorter looking back. And there's definitely been a lot of these cycles okay.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you think that your mentor working appropriately, or do you think maybe you need to have a MED check."
8751.0,Patient,Well i'm not i'm not on anything for.
706.0,Provider,you're not anything for depression.
8751.0,Patient,Now my. primary care doctor has offered. But. I. i'm hesitant to take anything. Under her supervision. That. She doesn't listen to a symptom she doesn't listen to anything so I I just don't feel comfortable with her being a prescriber.
706.0,Provider,I think we talked about that a little bit last time to and talks about you may be seeking out a different provider.
8751.0,Patient,I. kinda. was thinking about going with the natural path. But I haven't even I haven't. i've only had the one appointment with her and I haven't like I haven't made it down to the lab to get blood work and I talked to my. Care coordinator from the insurance company and she told me to call and see if I get. Like the all. visit to have the boy drive here.
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8751.0,Patient,um someone by.
706.0,Provider,yeah like do some home health type stuff.
8751.0,Patient,"But I. I haven't contacted. The agency's again yet. The couple I spoke to before when she had suggested on health stuff basically I did I don't qualify because I still do enough stuff on my own. instance, so I don't qualify for their programs so. i'm not really sure. hey. This kind of like everything stuck in a in a loophole. yeah because i'm not. The State says i'm disable the Fed hasn't said i'm disabled so i'm not disabled, so I don't qualify on the disabled side it for everything. But I am disabled so. All the limitations of being disabled or there. huh but. What do you mean until. Until someone officially says you're disabled you're not."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
8751.0,Patient,"So then you're just. Whatever. And that's. I mean I I get it, I mean there's entirely too many people. To try and. Take care of everyone, or whatever, but. It seems seems to me. The whole medical industry has gotten away from patient care."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8751.0,Patient,And it's now just about. money. numbers.
706.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean and in a lot of ways that's true that's the nice thing you know that I like. bright heart, because it really does focus on patient care, rather than other things. yeah, and so I think that that's one of the huge benefits of being with a company like this and then for me working for a company like this um. Very different than your traditional health care or mental health care type facility. um. I really do think that it would be beneficial for you to continue to look into all of all of those different services and opportunities to get assistance that we had discussed, because the more you can take off your plate, the better you're going to feel. And the more that you can focus on the things that your what your goals are like that slow exposure therapy, you know, but then not having to worry about maybe. Doing you can do it on your own time, rather than because you have to run to the store or something like that, because maybe there's a service that can come out and take you once a week that kind of thing."
8751.0,Patient,"yeah and that and that brings up part of part of my problem. Oh, why. When I had my Prius."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8751.0,Patient,"When I first moved out here, I I bought a Prius uh huh. I have trouble getting in and out of low vehicles."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8751.0,Patient,"And when I first guy here, it was maybe one out of every 20 times I get in there, out of their car I would get that sharp pain. toward the end of the time I had the Prius. A year later."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8751.0,Patient,"I probably got that feeling one out of every four times I got in and out of that few. So it became like. At least one time going out to run errands. I would end up. feeling like curling up in a ball right, where I am for half an hour. And that was just cool. I mean I. Literally I got to the store would try and get out of the car feel the pain sit back in the car for half an hour and then just drive home never doing. A was just like complete waste of like an hour or more. yeah it was like okay. This is a good, so I traded in the previous I got a truck."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
8751.0,Patient,"To get in and out easy. Getting out I could straight my back and lower myself and and be fine and be standing without and that was fine but, and I still didn't really drive. The entire time i've been here since July of 2017 till now. i've driven less than 500 miles. Totally."
706.0,Provider,So you have a vehicle and you can drive.
8751.0,Patient,I don't have one or what I sold the truck I. Because it was available money.
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8751.0,Patient,"And I wasn't driving anyways I mean I literally was driving. 66 miles, a month. So I always like. Why am I Why am I paying $70 a month at car insurance if i'm driving six miles, you know. huh it was costing me more to keep it. So I I sold that. I bought me a you know a few more months of rent and. And, and then after that I. Basically, had no assets left so, then I qualified for housing. Really kind of sucks but. that's the way it works. You audio cut out."
706.0,Provider,"and make one and I really want to follow up on those services that I gave you information on I really want you to look into those so we can kind of discuss that the next time that we meet. Does that sound good. Okay, and if you would like to have longer sessions, then when you set up your appointments just let them know that you want 60 minutes or 45 minutes or whatever, so that they don't book somebody directly after you."
8751.0,Patient,Okay. Okay. yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So um, but I have somebody in the waiting room that's why I have to under session but um but yeah just let them know if you want to have longer sessions discovery for like 45 minutes or 60 minutes. Okay. yep you're welcome if you need anything before next visit i'm just gonna hold the virtual clinic and they'll let me know. Okay, all right take care. All right, bye bye."
