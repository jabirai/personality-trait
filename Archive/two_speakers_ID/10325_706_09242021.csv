10325.0,Patient,No trying.
706.0,Provider,"So, what are you looking to do, what do you want to do."
10325.0,Patient,"Mostly construction, but we don't want to answer."
706.0,Provider,"Yes, that's a pretty hard one with winter coming around. yeah do you do in late, can you do like indoor staff or just outdoor stuff."
10325.0,Patient,"fast food restaurants, I really can't oh i'm."
706.0,Provider,"So, as far as construction, goes, can you do like inside jobs, like drywall and things."
10325.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,So maybe that's something that you need to look for is like a drywall or something like that kind of a position because that you can do throughout the winter.
10325.0,Patient,yeah boring stuff like.
706.0,Provider,"yeah. So maybe. I don't know where you where you live, if you have a lot of different construction companies, but maybe just kind of reaching out and just. letting them know what your skill set is and see if they have any openings for somebody like you, you know, because sometimes they don't advertise that kind of construction type work it's all by the word of mouth. So you know just reaching out and being like hey this is, you know what I can do i'm looking for you know, a job, and you know doing what a bmp i've got this men's experience. And just see kind of what they say, the worst thing they can do is tell you now, and the best thing they can do is tell you like yeah why don't you come on we can talk about kind of you know what we have. yeah, so I would. I would start there and just kind of see where that leads you."
10325.0,Patient,"need to get me in Khartoum in China i'm waiting in my third stimulus check if you got messed up, so I didn't send it back."
706.0,Provider,Oh no.
10325.0,Patient,yeah my room see me know for me for with us.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, well, that will be helpful, with trying to work, you know, having a car that's important."
10325.0,Patient,"Yes, for your room."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh definitely um. So. What are your short term plans, besides getting a job, like in the next three months, what How would you how do you want to see your life."
10325.0,Patient,i'm hopefully better than no. One better loading or okay.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so job car maybe your own place to live. Would you be living with your girlfriend and your daughter is that the. So um. So, in order for those things to happen first the job, obviously, to get a job you probably need a vehicle, so you can get to work. So it's. Just like a step by step, so. What is your Porsche."
10325.0,Patient,Porsche we agree.
706.0,Provider,"So so. Canada first big step is getting a car, and you said to do that, you need to wait for your stimulus check."
10325.0,Patient,"1400 dollars, so that helps a lot."
706.0,Provider,"So um. How long ago, did you have to send it back."
10325.0,Patient,about six so much seven weeks now. it's a nine week.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, I was gonna say how long did they tell you yeah six to nine okay. yeah government can be pretty slow sometimes."
10325.0,Patient,You really can.
706.0,Provider,"um so a lot of people that didn't get their stimulus check their last one when they filed their taxes they got it, but you probably didn't file any taxes last year did you."
10325.0,Patient,know just my third rule. Recovery rebate me.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So I think you have I mean, I think you definitely have a good plan in place, you know you've got some goals. You want to get your car, you might get a job you want your own place live with your girlfriend have your daughter, and just kind of have this new life, and I think that's a perfect plan. So now, my question is if that perfect plan doesn't go off without a hitch and there's bumps in the road, how are you going to deal with that."
10325.0,Patient,Work past. No real life.
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well yeah nobody. Nobody wants to relapse obviously that's not somebody doesn't wake up one day and be like today i'm going to relapse you know, like it's just not a plan, but, but it does happen, because life can kind of take you by surprise life can take you on."
10325.0,Patient,crazy people.
706.0,Provider,"yeah get around the wrong people or something traumatic happening, you know, like if something happened to your daughter or your girlfriend or. Somebody in your family um you know what would you do what coping skills, do you have that you can use rather than run back to the thing that has always been there."
10325.0,Patient,or just talk to somebody looks to me. So.
706.0,Provider,So so talking to people as one of your biggest coping skills.
10325.0,Patient,"me. You know i'm real close to you, every time open it up. uh huh don't really trust anybody. server years the little screwed me over okay."
706.0,Provider,"So you feel like. over your the span of your life people that you thought you could trust, then you couldn't."
10325.0,Patient,And yeah.
706.0,Provider,So now you're just like I don't trust anybody.
10325.0,Patient,"You know, let my guard to him, trying to. Get you."
706.0,Provider,"Next. yeah nope I can I can understand why you would feel that way. But look but look at it this way, I mean obviously you have your girlfriend and I have a baby daughter, so at some point, you had to trust her enough to let her in your life. Now, and if you wouldn't have trusted her you would not have her in your life or your daughter. So sometimes taking that leap of faith, so to say, with people I mean sometimes it turns out, bad and sometimes it turns out well, but at the same time, if you don't take that chance you'll never know."
10325.0,Patient,So I always.
706.0,Provider,"You could always walk away from somebody. But if you miss an opportunity with somebody a lot of times you don't get that back. Does that make sense. So um. So, as far as like your coping skills of talking to people that's a great one I think that's awesome that you have a good support system, you can talk to. But what if you were by yourself and nobody was around like what are things that you can do to keep yourself grounded to keep yourself in a good space, if things are around you were very chaotic and and you know there's a lot going on."
10325.0,Patient,and then try and learn how to drill into it.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're creative you like to do creative things like draw stuff like that yeah okay."
10325.0,Patient,"So very, very good."
706.0,Provider,"Well, you know you know the crazy thing about tattoo artists, is that they don't. always necessarily draw like what they put on they think. It gives them a picture and they printed out on this printer thing and then they stick it on, and then they kind of leaves that you know late that tattoo."
10325.0,Patient,"Again, is. yeah."
706.0,Provider,yep it's like a temporary tattoo and then they just go over top of it.
10325.0,Patient,"Yes, what I do just dental. For patterns."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah so you don't really need to be good at drawing because it's already drawn for you.
10325.0,Patient,The. shame for. You really looks crazy you're done shaving.
706.0,Provider,"yeah unless it's just like a word or something I mean that's obviously can just be like in one color, but if you actually have a picture yeah you definitely need to have some shading um. So what other things do you like to do in your free time."
10325.0,Patient,I was lucky de.
706.0,Provider,la so does that help take your mind off the things.
10325.0,Patient,yeah there's a good show or movie.
706.0,Provider,Just distract show. yeah yeah What about do you get outside much go for walks or anything like that.
10325.0,Patient,"yeah sometimes I go nice oh yeah Oh, I want to draw hot."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah nobody nobody likes when it's really hot and humid. The one thing is, you know, in the evenings or in the morning before it's really hat getting out even for 1520 minutes is really good for your serotonin levels. In your. In your body, because the vitamin D from the sun is a natural mood booster so it's kind of like when you work out how you have that natural kind of high feeling that really good feeling because of the. endorphins vitamin D is kind of like that to your body typically produces so much vitamin D, but it gets a lot from the sun."
10325.0,Patient,And if.
706.0,Provider,"you're not getting a lot of sunlight. You know, taking vitamin D supplements can help with mood as well. Especially late third shift people, because obviously they work at night when it's dark. And then, when they. come home they sleep all day so sometimes they don't get that sunlight, because they have that opposite shift. Sometimes they have to take vitamin D to maintain all those levels, because you know they're not getting it from the sun. They even say like artificial sun like from tanning beds is actually better than having no Senegal, just because that light just it does something with your mood and increasing those vitamin D levels so. If you can get out and go for a walk so be really very helpful to you, I think you would notice that different and in your mood. Because the biggest thing when you're in recovery, especially the beginning of recovery and you're trying to kind of rebuild your. Your foundation, so I look at recovery is like a house and you have to start at the bottom, you have to build a foundation. If you're building that foundation and it's not a strong foundation you work construction if you build a house on a foundation that's not strong the House isn't going to stand. You know it's going to fall."
10325.0,Patient,So you.
706.0,Provider,"You have to have that strong foundation and that's how I like to describe recovery is it brick by brick to build that foundation, so you can have a strong foundation, then you can build upon that first year to get that strong foundation. So. So being able to identify when things are stressful identify ways to cope. And then also to stay very like you said stay positive and work towards your future Those are the main things in recovery that you have to master in."
10325.0,Patient,order to.
706.0,Provider,"yeah. And it's hard, because you go from a life of getting high so. Really, what matters when you're getting high all that matters is getting high how you're going to get high when you're going to get high How much is it going to cost you to get high you have enough money to get high like."
10325.0,Patient,Those yeah but it's.
706.0,Provider,"All about. So, now that you don't think about those things anymore, you have this day, where you're sober and it's empty, because what you used to fill it with isn't there anymore."
10325.0,Patient,and
706.0,Provider,"Anything that you feel you know positive or negative, whatever it may be that you used to use drugs either to enhance it or cope with it or numb it. isn't there anymore, so all of those feelings, you have to feel all those things that happen in life, they hit you a lot harder when you're not high."
10325.0,Patient,So. Oh he's got one semester place.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and that's why, when I talked about when we met last time about structuring your day just kind of having your. Your day structured out so you know kind of like on a schedule how your day is going to look and once you get to the end of that day there's one more day in recovery, you have. yeah and the next day you go through your schedule again and that's one more day and recover, you have, and soon what happens is it becomes a routine. And once you have a routine it it doesn't seem like work anymore. It just seems natural. So, and for right now with you not working, I mean besides looking for work really what you have is the gift of time to figure out. You know, to figure out what things do you enjoy What would you like to do with your your free time and you have that you know that gift of time to be able to look at all that stuff you know, maybe you have some interests you didn't even know you had."
10325.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know and there's you know healthy ways of dealing with aggression and anger and. resentment and all of those things you know, some people will go and do like. Like boxing or work out or those kinds of things, and those are healthy ways to release that energy. You know nothing feels better than when you're upset with a situation or person than to go hit a punching bag. well. I do kickboxing and I love it it's just this release of stress you just take it out on the bag so sometimes that's really helpful to I don't know if you. Have any place like that, where you are but. really helps to. make you feel good, because you get those natural endorphins going but also release any kind of anger resentment stress frustration, you know guilt shame, whatever it is that you've kind of got built up in you, you can get that out."
10325.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,So. yeah. hmm. yeah. Well i'm sure that with having a baby you spend a lot of time with her.
10325.0,Patient,Certainly little further.
706.0,Provider,along and they grow up so fast.
10325.0,Patient,really do.

706.0,Provider,"Okay, so is she in love with her baby sister."
10325.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
706.0,Provider,"yeah that's pretty awesome I have a 13 year old and I have a two year old So when I had my youngest my son was 10 almost 11 and. It was a huge gap, but yeah he just he loves his baby brother."
10325.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,um it's good to have. That sibling bonding.
10325.0,Patient,"You know, sometimes don't like."
706.0,Provider,"If they're the only child when a baby's born, but it's good when they have that bonding and they have that that love and i'm glad that you spend a lot of time with your kids because that's really important for them. To develop into a good human beings. to feel secure in life. Right so."
10325.0,Patient,Naturally neural.
706.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah so I mean that's really great too. And it's good that you have maintained your relationship with your older daughter, because sometimes when things fall."
10325.0,Patient,"off, you know, especially if you're using a lot."
706.0,Provider,Sometimes you lose those.
10325.0,Patient,relationships in.
706.0,Provider,And you can't get them back.
10325.0,Patient,"Yes, one thing oh my. hmm you know yeah."
706.0,Provider,yeah yeah you definitely don't.
10325.0,Patient,want going all the way there. Two bumps and early.
706.0,Provider,"yeah there's going to be bumps in the road part of recovery is relapse that's a given people typically will relapse at least one time but. The difference between somebody that is stable in recovery versus somebody who is not is that relapse will be a wake up call. And then they'll get back on the road to recovery and they'll say okay Why did I do that i'm not gonna do that again, this is what happened, these are the signs, I saw and now i'm right back on my in my recovery i'm not even going to look at it again. The stable in their recovery have that bump in the road and they let that bum completely throw them off track. And then, they have to start. all over again so that's just the difference so you're going to have bumps in the road, it just matters what you do with those bumps."
10325.0,Patient,"yay Yang. England very image. that's good, so thank you for yeah."
706.0,Provider,"And it sounds like you have a lot to live for yeah two beautiful girls and you've got your girlfriend and your family and. i'd say, all in all you're pretty lucky."
