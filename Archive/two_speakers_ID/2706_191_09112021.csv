191.0,Provider,By.
2706.0,Patient,"Your side, I actually got it because, like I broke my neck in a car accident, when I was younger, but I got it like crack my back and things. But then. I started looking at these workouts and you can like lay on the floor and like take the ball from your finance and pass it to your legs like back and forth so i've been fiddle around with that, like you know."
191.0,Provider,"I have one too it's hard for me to keep my child off of it. But my yoga ball, what I do sometimes I lay on top of it. And that's how I do my push up sometimes and. Sometimes, what i'll do too if i'm sitting watching TV and I want to burn more calories i'll actually be pushing up an awful my ball, while i'm kind of. Getting some motion because. I was noticing, as I got older cassie I was gaining weight, so I Ashley smaller now than what I was in my 30s. So i'll. Do the resistance, the ball like you said, an exercise and yeah that makes such a big difference."
2706.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I go i'm starting to get like spider veins like in my upper leg area. I know from where like i'm standing all day and I am kind of heavier so there's things I want to. I bought all kinds of creams and stuff for it, but I know I just need to keep my legs elevated more so I can lay like all my back and put my feet up on that bowl you know just different things, and it was like 30 bucks so you know worth it."
191.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah I know you know I think you and I have a lot in common yeah the spider veins to do that one of the things i'm trying to do is keep my weight from getting so high so and I may have to store back doing like compression stockings or find my son elevate my legs.
2706.0,Patient,"I tried looking for some of them on Amazon, but I can't find none. That go like past my kneecaps. And minor like that that's my detox."

2706.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
191.0,Provider,yeah I will.
2706.0,Patient,Look him like on Amazon and walmart and.
191.0,Provider,"yeah because I know, sometimes what i've done to instead of getting the medical grade ones i've used like you remember that can't that that the company spanx I try to get ones with the higher spend X content in them and i've gotten some really extra control. really just pantyhose and I find that they hold your leg so tight and still not as good as compression stockings."
2706.0,Patient,But I.
191.0,Provider,was thought to that sometimes and go to spanx go to summit like i've gone to some of the high end stores and they have so look at the amount of spandex and i'm.
2706.0,Patient,going.
191.0,Provider,"To get pretty high, and you can actually they seem like they do feel tighter with the legs and they just tone, all the way up."
2706.0,Patient,yeah. Oh yeah that is good idea. Because I noticed like they're starting they started in my you know upper like above my kneecaps but they're moving their way down like i'm starting to see what looks like little bruises but I know you know the bus veins or whatever yeah.
191.0,Provider,The spider veins yeah yeah no genetic. yeah it runs in my family to.

And I don't advocate for going to 10 and base and I. And I actually encourage my patients, not to. It is because i've skin cancer and everything but one day I was just sitting around and I didn't have anything to do, and it was in the wintertime. And my patients us always talking about how good they feel after tanning so went to the to the tan shop. And I was standing around and people looked at me really funny because I guess they like she's not here for 10 so I had to tell them Ashley i'm here to get a tan. And they really friendly but I don't think they thought that I was there to get a tan says no i'm actually here to give to him so when I went there as I got one packet one time I didn't get the package just one time service. yeah I love that tanning booth cassie I feel like I had 10 cups of coffee.

2706.0,Patient,It.
191.0,Provider,"I just felt so much better, I had no idea that it. could make you feel that good and I never gone back. And I think the other thing that it was really good for it really makes you relax it's like you have to. yeah you have to focus on getting that tan and just rest and then, when you. The whole experience was just wonderful yeah so no I get it now, but beforehand, I didn't get what people were talking about it to me it's Ashley I think it like i've laid out and babe by the pool at the beach. at it, it is great doing it at the beach, because I think it's the water, the waves."
