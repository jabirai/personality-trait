207.0,Provider,i'm.
518.0,Patient,Just kind of put to the side never got to it and to do a background check ahead of time because we got misdemeanors will show up they can't do it to the last second so I have to do that well ahead of time.

518.0,Patient,"decreases anxiety. Right she's back to the future, this workout that workout is the right is there that'd be alright."
207.0,Provider,"So the thoughts of the future, so do you think is that now that you're in a full blown relationship right would you say that you're currently in a full relationship."
518.0,Patient,Created darn close.
207.0,Provider,To what may say close and non fully in a relationship.
518.0,Patient,"Well, still giving her pawnee a room that you know she just lost her husband, so no light flashing light too hard, but it's gotten really close. So I was considered almost there. But."
207.0,Provider,Not so you're saying that it's not a full. So you're saying it's not a full relationship because you're. you're allowing her to grieve the loss of her husband.
518.0,Patient,"yeah me I don't you know, try to say i'm as your new replacement completely drop everything I know. She saw speaks of those times and go through go through some things."
207.0,Provider,"And invasion over here. I know that one of your biggest desires, has always been to be in a relationship, do you still do you still have to spend time with your nephew was it your nephews right."
518.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't. I haven't been down there in a while they moved to a new house. And it's a number down area. That is having a. I don't know was like her, on a hit like the holidays and everything else through it up and I haven't seen him much recently sent my grandma's funeral."
207.0,Provider,"How old, are they again."
518.0,Patient,gage V. 11 this October and then actually turned 10 bucks.
207.0,Provider,Turning.
518.0,Patient,Up somebody turning.
207.0,Provider,A letter about nine.
518.0,Patient,Months apart.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so somebody turning."
518.0,Patient,11 and at the.
207.0,Provider,end of October.
518.0,Patient,Well yeah towards the very end of October. I forget the exact date it's not Halloween was close to it.
207.0,Provider,"um. But it's still. I know you talked about like the desire of having your own family kind of like what your your brother has. And just kind of you know, having some stability being in a relationship and not necessarily just being alone or always being alone, so I know that's the biggest thing for you and and with some social anxiety that you, you do have it's it's it's somewhat meant hindering. for you to go out there and meet people, and you know so here is this one opportunity where you met someone. And there's a potential there to build someone, and I do believe that that kind of filled somewhat of a void, for you."
518.0,Patient,"yeah it does, but. I don't think I did it just do that. cuz you know just don't settle for any anybody there there's a lot of. A lot of stuff we connected on even when she was married just talking and chatting and things. We are very similar like opposite sex twins or something. You want to me."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm. Very.
518.0,Patient,"With your up in small towns not far apart, you know grew up in the country small schools and and gotten a city was different. Everything you know."
207.0,Provider,But it does come down to you.
518.0,Patient,Similar personalities quiet reserved somewhat you know good sense of humor.
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm and, but it still comes down to us still. it's still assessing and analyzing because sometimes when we're trying to fill a void, or we have a need or desire a feeling often times. We we we are going to find those similarities we're going to see those similarities we're going to. justify some of the different things, because at the end of the day it is filling an eight desire it's a voice that's been filled like this is how you know i'm feeling and then after a while, then the real um. I don't want to say, the real person, but I want to say, eventually, then everyone's true colors start showing from this is how oftentimes we start saying you know, not necessarily blaming yourself, but there is definitely. When we start noticing all of the different quirks or about each other than whether we blame the other person you blame you become harder on yourself and it's because we were blinded by our needs we were blinded by our voice so that's why I said it's it's it's really. Being. able to visualize the word it's just um."
518.0,Patient,"Well there's some of that some of the stuff you're. Speaking of you know, some of my demons came out some of hers came out. We hit has a lot, but now we kind of met a melting point where you are now kind of smooth out a little bit. That was trying to explain it to beginning. Okay, you know what I mean, so it kind of instead of just blowing although off the water blowing everything out of water and change Oh, you know no more you kind of fixed it to more adapted to each other better, some way somehow I don't know it could be guys mentioned. Earlier kind of going at it pretty heavy for a minute, you know, are you doing this or that or. She seen it one way I see another way this and that and. Okay kinds of things."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm. So you find that there's a lot more similarities than differences and there's a lot more that most of you can outside of the passing of her husband I you said she also has she has adult children right.
518.0,Patient,Well yeah too long.
207.0,Provider,"Now, are you guys presenting yourself as in a relationship or are you guys just me painting the title of mainframe."
518.0,Patient,"brands, for now, but she has two younger boys to that she's getting back to kind of got separated for a minute."
207.0,Provider,"But what what are they going to be moving in with you, for her."
518.0,Patient,"Eventually, but i've met both of them several times, or a few times rather or the one several times one few times. There I get along real well every like means oldest one really like so."
207.0,Provider,that's pretty good and now have you had any triggers or any need. or desire.
518.0,Patient,"Not recently what blows not dead long ago, but I got through. My grandma stuff and the birthdays right after that, so I just kind of went hand in hand, you know. I just fell off the deep end for an uh."
207.0,Provider,"huh. The things that i've been. Doing is recommending is mindful exercises doing a lot of mindfulness exercise where. You do some deep breathing and. To calm, because at the end of the day, it's it's it's learning how to take back control of your thoughts, because all of it is within your use your thoughts right. And why we do these mindful exercises is just to identify what are the force of these negative thoughts that i'm having and you know, being able to. Talk about it in group being able to identify the same do you have control over into things you don't have control over, because the truth of the matter is that's what increases our anxiety because we spend a whole lot of time great deal upon and. We could spend a great deal of time, focusing on the things we have no control over. In comparison to focusing on what is my task at hand, and what can I do about the task is at hand. and finding so like, in this case from a financial standpoint hey I need to be able to find a job with focusing on applying for a job. And just applying for as many yes, I want to apply for Amazon, I want to try walmart but then, if you don't get the job, so you just give up and walk away. She doesn't get angry, or do you continue to apply for many different jobs because, with what we don't know is that if our idea doesn't work out maybe that's not what that's not what."
518.0,Patient,"was your walmart over the phone pretty much. That there's three of them in stark county is trying to get were right for older older friend works at one a little further down the road. And I tried to get into his but i'm not sure how that's going to go, what kind of shifting offer the one on closer and closer to me offered me. Multiple shifts and said I could go and go in and change my application to add more shift time to put a certain time down, he said was available my buddy."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
518.0,Patient,"And they're pretty desperate for help, so."
207.0,Provider,"Next, for help, I don't know if Amazon is desperate for help, but everybody else and all their higher like wow man they had like 36 openings."
518.0,Patient,At the one that's a new one in akron Ohio.
207.0,Provider,"So I was just looking like just go ahead and do that and then just kind of again. Again, I really highly recommend my exercises and listening, especially if it's if it affects your sleep um you know, listen to it to help you go to bed. And just use those as a lot of it is just restructuring so you're not focusing on the things ultimately that you have no control over. And it's getting rid of those negative thoughts and being able to identify, even when you're having negative thoughts, where are they coming from and where they're coming from the truth is, can you do anything about it. Are enzymes in our fears is always about the unknown. And if we knew everything right would we be in the position that we're in know life happens on its balance of adversity and and and it's like your your wins and losses. it's going to it's going to rain, is it a little bit of both. And so, with That being said, it's just looking at it from the place of. You know staying within the realm of the things you have control over. Okay, so I have to jump in a group right now so we'll i'll see you on Thursday in group and then also see you for your next appointment on the 22nd okay."
518.0,Patient,"Okay, thank your show."
207.0,Provider,"All right, no problem have a good one."
518.0,Patient,You too bye.
