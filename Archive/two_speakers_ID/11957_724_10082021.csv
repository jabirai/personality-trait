724.0,Provider,Where they hired you for full time and I cut your hours.
11957.0,Patient,Every week since I started working there so it's like 25 hours when we consider 40. So I got a phone call on one of my resume submissions from about three weeks ago and the guy told me he wanted me to come work for him writing content for social media. and doing bookkeeping. and personal assisting so I decided to quit the job that wasn't giving me enough hours and go with the job that is offering me the same amount of money for full time hours.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and when do you start that. Monday Monday okay well that's good. Oh."

11957.0,Patient,"yeah I am just like scared, though, because my mind is traveling down like what if this isn't really a real job when it fits another craigslist bullshit job that doesn't pan out to be anything."
724.0,Provider,"Well it's a reasonable concern and you've been burned in the past, so you know it's not like this hasn't happened before so you'll have more better understanding when you go there in person, have you tried like driving by the Home Office like doing any kind of like."
11957.0,Patient,"I was there. Okay, I was there today and I was. I interviewed with them in person and they still after interviewing me in person, they want me to come aboard and work for them so. But he was pretty adamant about he wanted me and my skills."

11957.0,Patient,I know right.
724.0,Provider,Now that'd be cool.
11957.0,Patient,"that's kind of what it's like it's like some. somebody like that, where he's got a primary business he needs help with, but he also has a secondary business he wants to get launch okay."
724.0,Provider,"Well, good good for you it'll be a new experience to give you an opportunity to try something different, and see if you like it if not you know what I mean like it's just one more thing you can add to your skill set right. Right, not a total. Working yeah yeah so money is better than nobody so. yeah that's good. um so what else is going on."

724.0,Provider,Okay well.
11957.0,Patient,"Only four years, four years ago by quick before they alternating."
724.0,Provider,What made you come to that conclusion.
11957.0,Patient,"When my son was sneaking behind his dad's back and communicating with me, he said things that were very upsetting to me and I didn't know how to respond and I just don't think they're old enough yet for to be around me being just me."
724.0,Provider,you're trying to be the the altruism in the family.
11957.0,Patient,I don't know what. That word means.
724.0,Provider,putting their needs above your own.
11957.0,Patient,yeah. that's what moms do. yeah.
724.0,Provider,Good moms will do that no.
11957.0,Patient,it's just everybody is breathing right now over my son to ask so amy time to heal from that.
724.0,Provider,yeah.
11957.0,Patient,"to eat, while we're talking."
724.0,Provider,"No, no, you are no you're totally fine um yeah there's no timeline for grief process and, like people will come to. You know the stages and the processing it like when they're ready, you know they can't be forced into it, it has to be like organic you know what I mean like people will will grieve in their own time, the wrong way. How are you doing with it."
11957.0,Patient,pretty good. i've learned. i've gotta go to the gym every day to stay happy. The anxiety is still mass. So I haven't been working out as much as I like to. And so i've been experiencing Depression and anxiety.
724.0,Provider,"So, how come you can't work out as much as you like to what's what's the roadblock."
11957.0,Patient,I don't want to get out of bed in the morning 530.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's a motivation thing, what about what about exercising at night after work, so you don't have to commit to your wake up schedule or impact your sleep schedule."
11957.0,Patient,Is the end of the day.
724.0,Provider,"mentally tired or physically tired. Both okay. Would you be more mentally tired physically tired, if you did it in the morning."
11957.0,Patient,"I wouldn't be mentally tired or physically tired if I did it in the morning, but my new job starts at nine. So I don't have to get up until 630 to go to the gym."
724.0,Provider,How close is the gym to your job.
11957.0,Patient,Far.
724.0,Provider,And there's nothing without the gym do you go to is it like a. ymca okay yeah so you can it's not like there's a bunch of ymca is around that you can bounce to like a.
11957.0,Patient,Sound bar brass.
724.0,Provider,"Is that's closer to your work right. Right, can you can you go to that wine, say, are you stuck with the one that's like the one that you're close to."
11957.0,Patient,Go to the one in Santa Barbara but do I know because when I leave Santa Barbara want to get out of Santa Barbara.
724.0,Provider,"Oh, but what about going into sandbar if that's what your new job is right."
11957.0,Patient,uh huh.
724.0,Provider,The way if you on your way to your are you're already in Santa Barbara so go before work. You know shower there that they have shower facilities there and then go straight to work after that.
11957.0,Patient,I think i'm gonna try this week getting up at 630 and going to the gym in the morning. cuz not 530.
724.0,Provider,"yeah now that would help. But exercise is important for overall like mental health and well being so is crappy as it is to like force yourself to wake up once you get into like it like a good routine and a pattern. You might not have as much difficulty waking up then find the motivation to go, because you will actually start to look forward to doing it. That or what's your schedule you work Monday through Friday, you have weekends off."
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"What if you did like what if you went to the gym like Friday Saturday Sunday. And then you worked Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and then worry about doing anything else."
11957.0,Patient,I have been doing that i've been working out on the weekends I don't always go to the gym sometimes I take it is like two or three mile hike.
724.0,Provider,Good looks good to.
11957.0,Patient,in lieu of going to the gym.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. Now, are you the type that needs to exercise every day of the week, or are you good with like a three to four times a week."
11957.0,Patient,I need to exercise every day.
724.0,Provider,"Every day okay. All right, um. it's it's dark by the time you get home so hiking after you get home from work is definitely out of the question."
11957.0,Patient,No.
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean you're probably going to play around with. It seems like the only option that you have is waking up early.
11957.0,Patient,630 is not that early.
724.0,Provider,"Well, it depends on what time you go to bed if you're getting like 78 hours of sleep and."
11957.0,Patient,Then I am always asleep by nine o'clock.
724.0,Provider,"Nine o'clock okay well yeah, then you should be all right that's nine hours right."
11957.0,Patient,I tried to get 10 hours of sleep a night.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. um yeah I mean it's tough waking up first thing in the morning and then going to the gym but once you're there you know you're committed."
11957.0,Patient,yeah. That seems the case.
724.0,Provider,yeah according to your. to your weekly surveys that I got here like you score pretty low for anxiety and depressed mood for the week so that's a plus.
11957.0,Patient,"yeah. Was that was last week, this week has been."
724.0,Provider,Have you done your surveys for this week. To.
11957.0,Patient,"This for this week, probably not."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeahs scored a two and a two it looks like.
11957.0,Patient,Oh.
724.0,Provider,Minimal minimal on both so.
11957.0,Patient,Well that's good.
724.0,Provider,Good good yeah that's really good how's the medication treating yeah any issues or concerns.
11957.0,Patient,I have diarrhea.
724.0,Provider,"With the medication. yeah Okay, have you talked to the prescriber about that."
11957.0,Patient,"Yes, and she did not respond."
724.0,Provider,When you talk to her.
11957.0,Patient,It was during group and I sent her a message. In private chat. That I have had loose stools ever since I got on the olanzapine and it's now like liquid. Good and i'm wondering if that's a side effect of that medication.
724.0,Provider,yeah chantelle would know.
11957.0,Patient,But she didn't respond.
724.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes when she's like in the group chat like she does a lot of her communication through there. And I would imagine that. Certain messages probably get lost because I lose messages when i'm trying to like privately chat with people and I got to like scroll down I can't imagine what her private chat box looks like she's she keeps that meeting open, like all day on Tuesday so. That should give you guys like the opportunity at the end of the group to stick around and talk to her. yeah yeah I would probably I would probably bring it up to her then."
11957.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, she in case again like a case she misses it in the chat that I would just catch her at the end because. I do two groups, a week with chantel that and that's only what she does she's six round with the last five or 10 minutes and we'll talk to patients like one on one you know or a little bit after the group if they need it so."
11957.0,Patient,Why can't I get into your group oh you wait you're a drug counselor. Correct yeah so it's not the right program for me.
724.0,Provider,Correct yeah. yeah. Sorry.
11957.0,Patient,I have a drug problem but you're gonna tell me it's psychiatric.
724.0,Provider,I mean they. They put you in here for face on yourself reporting for it so.
11957.0,Patient,My. Reporting for my drug habit.
724.0,Provider,or your self reporting a drug habit what's your drug of choice. marijuana okay and what's the issue with marijuana.
11957.0,Patient,I can't stop smoking.
724.0,Provider,How is it impacting your life in a negative way.
11957.0,Patient,It makes me anxious and then I make split second decisions that automatic level and I blah I self self distract.
724.0,Provider,"Well, I mean you, and I can talk about you know substance use you don't have to go to a group, a lot of the groups that we have or. You know opiate use disorders so they're all you know that's what they're all in there for they're not in there for like poly substance use are strictly opiate use so or medication assisted therapy because they're on opiates So those are the groups that I do. yeah but, but if you want to talk about you know secondary side effects from you know cannabis using it and. That is a common side effects does make people anxious, it does make people paranoid makes some people depressed so it really, really depends on you, you know what I mean in your chemistry and how you respond to the substance. it's not an uncommon side effect that I hear about with cannabis and makes people very introspective and sometimes they don't like having that conversation with themselves, and it makes them. You know excitable or anxious and manic and all those things, so I would advocate that you use less than what you're currently using if it's causing you, you know significant harm there's no. Real negative physical side effects when you start so like the withdrawal effects is you know, last two to three days you know you're. Maybe a headache maybe you're irritable but nothing life changing it's not like you're the day like enter program for like medically supervised detox or anything like that it's just. marijuana is what. The what happened."
11957.0,Patient,mormon irritant than anything.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you're just irritable you might have a headache it's similar to like it's like a caffeine detox like if you. If your body is dependent on caffeine like lots of people are where they if you drink a coffee every day for like six months you're pretty much. will have a chemical dependency on coffee or caffeine, and when when you don't have it for a day or so like you'll have headaches and you'll be irritable and a little foggy but nothing, nothing end of the world like you know. Alcohol benzo and you know methamphetamines sometimes and especially like like opiates like the withdrawal symptoms are like life altering. You know what I mean like you can't go to work you can't function in society, you can't keep commitments or anything like that you either need a medical intervention, where you have to go to a program and detox under the care of medical supervision or. or incarceration or something like that, but marijuana is not that's not one of the big one it's, not even in the top five most addictive substances in the world, no caffeine is or nicotine is number one caffeine is too. So."
11957.0,Patient,marijuana would be three for me.
724.0,Provider,"Now, though, in the in the Grand grand scheme of things marijuana doesn't even really rank is like most addictive habit forming yeah because it's like a physical routine attached to it so there's a habit to it but. As far as like chemical dependency being like your body can't function without it, it doesn't break no it's not that big of a deal."
11957.0,Patient,"Well, I saw Sophie and as much as I suppose he had during the day, while I was working. That all that plus."
724.0,Provider,The host. How do you feel.
11957.0,Patient,I feel more focused and less foggy.
724.0,Provider,"It is a cognitive, you know depressant you know the chemical of thc is not that have a stimulant it's not going to make you like. expand your your focusing abilities and kind of like narrows down and makes people mellow so it slows everything down so it's a depressant by many standards."
11957.0,Patient,So yeah i'm sorry my cat is attacking budge on the wall.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, a smart said it probably put their itself. cats or something else."
11957.0,Patient,"funny i'm sorry well outside of that medication, what else."
724.0,Provider,Any other issues with the meds that's been prescribed to you.
11957.0,Patient,Not that I know I. Am on a cocktail of beds.
724.0,Provider,"But really the. The gastro diarrhea stuff that's, the only thing that's really bothering you."
11957.0,Patient,yeah that's a good.
724.0,Provider,what's your. what's like your fiber intake like do you have like a healthy fiber intake or.
11957.0,Patient,I eat salad for lunch a yogurt for breakfast. And then I eat miscellaneous dinner like.
724.0,Provider,A miscellaneous dinner okay.
11957.0,Patient,"So tonight, I have a tamale and a little slice of lasagna."
724.0,Provider,Are you on like a like a calorie restricted diet or.
11957.0,Patient,"I was i'm taking. I am and how God for a few months now yeah because i'm taking medications that cause weight gain, so I have to watch everything like. Okay, but my weight is I mean Oh, I will be but i'm not that happy."
724.0,Provider,To have you notice any significant changes in your weight.
11957.0,Patient,No i've been managing it.
724.0,Provider,And maybe some of your energy level comes from having like a local like caloric diet.
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,that's probably not a good thing. But i'm not a dietitian so I don't really make too many.
11957.0,Patient,I feel more energy when I wake up in the morning and I exercise first thing.
724.0,Provider,"yeah for sure exercise is good, is crucial for energy it's it's almost counterproductive to what people think they're like oh i'm just gonna be tired after I work out and it's. it's not it's the complete opposite you feel refresh rate like reinvigorated you do have energy like it's a good thing if more people could exercise like before they start their day I think a lot of people's overall well being would be greatly improved. But it's hard work and we don't like doing hard work, sometimes."
11957.0,Patient,yeah it kind of hurts.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, there is yeah definitely what kind of what kind of work out so you focus on to do like Cardio."
11957.0,Patient,I do 20 minutes of cardio. And then I do strength training on machines.
724.0,Provider,"Without the gym you go to a point, are you already said that ymca so i'm trying to think of like the layout so it was like a like anytime fitness or planet fitness. because sometimes we'll have like those corporate level gins will have sections where it's like you can run a circuit and I have all the machines together that you could run like a full body circuit on like 20 minutes and planet fitness had a. Like a little room or a section of the rooms set off and there was, like all the machines and then I had like a red, yellow green stoplight. And it did all the timing for you, so you get on the machine and it would be like number it'd be like number one you get in the machine and you wait for the light go green. And you would just work out until the light turn like yellow and you'd slow down and it hit read, then you would get up go to the next machine, so you go to like machine to. wait for the go and then you would do, and then by the time you're done you're in an entire circle like 20 minutes full body workout good to go, you know go off. shower shave do all those things and then get to work it's like really like a really cool like like system that they had so people. weren't like super serious about like working out or didn't really understand, like the concept of mechanics, and so I could literally go there. and have all the work done for them and then just go about their day it was really cool it was really cool it's like having a personal like a. Like a fitness gym instructor except you would just get on the machine and do it is cool but I don't know about the ymca has anything like that."
11957.0,Patient,yeah it's kind of like that.
724.0,Provider,there's a.
11957.0,Patient,there's a real for Cardio machines and then there's a circuit room me that I go to. And it's a full body workout yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, good so you're doing good."
11957.0,Patient,"So I follow the circuit along, so I so it takes me about 40 minutes to work out I do the spinning, and then I do the circuit for 20 minutes."
724.0,Provider,yeah and you feel good when you're done right so. that's worth it. It was closer to be more convenient that we didn't have to wake up super early but.
11957.0,Patient,"For the time well, I have to wake up super early because I have to go to work and there's traffic."
724.0,Provider,"yeah oh yeah there's that too. um so what else, what else any upcoming doctor's appointments or anything like that."
11957.0,Patient,chantelle says she doesn't need to see me.
724.0,Provider,Okay. And what do you think.
11957.0,Patient,I think i'm doing really good on my bed I think my grief therapy classes are been really helpful. To ideas on how to manage anxiety and depression.
724.0,Provider,And what are some of the some of the techniques that you've learned so far.
11957.0,Patient,breathing. praying. breathing some more.
724.0,Provider,yeah mindfulness.
11957.0,Patient,Being aware of my negative thoughts and helping my self to turn those around.
724.0,Provider,"So reframing. Those are all good things and they're all standard practices, and if you get really good at that you can manage like a lot of. A lot of feelings, as they come on and address them early instead of listening to or allowing them to settle in and pro long. So yeah they're all good strategies breathing is like ironically look more like more easier things to do is like close your eyes and take 30 seconds do some deep breath through your nose and you know lightly push out of your mouth. That really sells people down it's like like what are they calling diabetic training or. tricking the brain a little bit like like resting like sit up straight, will you shoulders back kind of like allow your lungs to expand. Really really healthy for you it's almost like a version of like kundalini yoga."
11957.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,So it's good i'm.
11957.0,Patient,"I booked a full hour with you, but you get a lot done 30 minutes."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I never liked like the hours, the hours, whatever I don't i'm not. i'm not restricted to timeframe, so, if I can get everything that that needs to be done that's productive and we can do that in 15 minutes or if we do in 45 minutes. Like I just had a conversation with my last patient, where it was like I don't I don't like being told. When I was in college like I had to write a paper like 20 pages long it's like i'm not going to do that I don't like to operate within windows, because then I have to drag it out and come up with fluff that's not what i'm about so. You know, sometimes of meeting that scheduled for. goes way past that because we're dealing with a lot of stuff and sometimes we're not so like i'm not going to just sit here and. entertained, for you know for 45 minutes because that's what we have to do that's not entirely accurate so therapy is like how you get it, and if you get too much of it at once. you're going to forget shit you know it's like reading a book like you can read a book in a single setting. But you're going to remember the beginning and the ending of the book and you're not going to remember anything in the middle, because you spent. So much time on it you're excited when you start it and you're excited because you're almost done. And you've attached like these emotional values to it, and then you forget everything in the middle so what's the point you know. Short spurts you get a lot of stuff done you're you remember the beginning the middle and the end you're good to go, you know so that's that's where I operate from, and I think I booked This, I think I put this in for 60 minutes I could do whatever I want. it's really that that's kind of like what it falls down, for you know if you if you getting stuff out of it and you're getting stuff out sometimes it's it's like pulling teeth with certain people you don't have to do that so."
11957.0,Patient,"Well i've been shooting group say my work kept producing my hours, and I was concerned about having to move and shot not shontelle but Sean told me Oh, you have to find another place to live, but you know how hard housing is defined right now."
724.0,Provider,"really hard, probably the hardest it's been a long time because one. One politically. Most people who have been unemployed during this whole epidemic. have been getting paid very well and not having to pay their rent right. uh huh they're supposed to have been getting paid to save money, so they could pay their rent because that that rent bill is going to come do at some point. But because the government keeps extending the moratorium on eviction a lot of people are like oh shit I don't have to pay rent yet. But when I do i'm screwed and then there's going to be a bunch of houses open, but right now. Right now, people are settled like that nobody's looking for new apartments because they don't have to they're not being evicted they don't have to pay. Why would you want to leave you know what I mean like people that have been affected by coven we've all been affected by coven now, at this point. You know what I mean like employers like they don't hire either not keeping up with their hours like. People aren't going out buying shit anymore it's like of course we're all have been affected by it, so people just they're not leaving so there's no there's nowhere to read. But here, pretty soon with that moratorium if it ever gets lifted yeah there's gonna be tons of places and read it probably for pretty cheap too so just hold out hold out because that's what everybody else is doing for the time being."
11957.0,Patient,well. I just have to. This new jobs is supposed to pay enough to cover the bills So hopefully it works out. yeah very hopeful on that.
724.0,Provider,"If not you should always be looking for like another thing like never settle. Never settle on a job, especially a job because there might be something else out there, that you missed or overlooked, but now you're comfortable. You are going to have a stream of income coming in, so it's cool but. I would always look for something else, just to have a backup plan, just in case this thing turns out to be that we should thought it was going to be. And then you decide to leave on an impulse or whatever it is, or you give a two week notice and then you leave well, you could have been researching other job opportunities and even applying to other job opportunities. that's what I would do if I if I started the job, and I was like. i'm not too sure about this i'd immediately start looking for another job yep immediately so."
11957.0,Patient,that's a.
724.0,Provider,"Recommendation see what else is out there, but in the meantime continue getting up going to work because you're going to get paid, but you also have the luxury of looking for all the things that might pay more or be better suited for you out there. Right you're not desperate for a job, right now, because you got one, but you might be slightly desperate for a better job so. yeah and the housing thing you know just play the housing thing by air, like nobody knows what's going on with housing, right now, although that it's nearly impossible to find, especially in California.
