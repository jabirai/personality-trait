11953.0,Patient,yeah and OCD ADHD and all of it.
207.0,Provider,"yeah. So, in terms of looking at. Now, is it is something that. A lot of. Which struggle with learning how to. manage. invited. And we struggle with managing our image variety, because often times there's so many different things that we engage in. On aware of how much it increases our anxiety or reminds us of your house or specific events and things of the past and we have a hard time managing our present day, is it because we don't necessarily know how to. We don't know how to differentiate what's really going on right now in the current moment because it's reminding me of a negative events of the past, and right now, whatever is going on and so we're reacting to the event in a son of us. What what's really fueling is our Pack. yeah and not necessarily how to cope with that so. You work a lot with your your outside counsel your anxiety."
11953.0,Patient,anxiety like past and ptsd.
207.0,Provider,"Would you say that you've in the years and, in the time that you've been in counseling or engaging in counseling these sign that you've made a lot of progress towards learning how to manage it and or identify the triggers."
11953.0,Patient,"yeah yep I feel like i've learned to live a lot of progress. But there's always room for improvement, so."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm and now. One of the things that I like to do and I when he comes on to you know everything I say you know you if you need to take medication, by all means I don't know inbound numbers medication."
11953.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,"But at the same time, because if it helps to help. But at the same time, the question is. When managing different things in our lives, whether it be related to our past or. Something current for like the ptsd to trauma and. In a moment to bring us some sense of. calm, what is the first thing that you reach for is it learning how to implement the skills taught over the years, or we reach for. The medication this chemical. entity to help to decrease what's going on within."
11953.0,Patient,"Oh yeah it's it's a society it's good civilizations and suicide suicidal issues that medications have made a gigantic difference i've been there. And being i've been in treatment for almost four years now. it's been a long so it's been. a long, long time."
207.0,Provider,"So for you, where you are today and with all the improvements that you have made and i'm like you said there's always room for improvement for you, what is a current area presently that you think can be improved, that you feel kind of. So much trouble with."
11953.0,Patient,"there's right now there's a lot of room for improvement, with my ptsd when it comes to. My family abuse like that it's it's it's really bad right now."
207.0,Provider,And what specifically right now for you anyway that's making it back.
11953.0,Patient,"nightmares at night to it makes David sweat and a couple of times I woke up crying over it, and it has to do with my mother. Just my mom."
207.0,Provider,and Your mom is still living right.
11953.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes."
207.0,Provider,"and You said all of it is what's your mother what is something that's going on with your mother, right now, because when we think about nightmares. And we live in reliving the trauma or you're having visible. anxiety or, however, that is index is transferred into the vivid dreams that you're having it all attached mom what is the current relationship or communication level of communication, you have with your mom right now."
11953.0,Patient,"I eliminated her out of my life months ago, because it was bad it was really bad and thankfully it has improved, but. it's also gotten worse, at the same time I don't know how to explain it."
207.0,Provider,"So I, and I want you to think about it for a moment, because. We think about things on a larger scale in comparison to being able to heal things back taking our time to peel it back like a banana. Okay, this is the manner. But how does a monkey often a banana from the rebels, though the bottom part I have no qualms so try and figure it out without destroying the top of it, so I have to really think about how to do that, so I want you to do that for me if you've eliminated her out of your life. The last couple of months you suck all communication and everything, how is it that you're still having. A reaction or emotional reaction. to her and the reminder of your path, if you have when you say month how long has it been six months seven months two months."
11953.0,Patient,This July.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so since July, and what front in July, what made you decide to pay lady among."
11953.0,Patient,"My sister's actually told me my mom tried to put me up for adoption, when I was 15."
207.0,Provider,And why did you do that.
11953.0,Patient,Right probably like the day before I cut her out.
207.0,Provider,And what was the need for your sister to tell you that.
11953.0,Patient,They didn't want to tell me but. They they already knew I was traveling with my mom and it was on and off on and off and. They told me that she tried and it would have worked if it wasn't for my dad.
207.0,Provider,"But okay so let's again let's try to unpack that inflammation. You what is i'm still trying to understand, so you are 28 right and in July. Right this year in July is when you. Cut your mama. Can you hear me."
11953.0,Patient,Well i'm sorry but you're you're cut out for like five seconds.
207.0,Provider,Okay now i'm saying this past July.
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So July August September, October November November so about three months because we're on day two of November so pre month. what was going on in July around about that time, why, after 28 years your sister felt the need to share that with you, what was the relevant with her meeting to share that with you."
11953.0,Patient,"I think it was the part where she can hold a secret anymore, because they didn't tell me. I don't know what made her you know. think that she needs to tell me, but I was already struggling with the relationship between me and her anyway, so I but they're. My two sisters, they are eliminated her like kind of like a two years ago, because of who she is and it took me a long, long, long time from B2C it and I think my sisters had to tell me that for me to see it to see what's actually happening with WHO she actually is, and when I found out. I didn't know what to think I was bows pissed I was hurt. So, at that point i'm done."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so your sister your two sisters talking to your mom they corrupt long time ago Okay, so all three of you have this very toxic relationship or just this conflict with your mom that she she was an equal opportunity it sounds like how she treated all of them back."
11953.0,Patient,"yeah Well, yes, especially me my older sisters, just because we're gay I don't know if that's a coincidence or not, but. that's that's how it was grown up."
207.0,Provider,When when when they both have you told them that you were doing.
11953.0,Patient,um I think my mom found out by herself with my older sister I came out to my mom when I was. 1415.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and how old was your sister."
11953.0,Patient,My at when I came out.
207.0,Provider,know when your when your sister.
11953.0,Patient,She was in 10th grade so that'd be.
207.0,Provider,"Great so depending on the month if she was born, she was probably."
11953.0,Patient,When she when she. came out. It wasn't it was sometime in high school.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, but was the abuse their prior to both of you. Yes, okay so being gay only added to it, it did. Thanks, so this is why i'm saying we're peeling it back like my like a banana because we got to get to the floor. And being gay in a her awareness of it didn't start oh my God my kids are gay Now let me treat them bad know all of that started prior now you just you added one more thing or one more reason for her to do what she did you added a reason that's all you did um. How far back, can you all of you remember that your mom wasn't very motherly loving. And motherly."
11953.0,Patient,"So, like I said it took me a long time for me to fully see it like this is suspected for. Through my teenage years too, but. Probably things started going down to 2005."
207.0,Provider,He started going you're the only son right.
11953.0,Patient,Yes.
207.0,Provider,"They think about a mom full to think about a son for mom. mommy is my. mommy is my girl mommy can do no wrong. And they crave and I desire that relationship with money, unfortunately, the one that I have. Have hurt me time and time and time again, and no matter how much I forgive her, no matter how much I make excuses for her, no matter how much I see past it. I still desire, this relationship with mom my girl my heart my everything I desire, this relationship so you've got to a place in your life, where you say. No, no, no. Like i'm doing too much and she's still the same so when you became aware of it, when you reflect back, would you say that mom was not very loving or. affectionate and tender to you from when you were in the single digit."
11953.0,Patient,"Yes, she doesn't really know how to express emotions so she's a very, very narcissistic person."
207.0,Provider,"And we talked about you believe your mom, you said that you don't really know your your. Your pan, I mean your grandparents right."
11953.0,Patient,My dad's parents I don't know them. Because my dad's dad passed five has been born my dad's mom password was three. My mom's mom is still alive and my mom's dad just passed away.
207.0,Provider,Would you say your grandmother was a nice person.
11953.0,Patient,My mom does yeah.
207.0,Provider,You know your your grandmother.
11953.0,Patient,No actually she's. she's more more a lot more affectionate and my mom is.
207.0,Provider,What about your grandfather.
11953.0,Patient,"What the same my grandma grandpa was the same she was, but he was more kind of. Independent and kind of just quiet. kind of like listening, the background that kind of guy."
207.0,Provider,"The mother into her own of you. she's here has her own her own from and all of that, and throughout the year, not really knowing how to. work through all of her own emotional and mental trauma here, it is that she wishes, she had children and not knowing you know listen as children you you, you know your parents. Your parents together what mom sustained from that or what mom put that through or whatever that situation is. It could either have enhanced a lot of that or it could have decreased, a lot of that and so your mom has her own river that runs deep. But again, whether or not she worked through any of it or thought any help to all of that it's not necessarily the conversation and topic of today what it is, is how she. took out possibly a lot of her trauma and her own ptsd or her own mental emotional physical whatever abuse that she had sustained at some point in her life. or had experienced at the hand of other people, she took a lot of that out on her children because of having a meeting or craving some level of control over someone else other than whoever maintain that control over her, and so you as her only son. thought out this love and affection from mom and wanting to be embraced and i'm sure your sisters as well. And not knowing how to give it and how she did and creating what ultimately happened to each of you individually and you're still sorting all of that out. And so, here it is what i'm hearing is that your sister having their own. Individual life because all three of you have your own individualized feelings and emotions and thoughts when it comes on the mom. or your own disappointments and anger and whatever it is towards mom though it may cross, there are some things that may be very familiar in similar across the three of you. But each of you have your own issues with month right there are females in your mail and so each of you need your own attach issues so there's attachment issues there is all kinds of different things that you struggle with and so. When your mom tried to. Adopt you out at 15. She was not successful and. Maybe it's something that. You kind of put in the back of your mind, maybe you kind of popped it in the back of your mind, so to say, well, you don't remember that maybe that's just something that you push the way back and you try to forget it. But this is the thing i'm just curious as to. Why did your sister feel like missing one more secret that we needed to tell you like, how is that going to. What is that going to do is that just going to deepen your distaste for mom is that just wants to solidify the reason why you need to cut her off because then, at that point, and then that's them controlling how they feel for you. or that's them dictating and manipulating hey, this is the reason why we cut her off this is the reason why you should cut her off because remember she tried to do this for you and remember she also did this for you. So even if there is a little whim of you trying to have a little relationship, oh no come back here my friend, let me tell you what else she did and i'm trying to understand their. Their thought process in making you aware of. Am I going in and out so. Because it's not anything on my end no i'm saying i'm trying to understand your sisters thought process on them, making you aware of certain things, because you being aware of certain things, what does that do for your ptsd when you really think about."
11953.0,Patient,It hurts it.
207.0,Provider,"yeah i'm sorry about that. So. What i'm saying to you here, it is by this little piece of knowledge and the more information that affects you. What do you think is best for you. When you talk about your anxiety or ptsd, what do you think that that's for you."
11953.0,Patient,"It made it worse, but also answered. The. Questions I can't put into words. I I look at it, as they helped me out they helped me figure it out, they they helped me put the puzzle all together. Because our relationship has been in and out for years and it's been messy and then good and bad and good and bad, but. They helped me out because they they saw was struggling with it so that's I think for it."
207.0,Provider,So it put the puzzle together for you in what manner.
11953.0,Patient,"helped me to move on. It does. But it helps me to move on. i'm not to deal with this with her taxes, taxes anymore."
207.0,Provider,Did you want to is there still a part of you that still want a relationship with.
11953.0,Patient,relationship with a mother just not her.
207.0,Provider,Is your apartment number still alive.
11953.0,Patient,away.
207.0,Provider,You have a partner right you live with her.
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,His his his.
11953.0,Patient,His mom 2015.
207.0,Provider,Did you have a good relationship with her.
11953.0,Patient,I didn't know her at the time. I didn't know hey let's time either.
207.0,Provider,"Okay. So, at the end of the day. it's not so much really that you really because sometimes we presented itself to say that you want a relationship with a mother. A mother figure the truth of the matter is the little boy within you that man, the little boy within you, you still want a relationship with the mother that was given to me. And the truth of the matter is. No more information, your sister shares with you about the past, honestly, it just traumatizes it hurts that little boy in you that still is crying out for our relationship with the narcissistic mother. That he has. So it's not a mother, because, even if your partner's mother was still alive today and she was the best mother ever that ever existed on earth there's still that part of you that little boy with you is still going to your and still. want the relationship with the mother. But it's coming to a place. of understanding her where she is today can you change them up."
11953.0,Patient,"No, I can't fortunately."
207.0,Provider,This is there things about your system that you don't like or you don't care for.
11953.0,Patient,Well yeah I mean we're all nervous perfect we all.
207.0,Provider,"know we ain't perfect and that's the question, so the question is there things about your sisters that you don't. work with them."
11953.0,Patient,I did grow up on the a lot of properties.
207.0,Provider,And you have a voice that issues. The personal issues you've had and How have they changed any of you. Have any of those issues that you have with them.
11953.0,Patient,"yeah we've we've all improved as a person growing up. For up dollars learn, you know how life is you know we heard. That kind of thing."
207.0,Provider,And you all decided to take each other as you. can see each other for who you guys are.
11953.0,Patient,yeah we actually became closer because of my mom.
207.0,Provider,But it seems like you guys became closer because of your mom because you share a bearish all three of you share a very strong dislike.
11953.0,Patient,of my mom. yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Listen you all share a very strong this slide but i'm curious if you were supposed to come apart and say you know what I know she. I know she possibly can, I know she all. i'm going to work on, instead of being angry at her all the time and reflecting on all the toxic things that she's done i'm going to work on forgiving. because she probably went through her own from it and her own of us, and all of that i'm going to work on forgiving her and releasing her all those things and i'm going to work on, you know just accepting her for who she is. Limiting my interaction, I am curious with your sister still be as close to you as they are, and will they still or will they eliminate how much negative inflammation of the past. That they've experienced will they still do that."
11953.0,Patient,"yeah. Yes to 100% sure that, even if this mom thing was an issue, the three of us would still be close because, as we get older we became closer."
207.0,Provider,"But would they. refrain from sharing all these negative things with you or reminding you of these negative things, or would they be supportive of hey Jeffrey if you if you want to have a relationship with mom. I would say, be careful what you engage in with her."
11953.0,Patient,that's actually. that's actually what they said to me.
207.0,Provider,"And if they say, and this is the thing. Jeffrey the little boy Jeffrey. Once a relationship with mom. And you're fighting and so you're you're having these vivid nightmares indeed a reminder of the trauma because there's I believe that there's a part of me that still fighting between the memory of the past and maybe the desire and the need to want to forget to have a relationship. hold on. Can you hear me."
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So. I think the battle between the two. quick. Apparently, they are really quick to but. Have you ever tried. for giving her."
11953.0,Patient,I did several times.
207.0,Provider,where you are trying to get.
11953.0,Patient,"past. How. It wasn't just the adoption part it we all felt a lot of abandonment. Because emotionally she wasn't there for us when we needed something she. I don't think she had the capability to help when it comes, you know friendship issues or issues between the other sisters like she she still to this day cannot express emotions I don't know why because she just she wasn't there."
207.0,Provider,"For a moment she can't express emotion, we don't know why. Familiar lady she can."
11953.0,Patient,"I think I saw I found this out like a year or two ago I remember when. My grandpa worked a lot and I found out my mom and her sister with their twins they had issues with that they missed him a lot I, I think. Her abandonment issues carried on to her being a parent and then having us do what that just going a different way."
207.0,Provider,"she's in her mind she's convinced yourself we figured it out we've got to do. not known to. be the same, I have to toughen up and I have to do you think about her error in comparison to your because, how does your mom in."
11953.0,Patient,62.
207.0,Provider,"You think about when she was growing up. Years ago, and how life was. And how they when they were taught how mental illness or abandonment or."
11953.0,Patient,"Oh, now I can hear you."
207.0,Provider,OK.
11953.0,Patient,I can hear you yep.
207.0,Provider,But. No longer. Okay.
11953.0,Patient,yep.
207.0,Provider,Okay yeah. So you think about for a moment all that she's endured what else outside of the abandonment issues abandonment issues you can you what else can you identify within your mom. Think about the things that you and your sister struggle with. The abandonment issues also think about she also came with a from an error that homosexuality wasn't something that was really accepted.
11953.0,Patient,yep.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so before we get to the homosexuality piece let's identify because listen your mama had issues, long before you're told her or she recognized that you you're gay right that was just the added thing that came on later on. Right now issue started long before."
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"You knew that you did, today you knew that you like somebody because you're in the 70s, saying you knew the difference between ooh I like a boy or girl said, all the issues came along, after. Yes, so. What else can you say that you've identified was in your mom in terms of her struggles."
11953.0,Patient,"i've just been wondering why she can't express emotions, because when her own father passed at the funeral she did not shed a single tier. He did not act like anything happened, but everyone else even her own transistor cried and expressed heal the loss, the feeling of loss, but my mom acted like everything was just fine."
207.0,Provider,"Does your mom ever in your any type of sexual abuse, you know. physical or sexual."
11953.0,Patient,"abuse, not that I know I don't think so."
207.0,Provider,"No, I didn't ask I was asking you, if on. Was she ever. Do you know her experience in any form of abuse whatsoever."
11953.0,Patient,"No, as far as far as I know, it's just the. abandonment."
207.0,Provider,"What is the relationship, did you have a relationship with her twin sister you're on."
11953.0,Patient,"Data was on and off, but it wasn't. Like Oh, it was when my mom. Is I don't know if, as in like just. she's she's worse worse than my mom so I really couldn't. click."
207.0,Provider,she's worse than your mom.
11953.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely yes."
207.0,Provider,Okay there's things of their past that y'all just don't know. And they just don't share their things of their past that charges don't know.
11953.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah I know.
207.0,Provider,And to understand your mom to get a full understanding of your mom in why she is the way she is it is. Having a better understanding of their past did they have a brother.
11953.0,Patient,They do have a brother yes he's the oldest one I think he's like in his mid 60s.
207.0,Provider,To have a relationship with him at all.
11953.0,Patient,"No, I I barely see him i've probably seen i've seen them less than 10 times white their life."
207.0,Provider,"And so, with you, barely. And you think about not really. Think about a person who doesn't have any real relationship with their parents, whether their parents or their siblings or anywhere they shield them from their own upbringing. there's a lot of uncover so the understanding of what is my mom not having feelings why didn't she shed a tear. When her father passed away, why does she treat us why, when she looked at us, she never embraced what what happened there's a lot to uncover there before did you have a good relationship with your dad."
11953.0,Patient,"i'm growing up, no because he was physically and mentally abusive to all three of us, but. Probably. In my early 20s like 2021 I started to finally have a relationship with them things kind of just we made peace with everything and then. few years later he he passes away so we didn't we didn't have a lot of time to have a relationship."
207.0,Provider,"So why do you hold so much more. resentful if that's the word. towards your mom, why does all three of you hold more resent towards mom than you did that his dad was more mentally and physically abusive."
11953.0,Patient,"She has not once admitted to anything that she's done well, my dad did."
207.0,Provider,"So the healing began with your dad because he at least admitted to it. So it's not that you guys hold any resentment it's not that you didn't hold any resentment, it says that he admitted. To his thing."
11953.0,Patient,"He had to do a lot of English, she was like work controlled he didn't do a good job of controlling them and. He was a lot of too stressed out with his job, but he said that was no excuse yes i'm sorry so that that meant a lot."
207.0,Provider,"To you, it was your data abusive."
11953.0,Patient,I think so yeah from what I remember all of us yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So he wasn't just physically and emotionally abusive to all three of you, but he also was with my."
11953.0,Patient,"Oh just just emotionally it's my mom physically, it was mainly me, for some reason."
207.0,Provider,it's your dad.
11953.0,Patient,"yeah I was the main target my other two sisters, not so much, but my mom was emotionally abused by him."
207.0,Provider,And um. Did with that did it intensified more after you came out or was a lot of that. Their prior to. Do coming out.
11953.0,Patient,My dad completely.
207.0,Provider,Completely were.
11953.0,Patient,approved he proved of it.
207.0,Provider,"But you said he targeted you more, even though he approved When did the abuse when it when it comes on to you feeling targeted when did that start before."
11953.0,Patient,"When I was a probably a top there a continued on the elementary school but. But then my parents divorced, and we didn't seem so much, so it. It kind of not ended there but wasn't happening as much."
207.0,Provider,"So what i'm hearing is that for you, you just need your mom to admit it, so you can start the healing you need her. yeah there's a part that you just need her to apologize. yeah it isn't a wipe away what happened is just that you want her to apologize and you're holding on to the hope that one day she will apologize."
11953.0,Patient,yeah actually. yeah I can see that I can feel it.
207.0,Provider,"Did that's exactly what you're saying, because you're saying that your dad did justice was just as bad, but he just admitted and he apologized and he owned to his stuff."
11953.0,Patient,"yeah so it helped a lot, but actually we actually get into relationships so yeah it's just. A minute here, and she won't."
207.0,Provider,She denies the whole thing.
11953.0,Patient,"yep she denies every everything she's done. Who she is she thinks she's just such a great person, a great mom but all three of her kids want nothing to do with her and she doesn't see that she doesn't see. You know the connection like she's she's not wondering why she's just actually the victim like we all just stopped her from no reason. Like she."
207.0,Provider,"Is she is she is a she is a victim in her own right when it comes on to her parents. She is a victim. Just like how you guys are a victim when it comes on to her so she is a victim and she has not moved outside of that victim role. Okay, it has not moved outside of that victim role so even though hey i'm a victim. So truth be told, in her mind y'all did something to her. My parents and my family did something to me my husband turned around and did it to you and all three in her mind also it's three kids that she has with your dad right. Yes, all three of y'all are ungrateful because I did everything I could, in her money. And how do you want me to admit to anything when I didn't do anything. Because i'm still stuck in a victim mentality and she doesn't see how because she stayed in such in this cocoon of victimization because she's lived there for so long, she cannot see or conceptualize how any of her actions brought harm to you guys."
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,Has your mom ever said to any of you guys that you're ungrateful.
11953.0,Patient,"Not those words but she said, I have done everything for you guys I raise you guys I you know, basically, the whole I gave birth to I fed you follow the law but."
207.0,Provider,And where's the things I get instead you're cutting me off.
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"She has not come out of that victim role. she's she's still stuck on. The child within her that's crying out for love and attention and affection and security, safety. she's still crying out for that. her body grew. But she's still there, so she said, based on what you're saying sounds like she never came out of it."
11953.0,Patient,"that'd be why she didn't even show it here at that you know. angry at him, and she just doesn't know it."
207.0,Provider,"Which means she knows, she knows she's. she's she. angry probably even the world. But I would have I would have been curious to understand the dynamic between her and her dad. or even if her dad didn't do anything could it be that her dad was aware of whatever was going on with him and he did nothing to protect them. Was he very belittling. Was he mentally abusive or maybe her mom was and he conducted or. Something is there. You think about naturally. Do you have nieces or nephews."
11953.0,Patient,He was alive all my life he's been good.
207.0,Provider,Do you have a niece or nephew.
11953.0,Patient,Have. One that one sorry one Nice.
207.0,Provider,And were you involved with your nice from your niece was from infancy of until how the journey section is.
11953.0,Patient,Only three.
207.0,Provider,"Good. Perfect have you been involved with her from three up until I mean from birth, up until now yeah he knows."
11953.0,Patient,He acknowledges that we're going yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, I want you to think about this innocent little soul that has entered this world. And when this little innocent so looks at you, and they hug you and they squeeze you and they kiss you and they they do all these just things that just melts in warms your heart. You think about this, three year old that grows up to be cold and angry and disconnected from the world where did that come from."
11953.0,Patient,Her grandmother.
207.0,Provider,"No, no i'm not talking no think about think about what I just said to you. This cute little innocent just child that you just want to eat up and you just can't have enough of because they come out just this innocent. ball of love and affection and they should and it's all innocent right it's all innocent because they're naturally doing what they do as kids and as they're growing up, and as they're getting older. They she just has a lot of anger and and just bitterness and resentment towards, whether it be mom or dad or anybody, where do you think any of that will would have come from where would that has come from from this sweet little innocent shot where was that conference. And why would that have come from her mother, what would mom or dad have done to produce this in this child."
11953.0,Patient,So that happened with us.
207.0,Provider,"So mom has to be aware of what she shows in what she inflict so mom has to be consciously aware. that she is not imparting her own trauma on to this child. because she. can be inflicted. Think about it, I have my own trauma, I have my own ptsd I have my own thing and because it's unresolved or and I don't i'm not working through it. Now I inflicted on Sunday, I pass it down to my child my child experience diddly squat of what I went through, but I have just passed it down because I don't know how else to deal with my anger and my frustration. I don't know how to be embracing to my child I don't know how to love and tell her that she's beautiful and that she's going to be grew up to be a strong I don't know how to do that, so how do I do I."
11953.0,Patient,Like my mom for some reason.
207.0,Provider,i'm sure because mom probably look at her like the Scrooge that circle coarseness. You think.
11953.0,Patient,"She has actually said. My niece as a second chance. Literally. told us, he is her second chance."
207.0,Provider,Why do you think she thinks she's just she's her second chance.
11953.0,Patient,"Probably because she messed up as a parent because of how you know, like you said ungrateful we are like. there's so much that puzzle that."
207.0,Provider,"I was her second chance. And every um. it's interesting because grandparents do this, and the reason why it's their second chance because in their own way they're admitting that they failed. As a parent. Let me ask you a question, how is she with her does she see her grandchild."
11953.0,Patient,Quite a few times but. Almost every time my mom goes to pick her up she cries.
207.0,Provider,"But even if she picks her, she cries what it, how do you see your mom responding to her. Like."
11953.0,Patient,Being a victim. in some way. She even said her feelings were upset because. My mom picks her up because she's pretty much either offended or upset by it.
207.0,Provider,You say your mom was offended or upset by.
11953.0,Patient,My mom did. did say she was her. will hurt because my niece cries when I my picks her up. I don't know if that sounds like she's acting like a victim or. Hello.
207.0,Provider,she feels rejected.
11953.0,Patient,"Yes, yep."
207.0,Provider,rejections reject she feels rejected. rejected by her. she feels rejected.
11953.0,Patient,yeah and it's just her. Like my sister. Everything needs she's she's I think she's gonna be homeschooled like my sister is great.
207.0,Provider,"Has your mom ever had counseling in the past. Through your years of. going through therapy for yourself have you ever. or it's ever been suggested, through you, as you work on your own healing or has it been suggested on working on forgiving us."
11953.0,Patient,"Have forgiven me. For my own benefit, I have forgiven her."
207.0,Provider,Have you ever wrote written a letter to her expressing how you felt and just.
11953.0,Patient,"long time ago I wrote an email but. I don't remember what I said, but I did express how I felt. A lot I don't know if it was a forgiveness butter, I think it was more like a. telling you I feel letter."
207.0,Provider,"Ultimately, in a given us letter you're saying how you feel but you're saying like hey you know, but I forgive you. I forgive. Because, because this is the truth forgiveness ultimately it's not for the individual right for you."
11953.0,Patient,or yep exactly.
207.0,Provider,"it's for you it's for you to release and let go and for you to move on freely mentally and emotionally that's what forgiveness, is for it's not for the individual. Even though, like there's a part of you that says that you're seeking for her to admit and for her to come back and say you know hey, I am sorry. we're we have created in our head sometimes you know, maybe then i'll try to let her in or and we create in our heads that if she does this then i'll really respond to it, but sometimes. We are, we are, we are putting an expectation of what we want them to do so that I can now breathe I can't breathe again. And then, when it doesn't happen that way then we're devastated. I remember, I was remember sharing this in one of my groups, as we were talking about forgiveness and sometimes expectation, we put on other people. I remember one time um you know, saying that I was going to address some issues with my mom and I listen I created the whole scenario in my head. I created the whole scenario and I had an outcome in my head honestly I had an outcome in my head and so with all my infinite wisdom and everything within me and I. I said what I said. To my mother and I was hoping that we would have had this really open conversation, and she would share with me because I figured you're old enough now let me come on lady, you need to pretty much come to terms with some of the things you've done right. But I was not ready for Jeffrey. was her response. I did not prepare myself at all I wasn't open to any response I was pretty close to what I expected because I created my own expectation right. Right and with all my infinite wisdom, you know it's dog on lady told me. Woman told me get over it."
11953.0,Patient,"Do you think I was a chance, but we're not applying the word."
207.0,Provider,I was very I was very crushed. I was crying here.
11953.0,Patient,I just wouldn't build put it into words how I how I would feel how but even.
207.0,Provider,"Then it was in that moment that I recognize. Just like your mom. She didn't know how to express any emotions she didn't know how to just like you might she didn't know how to do any of that. She was she's not a very affectionate person she is all of the things that I wanted and how I because I didn't grow up with her, for the most part. And she didn't know how to do any of that, and it was when I allowed myself to begin to understand life from her perspective and take her as she came and not hold on to a lot of details of the past. and keep reminding myself of it, it was when I open I allowed myself to be open to understand her. And it is where that I understood. I don't know how to express my emotions and my feelings, because I never received it growing up. All that I was expecting and I needed from her, she had no clue how to do it, and do you know she I don't I don't know it was one of her moments of truth and she said I don't know how to do it. And it was when I opened myself to hear her say that she didn't know how to do it is when I started recognizing none of her siblings knew how to do it. And the same issues I had all of my cousins had them. That need that desire for that affection and that embracing and all of that, the emotional abandonment, we all had it, because if they had it. I don't know my grandmother she died long before I was more. I have a very limited memory of my grandfather, but I knew him I don't remember any relationship with him because I wasn't really around, but as I got older I opened myself up to really understand their dynamics. And so, for me, as a parent myself, just like when I use the example with your niece and your sister it's me having to learn to be intentional that I didn't pass down that same emotional abandonment to my children. Because, then all i'm doing is passing down my own trauma like she did to meet my her emotional trauma and all I would do is pass it down to my children. So the trauma that they would have experienced would have been one that I took my own trauma and pass it down to them. And then it would have been coming to rick generation and generation and we try to understand where did all of this, come from. It doesn't excuse go ahead."
11953.0,Patient,"i'm sorry her brother. isn't isn't like that, with his with his kids hit all of his kids have a great relationship with him."
207.0,Provider,"it's the intentionality you have to be fully aware and intentional, that I am not going to do. So let's say if one day you decide that you want to kit and you have a child. I never gotten loved I was never told that i'm going to be this and all of that, and so you have to be intentional about ensuring that you're going to do to your children what you'll never have. And you make damn sure that this is what you're wanting to do. And that's what he's doing. It doesn't take away from his own experiences as a child. It doesn't take away from everything that he still holds on to, but what he is saying that. He works harder at doing what he's doing than a person who's never experienced what he has so he works twice as hard to ensure. That his children never have to experience what he experienced."
11953.0,Patient,What far as what I see they don't they're happy they're happy with their parents.
207.0,Provider,"Because he works and you think about the if the person who he had children with if he's still with the person who he had children with you think about if. That wasn't her experience. He. works tripper times harder. To do something when, in comparison to. His partner triple times as hard. I have to work hard at embracing my daughter, I have to work very, very hard at that, why do you think."
11953.0,Patient,That being has a healthy life.
207.0,Provider,"Because it's not something I necessarily have. Right, so when she's embracing do you think it makes my skin crawl in the very beginning."
11953.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Of course it hands down, it makes my skin crawl all day long It makes me very uncomfortable. But it's an internal mental battle for me. And I have to allow myself to relax to embrace it. So it's something it's kind of like that positive self talk you're constantly having to do it. Nobody on the outside knows that this is a conversation i'm having in my head. So when she embraces I allow it, but when she hangs on too long and i'm like all right all right all right. it's because it's me having to work hard. at giving to someone that I don't necessarily really know. How to do so, I i'm teaching myself to do it. And i'm teaching myself based on other examples of people knows how to do it."
11953.0,Patient,"And that proves, you know how to love you just may not know you, you may not know you know how to love, but if you're trying hard that means you're capable of loving."
207.0,Provider,"we're all capable of it we're all capable of it it's just through experience that we've had past trauma it's suffocated that and so now we're working against the green to do it. Because even think about even within your relationship that you have now i'm sure there's there's a lot of clashes that you will have, and a lot of that probably comes from your own emotional deficiencies, because of your own upbringing. What it doesn't matter who the partner is this is the truth to Jeffrey it doesn't matter who the partner is in what gender it is. relationship is always going to for the most part be hard, because you still struggle from things of your own past and upbringing, because because remember that and mom bring something to the table. They each individual. have sold, you may have. issues with particular gender. You may have. And that's because of your own upbringing. Think about it from. I seek validation from women, why do you think, so why you think that."
11953.0,Patient,You go.
207.0,Provider,"I see exactly I seek validation from women because I never really got it from mom. I don't necessarily seek validation from men, because my dad overcompensated. So you think about when women who have money issues or people who have Daddy issues, try to understand why so you may seek certain validation from men, you may seek validation from women. And there's certain things that you seek from each gender it doesn't define your sexuality and your perfect, it just did it defines. The emotional mental struggles, you have that's what it defines sometimes we have to separate that it doesn't define my preference in relationship it just defines. The struggles, I have and what causes the my my anxiety what causes my depression what causes my mania is because i'm still seeking certain affection and validation and attention from each gender. And the reason why you seek it because you never got it from the two main people in your life. And how we seek it is oftentimes in very unhealthy ways and that's the reason why we have such issues in relationship, not just intimate relationship, but also friendship relationships with men and women."
11953.0,Patient,trickles down everywhere.
207.0,Provider,"So if a man speaks to you in a certain way, sometimes it bring flashbacks. dealt with you, you how a woman may come to you, it gives you flashback from mom. And so now i'm having this real anxiety attack or response, simply because it ain't me already. it's a reminder of what you went through. In your own upbringing."
11953.0,Patient,And you just want to run away from it. Because you don't want to do.
207.0,Provider,"But sometimes we have to be able to pinpoint. Because it's not the whole thing, because this is the truth of the matter it's not everything about your mom that's horrible just like it's not everything about your dad there's that's horrible. There are just specific things within them, and you have to be able to identify that and work on fact. peeling it back like a banana figuring it all out what exactly about my mom do I have an issue with and that's what you work on, because until you identify that that's when you have a better way of managing your anxiety and depression. And then we're no longer so dependent on medication, because the doctor could come back and tell you Jeffrey you know you've been on placebos for the last year, what you're talking about you take a sugar pill all the time. But in your mind because it's so powerful you thought the medication was working what the reality is you were taking a sugar pill, but you were really truly doing the work to learning how to identify and manager anxiety. Okay, so I have another session it's waiting on me so. let's let's see if we can think about what it is that I said and for our next time that we we meet, we can work on you, being able to identify like when you think about the the the ptsd as it's related to your mom I would love you to today's Tuesday. yeah let's to. This to 12 o'clock on the 23rd."
11953.0,Patient,What day is that Tuesday.
207.0,Provider,"it's a Tuesday yeah the week of thanksgiving, but I want you to think about it, when you think about like the anxiety and just the trauma and the reflection with your mom and the desire, the still desire that you want with your mom and there's nothing wrong with still wanting that relationship. Think about specifically and identify and write down what is exactly about your mom, and so the memories that causes these very vivid nightmares or what have you what is it and try your best for all your years of therapy identify. What is it. or try to understand her perspective, so you can now work on how to I. work through. This these issues okay. Okay alright have a good one, see you."
11953.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
207.0,Provider,you're welcome bye bye.
