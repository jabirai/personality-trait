740.0,Provider,"nothing wrong with it okay. Every now with me yeah exactly just about portion so you know how to discipline, it sounds like good discipline to me."

16669.0,Patient,tested any more of it.
740.0,Provider,"leaves them with a this last on my sale i'm not sure what you. See. I need to have self control, I need to have something."
16669.0,Patient,"I need to I need to and well yeah so that helped a lot and so stuff like that, and then I volunteer for. Safety department for a construction company. i'm an administrator and so they've been doing more work and so like a 12 hour day to put on Saturday in Santa clarita and it was it was awesome it was so nice to be able to do that, and so it was just a really busy week and then who's got another one in palmdale but. I think my mind like busy because I don't focus on myself as much my mind is me on positive things. But anyway, so between trying to put healthy things in every day and then making a list of what I need to do, I have a routine. And i'm proud of that it is possible."
740.0,Provider,"It is possible, any don't have to be perfect."
16669.0,Patient,"You just got to be consistent, you have to be."
740.0,Provider,"yep they see. They see that's amazing i'm glad to hear that i'm glad to hear, and you know the crazy part about it is you know husbands, all the best partners anywhere they already are. As well yeah pardon and everything else. i'm like. Oh really yeah, so I think that's amazing i'm happy that it's your husband had agreed to be your accountability partner, and then you know, in the crazy part about it is when you do things together, it allows you to grow together. yeah do healing. And so. It just one of those things that like I think it's amazing. That I think is really, really amazing that a little are able to do this together, and that you have established a route to."
16669.0,Patient,You know and.
740.0,Provider,"And I think good Now the question that I do have is this, because you made a statement. And you say Okay, well, I like being busy because when I felt when i'm busy at home focus on myself, however. I have a question. So what's so bad about focusing on you."
16669.0,Patient,"Why do you prefer to be busy no it. I OK, I focused on the wrong things about and that's something I need to work on i'm. Like all when i'm alone with my thoughts. I just don't feel it's healthy at this point in my life because I start thinking. Like there were a couple of times this week, where I had to really work on it, where. I started getting a little anxiety. Which which I think is nothing compared to before I started treatment nothing but I started getting a little anxiety and it was usually at night, it was about three times and I started thinking. I could have a heart attack tonight, and I know that. It I know it sounds silly to say outset out loud and i'm embarrassed I even think that way. But I like think about just how bad my cholesterol is. And, just like how. I wasn't educated enough and I let it get this bad and then, and that was at the beginning of the week, and so, how I combat, that is, I just like eventually thought to myself. But look at how like how much i'm doing."
740.0,Provider,Right now.
16669.0,Patient,"And you know it's okay to think i'm not going to have heard. And so, when i'm when i'm busy with like work and, like day to day life and stuff like that, then I am too busy to think of stuff like that I like. prioritizing and getting life together that's what I meant. When thinking about myself no i'm all for all for self care now. yeah when I get to that point and I think like i'm gonna die tonight I don't like that. yeah and after really talk myself like you know i'm fine my heart fine I can look at all the things I can do, I can walk long. distances, I can even run. i'm running when the weather is really good you feel so good, so my heart when you be able to do that if I was going to have a heart attack, and so I just have to read it myself when I get to that point."
740.0,Provider,"So this is what I will say, and I know to be scary right. yeah. And and and I definitely understand I remember, I was at a place like there to once upon a time. When my doctor was like okay so so the good cholesterol is there. But the bad cholesterol is high. So you need to figure so matt. yeah I was like. But I like."
16669.0,Patient,Right. In.
740.0,Provider,My life and I like birds. and abilities. And I like sneakers in races and half.
16669.0,Patient,rice and I like I love.
740.0,Provider,"Right yeah. I like chips and I like. The sugar, we can. So. When so I say all that to say yeah i'm saying the thing about it it's going to it. And exactly what you did is exactly what you continue to do. And that's something that's something that you have to tell yourself you're not going to wear them saying until it's time for you to go somewhere and I don't think right now. You know, and I can I can understand that it can be. You know battling with food in China to eat the right things and trying to resist the urge of choosing the wrong thing, even though you want to really pay. But one thing I wish I think you're doing a great job. I think you're really doing a great job I am. yeah, and so the battle was the battle well guess what one day you been goes to the doctor and the doctor can say you know what I get the less levels are really. I know."
16669.0,Patient,We already have an appointment in March and. Listen. really looking forward to it.
740.0,Provider,"it's going good report. you're saying and it's just like I told. Like I told you doing our first. session, you know. Now that you had this routine it's not only routine in your day to live and but it's also retaining your day to eating. And, by the time you look watch. Nikolai good news yeah. You can have a snack take. Right all right, but um so today, I went to go look back at your list of things yeah yeah now i'm gonna say the same thing I you know I believe in being transparent my clients. Because i'm not i'm never gonna lie to you this one thing about it. Right so i'm still. Slowly but surely working on your treatment plan. I have you written. On one document I just have to expound more and then place it on the other documents so but I do have a written last time we spoke, we talked about comparisons. yeah remember mm hmm how have you been doing with a."
16669.0,Patient,"really good actually. On. Saturday, when I when I went to that project, where we trained people to how to wear a respirator mask properly on job. I. I met a lot of really awesome people and when really nice girl, in particular, you know she's the type of girl that in the past, before our session I would have compared myself to her like crazy that and then I thought about your word. And like instead of saying in my mind i'm jealous of her for X y&z I changed it to I admire her for. My envy and like we had an awesome conversation, and like we have a lot. of things in common with I wouldn't have maybe gotten close to her head, I thought, like i'm jealous of her and Oh, she would never be friends with me. And stuff like that, and so we got really close to. Where i'm even like they invited my husband and I to come stay with them next weekend."
740.0,Provider,For all.
16669.0,Patient,"objects and yeah I know it's like we made good friends and. i'm like even like going to their house he's going to continue to think I admire her for these things, and then asked her, how do you how do you do this, how do you do that. So I just thought of that and i'm going to continue doing that that helped many. i'm trying to reaching i'm trying to retrain my brain yeah."
740.0,Provider,"um let's see oh by the side you say i'm gonna say this, and the reason why. The reason why I. encourage you to do there is because it allows you to make. It allows you to make relationships with people. See when you compare that to folks and you feel jealous that you never get relationship."
16669.0,Patient,"No, I. Because you get it between."
740.0,Provider,"Because you get intimidated and you feel like i'm. Like how, how will I help but see the thing about it, people got this time wrong okay. You don't stay away from people that you. Did that you admire. You you know, the people who want to be close to because they can sharpen. You know the crazy part about it and they say you are who you attract in the crazy part of the thing about it is, is that the more you are around people who you want to be like the more you will be ashamed to be the person that you want to be too. yeah that's just my belief, I mean you know. I just don't I used to tell my patients all the time and i'm not saying i'm on I mean don't disrespect. i'd say Michael I used to my class out of time, when I when I used to do group I said, let me tell you something. I said, if you want to be successful, you hang around successful people I said, if you want to be millionaires do you hang around me, you know I said, if you want to be nobody's that you hang around nothing's. There Julie, I mean, is it not true, it is because the crazy part about it is, do you know that if you hang around somebody long enough eventually. Eventually you'll learn from them. you've gleaned from them. You know you start using their terminology. and And now i'm just saying, so I think that's amazing and like I say you know i'm so proud that you're willing to practice. Oh yes."
16669.0,Patient,"Absolutely, I want to change."
740.0,Provider,"I want to form yeah and i'm like i'm you know it really starts my morning i'm good to hear you like you know when, instead of comparing myself i'm a comedy i'm i'm a."
16669.0,Patient,math.
740.0,Provider,"You see what happens now, you get a free trip somewhere. In that's what happens because, like, I told you like, I told you last week, the only person, you have to compare yourself to the you that you were yesterday."
16669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,I see nobody else.
16669.0,Patient,"That Okay, so I have to tell you that actually helped me through. On one of the anxiety night is is I thought about that i'm like look at the decisions I made today that I didn't make yesterday. And that, like gave me a sensor relief, so I did that I did what you said and comparing myself So hopefully I won't have too many of those, but when I do, I have a game plan."
740.0,Provider,"Better you better have a game plan. I think I mean I think that's phenomenal so less less less okay well, let me, let me, let me look. Okay let's dig a little bit just a little bit."
16669.0,Patient,i'm not i'm not very pleased.
740.0,Provider,"When I dig a little bit more today um so. I want to talk about if if you willing, I want to talk about self esteem. pretty sure um so I want to know. What does your best possible self look like."
16669.0,Patient,"My best possible self i'm. Fortunately, the first thing that just be honest that comes to my mind, is how I look. And that's how it kind of always been so my best possible self would be fit and really healthy and then comes the the deeper. Fortunately, but that's just how it is right now, as I felt physically. But the deeper things. definitely be just. content and. yeah able for things to roll off me like if someone really. I was thinking of those videos that we had played. In group session about if something causes you to lose trust it's a traumatic experience. yeah and my brain will turn a lot of things into a trauma for me. and My my husband. I don't know how he does it, but he is able to just like if someone said something or something happened it kind of just rolls off him. And then he moves on, and I think that's amazing all i'll record it and i'll rewind it. And now replay it. And i'll just think about it and i'll let it let it get to me. And time like really stressed and so. My best possible self would be able to. process it to where I move on as soon as possible, rather than saving it for later and playing it again."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and just yeah being content. And this cuz me, and I mean and women. Listen, we just emotional. So yeah for anything that affects us emotionally i'm going to gravitate i'm going to gravitate today. You said i'm going to i'm going to. You know i'm going to grab hold of it. Because of the fact that this. You know this is something that. This is something that hurt me emotionally. yeah so it just it just one of those things. Huge is he is like me. I want to let it go. But it, but it stains too bad."
16669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And then, sometimes what is, would it would it would it stay our emotions it stains it puts staying. In our in our mental. Space because they. Are right yeah energy one of those things, and so you look at your husband like what, how do you get off with you so."
16669.0,Patient,easily yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Like let me ask them tips, and so I made. This thing out like I just want to know how you do this. You know, and it is, is is definitely one of those things. Day. is just a everything takes practice, I know I know you know some therapists they come with this we're. we're deep. theology and beat metaphor and philosophy and all that kind of stuff and they said we're good but i'm just gonna be really honest with you practice makes permanent. The only way that I mean that's that's the only proven way that i've seen this for exposure and practice. And you know i'm saying the whole thing about it is, is that you have to you know when you when it comes to situations like those it takes a lot of talking to yourself, I know."
16669.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"It may say y'all want to come up like you crazy, but it does it take a lot of because you have to tell yourself thing you have to tell yourself and then i'm gonna say this i'm gonna say this because a lot of times we try. When something to fix us on something hurts us, you know, like you say you were wanting to you play it over and over again, you play it over and over again. And the thing about it is, is this sometimes we can feel like. That that hurt is our portion. Like we deserve this right and so many times, instead of letting it go, you know i'm saying we hold on to it because that's what we've been exposed to majority of our life, so the crazy part about it is the good stuff. will let it go. But the bad stuff and the stuff that hurts us will hold on to that because we think that's what we."
16669.0,Patient,deserve yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Right and the thing about it is, it is."
16669.0,Patient,It is.
740.0,Provider,"It yes. It is twisted. And it's backwards, but it's about a reframing of your mind. it's about being able to reframe your belief. And the only way you're able to do that is how you see yourself if you believe that you're worth more if you believe that your value. Is above average if you believe in yourself and who you are, as a person, if you believe that, regardless of what up whatever I was dealt. In the past year i'm saying that's not my portion today, you know i'm saying like if you believe those type of things, then, of course, a way of reframe your mindset. But, mind you, you know i'm saying. What is it. You know anything about it is what you know, whatever you think that's what you. And so yeah. We you know it's about. Renewing renewing our our mind. I like to use the analogy. Which of my renewing our mind I like to use the analogy, when you go check out a book. At the library right, so you go check out a book at the library and and you know I don't know if they do these these days with back in the day, you know we go with the library to have to have little card slots and I used to write your you put a little stamp. You know of when the book needs to be doing, you have to sign your name and. Your initials and stuff like that, and you. And I tell you okay well you got two weeks in the book needs to be back in two weeks, and so, then you go out. Have you read the book two weeks past. You know it's time to read the book bag, but you didn't get to finish it. And so the thing about it is, is that Okay, so they may the library offers a renew you an option to renew and so you bring you bring the book back, and then they actually do you want it, would you like to renew with the you say yes. Right. And the crazy part about it is, is that, whatever your expiration date was is no longer existed when you renew they give you a fresh date it's the same thing with your mind. Is that will you renewing your mind that which was young i'm saying that which was has to be raised, you have to give yourself a fresh slate. easier said than done, yes, I know, however, that's the objective of a renewal. You i'm saying, because the thing about it is being able to renew your mind will actually help transform your. you'll bring forth the change same way you've been able to where he was able to talk yourself out of comparison and he was able to find you and accountability partners so that you can so that you can continue to be healthy, you know talking to yourself, I had a. Those anxious moments when you feel like you know my health is in jeopardy and i'm not going to make it being able. To talk yourself out of those things. That is the major that right there it actually it actually it actually puts you in the right direction mentally of how to be able to renew your mind. So when you get those negative thoughts and when you get those things to tell you. That you're never going to be it you're never going to lose the weight you're never going to be different you're always going to look like this, you go and die out of this kind of stuff blah blah blah blah right when you get those type of things, then you're able to fight back. yeah i'm saying and that's where your strength comes from and see and I know I know that the physical appearance is is is at the forefront, I understand that I respected that aspect that you i'm saying, I understand that. However, is what you think about your physical appearance that they really they really plays the part. Right, because my thing is I just had a baby and the baby fate is real okay. So, but the thing about it is. Just like you like I shared with you, just like you said i've been doing what i've been doing i've been eating writing and i've been i've been working out and and and you know when I turned to the side i'm getting slammed. yeah i'm saying it's not where I wanted, but I know if I keep going. You know, eventually it's going to get there, but see what I what I say all that to say to you is that. As you continue to eat right as you continue to walk and things like that you have to be able to encourage yourself and to believe in the person that you're going to be. and not be so stuck in the person that you see right now. He helps it is part of the renew because sometimes and i'm gonna tell you this you can't. We can't we can't get rid of what happened to us in the past, we, I mean I wish okay. yeah I wish that we could have the biggest eraser on and just all wiping stuff out. But however that's not the way it works, but what we can't do is that we can use that as ammunition. To be better than they were. And there's just like I told you a few weeks ago, you know i'm saying you know. We can't change your momma Dee or what she didn't do. We can't change it, unfortunately. But it's one of those things to where it teaches you. You know the Chico me better than she was. That the stuff. That you and you know what and sometimes. being stuck in that place can hinder you from wanting to have your own children because of the fact that you're scared you're going into being."
16669.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,"You know i'm saying, and this is a real fear. is real right, but the thing about it is. Mine, mind you. The more. You grow into this better version of yourself. The more you keep doing what you do right now. Find out the urge to compare fine off the urge. Young saying to. catastrophe fighting off the urge young saying the top down on yourself and being negative and things of that nature and continuing. Continuing admiring people instead of comparing and being accountable to your husband and eating writing doing writing being somebody, the more you put your mama's words to shame. Just imagine every time you do something different than what she put in you, you put her words to shame. you're getting better and better every day, even if you don't family you gotta tell yourself anyway get better better every day. Every day i'm getting better. And every day you put a worse, the same. And then you go, I mean it just it's just one of those things and that's it just part of healthy coping you know i'm saying, because I mean trauma is real it's real. it's real. But it can heal. It can be healed."
16669.0,Patient,And you can be humble.
740.0,Provider,"as possible, it takes time. But, if possible, you know i'm saying and the thing is. Is that what you're doing now is is is. is part of their process of healing. So I want you to be proud of yourself. You don't really, really good you really are no I."
16669.0,Patient,Am yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So last thing is this. In this router self esteem. understanding can be really difficult to point out things like you said, the physical is what really takes precedence. over everything else, so I want to do this with you real quick before we go. Okay, so this is called strength exploration, so those who know their strengths. and use them frequently tend to have more success in several areas. They feel happier and have. Better self esteem. and are more likely to accomplish their goals. To use your strengths effectively it's important to have a. clear idea of what they are. And how they can reuse some of your greatest strengths. might be easy to recognize why others go unnoticed because they feel ordinary to you, even if they aren't. In this worksheet you will identify your strengths in ways in which you are already using them, additionally, you will explore new ways to use your strength to."
16669.0,Patient,Your advantage.
740.0,Provider,"So this is what I want you to do. um I don't know. Is it possible. I am going to. What am I gonna do i'm gonna save this. And i'm going to send it to your email. So I wanted to go over this with you. Because it is a little expensive, and I want you to I want you to actually have time to think about it and 10 minutes of time, but I want you to. I want to present this to you, basically you circle your streets from the choices below and then you add your own at the bottom. Which is these down here. And then in relationship, what are your strengths. describe us with specific time your strengths, were able to help you in a relationship described to do ways, you can use your strength. relationship been in profession professionally past the present work school whatever. list the shrimp you possess to help you your profession describe a specific time your strengths are in the helping profession and to new ways. And then personal fulfillment your hobbies your interest pleasurable activities same thing okay so i'm going to actually i'm going to say this, and i'm going to email this to you, and so the. Week, so that you can do it, I am i'm gonna go ahead and email, let me confirm your email because I want to make sure that. I see. 1717."
16669.0,Patient,yep.
740.0,Provider,"i'm going to send it to you now, so that you can have it, so the next time we meet next week. i'm going, I want to go over this thoroughly. So I never want I don't want to rush stuff like this because I want you to actually have time to think about it."
16669.0,Patient,"sounds good, I did that last homework, you gave me two."
740.0,Provider,Okay let's go for.
16669.0,Patient,"That 10 negative things and then to positive things for each one that actually helped me. Okay So the first thing I wrote down is my my body and appearance, because it was just the first thing that POPs into my head, right now, but then the two positive things is i'm tall."
740.0,Provider,i'm above them.
16669.0,Patient,"tight that have been skin. And then the second thing I don't like about myself is my anxiety that i'm currently working on, and then the two things for that it's made me a more cautious person, and then I also have a lot of empathy for people that have stress and anxiety. So I can actually talk. I talked to a lot of people about their anxiety and then. i'm very prone to I couldn't think of a better word, because I don't I don't think it was the right word but I said prone to laziness. But I don't think it's lazy I think it's. I don't know."
740.0,Provider,Good word.
16669.0,Patient,Where I just.
740.0,Provider,It.
16669.0,Patient,"Just sounds like such a bad word. Is it. crushed me i'm going to procrastinate yeah i'll say professionally and prone to procrastinate. And then the two positives of that but i'm getting back to with my limitations. So I say no to a lot more, and that helps me deal with things when I just I say i've got too much now i'm sorry. And the next positive is, I have an awareness and the desire to better myself but. A lot of people are not self aware."
740.0,Provider,That they need to.
16669.0,Patient,"Change whatever negative stuff they've got going on. And then something else I don't like is I don't like my lap and my voice. But. yeah I don't like my last I don't know why it just my voice, I think I sound like a man. But that's man. yeah I just speak I have such a manly voice sometimes. I know i'm working on it and we're not in a. Pardon me, I think you have like a set fee boy."
740.0,Provider,To me i'm just saying I respected okay. let's keep going.
16669.0,Patient,"But the positive things. I love I love my sense of humor i've got a great sense of humor. And i'm able to make people laugh. Okay, and then another thing is, I have the ability to get along with a lot of different people. i've always. Will to get along with different personalities and ages and background so i'm very thankful for that, and then I have a lack of confidence, but the negative thing. And then to positive things is I love my cooking skills, I love being able to put things together, and a lot of people enjoy that. I have the. ability to live, very simply, I don't have to have a lot of things. thankful for that.
