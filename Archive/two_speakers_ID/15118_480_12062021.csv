480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's so cool I had no idea."
15118.0,Patient,"it's awesome I mean it's just. And if you do need France or anything, and you are running a little low on cash or something you get it for at least half off."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well that's why I know about it, because when we first moved to Charlotte um. I was like in the process of having all the kids and whatnot and so money was always super tight and we used to get a lot of furniture there. It was such a little store."
15118.0,Patient,"yeah it's a nice store and I did this, and it feels good to be able to. You know, get back, I mean, yes it started with for the order, but now i'm working i'm still doing so."

480.0,Provider,Oh that's right you started dating in high school right. yeah.
15118.0,Patient,yeah and the one thing I would say I bought me skipping is wish they had better food and. They did not have any good fit I was just weird I don't know.
480.0,Provider,Like did they do the traditional thanksgiving stuff and it just.
15118.0,Patient,So they did a Turkey breast instead of a Turkey.
480.0,Provider,man. worst part of the Turkey.
15118.0,Patient,"Yes, and then they. didn't do any gravy. And then I don't I can't so they didn't have to they did make mashed potatoes and green bean casserole and MAC and cheese and that's it."
480.0,Provider,So no stuffing no sweet potato with the marshmallows on top.
15118.0,Patient,I know I was pretty bad. yeah it was I was like come on.
480.0,Provider,that's funny. But it. was a nice day the weather here is gorgeous.
15118.0,Patient,"It was really nice. And there's my dog outside and, obviously, through the stakes. And all that fun stuff."
480.0,Provider,"awesome. So your parents, what did you just ditch them on thanksgiving did you guys celebrate after."
15118.0,Patient,"Before I mean we did. This getting dinner, we had some steaks and potatoes and stuff but yeah we didn't get any crazy yeah."
480.0,Provider,that's good and things are still going on with them.
15118.0,Patient,"yeah things are good, I mean I wouldn't say they're. 100% trusting I mean obviously hundred percent truth, but because of me, you know I you know but her overdose in their house, so I don't expect the trust to be back for a while. And you know i'm doing everything I can in turn it back it's just you know it. will still trying to understand addiction in itself not just me alone, so I mean i'm not. Mad at them, of course, i'm not mad at them, I just wish they understood and more and understood that. I think they understand it's not really my. I don't know how to word out. Because, yes, it is my fault, yes it isn't and just depends on way look at it, the way you understand and fix. It says. Nothing bad nothing bad has been going on, I just know certain little things I. walk in keeping doors locked on their stuff like that, but."
480.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
15118.0,Patient,"Just kind of keeps eating, I mean, knowing that I never once had ever stolen anything, then. write anything and madman but."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's the part that is hard, because so. A lot of people like you said a lot is going on a they don't understand that. At some point, you lose the choice in addiction right, so people who aren't addicts and don't take the time to really research. And at some level, I would even argue that it's hard for people that don't have any sort of addictive tendencies to really understand that they can logically know that. You know the science behind addiction, once the chemicals in your brain you no longer can choose blah blah blah like they can know that it's really hard for people who have never experienced that to understand it. And I think that's where a lot of non addict struggle with understanding and then also having empathy from that understanding is they can't possibly imagine how. You could lose your ability to choose how much more you use right and so that's something that I try to keep in mind. Especially when there's trust issues is it's not that they don't trust you as a person, they don't trust your addiction. And it's helpful in recovery to externalize the addiction as not a part of us right because that's The difference is you, in your sober mind would never do things that you did in your addiction. And I think they see that and they know that. The problem is, they don't trust your addiction and they don't know like I mean it was a good five years into my sobriety before my parents, let me use their lake house with my kids without them being there like five years i'm like. guys i'm not gonna do anything. But I also understood because. In my addiction, I did a lot of untrustworthy things so. there's a lot of like grace and compassion that has to come from both sides, you know."
15118.0,Patient,"yeah I know, but the one thing is that gets me a little bit to his. dad. As functioning as he is he's an all those, then he knows so it's in you know, like you're saying I don't know what it is i'm not gonna push on it, and I think they are trying to understand, but. I don't know if they think that is addiction is not as bad as mine, I."
480.0,Provider,"Has he ever called himself an alcoholic. yeah okay. That might be part of it, too, then, is. People who are in denial of their own addiction tend to project some of that stuff onto others."
15118.0,Patient,"yeah he doesn't actually say that word words alcoholic but he does say he know he knows that he has to drink. yeah to now but yes, he also served in the marines for six years, so I mean as soon as he got back that's not no excuses, but I just see the correlation."
480.0,Provider,"yeah for sure is he, like he drinks daily."
15118.0,Patient,"yeah he drinks. Right five to seven beers and day. He gets off a word. Now he doesn't drink it in front of me anymore, and he puts them on carbs and all that, like they don't I haven't seen a beer cans and since i've been back from rehab. yeah but obviously i'm I know he still does I do see it here in there, I grew up important there but he's trying his best not the dude from."
480.0,Provider,Does it bother you that he drinks.
15118.0,Patient,"No, I mean I thought it would have been a really doesn't."
480.0,Provider,"Good. huh yeah that's interesting. So there might be a little bit of denial and projection coming from them too. But yeah I can understand how that would be frustrating it's like. You know, trust me yet i'm the one not using anything, while they're still actively using. huh."
15118.0,Patient,yeah but I can't expect that spec then just. stop their whole life. Right my. My problems that I created.
480.0,Provider,"Well, the problems that the addiction created. Member were external."
15118.0,Patient,Yes.
480.0,Provider,"Not a bad person, you are not difference there's a difference, so is the plan eventually to get a place with your girlfriend."
15118.0,Patient,Oh yeah where you know now that i'm fully working again and everything it's probably gonna be the next month and a half. rho God.
480.0,Provider,So you don't have much longer of living with locked doors.
15118.0,Patient,"No, no, no."
480.0,Provider,She like fully trusting that she get addiction.
15118.0,Patient,"Oh she's 100% yeah. She really does, I mean. i've taken her to feel the open in a classes, where you don't have you know necessarily have to be an addict for it so actually can see it, and you know really see everything and she she has been doing her damage to fully understand everything I think she's really getting it."
480.0,Provider,"Good. Okay, very cool um so holidays coming up in any of this triggering."
15118.0,Patient,"i'm not for. Not to use, but to drink a little bit yes."
480.0,Provider,I haven't heard not drinking at all.
15118.0,Patient,"No, I haven't said."
480.0,Provider,"problem for you like, is this. Part of. Tell me, because a lot of people. A lot of opiate addicts still drink occasionally."
15118.0,Patient,"So I feel like I can control myself, I did decide to drink here and there, and I know, like in the future, I mean i've been I talked about this with. You know a lot of the speakers and everybody went on some rehab you know I you know i'm not going to try to drink anytime soon, but I. Because I want to be fully sober and just do that, but I can the future I might you know occasionally drink here and there might get like you know further down the road and they all said, you know there's about you know it can work. It just depends on your mindset and a few other things, but in my past. I never had. A problem. With trying to control drinking now, when I was in college of course I would binge drink on some nights and I, you know I would definitely drink a lot on one night and then not drink for a while and then. I went back out to another party or something after like. You know full week and go back out on Friday or Saturday, and I would drink in but. Other than that, I never. Consensus consistently drink every day. Right. I don't know, maybe. yeah I can think of a time where I drink more than three days in a row."
480.0,Provider,So yeah I only caution obviously would be alcoholism tends to be largely genetic so. I understand your dad's being triggered by ptsd but that's usually what happens is like you have the genetic predisposition and then environmentally something triggers it so that would be my only caution with you that and if you're on suboxone you can't drink a lot. without passing out like not like fainting like a lot of people get really so i've heard two things happen when you're on suboxone and you drink more than like one or two drinks is either you just get really tired and fall asleep or some people get nauseous and like puke.
15118.0,Patient,Okay.
480.0,Provider,"So that would be my. Caution with drinking is, if you are going to drink. Remember that you do have the genetic predisposition and also you're an addict so it's a lot easier for you to become an alcoholic than other people. And also, when you're on suboxone it just might not end well if you drink more than one or two."
15118.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. makes sense.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15118.0,Patient,I mean crossing any kind of drugs or alcohol would. see that yeah.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15118.0,Patient,makes sense. yeah it's just but everything else is going really good i'm. Good it's really can. Set the thing with my brother that's about. These things and still getting me.
480.0,Provider,And he is still not talking to you at all.
15118.0,Patient,Now.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, he did tell you happy birthday."
15118.0,Patient,"No he didn't. Have any mojo nope and. there's been a couple times, where I just noticed today, but I love you i'm doing good. So I haven't really heard anything and. what's but really you know sorry you pissed me off was when his girlfriend text me and said hey I got you got I got to a pH change gift card for your birthday. So you can manage can go out and have the chains and so let's say he was configured up and then I texted make sense and i'm coming over to get it and she's like i'll pants in another box and put up the elephant mailbox open the card, and it was addressed from her and her dog."
480.0,Provider,that's sad yeah.
15118.0,Patient,I just don't get why that big of a deal where to go under way to not to tell her to not put your name on that car.
480.0,Provider,"yeah well and that's why I feel like there's a lot more going on internally for him, because this is definitely a disproportional reaction based on. The path that your life has gone the past year, so you know, like I would understand if you were still out there, using and causing problems and."
15118.0,Patient,"One to 100% I would not blame them if that's the way I still was. yeah not one little bit, but I just bugs me that he doesn't even know how i'm doing it doesn't care. is tearing my mama part is eating her up."
480.0,Provider,"So did your mom talk to him about it, like does he talk to your parents about the stuff."
15118.0,Patient,"The only thing that my mom can get out of him. Is that. He is talking to his therapist. The only thing that she can get out of the team, they want to talk about anything else, except he's working with is there."
480.0,Provider,wow.
15118.0,Patient,"I knew damn therapist could you I. mean I can't speak for the therapist but would you ever tell somebody brother in that position to not talk to the brother at all. not saying that she's telling that but I just feel like there is therapist would at least kind of you know, urgent say hey just please say hey happy birthday."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean, I do have situations where I think it's healthier to not engage with toxic family members, but the difference is. you're not a toxic family member at this point because you're clean you're sober you're doing the right thing, so. I mean, obviously I can't speak for this situation or for her or you don't even know what he told her that's part of the problem with other people going to therapy and. Like you have no idea what he's telling her is going on right now, because he doesn't even know what's going on with you right now, which is the problem."
15118.0,Patient,yeah bro I know he's still thinks they're using.
480.0,Provider,"Right, but so does he still have a relationship with your parents, they just don't talk about you. your husband kind of pulled away from them."
15118.0,Patient,"Well, so since I moved back into the House, for you know the short period time he hasn't he does not come over on there. So definitely that's you know that's also why it's turned my mom has been has not come over nearly as much as me he went there for me back. To his girlfriend's buttons. Now so yeah that's how it's been and, as you know. This not. and honestly I feel bad more for my ma. Then I hope that makes sense."
480.0,Provider,Oh for sure yeah.
15118.0,Patient,yeah just.
480.0,Provider,Have you ever tried to like right in the men's letter to him or anything like that.
15118.0,Patient,I haven't and then I need to.
480.0,Provider,Do sponsor in your meetings like do you do the 12 steps.
15118.0,Patient,"So that's The one thing I never have gotten a sponsor. I never I haven't. In rehab I you know, I was thinking about it and I just never I don't know why I never want to run to do it, but yes it definitely should because we haven't did. Did the started in the fourth step with somebody and they said just you know wait until you actually going to fill a sponsor instead of a 10th one for this one, so I just never, never got back around so. yeah and honestly I had nobody in those na meetings, I can see myself. Having them as a sponsor I don't know. I just couldn't couldn't see it. Soon, as people. No."
480.0,Provider,"Well, no, no here's the thing like i'm not saying you have to do the 12 steps by any means there's a lot of people that. Get clean and stay clean, without ever doing the 12 steps, but the benefit of doing them is then you have someone that helps you through things like those amends, and I mean we can do that here also but i'm. Also, with sponsorship it's not like a lot of people think it's like this big huge commitment and you're going to marry the person right, you can change sponsors at any time. So I totally get the whole like you have to feel like you can be honest with them, because otherwise it doesn't really benefit either of you, if you don't feel like you can be fully honest um but at the same time, it also isn't a marriage you're not like committing to lifelong sponsorship."
15118.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,You can change at any time.
15118.0,Patient,"So yeah and i've really have been thinking about doing the admins part and all that so much there is means that I can make with other people too. because then we know things that I wouldn't say or do, and I was under the influence and. I mean even you know we'll come back and old text messages I just think I look like an idiot. So many things I said. So yeah there's definitely people that I still think about Su and just my brother there any great some type of a means to. So yeah definitely want to work on that this week. So that. They can. do that."
480.0,Provider,"yeah for sure yeah so and also just because we're talking about a men's the big mistake, a lot of people make with doing amends is doing it for selfish reasons right so amends are supposed to be for the person you harmed so. It might be that your brother isn't even ready to receive an amends at this point. that's why it's important to have a sponsor who knows, like all of the history of things so, then they can help you decide like what's an appropriate. amends what's the appropriate timeframe what's the appropriate way to do it, do you do it in person, do you do a letter, do you do it phone call all of that stuff so yeah I think that's a good plan to work on getting a sponsor. Okay. For you, we do individual appointments only monthly right because the self pay, or is it twice a month."
15118.0,Patient,So we did it twice a month is time. soda yes so it's a. You.
480.0,Provider,"hold on i'm looking to see when your next appointment is. Okay yeah we don't have any other. We don't have any other therapy scheduled for this month, but you do have group scheduled. Did you come to group last."
15118.0,Patient,"Monday, which means killing and. should be."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so you should be coming. yeah. yeah."
15118.0,Patient,She prescribed the week on medicaid I was gonna ask about this in two weeks of medication no i'm out today so. What do we do about that.
480.0,Provider,yeah out completely.
15118.0,Patient,"So i'm taking I have today, but I don't have you know Tuesdays or Wednesdays."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so generally with medication issues, the quickest way. is for you to go to the virtual clinic and ask for the prescription team, because we have a nursing staff that does bridges, because Dr Marshall doesn't work on Mondays with bright heart. So if you're going to be out by the end of the day, I feel like that would be the best way to get it, so that you won't have no meds tomorrow. So when we're done or whenever you have time today call the virtual clinic and ask for the prescription team and then just tell them that. You are bi weekly in group you got because of thanksgiving we had moved our meeting from Wednesday until Monday, so now you're out today, but you don't have group again until Wednesday."
15118.0,Patient,"Okay yeah well I just. they're not going to charge me for that, though, are they."
480.0,Provider,For calling them no.
15118.0,Patient,"Okay, because last time when Dr Martha was only doing weekly prescriptions they tried to tell me that I had to pay for a bridge doctor because. of something random and I, and I kept explaining to him on biweekly on group but she's doing been doing weekly prescriptions so. Sometimes they just don't. I don't know."
480.0,Provider,"Well, so okay if they say something about that tell them to Google chat me to verify because Dr Marshall is not available today, but all the available today, so if they need to like confirm or whatnot they can send me a chat message."
15118.0,Patient,Hello.
480.0,Provider,"Alright, so our next appointment, do you mind if it's scheduled for January."
15118.0,Patient,that's fine.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, because, oh no, I have to get a new planner. don't have January in this planner. um. Alright, so let's do well how about let's wait until group on Wednesday and see if Dr marshalls okay with you going down to monthly for individual. Because yourself pay, because you go to na meetings, because you're getting a sponsor. I feel like I would be okay with that. And you can always email me if you need additional appointments. um let's do that and then. Wednesday i'll go get a new planner."
15118.0,Patient,sounds good to me.
480.0,Provider,"Alright cool. Well, take care, and let me know if you have any issues with the bridge prescription."
15118.0,Patient,Okay i'm also. Other any afternoon group therapies that I can you know change from because you know I am mark being a lot and I don't think i'm maybe I want to be able to do this month is 11 to noon.
480.0,Provider,"We do. Tuesday, so our for North Carolina groups are Tuesdays at seven Tuesday at 830 those are both in the evening and then Wednesday 9:30am and 11am so you can come to either seven or 830 on Tuesday."
15118.0,Patient,yeah as soon as tomorrow 7pm.
480.0,Provider,"OK cool, so I will let them know, do you want to change it permanently or just for this week."
15118.0,Patient,"Well, actually, I might be working like bad day tomorrow, so it was to the 830. Okay, but i'm change it permanently."
480.0,Provider,"perfect, so I will put a note in and yeah sounds good, and then we'll have with your meds to just in case there is an issue."
15118.0,Patient,"you'll be able to send her tomorrow. Exactly. Well, thank you so much."
480.0,Provider,you're welcome enjoy your day and i'll see you tomorrow.
15118.0,Patient,i'm ready.
480.0,Provider,"All right, bye."
