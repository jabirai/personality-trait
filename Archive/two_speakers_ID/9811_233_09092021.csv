9811.0,Patient,"So I fell about two weeks ago, and I still wasn't taking anything I wasn't taking aging, and they got to the point where like I was having a hard time walking and I was like I had remembered that I had seen. I haven't seen him."
233.0,Provider,"i'm just i'm just only asking when did you take the Arctic code or not the right story, not all the problems walking my question is when did you take the Arctic, oh no."
9811.0,Patient,"So I took it I started, I took it last. Thursday, it was noah's last Wednesday last Wednesday and then I had it until. Saturday Friday. Last I had it like from last Wednesday till about Thursday or Friday and that's up until when I have had that medication and then I just I was surprised on how like fast it got to me and it got me like. It can."
233.0,Provider,"Tell me, when you finished off the Arctic code on i'm here in Thursday or Friday of last week."
9811.0,Patient,"Yes, this."
233.0,Provider,into what's been happening over the last five or six days.
9811.0,Patient,Since i've been sick.
233.0,Provider,In what what is taking me be more specific.
9811.0,Patient,"So I had like really like. Well, so I i've been like really anxious i've had like anxiety um i've and that's why i'm saying, like, I was surprised on how like so is draw like hadn't like had me like where I began like. not like, if I wanted more. and always felt like like bassline like how I used to feel like. Like oh my God I way I want it and I don't want it, and you know what i'm saying like. But I don't want it, I don't want to even go down that path again and I don't want to. I just I can't I can't even okay."
233.0,Provider,So here's the problem that we had we are in the process of discharging you because you didn't show up for service.
9811.0,Patient,"And so, and. So I talked to them about that, and they said that they were going to discharge me on the 18th I believe or the 16th or something. So they said you got it. got it right on time. So they were like you caught it right on time and I was like."
233.0,Provider,Who is the.
9811.0,Patient,"um I don't know I talked to several different people. um I i've talked to several different people they just transferred me like from one person from a coordinator to compliance to then somebody else that told me, I had to do like some surveys, so I did that."
233.0,Provider,Really and here's the difficulty. You haven't been showing up for service.
9811.0,Patient,"Right that's why i'm saying like I want that's what i'm hoping to do is, I want to get back on track and I want to not go back I had never like I don't want to fall back into patterns that I was in before you know, and I want to get my life like back on track Ray was before."
233.0,Provider,"And so, when you were in our program last time around. And then, also with the difficulties that we're talking about now i'm not convinced that our program matches what you need from a program you've had a lot of difficulty getting getting the lab work getting the urine drug screen doing the surveys following."
9811.0,Patient,"Well, and that's what. i've always done is but the thing is with the drug the the UAE I never had received it, and then, finally, like I. Apparently, they said they sent it to my home address and I never got it to my home address that I keep telling them I don't get it at my home address I get it at appeal box I don't get."
233.0,Provider,"So it is possibly a difficulty that when our program doesn't doesn't match up with the needs that you have and how things function right the where we how we work those urine drug screen doesn't match up what's happening for you. So if i'm not faulting you and just saying that there is the potential, then our our the way that we do things does not fit your process and what you need to have happen that's my concern here. you're what i'm saying."
9811.0,Patient,"yeah I do I. know I understand what you're saying night that's. I mean, but I, you know in this last time that I talked to who have like and I can't even tell you, who I talked to I talked to several different people, but that is one thing that I asked him I said. Whenever I would get if I get my you may send me my drug screen like really come to a P O box and they said they would know to that. That it would come in and they said Oh well, we've been sending it to your home address and or they had sent it in the previous I guess they haven't seen anything like as elite wherever books. That they would send it to the appeal box and for me just not to open anything until I received it, or whatever, and I said Okay, but then they told me to wait till I talk to you and then that we would get everything situated."
233.0,Provider,Right right.
9811.0,Patient,i'm just asking for a chance to like. Get back on track in you know. I just. i'm just asking for help.
233.0,Provider,"Right and i'm just trying to decide whether our program is the appropriate way to get help right there are other programs out there, this is not the only one, but if it doesn't work if you're not able to come into group, if you don't have the Internet connection."
9811.0,Patient,And I don't know I have brand new.
233.0,Provider,"If you don't have that Internet connection the things that we need to get done aren't getting done it's no fault of yours is that our program and how our program function. does not meet the needs that you have and that's been my experience so far is that our program does not match the needs, you have. No, I hear what you're saying you're working these things out you've got the new technology you've talked with them about getting the urine drug screens done all of that stuff So what we can do is just a temporary time Okay, the the discharge, time is still in effect for next Friday. If you're not coming into services there's no if you're not getting things done there's no point. Right. there's no point so and then it's still going to be temporary after that you have to show me that this does work. Okay right, but you can make this work. Groups, they lock 15 minutes after their start start time so previously you were doing the Monday 10am. Yes, so that means."
9811.0,Patient,Friday actually.
233.0,Provider,"Friday okay so on Friday and for the group that means it lock 15 minutes after the group starts, so if you're you come in 16 minutes late. you're not going to get in your late right, so people I encourage people to show up a couple of minutes early to group. So that you're there you're present you're paying attention you're not interrupting others. you're listening you've got good connection with the Internet you've got your surveys done the urine drug screens when they come to you, you don't wait to be told to get them done you do it right away right. Right that's that's how what I expect to happen and that's that's how the program works now if it's not working, let us know we can help search for other programs where you that is going to better fit your situation. Okay. Does that sound reasonable to you."
9811.0,Patient,"yeah i'll prove myself, because I really do you know I need this, I want to do this, I want to. get my life, you know. I can backtrack into filling the weird but instilling in me it's not fair to my kids is not fair to. It mainly because, like i'm not I can't be the parent that they deserve, if I. Not doing this for myself, you know what I mean."
233.0,Provider,"Right right and that's very important absolutely so what group is going to work for you we've got the Friday 10am and the Friday 12 noon and then we've got the Monday. 9am in the Monday 12 noon, which one of those works factory."
9811.0,Patient,The Friday 12 year old were perfect. That would be perfect perfect.
233.0,Provider,So that means you're coming in tomorrow. So let me. Get. get your name on the list cheers or got it.
9811.0,Patient,"And I you know, like even when I had first started like during the program with you guys like. Even. Like just even like noticing like how my kids even like well they don't really they don't know what's going on and stuff you know they're too little, but just they remember how say mom would always like we I felt better that we could do things again, and you know. And then here is the last couple like weeks that I haven't been feeling good or whatever again it's kind of been like mom when are you gonna feel better mom when can we do this mom when can we get on like. Just because I don't like. And it's not just that, but just because I don't I don't feel good about myself I don't like it, I like I need to get myself right because. If I don't like. i'm already have you know, so if I don't do it for myself like. They don't have anybody else you know what I mean."
233.0,Provider,"i'm working some of this out. All right, so, then we need to get the medication fenton for you also. Now I had you taking suboxone but it looks like as of July, it might have switched over. yeah."
9811.0,Patient,yeah because the. suboxone was getting me like really like tired and like nauseous so we put me on the subjects and that was working a lot better.
233.0,Provider,than it was the three pills a day is that right.
9811.0,Patient,"yeah yeah The only thing is that my insurance it needed a chaos. So I was having to pay out of pocket that's, the only thing."
