6337.0,Patient,"i'm so the hospital, we are supposed to leave today but um they had to put Chi back on some quantity. Okay, because he was wasn't really dealing with them taking him completely off of it like he did really good with being weaned off the morphine and they were able to meet him like 10 days in a row. But then I guess they're not mandated or it's not their protocol that they have to wean them off of the quantity and as well, so there. They can just put the babies off cold Turkey, which I think is kind of stupid, which is what they did so, I think."
191.0,Provider,you've done my nails a Pal they have i'm on cloud nine.
6337.0,Patient,yeah I think so yeah they.
191.0,Provider,"Are you on a benzo or anything, and we were pregnant."
6337.0,Patient,"No, they just use that because the baby babies are you know there were to get you anything they usually have like tremors and stuff it just helps you so. So they cut them off cold Turkey, so they think that it was a combination of weaning him off of the morphine so quick and then cutting him off of that right away, too, so just kind of everything at once, so they had to put him back on a low dose of that so. Now i'm leaving I think on Monday."
191.0,Provider,"So okay yeah the only reason I asked, I know for my patients that may have babies if they're using that that they may have to but um yeah so they added that to him, because he was having a tremors and shakes even when they Adam had him on the morphing he was still have. him okay. yeah Okay, so you were not using clonazepam while you were pregnant."
6337.0,Patient,No i've never used that.
191.0,Provider,Okay.
6337.0,Patient,"yeah that's what my first son, he was on that to he was on he was actually on morphine cloning and they had him on phenobarbital 1.2 so."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, oh yeah how his card is morning, where is this morning."
6337.0,Patient,he's in the nursery. So.
191.0,Provider,"Oh, are you breastfeeding. No Okay, no. Are you planning to."
6337.0,Patient,"Well, I was going to but then you know transitions kind of leaning more towards the fact that I was gonna have to go to foster care and I was going somewhere else, so I just kind of. put that on the back burner for now so."
191.0,Provider,"Okay okay Dan So what is the plan, I know, it seems like things have changed quickly."
6337.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm going to residential treatment. And I believe is their program is 90 days i'm not. 100% sure I don't really know a lot about the program yeah I just know that me and I are both going together. Okay um. So i'm assuming this 90 days. um and then, once. I leave they're incomplete treatment all the movie back to the shocked in and moving into sober living."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so once you out, you will move into is that a groupon."
6337.0,Patient,"um I don't I think. They have some some of the places that they have. Do you have other people. living in them, but then they have a few apartments that are that I would. That, I would just be there by myself with baby."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so is what what what type of facility which you call it what you say it's up what type of facility, how do you. Know residential facility or."
6337.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
191.0,Provider,"No a like an apartment residential facility, where you have your own place which yourself. Alright alright."
6337.0,Patient,"And then I was going to see about possibly being weaned off of the subs while i'm down here. Depending on, you know how long i'm down here, whatever they want to do, but if I go that route. And then I eventually want to get on the. Call um but as far as that goes, when I get out of the program gather and collect so really and i'm still going to come back to you guys for like my mental health."
191.0,Provider,So the apartment residential place that's like a sober living place.
6337.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"All right, then, so does your father know about this House your father is your father. supportive or who, in your family, friends are supporting you and during this."
6337.0,Patient,"Transit yeah everybody knows everybody's really glad that you know this is kind of what happened, rather than you know him how to foster care and. separated. But he's really happy, this is how things are now so."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are you planning to do this differently, what what's your game plan to keep keep your son and to protect him."
6337.0,Patient,Take everything seriously and everything that i've learned over the years and just actually put it to use this time okay i'm. Just gonna work hard.
191.0,Provider,yeah yeah definitely I think that that's beautiful now when you get into sober living do they cannot dictate who can visit you or they control that or How does that work.
6337.0,Patient,"No clue I don't know how any of it works I just know that they said. Like starting out like everything's furnished and all that the whole House is and then starting now only pay like $100 a month, but they will help me for years. Until I get a job and that's for utilities rent Internet TV all that stuff oh um it's it'll help me find a job and everything um you know kind of like get my license back or whatever, and then this is that people are eligible to stay there for up to five years so. I mean I. mean i'll be there that long, but I mean it's nice to know that you know I mean I don't have like a short time on it, you know they're going to be kidding. me out, you know so."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, I want to share this with you just so you're aware. One of the biggest challenge single people. Make when they have a child, whether you're male or female, I see more females make it is the people that you invite in your life be in touch listing will have different people keep your keys even family members. We could date i'm. Putting you children and unsafe situations um you know, one of the things I like to share what my mom's is that your child is a gift to you for a reason. And if you feel that somebody is not treating your child can his child is not safe or definitely if you know that you have every right to protect that child. You don't have to ask anybody's permission. know my child can't stay with you know my child isn't that spin night at your House well why you need to do this, you need to do that why don't you. Why don't you. Why, you always want your child you don't owe anybody an explanation as to why you want to be with your child and not hang out with them all the time. Right, because a lot of people will want you to be with them, they may want you, but they may not want that child okay. Okay."
6337.0,Patient,"Another thing with me moving down here is like I don't really know anybody here. So I don't i'm not gonna be around a lot of bad influences that I was. Before I move, which is good, I mean I know i'm gonna meet new people on here, obviously, you know you know there's bad people on bad things Everywhere you go but."
191.0,Provider,Everywhere yeah but.
6337.0,Patient,"Now you know me not knowing anyone at all, you know it'll give you a little bit of a head start on things you know to be able to get to where I need to be and prepare myself for that so."
191.0,Provider,"yeah so I see the love you have, for your chat and, to be honest with you kelsey you're the main protector of. Your your it you're it and that's a beautiful road will be, and it can feel lonely, but I want you to feel confident trusting yourself to protect your child, one thing I share with people if you have a mixed race ciao okay. And i'm talking from experience right and I have friends that are mixed race and I have friends that are full race I ever you want to explain it. and will always be accepting of a child that may be big mixed. The color the gender. And so, for some people, you have. actor okay."

And then, when you take them out of the car see that they can start having seizures and stuff and i'm like i'm thinking, I was like I got this three hour drive reports and a couple days I was like we're gonna be somebody every half hour I was freaking out."
191.0,Provider,"My toe horsey you know what I would do a lot whenever my children we travel I would sit in the back seat with them. Or if I ended up sitting in the front seat, if I had stuff pack I would always be I will like I will put something in front, you know how they have immobile and front and they will play with it. And then I was always checking on my hand my mirror down, so I can look at them and see them. And then I was always run a fee to Robin it tells a lot of times I set in a backward i'm and you have to pull over often any way to change you. mean, so I was like yeah. So we will pull obeid sometimes I change them in a car, but after we pulled over, but it was we were always hugging on them loving on them yeah our trips took much longer when I had children. It took it took four hours to get somewhere, it might take us, five, six, to get there. And then you always have to try to find a place to have a baby changing table so that's one reason why we got we ended up liking mcdonald's and chick fil a because they were always had that option. And chick fil a was always cleaner, so we can really lean towards chick fil a plus. Oh okay okay got your medicine sent. Alright, in.
