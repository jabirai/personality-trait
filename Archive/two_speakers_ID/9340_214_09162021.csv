214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking so what's new how you been feeling. But when you say that right what what is happening that makes you feel that way."
9340.0,Patient,suicidal or better.
214.0,Provider,Know suicidal and we'll talk about better but i'm trying to figure out what the queue is.
9340.0,Patient,"So, yesterday I was talking with a crisis counselor about it. And the stuff I talked about was like I felt really lonely and I didn't have anybody to rely on and but. Yes, also my problem also because, like, for me, I always felt like I had to help people. Just because of how I was raised, and how I felt like in my family, I was the third parent holding things together, like in their marriage whatever right. So if it transferred to other things to where I tried to have this helpful persona where I help people selflessly and like I don't tell them any of my problems so it's kind of like oh no you don't need to worry about me no i'm fine yeah you don't need to ask about okay or not. Why doesn't anybody care about me so it's kind of like that, and so all the things that I feel it's definitely because of my own doing. And I was thinking about like writing letters and stuff to my friends and family. Because I was like Oh, I want to reassure them that wasn't their fault that there's nothing that they could have done to like have helped me or make me feel better, but then like. I started telling my friends that which is new, for me, I don't usually tell my friends about money ideation and they told me like. Well, no matter what you do we would still miss you we would still want you back more than anything, and for me, the reason why I hesitate with telling my friends my issues is because. They feel it feels like they're busy all the time and I don't want to be like Oh well, they're they're like doing homework I shouldn't bother them, but then I started thinking like well if I read them I think they would want me to bother them. Rather than like me not saying anything at all, and just laying down so. it's just like part that and also just like part feeling like i'm not good enough for my family and how my parents don't actually want me as their kid and i'm not and I don't make them proud and. it's just stuff like that it's just like and a combination of school is just being like really stressful just like all those three things it made me feel very alone, and like I wasn't. yeah like my struggles. that nobody can understand I guess that's."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and and I want to validate that by saying so, when we worry about others and we don't worry about it ourselves, this is problematic right because everybody believes you're the you're the. you're like the peacemaker you're the. Good maker you're the feel good post, and I want you to I want you to lean on me, let me know what happens is when we take on the role everybody says she's totally fine we don't have to ask nothing so you become not a part of anything. Right you become secondary when you need to be primary so if you're going to say to a friend hey how you doing you also need to say hey listen. I will, I need to tell you, I want to hear about you, but I need you to listen to me to like set them up for we're going to be a partner in our communication, because I got stuff to I need to get Somebody tell me how they're looking at it right, you need to incorporate them into the fold."
9340.0,Patient,On both sides.
214.0,Provider,"Yes, yes. Because you're not asking, so there, they are presuming you are fine it's not that they're bad people it's not the dead, taking advantage of you have we don't ask no one's gonna bother with it basically."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I get worried about like because whatever I tell people like the serious stuff i'm at like a really vulnerable state and people say the wrong thing all things all the time and it's just like at that moment, is not the right time to see the."
214.0,Provider,Court thing. Because it's like.
9340.0,Patient,"I could just snap at any moment so. I need somebody to like. Just kind of be more sensitive just kind of there and just to. True, I guess."
214.0,Provider,"yeah, but I think you did great work with the crisis constantly, so I think you really. Like you really nailed it like you really identified how the overwhelming this and loneliness comes on. It comes on because we're not letting people know we too need to be heard, we too want to feel loved me too I need friendship I don't need to be the rock I like to be part of the rocks right. So, if this is really on a big moment of identification because, like if we can get our friends to realize, we too need help, then we've almost almost. repaired what was broken this is like a great moment. Okay, good okay."
9340.0,Patient,"So yeah I started like being a little more proactive with my friends, because I realized that they can't really help me if I don't show them my hand a little bit I think one of my problems is that, like I try to hide things a lot for people. Because I don't want people to worry about me but, in turn, I feel like they already do worry about me because I don't say anything so anyways so changing that and started telling my friends more that i'm not okay and. I need your help to make me feel like that there's something worth living for like I know this is like really serious to put on somebody but."
214.0,Provider,I.
9340.0,Patient,"Love alone and I don't feel like anybody cares about me please tell me, this is not the case."
214.0,Provider,"Right, you need to hear someone say out of their mouth, I need you, I love you you're important to me, we all need that validation, so I think this is very good, like the process may have taken a little long type identify, but now that we've identified, we know we need to tell other people. Oh, this is wonderful."
9340.0,Patient,"My account set up the crisis counselor Jason so honestly like consider telling my family my parents and I want to try to do that, even though it will be difficult i'm not going to come in, like thinking that they'll understand, I just want to let them be in the loop that may be like. I like oh I don't feel like you're proud of me or I don't feel like you actually care for me I just feel like i'm a burden and I don't want that to be the case so i've had a talk with my mom first and maybe."
214.0,Provider,"Very wonderful, because what you're saying is, I have no expectation of any response, but I need to let you know what i'm feeling. It that's wonderful really it's wonderful that you, you start to understand that your voice is important that your voice is you, you matter. wow this is this is pretty amazing i'm being honest, sometimes it takes individuals quite a while to get to this place where they're able to realize. You know what what the problem is I haven't put myself first I haven't. haven't told other people I I need to be wanted, I need I need you to be concerned, for me, I need to know I matter I think i'd be i'll be honest with you, I think what you did yesterday with counseling was amazing work you have to give yourself a lot of credit. you're very welcome very welcome and. i'm has Google and, by the way, so it's a little stressful because it really going yeah."
9340.0,Patient,"The only thing that's stressful is really physics, like everything else, I can kind of manage my own like today, I have like my discussion do for a political science science and. Like I know I can do it, this is kind of like stressed out I don't want to, but i'm gonna i'm gonna focus and work and maybe."
214.0,Provider,Go to the library.
9340.0,Patient,"To try, or at least try a new area not work in my room i'm gonna try work someplace that I don't normally work."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good."
9340.0,Patient,"What else do I talk about oh yeah so before the crisis cancer thing. I was talking to like a friend, I guess, like an extra. About like my suicidal thoughts because he's the only one that like usually hears about it, and I know that must be really stressful because I, you see, that person for somebody were like they just told me. Are you suicidal thoughts and all like the emotional stuff so I know that feeling very well I just feel like the way he handled how I felt was not the greatest at the moment and. So when I was telling him about like like my plans to like die I guess. To like write letters to my family my friends to search up like less messy ways to like kill myself, I guess, or a way that's like kind of less traumatizing. Everybody were to hang myself, maybe I could put like a trash bag over my head just to like nobody like sees my face or whatever like. gets even more traumatized I guess i'd be like less traumatizing as possible. That that's all I wanted to do and I was telling him this and he started telling me like Oh, when people kill themselves at the end of their life and they fight back. And that wasn't the right thing to say at the moment, like I said before, like when i'm in unstable state, just like try to be sensitive because, like any they did just like set me off even further and it's going to be like away from my goal aka to get better. So the reason why that set me off was because um. Because one and it felt like he wasn't taking me seriously oh like you're eager to try and do it like you're going to I want to live after that, like I don't think. magically l I would want to live after that and another reason was also because I was in a situation like that, not because out of my own doing I didn't want to die, but I was driving my car down the freeway. And I got into a car accident, and when I hit the side of the road there's like this residual back and forth feeling. And for me mistakenly I thought I was on the side of the bridge, I was like right balancing on top back and forth. I thought that was a teenager emotion, I thought oh my God i'm gonna die i'm going to fall i'm going to fall to my death and nobody's going to help me there's no way I can get out of this. Like the like the only thing I cared about in that moment, was my own safety, I only cared about cushioning my head protecting myself anything to just like see myself."
214.0,Provider,Why yeah.
9340.0,Patient,"So I remember that very scary Bowman, while I was suicidal and. yeah him telling me that, like it was his own experience, and like he knew what he was talking about. It made me feel like he was being presumptuous that he acted like he knew what he was talking about one really is no time for ego right now it's not it's no time for you to be citing facts or sources to me I don't need that right now. But I need emotional support I don't need statistics or whatever like I don't know what makes you think that I do anyway and plus now that I feel more upset because I remembered this horrible traumatic event that's happened to me. In a moment where I do want to die, where I wish that it did happen and that I did pass away, since then, and where did I end up like after that car accident, I want to die again. So really I don't know why he brought that up, but I really got me and I told him that, and he told me like that he's not going to apologize for upsetting me. And that I shouldn't assume that I know his life for his experiences and that like just really dumb stuff that you should not be saying to somebody the suicidal and. yeah so that's what set me off like way off the rails, because he wouldn't really help me after that he was like go call somebody go go get whoa just like stuff like that and it's not. it's not a really good feeling, especially since they are borderline that to be pushed away like that to be like anybody would feel terrible it's just like I feel like it's more amplified because. it's just like being abandoned is like one of my greatest fears, even if I don't want to admit it so just him to saying like go call somebody is kind of like it felt like as being given up on um so yeah and. i'm upset and I don't know if I am allowed to."
214.0,Provider,"Just hold on for a minute, and the reason I just wanted to stop you is it's what's happening here is you needed someone to listen, you weren't asking for commentator by So yes, you can be upset but on the flip side this person. is not a person of understanding right there it's you're going to do this well, let me tell you what I would do by that that's kind of what you said, the ego thing. So being upset is being also aware that not everyone has an understanding of how they should accept that conversation on what role they should play he may have been deflecting his own. Concern or his own bias by talking about other things right because that's what he kind of did deflected, so I think you should be upset but you also should know that going forward he's not a good resource right."
9340.0,Patient,"Like I cut them off, I mean i've been meaning to do that for a while, but I guess I needed like a stronger push I guess like a week."
214.0,Provider,"out so now you got it. Okay, good good yeah."
9340.0,Patient,"And and ever since like that conversation I started talking to my friends and they they gave me the support that I needed the stuff that I need to hear just saying like. TAO we would miss you so much, if you were gone like like we talked about like the suicide that happened, like in another high school back when we were in high school. Like a girl like killed herself and everyone has really upset about it, despite not knowing her and they told me like, even though they didn't know her they were upset so, how would they feel if someone close to them dislike. Right went up and die and I realized. Oh, they would be okay, with it, because for me. I remember, you said that I had like the delusion with conspiracies like. Right yeah with people talking to each other, oh, you should tell tell this to make your body, this one really I feel like the reason why I think everyone is lying to me, is because i'm lying to everyone else."
214.0,Provider,wow there you go.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like because I lie and say that i'm Okay, and this, and this, and that it feels like people don't actually know me. So, like when people say they do care do they actually mean it or not, and and just yeah it was like mine, it was mind blowing for me at at the moment, once I realized, I feel like everybody's not truthful to me because I haven't been truthful to them and i'm pretty projecting my own."
214.0,Provider,"You are exactly you are saying what you're doing, but just saying everybody else is involved in it, too, but real really it's because it's coming from you in the things you can do so there's an assumption here with some delusion that everyone else also is like that. But this was this is another amazing reflection about. You know what my obstacles, not that your optician has given you bad lenses but the way you view the world, you have to be very careful. and save yourself now wait a minute that that's because we said what's the chances that every person. Has each other's phone numbers that they will call up and be talking about you and you even said SLIM so sometimes we have to do is, we have to challenge the phone said wait a minute wait a minute. Now now it's it's about me or it's really this right, we have to, we have to implement the fact of it, so we can contradict the thought process but see between the crisis counselor and this. i'm watching you now process different like you're starting to realize Okay, maybe it's the way i'm thinking, maybe it's this maybe it's that you weren't doing that, before you were very much about. You know it's it's almost everyone against me no one really caring for me. So I think this is really, really an event, where we can say you know. you're doing you're moving up the ladder of understanding the way the world appears to you."
9340.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I I felt like. That, if I died, like the facade, which is a go away and people would suddenly be like oh say God she's gone finally oh I don't have to pretend to be your friend anymore."
214.0,Provider,And by that.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah and I think I feel that most with like. People that's closest to me like with my friends my family my family's like Oh, thank God, we don't take care of her anymore Oh, thank God, she was like a parasite to us."
214.0,Provider,Right.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I think for me i'm worried about being useful, even though that's Not a word that people should use this to describe themselves because people aren't tools. it's just like I feel like if I don't give anything to anyone, then I don't deserve the love them giving basically like conditional love I guess."
214.0,Provider,"I think you're right, but I think once you break the barrier by. getting ready to have this conversation with your mother you'll start to see that. The way you used to see things no longer will be the same meaning you're starting to challenge the way you think about things, and I think this is an important way. for you to realize, you are loved you are needed, everybody does care and if I take the time to include them all know that, instead of thinking, nobody does right because it's a thinking process it's nothing but that."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I think I don't share my suicidal thoughts because. One i'm scared of getting hurt and just like. People just say the wrong things so I feel discouraged, even more so to like share my issue, but to be honest and i'll feel like I give much to hold on to. When I tried to open up sometimes like I don't go into detail i'm just like oh yeah I have a feeling bad lately, I guess, and well what are people supposed to say to that so. I started showing more my hand starting to specify what the issue is trying to get more context and i'm actually getting the support that, like the more I put in the more I get."
214.0,Provider,"There you go there you go you just said it, that was fantastic by chance, a we meeting next week because I don't see nothing on the schedule."
9340.0,Patient,once a week.
214.0,Provider,"Oh, when do you want to meet next."
9340.0,Patient,"Thursday, around this time is fine."
214.0,Provider,"I, so let me just double check, please. So I got a small snafu I have eight o'clock which is five o'clock your time does that work. yeah okay awesome so let me take care of that. oops. We put that in their medications working."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I think so. That kind of bothers me is like. I could keep running out at the two week mark and it's not exactly during the time when I go to group so it's like I always missed some days and it feels like my brain can't handle that change of like constantly getting medicine and then not having medicine and it's like. Essentially I want like enough for months, at least I don't know I mean, I have a schedule, I mean, I have an appointment to talk about I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"She she's one one thing I will give her credit for, is knowing how to care for patients and listening. she's really a good listener, so I don't think there's nothing to be scared of I think you couldn't ask for better person who's taking care of your prescriptions because of the impact So you see her on the 30th. And I actually worked with her on Monday i'll have that discussion with her ahead of time and see how she feels and see if we can cultivate some understanding early is that good for you, yes."
9340.0,Patient,"Yes, one more thing that i'm also thinking about i'm sorry to realize. I guess my dad is kind of like. I don't know he's done some really questionable things and for a while, I thought it was normal but i'm slowly realizing maybe this is not Okay, this is not normal. yeah because it's such like a subtle issue many people don't see like a problem with it, but. I guess like. So stuff you were worried about when I was a kid it's just like a other men, I guess. Like you specifically and my cousins from my mom's side like he would worry that I would get assaulted by them and I, it was like almost like an obsession like he was expecting it to happen. And I don't know why he kept thinking that. And like as I grew up. Like in elementary school I tried to sit on his. lap like any kid does and then he would push me off, he made it feel kind of weird. Because yeah I didn't understand why I was like he was pushing me off, I thought, maybe like get mad at me or something and. Like me, babysit it at the time, too, so whenever he put another kid puts another kid on his lap It made me feel bad. Absolutely yeah when probably he was making it something that it wasn't like. Maybe from his point of view me wanting to keep sitting on his lap with me like trying to make some weird advances I don't know what that was all about. And also, when I was younger I would take baths like my best friend, but like we were really young, so I didn't think it was a big deal and I don't think it should be, because we were kids. where he thought I would be less because of that, not that that's an issue, but like that's weird, that is, first, that would come to that."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but you you realize this is culturally something culturally, you know men father is manly daughter his daughter, this should be no women. Although daughter interaction of intimacy other kids are fine, but not blood children, children, taking BATs you know how society is with systemic lies two to two people in the bathtub. This is going to create a sexual dysfunction and they have all these biases and what it really is is on education right. But it's it's brought up inherently through whatever parenting he received so he has this ultimate implicit bias, maybe, and he doesn't know how to get over it, but it impacted you and that's what he missed right that's what he missed. He has another kid he's not concerned, how you feel about it what it looks like and you feel like you're the effective. Right and he couldn't own that listen towel for me this, this is not what a father is supposed to do, because you're a girl and i'm a boy. And that conversation never to place and you feel like it's your fault, or you did something when really it's him having either ignorance or bias so again it's it's actually another person's problem, but it impacted you."
9340.0,Patient,"To expand a little more. Like maybe maybe it is a cultural thing I heard that before. But then he started to do things and made me feel like a little unsafe, I guess, which was just like removing the lock off my door for really dumb reasons, because I want to keep the door open like. Why would I want to I don't want you to know what i'm doing, because this is how I am not doing anything weird I just like if i'm doing homework, I want to do in secret, I don't want you guys to like barbra Jean. Like fail my English is something I don't know but yeah. yeah he took the lock off my door and it caused me to like develop this sensitivity towards people and they're walking across my room. I started feeling like oh they're gonna come in."
214.0,Provider,you're vulnerable because you can't. Secure yourself I get that.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah and I would worry because, like when he goes to work things back good night. And I would worry that like because I don't have a lock on my door I wouldn't be able to protect myself against my dad. And I had like this really weird fear of him assaulting me because he keeps talking about it and it's like he's expecting it to happen, but for me it feels like he's saying this because he wants to do something similar, maybe that's not the case, but it's definitely coming off with that."
214.0,Provider,Absolutely.
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I had a ton of nightmares of him doing that to me, and I would just constantly stay awake at night just. Just like making sure he's not coming in my room, making sure that he's asleep big issue that i'm going to be okay, and he just I don't know whatever like I wear stuff like shorts or whatever. Like I learned with other people their parents when they want them to change closely to say oh go change they don't get too specific my dad does he points out like. Like what he sees and what's wrong and that's kind of like really gross to me, I guess, and krista a lot of people, I guess, when I tell them that, so I guess it's not just me."
214.0,Provider,it's not you but remember and I don't want you to believe i'm taking his side i'm validating you this is definitely a cultural thing. Because this is not the norm.
9340.0,Patient,learn more about the cultural thing.
214.0,Provider,"I would, I would learn up and also learn about conditioning as a child. You get conditioned into the child it's not about what's right or wrong it's what your mother and father constantly instilling you it becomes what's right or wrong versus. right or wrong with you know how should you talk to your daughter, what are the approaches, but all the appropriate. huggins and holdings of a daughter versus you've been told that that's totally wrong, this is evil by his perception has been tainted because of the way he was brought up. It has nothing to do with us so yeah we would benefit you. To read up on on on you know the culture and within he grew up because, not that I need you to get understanding, I want you to know it's not you. Okay, and that's important to you."
9340.0,Patient,"yeah I guess it's just like a little weird and gross whenever he gets like even when I was younger he would point out, like the growth of my stuff and I always always weird but then it's not like it's not outright assault or anything so it's not like."
214.0,Provider,"No, but it's very that's uncomfortable language it's it's the. And maybe that's his intent is to make you uncomfortable maybe he thinks that's the way to get you. I don't know to change your whatever maybe he's not well versed in how to have a proper communication with his daughter. to just say hey listen, can you rethink that outfit please why we don't need to go into specifics about anything but we can have a a ginger conversation that you know. You know, maybe that's not the best offer for today, instead of commenting on body parts and so on, to make somebody feel really awkward he he doesn't it doesn't seem like he has that ability and I would say that that's part of conditioning."
9340.0,Patient,"I do hear a lot, so I guess just whenever I hear about like. Oh it's a cultural thing i'm like Okay, but it still makes you uncomfortable."
214.0,Provider,"Right yeah it doesn't help me that his his conditioning. is present great for him, but what do I do with his conditioning, can I own conditioned him, can I can I enlighten him to educated facts can I have this conversation not sure that's possible but just understanding how people get conditioned. Through a culture, I think, would help you understand that it's not you it is him, and you know as we get older as adults, we don't change much. So then we're good for. So make sure we're good for the 23rd at five o'clock your time right. Yes, it is. perfect. Okay well with that said Thank you so much, and you know if you ever need me you call the virtual clinic and they'll get a hold of me. Right, you have a great day. Okay bye bye."
