14755.0,Patient,Now.
214.0,Provider,"Again I can't. say it seemed like there was the need to do something, but we're not able to find the stimulus in which to get it going and getting engaged is that accurate."
14755.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,What do you think is missing from the equation in order to get moving.
14755.0,Patient,"um well, I mean I kind of have started getting moving on SOFA I actually got called back from a job. I started getting stuff ready, so I could go back to school do chemical engineering here and hopefully the spring, maybe the summer, if everything goes according to plan. But still, like, I still feel like i'm kind of like. In the same. place right now, I guess, I just have started getting stuff moving a little bit. I don't know things are just going to kind of take a little bit of time part is like i'm gonna have to get you know it takes a while to get on boarded and stuff like that, with a new job. School I just it's just a lot of uncertainty, right now, with everything you know."
214.0,Provider,So things are moving but are they not moving as fast as you'd like them to move is that really what's happening.
14755.0,Patient,"yeah Well, this is also a new like I just got these calls last night from the jobs. But also yeah I mean i've been working on it for like a month or two at this point so yeah I would say, not as fast as i'd like."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and what about this gym. thing getting active and exercising, what is your thoughts on now."
14755.0,Patient,"I really need to get back in the gym this is definitely the most out of shape that have ever been in my life it's just like. I got to work a seven and I get home at five and i'm just i'm just so exhausted by the end of the day that it's hard for me to find like the motivation energy to go do that, especially with transportation issues and stuff like that."
214.0,Provider,So were you able to be for this all to place you able to get to the gym.
14755.0,Patient,"yeah I was but, honestly I hadn't been going very frequently even before all of this i'd say that I. haven't like. there's probably like a five year five six year period, where I was going like almost every day and then just kind of fell off, especially like my last year down in Athens and this year so. I don't know this is just all kind of motivated me to like want to get back into it. it's just been. difficult to accomplish doing that."
214.0,Provider,"Just Out of curiosity, we really haven't been consistent with our trying to re engage in it, when you see me, are you seeking the actors exercise."
14755.0,Patient,"I feel like it'll be like a healthy like. outlook I don't know like a good way to like stress relief and stuff like that. And just generally feeling healthy, you know being feel like it'll help with like sleeping at night more thoroughly and. You know just feeling more energy and healthy in general."
214.0,Provider,"I mean i'm not gonna disagree, I think that you know that whole thing about happy hormones if we're if. I mean if if we're not doing something to keep the body in motion we're going to feel sluggish and lethargic and pretty lazy so but i'm just wondering if that is the goal we should be focused on."
14755.0,Patient,"Oh, what would you what would you think that."
214.0,Provider,"So my my thought is like I kind of feel like. i'm getting the. Communication that like you feel you feel what you're currently doing, although you have a degree in it is kind of dried up it's not providing you. The mustard you want, and now we're going into this engineering degree and obviously you want to solve with your girlfriends relationship i'm just wondering if if if part of the exercises will affect exercise i'll feel better fox do better, you know you know i'll be able to do more. i'm just wondering if that's your rationale with the exercise."
14755.0,Patient,I mean that's definitely yeah that's definitely part of. My train of thought.
214.0,Provider,"But what at what i'm always concerned with whether it's exercise to change the behavior is how do we feel we don't do it. Or we worse. Because we didn't do it, or we worse for thinking about that we should do it and we haven't done like I don't know which one. And maybe worse isn't the right word, maybe that's My only concern, but we put things on our plate that are ready to be dealt with. And then you know we become a little debbie downer because it's like damn I should have where devices, I can get to the gym I didn't have time to go to the gym I want to do, but it's not something I should be focused on. Right yeah my concern."
14755.0,Patient,"yeah there definitely is. You know, going on in general, right now, but I still have like. A couple hours of free time every day when I get home and I just kind of feel extra you know bad i'm just sitting at home, not really accomplishing anything."
214.0,Provider,Do you have a gym membership.
14755.0,Patient,Do have planet fitness membership. There to cancel it so every time.
214.0,Provider,"I know. Because I was gonna say if it's. If it's basically the logistics of getting they're traveling there or getting picked up and whatever you know they're there is so many different things that we can do at home to cultivate the same. stimulus. i'm not saying that's a solution i'm just saying you know we got a membership we're paying form we're now using it, and I know we should probably rethink that first and then see maybe we should do a month to month, you know whether it's peloton whether it's pro form, whether it's apple. And just be of instead of worrying about how am I going to get this shouldn't takes me how far it's a whole hour like I don't know trying to give you suggestions you know to how you can, and then you can do them when you want as often as you want. And I don't know."
14755.0,Patient,"yeah it's just I mean it's just even when I was younger and live with my parents it's always been difficult for me to like motivate myself when i'm in my house to do exercises like I feel like I need to be somewhere. In for the same with the same with like studying and stuff like that, like if i'm at home it's kind of difficult for me to like focus on that, rather than five would go like to the library and sit down, then I always feel like that helps me focus on like the task at hand."
214.0,Provider,"or enough because i'm a workout i've been working on for years and it's seven days a week, you know, independent and they came in the gyms close the window alternatives there were no alternatives. So, then, I went to you know home base solutions and I love it because I actually can do it more often and my convenience in my own home, but I adapted, but I do understand, would you say about you know it's hard to do it in the home, but depend epic has helped me transition. To facing anywhere anytime. And i'm like i'm glad this kind of happened because actually exercise more now, because every time I have an opportunity to exercise my. exercise the gym only gave me one window, although I did like. Having all the different machines and. I get that but, like I don't know i'm just trying to give you like i'm just wondering like. Hoping that this is going to like pump up more motivation and more happiness, or is it still basically like dealing with the situation in the alcohol I don't know how and you said you last time I was in group to me, you said you've got some good well. good ones."
14755.0,Patient,But some yeah.
214.0,Provider,Bob with bookings.
14755.0,Patient,"They don't I mean they just my lawyer, said that he doesn't think they're gonna give me the the felony charge just the just."
214.0,Provider,what's.
14755.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"And I just I want to be careful with the gym, but I also want to empower the way I I know for me that that is part of. me staying healthy and just being able to deal with my long workout so I always encourage you, but then i'm always concerned if we can't do it, what is, I feel like that's why I brought that up."
14755.0,Patient,"Man yeah that would mean that's definitely like part of. My dilemma, right now, like I just kind of feel. More gross and Bob ish because I know I do have like time and ability to go that I just kind of like i'm not so yeah I guess it would be like it's more you know, on myself if I tried to keep trying to start a routine and fail, but."
214.0,Provider,"And I think that. And that's why you know I when I use like working on an exercise and very easy with those words because for certain people majority of people that can't do it, you just get into routine because it needs to be committed. And I often feel they feel worse because they can, unlike then pull away from that from away from. You know, trying to accept that this isn't something you can do right Well, this is something that will ever be able to not in your case but i'm just saying like I would start. somewhere like I would go to the gym and still see if you find that thrill of being out and in a place to go to like it gives you a commitment, because you have to get there. Meanwhile you're paying for something so that should ultimately be. To you know your system where should not paying for some ordinary music. I really like about that, but that's kind of where i'm at with them."
14755.0,Patient,yeah I feel.
214.0,Provider,I will just take it take it one step at a time so we're we're still on our birthday on track for Friday right and not national.
14755.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,As the medication been.
14755.0,Patient,"it's been good, the amitriptyline has kind of given me some nights worse, but besides that it's been going well."
214.0,Provider,anxiety anything has changed in all those.
14755.0,Patient,i'm sorry what was that.
214.0,Provider,You said in depression or anxiety thinking teams.
14755.0,Patient,"I just felt. Better in the last few weeks, especially with like anxiety it hasn't been like as uncontrollable like it's not like when it starts it just keeps going and going going."
214.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Right and we found that improvement so that's I think we gotta do is just keep my ear to ear and then figure out what you need to do to be motivated because see just looking at it from this perspective. you're doing it looks like you're making the change the rules speed school, so all that means not today. But as long term not short term it's a good don't get me wrong i'm giving you accolades, for I think what happens is there's a point when we start looking at all the things we're doing well again we're doing ship, but like that is really going to happen to later, so I. feel the void, I need to do something now like I need to keep busy now. And maybe that's where that workout is coming in that."
14755.0,Patient,Definitely yeah 100% because I feel like i'm doing like a lot like. there's no like immediate. You know.
214.0,Provider,"Again, and that's why it just a clue of something you probably understand this is why people can't stay in a workout regimen because they just don't see the results they want to see after the visit like. Like Come on, I don't I guess it's it's up it's a whole different way of living it's a whole different way of commitment and it takes long term to figure out the benefit, and most of us are short term is because we want to be satisfied so just be careful with that. So what i'm gonna do is i'm i'll review my calendar and then we'll go back and forth with chance is this our second show in October."
14755.0,Patient,know we have a Mossad we have our next one is set for October 25. And I can't remember the time for that.
214.0,Provider,"i'll double check it before group in this one, we already know that we get our to win and we'll go from there okay."
14755.0,Patient,sounds good.
214.0,Provider,And you keep up the good work enjoy your girlfriend and just take it easy.
14755.0,Patient,"All right, thanks."
214.0,Provider,You to.
