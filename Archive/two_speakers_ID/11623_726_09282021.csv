726.0,Provider,"No you're good I I let them know just now, but sometimes if I if I let them know they don't always update charts so I have to it's a whole process. So just in just in the future don't worry about today put in the future, just try to go in through virtual clinic because if not, it doesn't show like you came to your appointment."
11623.0,Patient,"i'm gonna i'm gonna take my ear but out and see that i'm upstairs it's just me and the dog just because. I don't know like you're frozen right now. Okay, so I don't know. But uh yeah. But um I wanted to let you know to just because I kind of wanted like a document trail dad last Thursday, and I did call virtual and I let them know but we had a really bad storm in Michigan and we lost power. So we were out of power. yeah late. o'clock Wednesday night at one out and Thursday. So I didn't want. Okay, my phone because, as far as power went. zoom meeting usually will drain my. phone battery so. I did call let them know, though. Okay, just because i'm always been in compliance, so I just like to make sure they know, everybody knows what's going on."
726.0,Provider,"Well that's much appreciate it, and I think I heard from other other clients that I have they have a similar situation where they had lost power for and had no electricity."
11623.0,Patient,So yeah.
726.0,Provider,That must have been really uncomfortable.
11623.0,Patient,"Well, it was, but we had a really huge tree and old tree. That went down and a lot of them on our road that were old big but they I didn't realize they were like so many of them had been dry rotted so luckily didn't go on the House it went the other way towards the. Road because it was a big it was a real mature old tree huge. Oh yeah I know from work. One head went down in our neighbor's yard and he's he's up he's very about 70 so I was over there and. Then, an hour later ours went. One of ours so yeah it was crazy crazy weather so."
726.0,Provider,"yeah well how are you doing, how are the jobs and your living situation and."
11623.0,Patient,"Work yeah. The dogs are doing good i've been working overtime just trying to get caught up a little bit and get some money saved. So, and my granddaughter's doing really good Simon seen her afterwards today. So she's a nice almost a month old here."

11623.0,Patient,"yeah everything's good. She does that she looks. Like her dad and then I see her mom and. yeah I was, I was kind of thinking, I would, but I see more of my son in her though yeah and she's just such a good baby she so far she's been a really content, no, no cry and the first thing but she's a month old so. yeah yes very good baby it's just it's amazing for me to watch my son because he's just a i'm watching a change on growing into you know, a man and he's just yeah she's his everything right now so yeah it's really nice it's really nice so."
726.0,Provider,"i'm glad, things are going well."
11623.0,Patient,The dogs are good everybody's. yeah it seems to be dealing good get ready for winter so. Because we're going to probably have a pretty cold winter.
726.0,Provider,"yeah how I said i'm. In Michigan how is, though, I mean I know it's probably cold, but do you tend to get a lot of snow storms in your area."
11623.0,Patient,I can't hear you.
726.0,Provider,get a lot of storms.
11623.0,Patient,"Let me see it, maybe it's my. Let me see if it's my connection Cindy i'm just."
726.0,Provider,wondering because.
11623.0,Patient,"Okay now you're yeah let's see now it's froze up again so. i'm. Okay, you seem to be okay, right here okay i'm sorry I didn't hear you I heard something about stores, but edenic glitch out again."
726.0,Provider,So I meant i'm storm like St or like in Michigan do you tend to get a lot of a lot of that in the wintertime.
11623.0,Patient,"And we did last year right around February, I believe, and it was it was a lot of snow. And I wish we had pretty much white out for two days. But yeah so I mean it just depends because it's Michigan sometimes it's just cold but it's we don't get a lot of snow. mom and then we'll just get like a you know. It periodically will get you know a little bit of snow and then it's you know it's just you never know anymore, but. I don't know I just seems like it's getting colder quicker this year. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"It looks like or hopefully you'll be in a concert even you're in a comfortable situation now, it seemed like where you're at so at least that you know you know, can it be out. In any of that cold weather."
11623.0,Patient,"Or at least I know i'm with right, at least if we got snowed in, and I know i'd be look decent people We probably have some candles going and. play some games or cards or something though yeah i'm not too concerned about it, to be honest. yeah so Oh, I wanted to tell you, too, that I brought up to the doctor at my last group about. At least you know getting every two weeks on my medication. Okay, because I had been in compliance. I hadn't missed any groups or anything like that, and she did she did grant it for me so. Ray I still. yeah yeah so and I do still plan to do my groups, you know, every week. But I think. By the sounds of it, I have an option to do that every other week too. So I will talk to her personally. yeah i'll talk to her personally, though, next time, because I I kind of said something right in our group, and our counselor in there had made a comment about sometimes people think they're ready for weeklies when they're really not or something I don't know. Something like that and I maybe. I took it wrong. Maybe I did, but I kind of got the impression, she doesn't realize by journey, because I, you know. i've been on this for like. Seven years before and I was getting my scripts every three months so i'm ready to go with every two weeks and not abuse the medication plus you know. And so, as my doctor that I want to start. getting on, you know, and I mean lowering at not going. So yeah you know, I was kinda I didn't know how to take that you know, because not all of us are in the same boat, you know so maybe she was just making a general statement blanket statement across the board for our group. I don't know but um. yeah anyway, the doctor dead go ahead and gave me because it's just with me work and these hours you know what I mean and i'm up at three in the morning, going to see every week it's just a pain in the by you know, and I mean it's i'd rather you know I can go every two weeks. yeah I can so that I think those types of situations and she's not my therapist. I shouldn't be just making a blanket statement right group about that kind of stuff Do you know what I mean because Maybe she was concerned that. Other people in the group who aren't ready might want. yeah same I don't know but um."
726.0,Provider,I wonder if. Anybody.
11623.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know um. I was just I think I was a little irritated because. Of the how deep The response was Do you know what I mean, because then there was. A comment about people not participating in group discussion and I thought, well, I always do that but usually get interrupted it's the truth by other people in the group do you know, and I mean. And they try to. You know defuse it as much as they can so like I said, maybe it was just me being insensitive or maybe she just wanted to make a blanket statement that people have to go to all you know all their. Their groups their therapies their surveys there that yeah which. I do. So yeah."
726.0,Provider,"And maybe maybe it wasn't I mean I don't know what this one's or anything but I wonder if if it was said, also because, maybe there's other people in different stages of recovery that maybe. They would get the idea to want to two weeks when maybe they not you, but maybe they are not ready for it, or something."
11623.0,Patient,"that's yeah it's a man's. Probably closer to what it was yeah I do I think that's probably closer to what it was, but I do think like what that kind of stuff I should just do like a text, whereas just between the doctor. you're not I mean if I have. Those type of questions because, like you said you know there's usually always at least three or four people that are out of compliance and group so maybe that's why she said. yeah not kidding I remember her name. Like I don't remember who she is. Who what her name was but. anyway. I just like I said. yeah, I just wanted you to know to as far as me missing group last week that's why. yeah No, sorry yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Now I appreciate the arm the communication that that you are doing with us, so I appreciate that. that's good to know."
11623.0,Patient,"Thank you. yeah yeah. yeah I really don't have much new going on. yeah but like I said i'm just working, and you know, trying to. trying to get some money saved up get my car, you know ready for winter too so. yeah yeah. Tell yours, all that kind of stuff."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah the winter tires.
11623.0,Patient,Where are you Cindy like what state are you.

11623.0,Patient,"Okay, all right. yeah there was like one. Well, when you asked me about Michigan I was like well I know she's not Michigan. yeah that's funny."
726.0,Provider,"I think I should also other they're. Here it's actually it's been like it gets humid and it gets hot and then it gets it cools down so it's just like today's kind of rainy but. But I think I need to start checking Michigan weather, because I have groups with all my people i'm Michigan or Ohio and I think it's good for me to know cuz. Like you said, like you had that happen because i'm in a different place like I wouldn't know that but it's good for me to know for for the people that i'm working on so."
11623.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah I didn't know if anyone else. had called in, do you know what I mean because I didn't know if it was just isolated to my town, but I heard other places, you know they were you know, like an hour away from me they some of them had lost power to like sterling. heights area which is like. 3030 minutes for me and then you know my son who's, on the other side of town he didn't lose this power at all. wow I mean it was kind of. Like a hit or miss yeah yeah so. My concern was just get a copy that. You know. morning because all the Everything was shot down. And I got one little lady actually lives in my town. But she works. right down the road from where I work and we're like 30 minutes from town and she says to me, what are you doing up this early and I said, well, I keep report year and she said well so did I, and I said Thank you so much for opening up the gas station. And she said she always opens up at 430. because she has like the guys that work for the electric company that come in and start work at five so she likes to have. It up and going for them."
