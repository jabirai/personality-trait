528.0,Provider,"yeah well um I mean, I know I we met kind of the other, we mean we met in group the other night but I didn't really get to talk one on one so yeah. You know I figure we'll spend most of today just kind of I really just want to kind of hear your story and kind of understand where you're coming from so that way we can come up with the best plan for you. yeah that sounds good."
14121.0,Patient,yeah perfect.
528.0,Provider,"All right, um so yeah where do you want to start, I mean maybe just telling me a little bit about yourself and kind of what brought you here and what you're hoping to get out of treatment."
14121.0,Patient,"Well, I. i'm very overweight and. not happy with my body and myself and. i've tried many, many diets and restricting and just like nothing I do I can't stick to anything. You know I do well for a couple weeks, and then I think I need I should have lost 10 pounds already, and then I just get frustrated and. You know it's I can't I just I need to change my mindset and I know and i'm a binge eater So if I get frustrated or bored or lonely or I turned to food. And sometimes I can control that sometimes I can't I mean it's like I just once I start I just kind of can't stop. yeah i've never i've never purged but they've been you know the bingeing is really is still there and. I just it was weird I was sitting at work, one day, I work for the county I met in the accounting department, but. We do some you know medical billing and claiming because we see patients are nurses doing stuff and. So I had an appointment or a meeting with the blue cross Blue Shield representative and he was going through all of the services that they provide, and this came up right heart health or therapy and I was like. I had a chicken to that, and then I did, and it was like it was just like weird like you know, like it was almost meant to be because I had already met my deductible so then my insurance pays for it and it's not costing you anything right now. um I don't know so I just decided to go for it because I have i've had a lot of trauma not not trauma, like most people. I mean other people have had like I was never abused or you know my parents were together for 50 years I didn't you know have those kinds of things, but. In my I mean my dad was an alcoholic when I was growing up, and you know he treated my mom kind of crummy sometimes he never abused her anything but he was verbally. You know, abusive and when I was a senior in high school he actually got a dui, which was the best thing that could have ever happened because he spent the night in jail, he smashed up his truck and. That was a turning point for him."
528.0,Provider,Oh.
14121.0,Patient,"And so, he didn't drink anymore ever again. You know, up until the day he passed away so. It was really a good thing that that happened and yeah. You know so, but then after I went to college and I got married really young I was only 20 and while we waited five years to have kids. I don't know I just I struggled financially my my ex husband couldn't hold down jobs, and it was. Not fun very stressful. Constantly yeah. You know I my daughter was born and. She was like four and a half, when my son was born and then I found out that my ex husband was cheating and so I left I just decided i'm not you know I can't. Do this plus he kind of wanted to be with her, so we separated when my my son was about six months old, and you know, then I was on my own for with them for about four years and. You know that was stressful because he's a real piece of shit. You know didn't. didn't take the kids when you were supposed to do, you know that he was wrapped up in his new life."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"So I struggled with that my daughter, you know and whatever and and then I met somebody else, so my my first husband was really the life of the party, you know very fun. So I met somebody who was like the complete opposite of that in that Oh, he must be stable, you know, and this is what I need in my life, and so we got married. uh huh and very quickly, I learned that it wasn't you know, I was the again the supporter of you know. bailing him out of things and he had four kids said he had to teach child support for and. It was like there were times when. I don't know he wasn't he wasn't a true partner with me like he didn't want to pay bills and he would spend our money or bill money and whatever and then, when we were. We had been married for. Six years. my daughter was diagnosed with leukemia. Okay, and so, then it became that battle. And you know I. While my marriage wasn't great it wasn't terrible I mean, and you know so. She dealt with that for. Almost well three years of treatment and then she was declared cancer free which I don't think she ever really was, but she felt pretty good for about seven months and then she got sick again, and she had the first time she had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. And then. In May of her senior year she was diagnosed with. acute myeloid leukemia so a different. Worse form. Okay, she had to have a bone marrow transplant that summer and. her body just shut down and she just couldn't. She couldn't handle it hang on my son is trying to call me. Can you still see me okay um so anyways she was very sick and spent the last month of her life on a ventilator and then passed away it'll be six years ago on October 13. So, so this time of the years really hard for me. yeah because what plays in my head. Get emotional, but is. Okay, on September 22 was the last time I got to hear her voice. You know this day was the last time I got to see your open your eyes. You know those kinds of things and then. You know, you know, ultimately, she passed away and. it's just it's hard and then I actually did get divorced from my second husband, because he just wasn't there for me and we weren't there was no intimacy in our relationship and. I think that he just. like to have the stability that I provided for him and I was just like this is not fair to me and. I used to you know he worked like Tuesday through Saturday. And I asked him to find a different job, where he didn't have to work every Saturday, or you know. Work every other Saturday or anything and he just wasn't willing to do that, you know for our family and I always did things by myself with my friends or he just was never there. Man, I thought to myself. If i'm going to be by myself, I might as well be by myself."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"You know if we had a great marriage and I was by myself at things then fine, but I wasn't or we didn't, and so I asked him to leave and so that was, I think, four years ago and we've been divorced for like three years. Okay, and i've been much, much, much happier since he's been out of my life."
528.0,Provider,Okay that's good.
14121.0,Patient,"i've figured out how to. manage my own finances, you know, and I have a budget now that I have all my money set aside for my bills. For each pay period and they come out automatically I don't have late payments and that, for me, is just been a huge stress reliever you know um so the in that part i'm happy. Oh, they still have the grief. And you know, while it gets less. I mean I wouldn't say, less is I guess easier to handle. Right my. mom. And my son is 19 he'll be 20 this year, and he. he's just a great kid I mean he's like the light of my world and. He you know he graduated from high school barely which he graduated that's all I cared about. yeah and then. In his senior year he also went to a tech school and got a diesel mechanic degree. Okay, so. He graduated from high school and tech school in the same year last year. wow he's been working full time and just you know he just is a great kid. And he does still live with me, which I I like. You know i've been trying to teach him the ways of the world where he has to pay me $100 a week and his own cell phone bill and his own car insurance and. pays his own things and. it's just really it's good."
528.0,Provider,Nice.
14121.0,Patient,"But i'm sometimes i'm still only I long, for you know, a partner in life to do things with and. yeah that can be hard. But and then my best friend moved away to Arizona this summer."
528.0,Provider,Oh gosh.
14121.0,Patient,"And that was that was really difficult, I mean it's almost like a death, even though I. she's not a talk on the phone person. She likes to text which is fine. But she was always my person like you know something funny happens during the day you texter you know what I mean and it's like I. For a while I felt like okay I quit doing that you know just cuz I can't depend on her I don't see her, I mean we we we were tie each other at least once a week she'd lived really like two miles from me and stuff but. I don't know, then, once you got settled in and things settle down for her we did facetime a couple of times, and you know, then I felt better I mean you can have a beer over facetime. Somebody. You know, and I just felt like she. didn't care that she didn't see me anymore, you know. When vince became and visit what I had a graduation party for my son a couple weeks ago. Because we couldn't do it last year because of Colvin. Right she came she came to the party which was really nice I got to spend a couple days with her, and you know she kind of has expressed that she misses me and so i'm gonna go visit her in November, like the week of thanksgiving. mm hmm so it's just it's just different. So I mean like I said I haven't had trauma trauma but."
528.0,Provider,You know.
14121.0,Patient,"My whole life has been nothing but financial chaos and. dress you know I think there was a time that I like I didn't when I didn't have chaos, a bit of you know chaos, a time a small window of time when I didn't have such chaos I didn't know what to do with myself, I may have said that in our."
528.0,Provider,Meeting the other day yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"My daughter's treatment to it was like. You know you go go go go go. And like i've been. so accustomed to living that way that now that I have. My shit together, so to speak, financially."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"You know I used to be scared to get the mail, because I didn't know what was going to be in the mail. You know my ex wouldn't pizza he was going to pay our House payment and then he didn't and then I would get an A noticing, it was 30 days late and."
528.0,Provider,Oh gosh yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"All of that and. You know, when you go from that to so it's just been an adjustment and."
528.0,Provider,"yeah sounds like you know you have more time to kind of focus on you and, like. yeah but like it kind of sounds like it feels a little it's not easy to do that, like you're not used to like slowing down, and you know. Right not running around doing things for other people, or whatever like you're. Now it sounds like. you're ready to like. focus on yourself."
14121.0,Patient,"Right and you think you know I would if i'm not happy with myself and my weight you think I would just embrace that and run with it, and you know but something's holding me back from being. Healthy and happy. Oh. My knees hurt really bad I have arthritis in my knees and. I mean you know realistically think Okay, if you lose 20 pounds your knees might not hurt as bad. You lost. 30 pounds, they would really not you know what I mean it's like. I can't I just do one pound at a time and be satisfied with that."
528.0,Provider,"will come talk. Can can we talk about that i'm i'm really curious about kind of what you're. Like history, I know you said you've done a lot of diets and i'd love to kind of find out more about like what you've done and, like kind of just going through like. What you've done kind of what the outcome was like when this all happen like I like to do so sort of like a timeline if that makes."
14121.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,Would you mind if we did that.
14121.0,Patient,"Sure, so when I was growing up, I didn't have weight issues I but I mean in high school, I was on the dance team and we practiced two hours literally every day, except the weekends so. It didn't really matter what I ate but I didn't overeat either, but I. I never felt like I was fat, I mean I had like bigger legs and my boss was probably bigger than other people, but I never felt like overweight overweight. Okay, and then you know when you go to exercising every day for two hours and go to college and don't exercise at all, it doesn't take long. You know, we were eating pizzas at night for during our studying and whatever and so for long your clothes don't fit you know, and it was more than the freshman 15 but you just don't really notice. I guess at first right. And then you know, then I met my my husband and. I don't know, I guess, so I probably weighed like 145 or whatever during high school. Okay, and then, when I met you know when I was dating him and stuff I probably was probably went up to like one at you know somewhere around in there."
528.0,Provider,was out there.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah and then after I met him and we got together and then um so I went to a university for one year and then I decided to go to a Business School so, then I That was a two year degree. Okay, and then, when we got married I wasn't. I don't know I wasn't. But I remember thinking in college one time, this is really kind of messed up but I remember thinking be kind of cool that to, I guess, I must have been up in the 180s or whatever, because I remember thinking myself be kind of cool to if I got 200 pounds than to say that I lost 50 pounds."
528.0,Provider,Oh interesting.
14121.0,Patient,"Very messed up right, and so I must have been you know hovering around that. No, but. And then you know when my daughter was born I don't know I must have probably been around that wait for like a long time I maybe went over. 200 when I had her and stuff and but I never I mean I probably was a size 18 maybe I don't know but I didn't feel uncomfortable you know what I mean. yeah and then, when when I. When I left my my husband well when my daughter was like three. There was a time when I was very stressed out like though that was one of the times, where I was afraid to get the mail and things like that and. He he went and bought a snowmobile wrote a check for a snowmobile and we didn't have the money for it, so I had to go use my credit card to get cash mean those are the kind of things that I had to deal with like."
528.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that way."
14121.0,Patient,"My dad like I can't control anything you know I just felt like everything was chaos so. I would. Like pick up my daughter from daycare and come home and then I would run around the House like a chicken with my head cut off picking up and doing the dishes and just making sure every there was no clutter anywhere and then, finally I would I was able to like move on."
528.0,Provider,and
14121.0,Patient,"One day, she said to me mommy, why are you mad at me."
528.0,Provider,um.
14121.0,Patient,"And it just hurt me to my soul like. she thinks i'm mad at her as i'm stomping around the House, you know, probably upset with my husband, because you learned just moseying around or or whatever and. yeah I think I went to the doctor, like the next day, and he gave he put me on like Prozac you know just things iot type stuff he said I had and. I think, ever since then i've been on some sort of anxiety or depression medicine. Okay, and when my husband left or when we decided to break up, I went I will be you turn. Okay, and I lost like 55 pounds."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
14121.0,Patient,"But I was never hungry, I mean it's like it was. I know, had caught him off all the time, and you know I kind of slipped into a party kind of stage like when my kids weren't with me when they were with him, I had met these people that was actually my daughter's best friend's father. He lived just a few blocks away and he would have people over to watch football games and stuff in his garage so i'd hang out and we would drink a lot and. I think I just didn't eat much because I just I don't know and so, then I felt really good after you know losing 55 pounds my my friends were telling me all your clothes are too big you can't wear those pants anymore, you know that kind of thing and. I don't know, then I just kind of started gaining back again and. I don't know and then. About three years ago, maybe. My friend who moved away she decided to go to this weight loss program and it was like. You know she was monitored every week, and it was very intense and I thought i'm just going to do what she does, and then, so the program was you don't eat breakfast which is. i'm not a breakfast eater so I that was fit in well for me and then for lunch, you have four ounces of protein and a fruit and vegetable."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"And then you have the same thing for supper and that's basically it and I think I lost like and you do that for 40 days, and then I think I lost like 25 or 30 pounds. I mean it worked well for me. And then you kind of step back and I didn't eat any dairy and you know dairy I think is i've heard that it can be an kind of inflammatory in your body, so I I think I felt better too, but I don't know if it was the dairy part or not, or just the. And without the time like. My my husband and I weren't we're kind of I had asked him to leave too, and then I had met somebody, and so we were kind of. You know meeting up and. It was kind of exciting, you know what I mean, and so I think that probably helped to be saved, I was motivated to be. You know, and then, so I, and I kept off that wait for, and so I was probably down to lake and there's like 240. or 220 but I felt I felt Okay, and my clothes I didn't feel like over horrible you know what I mean and then. I kept that off for a couple of years and then. Some things happen with my son and. His girlfriend's father who we knew very well and i'm. I was kind of seeing him. And then, like last thanksgiving things just blew up and he wasn't a very good person, but I I overlooked that it's like I. I must be attracted to people who are going to treat. me bad or people that I don't know it's weird and so. Then I just started like gaining weight back again because it's like stressful and now i'm like the heaviest i've been probably ever in my life."
528.0,Provider,Okay what's your weight now.
14121.0,Patient,I think it's like 286.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and what's your height."
14121.0,Patient,Five four.
528.0,Provider,"So um. So I want to kind of go back and just clarify a few things are going to ask if that's okay. So it sounds like. From what I understand like you said, like in childhood or to like when you were in school you're around like 145 like that you are didn't really struggle with your weight at all like it was just that's what it was, and then you went to college and that's when you started gaining more. Right and. And then I think you got married and like you might have gained a little bit more maybe up to like you said around 200 and then. You know, got pregnant and obviously gained weight with that. So it sounds like and then, I guess, I wonder, so I guess, from the time that you were I guess in college through when you got pregnant. Did you try dieting at any time or was born."
14121.0,Patient,"Yesterday did, there was a time where. I joined weight watchers with my mom and we went faithfully every week and you know I guess at that time I was very happy to lose one pound a week or if I had any loss at all, I was fine with that and. I don't know, we must have done that for quite a while and and I remember being down to like 183 or wanting to do one or something like that, and that would have been before I had children. And my daughter was born when I was 25. Okay, so I felt, you know, I was good, with that so that's probably that was after I got married. But before I had kids."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and you got married when you were 19 you said."
14121.0,Patient,20 yeah.
528.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14121.0,Patient,"And then I tried weight watchers you know other times and. I was good, like when I went with my mom that was sort of the our weekly thing like we would go and then we would go out to eat actually we would because you know you you don't eat much on way in day. You don't want to be, and so that was kind of our routine and then and I used to be a member of the ymca and she and I would go to aerobics like a couple times a week and stuff and. I remember, they had only two treadmills at that time, and one of them, you couldn't use if you weighed more than 200 pounds that was like a little bit intimidating because you had to wait for the fat person treadmill. um you know what I mean. You know that went to be a thing now because they're all the same, but yeah it was like."
528.0,Provider,know.
14121.0,Patient,"Good I mean yeah kind of intimidating. You know. um. And then I so later on in life, I tried to weight watchers a couple other times and it seems like I would go with my friends, and then we would just pedal out at some point, and I really couldn't afford to go because, again, I was supporting my husband's and. I don't know and then my friend is sick, we agreed to do all these things, and then we would disappear out. Okay, like she wanted to try the online one, and I think for me that going somewhere and weighing in in front of somebody was. Something that was good for me. Okay, but and then so after I lost just a few years ago after I lost like that 30 pounds or whatever and kept that off. Oh, at the same time, I think I went through. National diabetes prevention program and NDP P, they offered it at my work."
528.0,Provider,And okay.
14121.0,Patient,"I met there once a week with people so that helped me that was, at the same time, I was doing that four ounces of protein. Okay, so I wasn't really following the NDP stuff because we my own thing, but the group support, I think, was good and then also when you had to weigh in in front of them buddy. Okay, oh that helps me do all of that."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so how sorry how old were you when when you did all that you did that, for it because I think you said it was like a 40 day or 30 day like."
14121.0,Patient,yeah I was. 4241. Although my now 40 i'm 49.
528.0,Provider,"I was probably 4545 okay Okay, and do you have diabetes or. know something they were offering for."
14121.0,Patient,The program that is a healthy eating program that. I mean it wasn't like you counted carbs or anything. It was just that they gave you a calorie counting book and you know it was just best practices and you know. Try to do this or do that I can't even remember.
528.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and then. When you, you said earlier, I don't I wonder how old you were when you started, you said you went on wellbutrin and you lost 55 pounds or something like when was that."
14121.0,Patient,I would have been.
528.0,Provider,"3030 OK OK, and then so was that, so you did weight watchers like kind of in your early 20s it sounds like and then you did again later in life. And that. You did this weight loss program and then did you do anything else, like any other kind of."
14121.0,Patient,"i've tried to just i've used my fitness Pal to track my calories and that's that's the thing I have trouble sticking to and I tried. Live strong one before. Okay, thank you matt and. I don't know. i'm not real good with the APP part. And then, like a year, two years ago, we have this other program through work it's called amada. and I will that's your insurance or whatever, and they send you a scale and you're supposed to weigh in way every day, and then you start they have like a weekly lesson and support groups and stuff."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"So I started it and then I just again I just kind of quit doing it like I still weighed myself sometimes because it send you reminders but and then do all the lessons and then like probably six months ago, or so. I asked if I could restart the program like start all over. And again i'm just where I, where I was i'm not doing the weekly lessons and. I don't know I just I don't know what's wrong with me."
528.0,Provider,So this was recently that you did this. model yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
528.0,Provider,"Okay um and then So what do you, what do you think I mean i'm curious like. I mean I don't know like what is it about those things that you think you just stopped doing or like that's not working for you or I don't know. that's not helpful for you."
14121.0,Patient,"I think it's um. The almost the lack of accountability there isn't I don't know it seems like the times I did the best was when I had to weigh myself and for somebody. But this is kind of the same thing you know, and I think that they reach out to me, and then I don't I don't really respond, and so I think he just give up on me. I don't blame them. I don't know I just. I guess I just. don't I just give up."
528.0,Provider,"yeah yeah when when you feel like you've been successful, I mean do you feel like you yeah like are there times, where you feel like it's been successful or it's been helpful like I wonder about that too."
14121.0,Patient,i'm.
528.0,Provider,"Speaking generally, but if you have specifics like yeah."
14121.0,Patient,"You know I mean I can, I think it has a lot to do with the binge eating too that's why, when I saw this program I was like okay well, maybe this is the answer, maybe I need to fix my my inner self you know. yeah and. So for me it's kind of like. I can eat really crappy for weeks and then put my mind to okay i'm going to start over again, and then start tracking my calories and then like within a day I already feel better."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"And then I feel better for a few days and then all of a sudden it's like ah i'm going to have some chips and cheese and just you know what I mean not that that isn't something I could have if I tracked it, but like once I go over my calories or something I just. screw it I might as it doesn't matter I might as well just keep you know eating today and then start over tomorrow or. I don't know it's almost like once I start eating for the day I just lose it."
528.0,Provider,"um, and so do do kind of like. I mean start out thinking you're like going to control your eating or restrict your eating and then it kind of goes. yeah you're actually in is that what you're saying."
14121.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I think some of it is that I don't plan very well. And like I. Like I haven't brought so I can work at home, and I can work at the office right and I like to work at the office I get to see people, and I feel like I just get more done and. So. If I don't plan my me and my meals, or for a while I didn't even have her very good of groceries in my house, you know what I mean and so. like this week, since I joined this I sort of tried to make a new commitment to myself to try to follow the calories again and then so in the morning, if i'm going to go to work I grab like I like those weight watchers meals, that you can have for lunchtime, or whatever. One that I always keep in my freezer I always have them because I feel like it's a. It fills me up and it's. You know, a reasonable portion compared to me, making my own lunch or whatever, and so like i've been trying to bring like a yogurt and an apple. And one of those meals to work and then I don't know i'm just like I said, not a breakfast person, so I had bought some of these protein drinks at. costco and so i've been trying to keep some of those in the fridge that way if I didn't eat breakfast I figure and sometimes i'm so busy at work, I just work, work, work, work, work and it's three o'clock and I haven't eaten."
528.0,Provider,Okay at all. yeah yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"And so, then I if I bring one of those to work at least I could sit at my desk and drink it, you know I have like a little lunch thing that I put it into keep it cooler and stuff and. So I feel like if I plan out my day, or at least bring something with me to eat because, and then we used to have a vending machine that has like sandwiches and, like those little containers of cottage cheese and stuff in them. So. I used to once in a while by you know something from there well when coven started they don't we don't have that anymore, but we do have like a snack machine that has like crackers and you know candy bars and stuff and. I purposely never have any cash with me because of the you know I don't want to spend money on that stuff, but you can use your debit card. But i'm pretty good about not going to the vending machine unless i'm really hungry and then I tried to buy like something like there's some reduced. or vegetable crisps, or whatever that. Hopefully, are better than chips or something but."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah So could you. i'm wondering what your typical day looks like in terms of eating, that would be really helpful so like I don't know if yesterday was like do you have typical days like does every day, is it varies every day totally different."
14121.0,Patient,"Well, I mean for the most part it's similar I get up and I I drink coffee and I always have creamer in it. Okay, which I I like to buy sugar free creamer at least. Probably have a cup of coffee before I go to work and then I I bring I have a bottle of creamer at work in the fridge so I probably drink a couple cups of coffee there and I think the creamer part kind of fills you up to. hungry, you know and so again if I plan out my day, then I bring like a yogurt and one of those meals, sometimes I bring like. Like I count out a number of true skits and then I bring like. Like that laughing cow cheese that's in those wedges sometimes i'll bring more of those and then my weight watchers meal."
528.0,Provider,How many truth gets do you count out.
14121.0,Patient,"Well, I think the serving sizes six but sometimes I do like nine. One of the servings. yeah and there are times when i've you know bought like a. Half a cup or a cup of cottage cheese and then I sometimes will put that on the trust gets. If I work at home, I don't do that kind of stuff like I drink the coffee and then like yesterday I worked at home, and so I had these. Cheese tortellini noodles in the fridge that you like heat up the water and then you cook them for like two minutes or whatever. And so I made some of those and I didn't measure measure don't like two servings which was like two cups and then I had some spaghetti sauce that I. put on that and I had that for lunch and that I didn't calculate the calories right away because I had some a meeting or whatever, and then I looked at it later it was like 600 calories just for the pasta, or whatever. And then i'm. Trying to think what are they. And then my son, you know I tried to plan out meals, for when he gets home to have some kind of dinner and. He has been busy so busy this summer at work, because he works at an excavating company and when he's not being the mechanic he drives like a dump truck around and so he hasn't been getting home till 789 o'clock at night, like. For most of the summer. And so, by the time he's coming home he's so hungry and he has like a half an hour drive or more so he'll stop. At the dairy queen or the gas station and get a sandwich or something if if he's really hungry, or if I tell them, you know I made this and you know you can it's waiting for you or whatever."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"But, like, I made a whole meal plan last Sunday, for the week and I haven't made any of it."
528.0,Provider,What happened.
14121.0,Patient,"Well, because he wasn't going to be home and. Then I had the groups, the groups is because that's six 5pm to 8pm for me."
528.0,Provider,yeah that's hard.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah and so probably between that and the I think I probably just need to make stuff ahead of time, so that you know it can be ready or whatever."
528.0,Provider,"yeah that's a good idea, absolutely."
14121.0,Patient,So I just need to plan better.
528.0,Provider,yeah okay so that's that's something that's it sounds like you're already thinking about like doing and it sounds like you did that are actually already just have to figure out kind of tweak your plan out.
14121.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we can we can definitely talk more about that. So I just want to kind of make sure I can understand everything, so you have the breakfast you pretty much skip except for the coffee correct. yeah and then, once what time do you eat lunch."
14121.0,Patient,Well that's just it if I met.
528.0,Provider,Joe right.
14121.0,Patient,"i'm at work i'm like busy busy busy busy, and I it's like two o'clock before I."
528.0,Provider,eat.
14121.0,Patient,"or three sometimes or like there's been times, where I didn't eat at all. i'm just going into my bedroom because my son just got home. So yeah, like the other night I had I didn't eat at all all day and then I got home, and I was like starving. yeah until then. If he's not home well and then with the test the labs that I had to do for for this, it said, my magnesium was, though."
528.0,Provider,i'm.
14121.0,Patient,"Okay, I didn't know. About like some avocados, and so I was putting those on trust gets as a snack. Okay avocados have a lot of calories but."
528.0,Provider,i'm. Our avocados a good source of I never knew I don't never I mean I think of them as a good source of potassium but magnesium.
14121.0,Patient,I think it was 3929 milligrams for half of an avocado.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean I do, I might have a list or actually I public. But I. Go ahead."
14121.0,Patient,"bananas and nuts and. and I can remember what was all on there, I can, I think I took a picture of this list hold on. i'm on the phone. It says i'm spinach Chard and what Chard is."
528.0,Provider,Like a leafy Green is dark green.
14121.0,Patient,"Okay pumpkin seeds yogurt almonds black beans avocado vague dark chocolate and bananas. Okay avocado says 58 milligrams in one medium avocado. I, like our product was so I thought i'll try that."
528.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just looking, I must admit I did look at your labs earlier but I didn't see the low magnesium just looking."
14121.0,Patient,yeah he said it wouldn't prevent me from the program but to talk to my my doctor about it. yeah okay. had my magnesium tested.
528.0,Provider,"Oh, now I see it, okay. Okay it's just a little bit low, but yeah it's yeah. Okay that's good to know."
14121.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Okay. How many days a week, do you think you skip your lunch."
14121.0,Patient,i'm. Probably. three.
528.0,Provider,"OK, and then so Does that mean you skipped breakfast lunch, and then only eat dinner. yeah Okay, and like and what would be so I know you said this week was kind of off, but like what do you typically eat for dinner."
14121.0,Patient,"Well, my son and I usually make him do a grocery order with me on the weekend, so we pick it up at walmart. Okay um well like this week I planned on having taco salad one night and we never did make that. We never made any of that we ended up having. Like get frozen pizza one night and anyways I was going to make lasagna two loaves. And spaghetti one night and then. No hold on I look at my notes and hold it down."
528.0,Provider,Or maybe tell me what you did you have dinner last night.
14121.0,Patient,last day I eat oatmeal.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, just that was. Just oatmeal."
14121.0,Patient,yeah like um and then I put peanut butter in it. But I was gonna make lasagna spaghetti for chaps with potatoes. pork roast and taco salad and then teriyaki chicken and fried rice and I never made any of that.
528.0,Provider,"Good ideas, those are like really good ideas um so we'll work on maybe that's something you want to work on is like following through on that plan. Yes, yeah okay. Okay, so, then when you eat is there a certain time you usually eat dinner, or does it vary to."
14121.0,Patient,"It varies I try to wait till he's going to be home. He doesn't like that I do that he tells me just you just go ahead and eat and i'll eat when I get home, so I should just you know pick a time and make and make the dinner, or you know I suppose i'll be better for it to try to eat, at the same time, each day."
528.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I said that's that's a good plan, I mean the more consistent, you can be with your eating and what we'll definitely talk more about this, but. The better in general. Like you know your body, because if you think about it, your body likes consistency, you know we're just human bodies like you know just like we have like asleep read them, you know. And i'd love to hear, I mean there's lots, we have to, we have to talk about but. You know if you have a sleep certain sleep sleep schedule it's kind of like the same thing with eating. Bodies function best when eating is predictable Okay, in other words, when the body knows. When to expect meals, you know or food. If it's like different every day and some meals are skipping and some meals you're you know, maybe you're under eating or overeating or whatever it is like it's it gets chaotic. i'd say for for the most part bodies don't do well too well, or as well, like that does that make sense. yeah yeah um so yeah and like I said well we'll definitely come back to that when we talk about a plan for you. So when you okay so dinner is variable in terms of when you eat I mean do you always eat dinner is that do you skip dinner to."
14121.0,Patient,"A table I don't skip dinner, but I don't always make the best choices, you know it's like grab a thorough frozen pizza in the oven or. macaroni and cheese. So, like this week i'm trying to think after Oh, I know I went to arby's one night and I got like a. A year or whatever. Because I think I had to run another errand I think it was Monday after group, and then I just ran through arby's drive through."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"And then Tuesday I can't remember what I did. Oh, one of those days is when I didn't eat eat lunch oh another thing i've done is have you heard of those things, called just crack an egg. No they're like little containers that have like. cut up little pouches of cut up vegetables and cheese and then like sausage sausage or whatever. And you open it and it's like a soup container like you get out and then you put an egg in there, and you scramble it up. And then you add all this stuff. And it's like scrambled eggs. yeah so I I had bought some of those and I was bringing those to work, so I did so, then, but I wasn't hungry in the mornings as drinking my coffee so by the time I ate that it was like. noon. So then, and then I was bringing the yogurt and whatever and then so. I think I had brought my weight watchers meal that's what I did I brought my weight watchers meal to work, but I never ate it because I ate the eggs too late, so I ate that for supper."
528.0,Provider,"Oh, I see okay Okay, and then do you usually so do you eat anything between lunch and dinner like anytime in the afternoon hours."
14121.0,Patient,"I that's when I would probably eat like the if I bring crackers to work, the TRIS gets or whatever I wouldn't try to that was kind of my plan was to eat lunch and then have some kind of a snack in the afternoon."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, and that didn't he just that didn't happen."
14121.0,Patient,"No, I mean it seems like every day I would come home with my yogurt still in my bag, I never ate it and then. I was bringing an apple every day and I never ate it that work. So Ada in the evening twice."
528.0,Provider,So when you were saying about lunch with the weight watchers meal that's your meal I I say you have just that frozen meal and then the yogurt and the apple or like.
14121.0,Patient,Like a snack yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's not really part of lunch at separate."
14121.0,Patient,break.
528.0,Provider,"And I say Okay, and then what about after dinner yeah, what do you eat after dinner, or do you eat."
14121.0,Patient,"that's when I really struggle that's when I it depends on when I eat eat dinner to like. I just I don't know I just keep on eating. You know, and again, as I make a bag of popcorn and sometimes that will satisfy me, or one thing that's dangerous for me is like chips, and then I put them in the microwave with cheese on them."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"But I don't like measure the cheese, and you know what I mean i'm not. And then. Like if i've had protein bars sitting around i'll have one of those and then like I don't buy ice cream and stuff because, if I if I had that here I would eat. A whole bunch."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"No i'm definitely a stacker and. Sometimes I just. I know, like I had one day that when I eat a whole bag of like m&ms like you know it wasn't huge but."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
14121.0,Patient,"And then, like we have door dash here in our area, and so my son kind of figured that out when he was sick last year, and currently, though. I kind of wish I didn't know about it. cuz like we've ordered like dairy Queen. yeah no. yeah it's 30 at night. Right and it's, not only is it her in this the expensive it's not good for you, you know. So we've done some of that too, and he kind of decided that he wanted to slim down a little bit too he's gained a little bit of weight now he's not in school and stuff and so he quit drinking pop. But he's drink so he's drinking like ice and water and. I don't drink sugary pop but I drink. diet seven up."
528.0,Provider,"How much diets have enough, do you drink it like in a day."

14121.0,Patient,"um some nights i'll have a few beers or. My son when he had his party I bought like some wine and beer, you know for the guests, or whatever, and so there was leftover wine and so i've had I like I like to mix that with seven up."
528.0,Provider,Okay.
14121.0,Patient,"I know it's terrible. that's that's a lot of my problem two is fine, I think if i'm bored and i'd have a drink than I have a couple hard drinks."

14121.0,Patient,"desk detrimental to myself, you know I mean I mean, I have a flexible work schedule, but still it's like I should get I need to get going earlier. Okay, so um so like I have. The whole chips thing if I if you know i'll get into the chips and a couple plates and nachos or. If I have ice cream, I will eat like. A couple balls of ice cream till i'm feel sick or. Even like protein bars if if I have one it's like I want another one i'm kind of a sweet salty sweet salty you know they mean I had something salty and i'm craving and cookie and. ya know when we had our group thing the other night and I were supposed to bring a pastry or you said, if I had a cookie I just don't. Keep that stuff in my house, because I can't. But like i'm. I don't know like if I do I do pretty well if I count on my Truscott, sometimes, but then other times it's like. And I like I like cheese i'm a big cheese eater and so i'll cut up some cheese, but I don't really count what i'm doing, and then I just eat a bunch of tickets and t's before I go to bed if i'm doing a binge or. I don't know I just it's like I. should be satisfied but i'm not satisfied until i'm almost sick."
528.0,Provider,huh okay so um and just so I understand your you know your experience like would you say that you would have like kind of all of those things in one evening or would it be like one or like how many different kinds of things do two.
14121.0,Patient,Times yeah in one evening.
528.0,Provider,yeah.

528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"You know I can feel it coming up and then i'm worried that i'm going to choke in my sleep because that's happened to me before where i've aspirated and. One time at one time, I was throwing up blood. Oh, my God coughing up blood because, like I choked in it went in my lungs that really scared me."

528.0,Provider,My gosh wow.
14121.0,Patient,"yeah so I woke up choking and vomiting and then you know you have to cough all that out, and then. There was blood and I was really scared. I think I went to my doctor and he said, you know you. You know coughing so hard can do that."
528.0,Provider,And it.
14121.0,Patient,"happened to me once when my daughter was she had like a week of treatment in the cities and we were staying at a hotel and then we would go to treatment during the day, and I remember it happened to me there and. Like literally I I almost had I had like a fever afterwards it was so weird. it's happened to me more than once. And then, so I didn't go to her treatment be with her, I think my mom was with or whatever, and because I was scared them, then I was sick but it's almost like I felt like I had pneumonia after that."
528.0,Provider,"yeah well that I mean, I think that can lead, I think that can happen."

Right cough it out kinda yeah. Right yeah um and so, how many days per week or, as you said, it's mostly at night that this that you've been. How many nights per week, would you say like is that every day, is it like."
14121.0,Patient,"that's probably. mean again i've been trying to be better since starting the program on Monday. So i've been better, this week, but before that probably like three four nights a week. yeah at least."
528.0,Provider,"And then do you like, how do you feel afterwards, like physically mentally like i'm just curious like."
14121.0,Patient,"Like a failure, like. Just disgusted with myself."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"Lots of time I end up having heartburn then, and you know. feel crappy and like I sit there and go Why did I Why do I do this to myself."
528.0,Provider,"yeah. um. And how long has this been going on, we actually yeah yeah how many, this is a recent thing kind of like longer than that would you say."
14121.0,Patient,"it's probably been. let's see. I know what happened when I was married to my second husband. I don't know probably you know what now that i'm thinking about it. Trying to remember, if I did it before my daughter was diagnosed with cancer. Because I I live we've lived in in this House for six years and before that I lived in a different house for like 11 years and. Here I bring everything to my bedroom and like I remember my ex husband he always would fall asleep at like 830 at night. And I would be sitting here and then he'd be sleeping and I would just. Go get something to eat eat it and then I go get something else that need it and. i'm on the phone. yeah and. So I know that that was happening, when we were married so it's it's got to be at least 1015 years."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so. yeah."
14121.0,Patient,"it's been good, I remember doing it in in my first marriage. yeah I know I did it at the hospital when my daughter was sick."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14121.0,Patient,"Not maybe not quite as bad, but."
528.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah and then well and again we'll definitely dive more into this, but I know you mentioned, like in the group, the other day, I felt like something that was like comforting you know, like. come out. Or, because you were bored or you know I know this earlier to just the fact that you like used to doing going, you know and it sounds like. Right, maybe this is part of that too, like. But we'll talk about we'll talk more about that um what. Like I have so many more questions, but I guess we'll save it. For next time. But. What i'd like you to do this week is start. Logging your food in the APP called a recovery record. i'll be."
14121.0,Patient,covering the record.
528.0,Provider,Over recovery record.
14121.0,Patient,Oh okay I haven't heard of that.
528.0,Provider,"yeah, so this is an it's actually an eating disorder. focus. Numbers we're not you know there's it's all about just tracking your food, you can take pictures of your food if you'd like. And really it's a mindfulness tool really just just help you to stay aware of like. What you're eating plus it helps because we can actually connect and i'll explain that in a minute, but like we can connect I can review your your logs and I want you to know, like, I of course i'm not judging your logs at all it's only you know, whatever you put is like only to help."
14121.0,Patient,me to understand what your. Dreams yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Absolutely and it's also for you, because sometimes logging it can really be. You can start to see patterns. And that's what i'm hoping for you is to like start to. You know just start noticing patterns and you're eating, so you can also log things like hunger and fullness which will absolutely come back to talking more about. Feelings thoughts like there's there's actually coping tools in there, where you can you can just spend some time looking at the average. be helpful for you, I mean a minimum, I would just say log your food that's kind of all you really need to do at this point, but if you want to. Do that everybody's different. But yeah so have you done, I mean I need to do you did my fitness Pal and any other kind of logging food."
14121.0,Patient,"yeah i've done, I tried the. Lip strong one, I did before. Right, I did I did try I did do the weight watchers online for shoreline but I didn't stick with that so."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know and and one thing we will definitely you know you'll you'll notice a lot during this recovery processes like. we're going to move away from counting calories and move away from the numbers and things like that, like measuring food or anything like that so. This that's what I really like about this APP it's like it's really just about like the food and like you know your feelings and your hunger fullness and you know it doesn't really focus on like counting calories or any of that kind of stuff as much, although I would say, like. it's helpful definitely for me and sometimes is why people just take a picture, but like if you know, like you, I mean if you are counting out like whatever 10 TRIS gets you can put that and the thing I mean that. is really helpful I don't know if you've heard just TRIS gets like if you have like a whole box or you have like 10 you know so. um so that kind of stuff, I would like just estimate I don't want you to really have to measure anything. person, you know, like don't you don't feel you have to like measure, but like you could say, for example, I like to use the fists like so like maybe your fist is about a cup so you might like a fist of like. I don't know macaroni and cheese, or something whatever it is, you know, like it might be like a fist of. Just to kind of get given ID or if you happen to. know how to cut that you can say that it's a problem um so yeah so kind of include that to that make sense. yeah yeah."
14121.0,Patient,"So, should I still do the fitness Pal or no."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, I didn't realize you're still doing that um no I would stop that. Okay i'm just do this one. yeah I mean how many because I know this was one of my questions that I don't want to forget to ask the next time so i'm going to ask you right now but. Because, you said you were been like kind of looking at calories are focusing on calories what is the amount of calories that you try to limit yourself to."
14121.0,Patient,"Well, I you know i've tried many different. Things but this my friend and I were talking about it and I just I decided I would follow the actual you know where it says two pounds a week or whatever you want to lose to the week and I think I had at 1800."
528.0,Provider,"OK OK. OK that's good to know so yeah we're gonna know and again we'll talk more about this next time when we kind of talk more about your actual like eating plan, because we will get to that. um but. This might be a good week to like kind of challenge that in terms of. Not maybe start not thinking about the calories and food, you know I mean it may be, I don't know how do you feel about that it's about. feel scary easy like okay like what's what's your thoughts."
14121.0,Patient,"Well, maybe a little scary because you know to me it's the whole plan of the calories but. yeah i'm not good at listening to my body, where I just don't you know what I mean. yeah but I mean I get that I need to start doing that, so I mean yeah i'll try it and."
528.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I mean it's a process of course, and so you know I don't expect you to you know, for some people. The calorie information is just so automatic sometimes that like it's hard to break that. Like so but definitely if you're tracking in the APP I want you to at least stop doing that you know. Any yeah like you're able to get rid of, in that sense. yeah and then we will you know that that's that's going to be a lot of the work we do together is you know first kind of setting up a plan in terms of. Like making sure you're getting enough and regular food and we'll talk about that all next time, but like and then moving you more towards like eating according to your cues but that's that takes time. you're not there, right now, of course, yeah so for this week, I would say just focus on doing what you normally do like whatever you know and. And then just logging the food in the recovery record and then actually Let me give you like, once you create an account i'm going to give you my code."
14121.0,Patient,Because it will then.
