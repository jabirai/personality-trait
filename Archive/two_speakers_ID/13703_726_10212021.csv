726.0,Provider,So what happened that got you upset yesterday.
13703.0,Patient,"Well, she. doesn't like me, apparently because I we didn't go and stay with her when he had surgery on his arm. because she wanted she's like really cool trolling and I don't know if she wanted us to stay there, but his parents wanted us to stay here because he lives in the guest House it is parents house right now. yeah cuz his house burnt down um and so. yeah so we didn't stay there, because he didn't want to, and I really didn't want to because i've heard so many terrible things about her, I was like maybe I shouldn't. Try to be your friend and. Until I think that to the fence and then she now she just like makes this comments I don't know she texts this, both in the morning about. I don't know basically telling him what a worthless Daddy is and. yeah and said some about me and dislike calls me like the ding Dong girlfriend that blah blah blah, you know. Oh yeah. yeah she's pretty rare I mean she thinks that she's got she like it almost gets to you like wow maybe. I don't know like you're not doing a good enough job or something, but really when you sit down and think about it it's like he answers the phone like 99% of the time that they call like is there anytime they need to sleep. But like but she called at 630 in the morning and. wanted him to jump up right then and. That was weird."
726.0,Provider,"I did, but. You got back on which is. Good all right there you are."
13703.0,Patient,I didn't do anything I just did it all by itself.
726.0,Provider,"Oh, it might be."
13703.0,Patient,"Oh, maybe. I don't know. It takes a while to get back on."
726.0,Provider,yeah it's okay.
13703.0,Patient,"Okay. So yeah she just does have to say things that like drag you down, but you know how text messages to people read things differently and interpret it different than what they're meant to say so. I just think that she just makes snotty little comments okay so so she thinks that she said um I. So we have the things where she thinks i'm insecure about their relationship and she thinks that. I like there's like three things right So then, when she she was responding. It is just a glitchy day today isn't it."
726.0,Provider,I know.
13703.0,Patient,"God it's raining here so that always does, that affects the cell service. In the Canyon it bro I mean just the cloud coverage seems like my phone doesn't work this good but. I don't know it's kind of cool that it's raining here in California we're excited. But anyways so she pointed out, these three things like that she used to struggle with in her relationship and they were. The exact same things that she says that is the problem with our relationship, it was that would you take that as an she was doing on purpose to try to be like I was insecure, or you know. Like she remembers when she did that but, but it was just like random that happened to be the same things I felt like she was like being a. Doing saying that on purpose to be like yeah I remember when I was, like you, in a stupid relationship insecure, or you know that's how I took it, but he. was like you know. She was saying what she went through and i'm like well that's funny that it's the same thing that she says we're going through and she has to pointed out, like in 123."
726.0,Provider,"Well it's not even her place to point anything out and it's not her relationship it's not her business, I mean her only businesses with him is the kids really. yeah it sounds like she's threatened by you and if she's threatened by you, it must be because to me it sounds like you're important to him and his life so she's going to try to drag that out. In her favor almost I mean, even if, even if she was see something that was similar at some point but that's really not her place to to talk, you know."
13703.0,Patient,"yeah she was talking about her relationship, but but yeah she always says and snotty little thing and every almost every message about me and. How he doesn't call us kids but, like the point is is like i'm sitting there I like wouldn't talk to her, the other day. When I started the gas station, because I was like upset that she kept slandering my name and saying I was about mom i'm like excuse me, you don't even go there because i'm so far for."
726.0,Provider,That long yeah.
13703.0,Patient,"i'm like okay yeah I my kids always come first and and them and I just have split custody that's the only reason that I mean I don't have split custody I I chose to that I actually have primary care custody of my kids but. Because I have to let her down and have to I can't just like haagen I mean it's not fair. it's good for them to have the dad and the mom both you know. And so. Hello Center straight on that and then um and then she's like when you're here, he doesn't answer his phone and i'm like well that's funny because i'm when I am here, I see the kids, not only does the answer the phone and I hear i'm talking to them. We see them, I see them almost every time like what like. Two or three times, it is just like so she I don't know where she's coming from like he doesn't it's because she wants to meet her house like she wasn't to come to her house like into hang out with him there and it's like yeah I bet you do I bet you know every."
726.0,Provider,time when her.
13703.0,Patient,"husband back wants to have him in her house, so that she can watch movies, with his kids on the couch but it's like that's not the reality anymore."
726.0,Provider,Oh gosh.
13703.0,Patient,"I mean I wouldn't mind if he did like he's gonna go over there today because she's a work. But um it really doesn't bother me, but the way she acts is like. And she's like I guess, I mean i've never had anything i've never had so many people tell me to stay away from somebody i've never had anybody tell me to stay away from anybody really."
726.0,Provider,In here every.
13703.0,Patient,"person i've met is like stay away from her she's evil not not just yeah evil like terrible descriptive word. For a person's personality, or whatever. yeah his parents don't like the most."
726.0,Provider,yeah I mean. I think it's like. Especially this relationship is important to you and you wanna keep that it's almost like if she knows that something bothers you she's gonna try to. push that on as much as she can and egg it on and it's almost like if if she sees that you don't if she doesn't make you feel. Insecure or afraid of the relationship because of her that she's gonna have nothing to latch on to so she's trying to find anything to kind of get on your on your bad side you know what I mean.
13703.0,Patient,yeah and. I can.
726.0,Provider,"see why he scared to like talk to her or even if he does talk to her like I can see why. That feeling of. You know, wanting to be in a relationship with you and then being afraid of answering or not answering the phone, because I feel like it almost sounds like show us anything in her favor good or bad to make herself sound better and make other people have bad."
13703.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah she's difficult to deal with for sure it's like a total, but it was crazy how it completely ruined our day we're just like both like dislike all day yesterday because of her, but then I blocked her for most of our phones and and we better ever since. Unlike can you gave me permission i'm just like you have to quit letting her be like run your life like that love that's why she's still a part of it that's why she has the power that she does because you allow it. But if you just don't allow it then she can't do it like when you block somebody it's like such a relief sometimes like if they're really handy you can."
726.0,Provider,Even if you.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah even if you like, don't answer is still just knowing they're calling or whatever it's like a But then when you block them it's like you don't even think about it. yeah and their kids are hurt their kids are way old enough to call themselves, and you know and Riley has a car so his oldest daughter's daughter. So it's like it's not like they need the mom to communicate."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I wonder on like what's. what's his or her relationship like with her mom if that's the issues that are coming up like between you and your boyfriend like what is the relationship partner kids because she sounds like she's gonna try or she's manipulative and so I wonder if she does that, with the kids to."
13703.0,Patient,"um yeah but they're pretty smart they don't listen to her like they know that they think that they know her how she is and she's kind of really naggy and. vocal like well yeah well, and I mean she's just she's I think she's a good mother, I mean she puts a roof over their head and they have a nice place to live and. She seems like she does which can but she's just. yeah she definitely talks a lot of bunch of stuff tells him what a worthless Daddy is like all day long in front of them and. They don't believe and then tries to tell him that they are think that and that they she has to listen to them come to her and cry about how he didn't show up and blah blah blah and i'm like. Like I heard him on the phone talking on the phone saying hey i'm not gonna make it today, or what you know, like it's so weird this and I don't know where I like want to sit down as a kid or have him sit down with the kids and. confirm that so that he's not so that it's so that we know if that's really the case, or so I guess it's not in my business really but. He should yeah."
726.0,Provider,"But. you're part of his life so it's like you know, at the end of the day, if this is a relationship that's going to be long term, eventually, there has to have a car, there has to be some sort of conversation on how you guys are good not. How you're going to maneuver yourselves as a couple with this woman, because you know if this is how she is now. I don't you know you want to know what boundaries you both have about the situation or about how you want things to go."
13703.0,Patient,"I why don't see why she has to be a part of I mean there's no reason, like you know what I mean like i'm me and my ex we don't. We barely talk like I mean the kids we can I communicate to my kid I talked to my kids directly and they ride the bus to my house or they ride the bus to his house and. We don't talk, I mean and that's I don't think that's healthy, I would rather us have a friendship, but um but that's like he can't he doesn't you know he can't handle that and. We tried in the very beginning and it didn't work and. it's just kind of because couples don't really do I mean when you're with somebody else because it's fine when you're both single But then when somebody. gets with another person it always goes, you know and so it'd be wonderful if it could I did i'm definitely a person that would have been open to that, I mean, I still tell him, he can go up there, it doesn't bother me I know it's not gonna I don't feel threatened because she's. cuz if he wanted to be a Turkey would obviously been whatever they've been divorced for like 10 years so. yeah I guess think that they would have happened, I mean if you and i'm not gonna stop it if it if he decides he wants to. Regardless so. But he does have a problem, communicating with me when he's there. I don't know why, but I don't that that's my only problem I don't like when he doesn't call me, and I know that he's like at her house or whatever and. But. yeah I just don't see they don't I don't think she needs to be I just think he needs to not talk to her because she's just she's never had anything. To say yeah. And it brings me down like I I you know I would see him like you can instantly tell like if he got a message from her whatever he'd be like all happy and then all done boo down power down. And yeah and now I know like how he feels because then she kind of like brought me into it and i'm just like oh my God. yeah the way she words things and I don't know. It just makes you feel like yeah."
726.0,Provider,Now.
13703.0,Patient,But.
726.0,Provider,"been 10 years since I separated it's almost like she's acting like it was like like two weeks ago, or something."
13703.0,Patient,"I know yeah been 10 years like, but he. She just has kept us the kids to keep him. You know, keep getting money from them and keep. I don't think so I guess they've remained friends obviously that they. I don't know I don't know the whole story, but I know that they she obviously want I mean I feel like she wants, you know him to be there as much as possible, like and she uses it as a kids but it's like no. it's in her house that's ever her time she wants to be there. Like it's not just the kids."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah is he afraid of losing his kid because of this woman.
13703.0,Patient,"um. Well, he he said that like I was gonna text her back and say what I felt and she's texting me to she put me included in the message. Because she's like since sheer insecure girlfriend has to read all your messages are you have to have your insecure girlfriend read your messages or something like that she was all mad because. She sent me a message and I responded on his behalf and she's like we do not need your girlfriend or you don't need your girlfriend to respond to our business data. And all I said was. Point taken. Jason will be over later like that's all I said two words to one sentence and um. yeah and she she just went on and on, it was like oh my God. yeah so yeah he is afraid of that he said, if you send that she's just going to keep my kids in won't let me see him and we'll do everything she can to make it to where I can't see him."
726.0,Provider,wow.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah they don't have any court orders or anything regarding custody, but. But they definitely um. She probably would but you know. they're old enough to. say who they want to live with, and if he I mean we've been looking for place. If he had a place, they would both live with him for sure hands down right now."
726.0,Provider,yeah so they already know what he was she's like so.
13703.0,Patient,yeah yeah they handle it really well they're they're pretty cool kids.
726.0,Provider,"Oh, how have you been doing with how are the kids have everything."
13703.0,Patient,Oh good I was gonna say I went to my happy place the other day. And it works. It totally made me smile and I forgot about that I forgot about what I was even upset about. yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Well, so."
13703.0,Patient,yeah um did you read my so I took a test a while back like right answered a bunch of questions. They give you that.
726.0,Provider,"Let me see, is it the personality. Type yeah yeah. Let me look it up, let me see."
13703.0,Patient,I know so.
726.0,Provider,"I think they're so fun those have a question, yes."
13703.0,Patient,"I know they are they I thought it was fun too, and I was like curious to see what it said."
726.0,Provider,"yeah let me see. is here, why."
13703.0,Patient,I like it i'm pretty well on the 10th but they she said that you would have it.
726.0,Provider,"i'm looking for and I. hold on, let me see if I can. See."
13703.0,Patient,"So my current situation, finally, so that hard, I told you did I tell you how nice it was a recall and they're paying for it."
726.0,Provider,Oh no you're getting.
13703.0,Patient,And they're paying for a rental car.
726.0,Provider,hey.
13703.0,Patient,I know. i'm like. so excited yeah it's been awesome for sure.
726.0,Provider,"ISIS I nothing's coming up, I don't know why, but then again i'm having a lot of issues with computers."
13703.0,Patient,I know.
726.0,Provider,"it's such a weird thing it's not showing up but i'm gonna i'll i'll take a deeper dive and try to find it and then I can send you like, a message or an email or something like that. and tell you. What it shows up as yeah."
13703.0,Patient,"Because I see other people's that have it, and it will like."
726.0,Provider,be like oh this person is this type of person that sounds like a really cool like personality tests almost.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah I know I liked it, I was really curious questions were tough or I mean you're like really I don't know it seemed like um and then I was like did I mark that are because then they asked the same ones, a lot right."
726.0,Provider,And I didn't read our map for like.
13703.0,Patient,tricky to see if I answered them all sporadically. or answer mobile web routing.
726.0,Provider,"So your card that recall, we what year was your car."
13703.0,Patient,It was a 2014.
726.0,Provider,Oh wow.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah so it had engine recall like a big one, so they had to replace the end I know and. and luckily I did it broke down and so that's how I found out and. It had like I don't know a few recalls on it, but the engine one in particular just there was like a handful of cars. That my year. That before they found the defect and my car was one of them so they pay for the rental car and. The yeah and my yeah for two months, so now, I have a car i'm so excited. Like oh my gosh you gotta be kidding me right now. And yeah I didn't realize that did they did the rental car coverage at first until I was like laying there and i'll just like hit me and i'm like oh my God, I wonder if they pay for the rental car because I mean what do they expect you did not have a car for two months."
726.0,Provider,I know.
13703.0,Patient,yeah because that's how long it takes them to fix it from back orders on yeah.
726.0,Provider,"yeah because I remember years ago there was like a recall on Toyota something and they had to like replace or it wasn't even like a part, like they literally took the car, I think, and like give them a different car, something I don't know what."
13703.0,Patient,Oh wow yeah.
726.0,Provider,But that was a while back and so.
13703.0,Patient,yeah that'd be awesome if the me a new car i'd take a new car.
726.0,Provider,Right.
13703.0,Patient,yeah for sure. there's all kinds of flash flood warnings now because it's going it's going to it's gonna rain like big 10 and heavy rains tonight and all the burns have no they're gonna just a road and big mudslides everywhere.
726.0,Provider,"yeah I wonder if it's a blessing in. disguise, you know how like. You were saying, like you, don't have your set place but with all the fires, and all of the things that are happening in California. I wonder if it's just like a blessing in disguise, like you, don't have to worry about like a property or you'd like if you had something to like have to take care of or God forbid, like another fire happens, or something."
13703.0,Patient,yeah yeah or maybe I want to move to Oregon.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13703.0,Patient,I have the option.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13703.0,Patient,"I know California so expensive. to live in, but, but it is, I mean it'd be hard to move because I like the sun and. yeah but it definitely wouldn't be hard to move out of the valley, I live in. But I don't and I. My boyfriend and his property. rate by his parents, but like we have to drive by her house to get to it. So it's just awful so she lives, like in between his parents house she lives like literally two miles down the road. Oh wow yeah and so before I came along, he was like stop by there all the time because kids are there. Any like kids i'm in so now. He doesn't stop by because of the conflict between her and I and and because she's really a negative person like she just nag nag negative negative negative like nothing positive comes out of her mouth ever. that's really a drag that's like. That was, like the first red flag i'm like I just don't know if I like her she's so lean like gosh like she just boom boom boom and really like. No, this is how you tie your shoes that's not how you tie your shoes, this is how you tie your shoe it looks like really I can tie my shoe ever want I mean i'm just using that as an example, but. yeah very different like this is how you do it, this is how life is this is how everything goes like um I don't think so. wow now maybe for you, but I mean. But he's been pretty good about. not going, I mean he's been good about understanding how I feel in. yeah and as. Best as he possibly can, but I always hate leaving because I know that you can go right back over there and deal with it and I don't like about that and she's like going over above and beyond, trying to move him back. I feel yeah."
726.0,Provider,"I want, she. Well, she liked that before like if he had other girlfriends in the past."
13703.0,Patient,"yeah he's ruined she ruined all their relationships all those relationships. I know she's like you. yeah. yeah that was one of the big fights um. yeah I don't know. I don't know, but she to pain in the butt but now that we black church it's everything's better for now until he unblock Sir again and then all hell breaks loose in the same thing happens the same cycle it's like law. But hopefully he. Have I went."
726.0,Provider,How do you feel now in your relationship with him like do you feel more secure about it and last couple weeks.
13703.0,Patient,"kind of I do but it's like. I feel like at any point given point like he might just be like throw his hands up because he doesn't want to have to deal with. Her freaking out like he might just just break it up or break off because he wants to be with his kids and he doesn't want to have to deal with this. trauma, but I mean I feel pretty secure but I said, like it's the beginning of our relationship, like he'd be like totally in love with me and then all of a sudden, he wouldn't like me back he just all the sudden it was shut off like that, and like. So that like made me nervous that it can happen at any time, because it was like over I don't even know what it was over. But um. But it was like instant and. It took him like you know, a couple days or however long to feel that way again about me like. I have not felt i've not just not liked him all of a sudden ever like. yeah but I mean I don't know I guess yeah."
726.0,Provider,"I was just thinking, maybe he he was freaking out in a way, because all of his other relationships were ruined by her that maybe he's afraid. At that time, or when that happens, like that feeling of oh shoot like if something happens she might just be one of those people that leave again. You know, like when someone just doesn't want to get close because they just have too many like bad experiences yeah that had anything to do with it."
13703.0,Patient,"yeah it could have. That yeah I don't know he's he doesn't. He is getting better, but he doesn't really like talking about. How he feels like when he's upset you know he's upset because you can tell, because he doesn't say a word, and you can just tell by his actions and what he does, but he just not he's not going to go and tell you why or anything so you just kind of have to guess. And yeah I keep like i'm not upset at all oh. that's so funny i'm like. I can hold it in for like a minute and then i'm like okay."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13703.0,Patient,yeah. i'm taking. i'm taking notes antidepressants but. I feel like they make me really tired. I know so it's like it's like. X X there's it's called ben's vn something X or but it's also called X or have you heard of that.
726.0,Provider,"No, no."

726.0,Provider,Our I. I don't think i've heard i've not like super familiar with like medications and selves i'm. i'm just looking at your stuff here and it Prozac. That. vaccine.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah. So I didn't take the wife took the Prozac for a couple days, but I was like reading some of those side effects and and. And do yeah I wanted to take something else, and so, then she did the next one, is it works pretty well, but my gosh I get drowsy like just randomly throughout the day like. drowsy like my like want to shut."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
13703.0,Patient,"I know, but that's like a side effect but i'm down thinking I don't know if I can handle taking these because they make me but I, but I, but it helps a lot like as far as yeah like not getting stressed out and beat them with them. Be level headed, except for yesterday."
726.0,Provider,have some stresses there but.
13703.0,Patient,If I wasn't on those I probably would have way worse time. way worse oh my gosh. For sure.
726.0,Provider,yeah well you know how like we were talking about Lee doing. em Dr processing. I think we talked about like compartmentalizing and putting things and yeah.
13703.0,Patient,they'll have done that.
726.0,Provider,"yeah that's all right i'm what i'm thinking is, for I want you to pick pick up memory or a thought where i'm. You know, we couldn't do actually ISIS is. When you that experience that you had with this woman and in this in context of the relationship um we can target that specific memory. Because that can also if he if it's more recent it can help bring you back to a time where you kind of felt similar or to see what was very triggering about it."
13703.0,Patient,Okay yeah. yeah as it was. triggering.
726.0,Provider,"yeah because it could be too is like. This person. She may represent a lot of different things, but the fact that she. She is kind of like messing with the relationship is also a feeling of like not safety because now there's someone else that could potentially be a threat. Even if, even if it wasn't romantic but she's still like the mother of his children so she still kind of poses like a threat, so if we can do some processing around that. I think what I want to do is like in the next session that will be the first thing that we do let's do a processing of. Something and, if anything, comes up more recent around her that's similar to this that's what we could do."
13703.0,Patient,Okay. I don't work. yeah yeah yeah i'm excited to try that.
726.0,Provider,"I love doing I think emt are like and i'm biased, because you know, whatever, but I think it's so good, like you can honestly do. Like for if you can't sleep at night, if you're having nightmares like you could just do processing just on the physical sensations and you start like a half people that feel. They start to feel it in their shoulders and they do, they follow the eye movements and then they feel it here, on the other side, and like it's just so interesting. What i'm gonna do is i'm going to make it the next appointment that's the first that's exactly what we're going to do we're going to target a specific current event that you felt really dysregulation or like uncomfortable or feeling anxious about. And will process it to see where it's all coming from."
13703.0,Patient,"Okay, and then see if that could help, and then I don't have to take medication."
726.0,Provider,yeah because that's what ends up happening ISIS is a lot of people they'll start doing and Dr and they start processing the. The memories and the body sensations that come up when you get anxious or depressed and you like later on they'll start to notice that oh like this doesn't bother me anymore oh that's that's new because before something may have been very triggering if you don't feel the same anymore.
13703.0,Patient,wow yeah. that's amazing.
726.0,Provider,So i'm.
13703.0,Patient,Like my my boyfriend needs to do and get over some I think she's like a verbal or yeah she's like emotional hurt him. yeah she's really messed up.
726.0,Provider,"I think like even if someone doesn't because this is. This was made specifically for trauma trauma subjective to the person so like literally it to somebody else something might not be traumatic but for somebody else it was so it doesn't matter you can process like. Literally any anything that you could think of that you feel physically uncomfortable with you can process and am Dr so it's like doesn't have to be that it was some big traumatic event, it could just be that it made you really sad and so let's process it."
13703.0,Patient,that's cool. that's awesome. Even though i've had a lot of traumatic events.
726.0,Provider,yeah but you know I think if we start with something more current you we can slowly tap into the stuff from the past. yeah it. All ties in together at some point.
13703.0,Patient,"And yeah and I don't want to tap into the past like it right, as my first get go cuz that's like."
726.0,Provider,I know. I know it's it's super yeah. So I said i'm gonna see did you want to do something for next week or two weeks from.
