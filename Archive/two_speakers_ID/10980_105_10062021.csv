105.0,Provider,"Nice, can you hear me. I can get it slipped alright good afternoon to you."
10980.0,Patient,Why is it not turning there we go. I have the hiccups.
105.0,Provider,You don't have to care for that is. What is actually a cure.
10980.0,Patient,What is it.
105.0,Provider,"Well it's a show, I have to show you. But it's pretty cool I mean I can't believe you don't know what this is it's a really cute trick to teach kids to. Go get a glass of water i'm going to show you i'm going to go i'm going to get one too, so I can teach it to. A fun little trick. ever done this on screen before but."
10980.0,Patient,alright.
105.0,Provider,"So the basic idea is that your your diaphragm is in spasm it's that thing that cuts the middle part of the body it's in spasm right so it's. um I don't know if it'll work with a bottle let me show you what it is, and then you may need to pour it in a glass okay. So basically you know, normally, you and I, we drink from here, because you know we're not from Mars. But today we're going to drink like we're from another planet we're going to drink from this side. I know it's really weird, but it will require that we're our head is upside down so you want to be careful not to let it get in your nose and you don't take a big drink, but basically we're going to be drinking upside down we're gonna do it three times."
10980.0,Patient,We need a glass.
105.0,Provider,yeah that's what I thought.
10980.0,Patient,he's driving me NUTS I get him a lot.
105.0,Provider,You do now you'll be able to fix it.
10980.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"All right. So. The basic idea is this. it's probably gonna be hard to see with your hair but i'll do it and you're going to do it three times but, again, the water is going to want to go in your nose so just be careful, but i'm going to be drinking from the wrong side of us so."
10980.0,Patient,Three times.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, but don't lift your head up notice, I did all of it upside down. don't lift it back up."

10980.0,Patient,How they're gone.

105.0,Provider,"Okay. um. Well let's see if that's true have the events in your life that were provoking whatever feelings, you had before, have they changed or has your ability to manage those events changed."
10980.0,Patient,I think both.
105.0,Provider,"Both Okay, so what is what situations that may have been provoking distress to what has gone down."

10980.0,Patient,um yeah it'll never change. Like that part will never change.
105.0,Provider,"Your interpretation of that has. been different, though it's not as activating for you as it used to be it's."
10980.0,Patient,Now okay.
105.0,Provider,"Well you've got some real freedom in there now. yeah you get to be happy, even when your mom's talking about whatever you get to be just as happy. mm hmm cool. All right, and what about trying to see a little something in here, there was a period of time, I think you were having some. Some dreams want to check in on that a little bit."
10980.0,Patient,"You know what hasn't changed, I still dream about the dead. Okay, so weird."
105.0,Provider,"Well, it. was up just stay there, stay there, stay there, so you're saying oh i'm still having dreams of the dead so who you dreaming about that's already passed away."
10980.0,Patient,"I mean, even the other day I dream about a friend of ours is mom and dad they've been dead for a while. You know that's kind of unusual. But it's always somebody that's passed away that's in my dreams, as always. doesn't matter where or even somebody that i'm involved with. I find it really weird."
105.0,Provider,and any other any other dreams content sites up.
10980.0,Patient,"Well they're all normal dreams, you know I. But why are they there, why are they alive I it's weird. Like."
105.0,Provider,"Even yes, the dead are alive in the dream."
10980.0,Patient,"yeah. You know day before yesterday, my brother Joe. I dream about him. What we alive."
105.0,Provider,What was he doing.
10980.0,Patient,You know I don't really remember that specifics. But it's always. There alive and there well and. Sometimes even their face is not their face. But I interpret them to be that person.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
10980.0,Patient,"But most of the time their faces. who they are. But I haven't had any crazy dreams so where i've been Donald has to wake me up, I have a lot of those where i'm crying and. He has I start crying to my sleep, I guess, because he's always coming to wake me up."
105.0,Provider,What was the last time you cried in your sleep.
10980.0,Patient,i'm spent a few months.
105.0,Provider,Do you remember how you felt in your last stream. The emotion.
10980.0,Patient,Oh very sad.
105.0,Provider,what was going on in the dream.
10980.0,Patient,I don't remember now.
105.0,Provider,Oh.
10980.0,Patient,I don't remember. The last bad dream I had I don't remember.
105.0,Provider,"me ask, let me ask the question again. Though because I think here's what i'm seeing I dropped a friends sort of family, friends who passed away a while ago, I was thinking that was the more recent one. yeah okay so go with that."
10980.0,Patient,"Okay, I gotta put my charger on. didn't realize, I was gonna die here. Okay. That one wasn't bad. It was just basically. A normal dream it wasn't sad or anything I don't remember specifics. But I even woke up and I told my husband, you need to call Jerome because i've DRAM of him and his parents and his parents have been gone for a while."
105.0,Provider,And so it made you think of taking some action. yeah did you do it.
10980.0,Patient,"Well, he is his friend well it's a both of our friend, but. i'm not sure he hasn't called him yet. we've been kind of busy with our House our houses. we're going to go under some construction the plumbing underneath the home is messed up so they're going to have to tear apart. The flooring to get to the plumbing to fix it yeah."
105.0,Provider,I dry.
10980.0,Patient,yeah the only good thing is the insurance is going to cover it. yeah that's the only good thing. yeah. And my dog my dog is so old she's already 14 years old and she's showing so many signs that she's not. Doing so well. She can't see she's like really blind now.
105.0,Provider,"yeah you think you would get another pet. No, no."
10980.0,Patient,"When I got her. I told my kids I don't want a dog I want the perfect dog. I want a dog that I don't have to work out. And I got her. wow she turned out to be I dog whispered her to death, you know the dog whisper. I did everything that he showed, and she turned out to be the best dog ever wow. And I don't have the energy to do that again. puppies are too hard."
105.0,Provider,"i'm looking at your goals and it wouldn't be I say I would love to dream of something happy, do you think that you are getting there or that you have had anything where there's been some content that has been happy."
10980.0,Patient,"Well, it hasn't been sad."
105.0,Provider,Okay that's interesting.
10980.0,Patient,I can't very well say it's been happy.
105.0,Provider,Right well what would it look like if it were happy.
10980.0,Patient,"yeah well. I guess i'd be talking more about it, if it was something great."
105.0,Provider,"What do you want, what do you want to dream about."
10980.0,Patient,I want to dream about being in the mountains. By a lake.
105.0,Provider,Right.
10980.0,Patient,"Not having to wake up and take my grandkids. i'm an uber uber grandma yeah. I have to take them everywhere. that's okay. Well, be complaining when they're. they're not coming around and I don't see him anymore we're never satisfied."
105.0,Provider,"So, this would you say that this is you're making some progress it hasn't been the sad ones it's not exactly happy you're sort of curious and you ended up taking some action based on the content of one of them with the family, friends and. yeah okay. I missed the last time you talk. thought about those people Besides having it happen in dream."
10980.0,Patient,it's been a while I mean he was a big part of our lives. But he got really sick he got cancer. And he stopped coming around. So we haven't seen him in a few years. I don't know it's weird just when I it's even uncle's I dream of my uncle's the other day. And he's been gone for a while. Just weird I don't know.
105.0,Provider,"You said, sometimes there's a face that doesn't match the feeling. The sense, a lot of times it's really the face that belongs. yeah okay. Alright, want to review a little few other things with you. You have been continuing to make efforts to need packaging. Alright, the topic is exercise I need to exercise more and how I think we've talked about videos and being very intentional about them and scheduling and having all the equipment ready things like that what ends up happening, though, and in reality, what happens."
10980.0,Patient,"It don't do it, I don't have find the time to do it, I have the time."
105.0,Provider,Okay don't do. don't don't create the time okay.
10980.0,Patient,i'd be lying if I said I don't have the time because I do.
105.0,Provider,"I don't want to make you lie. And I want to not have pain and not take anything. Well you've been taking ibuprofen and tylenol tylenol and you said exercising. This morning, like first thing."
10980.0,Patient,"I have to, I have to get up and do stretches and stuff just to get my body going even my hands are so small, and when I wake up. it's a must."
105.0,Provider,"and increase self care. So the objective I don't have anything for that just to go to therapy if we need to change that i'm going to change this one, the goal is going to say the same. But it needs it needs something more specific, for you. not cutting it so copy. paste. So let's get into a little bit more, and I, you did handout in a little bit and you do sometimes that there's no time for you So how are you going to have increased self care. If you're not carving out time for it, and if you were to carve out time for what would you be doing."
10980.0,Patient,that's a good question. I. don't really have an answer for that.
105.0,Provider,"Well let's look at. Help us sort of get a sense and sometimes you can roll it out, you can say self care. Go to its opposite know when do you notice, you have let your cup run in D so there's been so little self care. that sometimes we become irritable. Sad, we start to think about escapes of things like like suicide We walked into our relationship with a bit of that it will got very extreme and so, but it long before that there are signs that it's happening so if we say okay well. I know when i've not. been taking care of myself right self care. But how do you know when you're doing it, so we want to look at the actions and behaviors that equal self care. Sometimes they're fun sometimes they are nourishing sometimes they're empowering are different for everyone there's no one set thing when we spend a couple minutes trying to figure out your definition of self care. What are some of the things that you think you don't have to know it can just guess because maybe you haven't done them. What might they be."
10980.0,Patient,i'd love to walk more. i'd love to get out more okay.
105.0,Provider,and
10980.0,Patient,When you say to do.
105.0,Provider,You say three times a week would feel like progress. yeah okay. you're not doing it at all at this point.
10980.0,Patient,This isn't taking people where they need to go no.
105.0,Provider,"Okay okay so client will walk three times a week well walk from zero to three times a week. Okay, so let's take a we see this other so. I want to have some same thing okay yeah let's let's stay there um. You have this sense of acknowledgement that you know you can create time but don't. Knowing that it can get extreme if you don't take time, if you don't address the things that are not fulfilling not rewarding not keeping your cup spiritually psychologically emotionally physically full or least not depleted. You know that it's important you've seen the benefit of it you're seeing these are kind of just regular i'm i'm meeting life's adversities fine. Because pipes break. People need to be picked up from school early, sometimes we take people to the hospital but you're meeting those needs, and it doesn't sound like you're getting these very extreme. I would call them manager firefighter parts that are coming up, which might say, to use drugs and alcohol to escape or to kill the self."
10980.0,Patient,kill someone.
105.0,Provider,"So those are very extreme, as you can see. yeah but if i'm hearing you correctly it's not getting to that point you're meeting those events of adversity and you are you proud of how your meeting those challenges."
10980.0,Patient,"Of course, from where I was yeah."
105.0,Provider,"Well that's still a life that is reactive. So okay hang on so. You might indeed and you just said, well first i'm proud of it, I like how i'm handling situations that come up I like it, but what self care suggests is that you're doing things on purpose scheduling them protecting those things letting everyone know no, this is my meantime. Right so it's different than reacting Oh, I like how I react to the unexpected things in life i'm handling that better but it's really different to say okay look at my schedule i'm looking at it. Okay, I want to walk three days a week, and look at it go how where can I plug that in tell everyone that's what i'm doing and use boundaries, to make sure unless someone's bleeding out that you protect it. And that you can you remember that you know this is part of your long term recovery to this is part of your spiritual psychological well being. Is that you have the self care piece in there, so when you think about walking three times a week, would it help you to look at a schedule like are you a visual person, where you want to see what it would look like, how could you carve that out, could we begin to schedule something."
10980.0,Patient,Maybe scheduling that that might work. To where I keep it up.
105.0,Provider,"Right, most people once they start something they don't want to break the pattern they're like oh I work so hard to do that first time I better keep it going. So it's really getting over that that initial challenge of the first or second time we get our pride involved once we've got it rolling and then we can rely on that oh I don't want to break this pattern and i'm doing so well, so if you already know your schedule. Which days, do you think those three might be."
10980.0,Patient,"Well, Monday for sure."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, what time. One 1pm okay. and the next day."
10980.0,Patient,Wednesday
105.0,Provider,What time there might.
10980.0,Patient,be one.
105.0,Provider,who got a nice pattern here.
10980.0,Patient,And Saturday. One when I could do Sunday to.
105.0,Provider,"And if there was that option but we're going to start with a commitment of this. That would be an atom. yeah That would be an add on that Sunday thing would be an add on more is is better, but this one we're just trying to get you to the Monday Wednesday Saturday. OK so number one you might put it in your phone you might put it somewhere where the block of time that comes before walking what will you be doing for that."
10980.0,Patient,clean.
105.0,Provider,you'll be cleaning.
10980.0,Patient,mineral adamant to have everything clean before I do anything.
105.0,Provider,So where do you think you'll be cleaning like bye bye you know i'd.
10980.0,Patient,be done.
105.0,Provider,"1245 so i'm being very specific where, will you be."
10980.0,Patient,I will be done and ready that's what I want to be that's.
105.0,Provider,"that's a status, let me try again, I will be in the bathroom I always do the bathroom last so I know i'll be in the bathroom or i'll be in the kitchen. The kitchen. kitchen there we go, so what you want, there is a visual cue sometimes the queue is a sticky sometimes the queue is I always have. A cup of tea after i'm done, and then it might be on the fridge might be on the tea, what do you do fridge. fridge Okay, so you want to put the sticky there want to put the note there just for a. While you're getting in."
10980.0,Patient,There always get my bottle of tea. yeah rich.
105.0,Provider,"But another fridge go walk you also want to have. A contingency, and this is a hard thing this is you read parenting yourself, which is on the sticky you'd say. Get tennis shoes on before tea, so what you need to do is trick yourself it's like we would with a child, if you need to go get yourself dressed and then your reward is going to be that tea. You can't have your tea until you put your clothes on you're walking close on it's a little trick it may seem like it won't work but. We can do it can say wait a minute do I always eat ice cream before I eat my dinner now I tend to make sure I eat the nutritious the protein the carbs and the veggies and then i'll have ice cream, you can do it it's nothing fancy or, then what we just talked about what the food. We work can we play you know and you'll laugh you'll negotiate this is silly but then you'll go, I want to make it work for me. To go put my clothes on what's the big deal they're already clean and ready be good if you have that already out good him on yo good now I get to MIT have your teeth and you get to go for your walk. And you might need to do that for a little while the sticky notes it's really weird about our eyes and our mind on the sticky note you'll stop being able to see the sticky note after a while. it's just weird we stopped seeing the signs and if you've ever worked in a building or been somewhere you don't even see the signs anymore you've become. So. But in the first in the beginning it's helpful and then we get habituated but. That would be great now is there anything else that might get in the way she want to do is never proactive you don't want to be reactive. So you want to think about telling people that you're doing it hey This is my walk time if you can possibly call someone else. During between one and 130 that would be great because that's when i'm going to be doing my exercise is there anything you could do to protect your self care time."
10980.0,Patient,This i'll let don't know.
105.0,Provider,I don't know yeah anything you need.
10980.0,Patient,me to help me to.
105.0,Provider,"uh huh yeah. Go ahead oh he'll help encourage you. yeah sweet love it okay so we've got something very tangible here. And again sticking those alarms in there, you know 1215 1245 saying you're going to be walking and so, however, that works out so you've been in the kitchen that's handy all right wait you got you got yourself a new a new, very specific goal there. And that's getting you to walk three days a week, just let me just write that down Monday Wednesday Saturday 1pm Monday Wednesday is that. Now all right great. You haven't mentioned anything about some of your relationships with people that have been difficult before. Obviously, your your husband is there's been a big improvement there but you've talked about other relationships to what are you seeing with some of those other important relationships."
10980.0,Patient,I don't i'm in my circle I don't go out of my circle more more.
105.0,Provider,There are people in that circle.
10980.0,Patient,i'm. No. No more.
105.0,Provider,Time. You know.
10980.0,Patient,"it's I stick here within just my family my family my kids. My grandkids I don't go outside my bubble anymore. I mean my mom it's it's difficult enough. To just deal with that I don't go any further. Your size, I mean it will never change because, like even. The other day she told me, can you come over, and I was like. Now it's not a good idea she's like well Marty is going to be gone this weekend, so why don't you come over this weekend so still acknowledging, you know. That he runs things. and using that I was like that doesn't change anything. Just because he's not there."
105.0,Provider,And what's the emotion you feel when she said that.
10980.0,Patient,"It didn't bother me. It didn't it doesn't bother me no more before I yeah but now i'm used to it, it is what it is."
105.0,Provider,"And you really believe that she cannot metabolize or listen hear you saying, although you say right now don't have a feeling, but I think there's one in there you do or don't think she could hear you saying."
10980.0,Patient,you're trying to she can.
105.0,Provider,or she do.
10980.0,Patient,yeah I know she she knows what I mean.
105.0,Provider,"Well, how would you say it."
10980.0,Patient,"Well, I even told her she's I told you, you want to come over and. and be with the kids because it was a whose birthday my grandson's the youngest one his birthday and she says yeah i'll go to your House. And then she said, you should come over so we can make pies I told him I don't feel comfortable here, and you know it. And she's like okay well i'll go to your House."
105.0,Provider,I did you learn anything from that I didn't learn what makes you uncomfortable. See that's why I asked what she told her because I don't hear anything about. my brother runs the show here. That was about pies and coming over.
10980.0,Patient,She said I don't go to her house anymore. I know she lived across the street. And I don't.
105.0,Provider,"Okay it's Okay, sometimes, the answer is no, I don't want to tell my mom. But. You started with and that's why I asked can she hear it, you said yes, but I don't think she's actually heard it because I got to hear it, I got to hear the real skinny. But I it's not about me."
10980.0,Patient,It doesn't faze her it's not going to change her.
105.0,Provider,"Different that's different than my asking you can she hear it. didn't say change her can she hear it, she might get up and do the exact same thing, but could should hear it. yeah she good. She wouldn't. Okay. So if that's true i'm wondering if really The reason is because it's pointless I don't want her to just hear it, I want change, do you think that might be going on, like why bother if she's not going to make a change."
10980.0,Patient,"Exactly. kinda yeah. At this point, i'm not looking for change anymore."
105.0,Provider,i'm going to send a quick little note. Well that's a great relief actually that's that thing you're doing were you I would call it letting go of the outcome. Is a huge element to the recipe of freedom to say i'm going to do what i'm going to do and i'm gonna let go the expectation that people are going to change i'm just going to. Do my thing. there's a slight difference with mom which is I don't know that you've said directly that this particular behavior so about pies.
10980.0,Patient,"No, no it's just that she has the recipe for it and. She would come over and we'd make them and show me and my granddaughter the her secret to her lemon meringue eyes. yeah and me and my granddaughter we're thinking about doing that, but I don't know how I literally don't know how unless she's here to. say what goes where. And she said well come over here we'll do them over here and I was like huh."
105.0,Provider,"Well, between you and I, and i'm not giving a prescription of you going and talking to her, I want you if you can have some ears that can hear it. What is it that happens with this idea if you were over there at her house, making the pies."
10980.0,Patient,"I it's me. it's all it's all about me because, when he threw us out of the House and told us not to come back and she didn't allow it, but she didn't stop it."
105.0,Provider,It made you feel.
10980.0,Patient,Like I don't belong there.
105.0,Provider,"It doesn't get much bigger than that Nice. that's that's a big experience it's not quite a label of an emotion, but feeling like you don't belong, and are not wanted. That emotion. has been there since you were a little girl. So you can have a small little pie baking trigger and it can activate that pain of being unwanted from being little. And it can right that's. it's a big. it's a big deal."
10980.0,Patient,It is a big deal. But i'm not letting that bother me anymore okay.
105.0,Provider,"It does sound like you're setting clear boundaries and you've certainly let go the change. And the only thing that I wonder is and that's why my very first question was i'm wondering if she has the capability of hearing it, there are some people that mature and they grow. they're able to evolve, some people do not some people they're going to stay the way this is how they view the world."
10980.0,Patient,And that's my mom.
105.0,Provider,asked your mom okay so you're probably smart to be careful. To not get your hopes up that something's going to be different and she'll be able to really hear you and. and hold space for that pain of that industry.
10980.0,Patient,that's exactly right.
105.0,Provider,"I just curious is that, like she values nails more is that her conditioning the way she grew up, I want to rush gets that."
10980.0,Patient,I don't know i'm the only girl out of five brothers and. The only other person that ever felt like that was jimbo and he killed himself.
105.0,Provider,He felt that same way.
10980.0,Patient,And I don't know what to say about that. Because even I wasn't involved in this life that bothers me more than anything. we've touched on that. I don't know if we'll ever get over that.
105.0,Provider,"As I recall, you had some what you were describing as sort of guilt somehow around it. And it still is showing up now i'm having that same sort of feeling."
10980.0,Patient,always have that. Because I feel bad I know how what he was going through and I did nothing.
105.0,Provider,She think you did it maliciously. or were you trying to survive your own life.
10980.0,Patient,"Well, I was trying to survive my own life at the time, everybody was turning against my son."
105.0,Provider,When you did you have a sense of responsibility for him emotionally when you were growing up.
10980.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. I told you, he lived with me, he was. Always with me, I raised him. Even after. He was going to school year he had his graduation party here. He lived with me, he was always with me. And when he was young, he was very shy, and he stuttered. And it bothered him a lot. But the world revolves around Marty."
105.0,Provider,golden child.
10980.0,Patient,"And like I told you, he even had an affair, with his wife. that's how Baptists. And I didn't know any of this none of this because Donald was sick, for a long time. We were in the hospital for like two years and and out in and out. And all these things were going on. And I knew nothing about. Until my son to divorce, then everything blew up."
105.0,Provider,"i'm wondering if next time we meet we might explore doing some parts work around. And we may not make any sense but. You being responsible being emotionally responsible for raising someone else you know, a sibling that really that's not your job and that's a parent's job. Sometimes that that can do something to to a person, and I wonder, I wonder where that lives inside of you, and maybe we could explore that next time. Okay okay let's schedule something together and see what works for you. we're on a Wednesday. What I happen to have on a Wednesday is I have 9am and I have."
10980.0,Patient,1212 is good.
