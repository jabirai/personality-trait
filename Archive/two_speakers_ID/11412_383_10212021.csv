383.0,Provider,mm hmm and.
11412.0,Patient,it's it's. I don't know I mean it's just lovely up here I don't know why i'm not happy.
383.0,Provider,"Well, so a couple things just tell you a bit more about like the negative talk in your head, is it the suicidal thoughts or is it just regrets about the past or. What kind of thing."
11412.0,Patient,"yeah it's. it's gone to suicidal threats twice, you know, in the last week. And it's it's usually because of something financial or. or i'm i'm in a lot of pain, and I mean that's typical for me, I should be used to that. But i'm not and and I keep I get this like I told you, I get this pit in my stomach and it just. sinks me down, and I feel stuck and one i'm stuck there. I take a seroquel. i'm getting off of the lorazepam. she's she's replaced it with some 25 milligram live seroquel so I take that and then I take 100 milligrams of it at night. To help me get to sleep. And it helps. But like yesterday I was so upset yesterday over it was over money and we weren't fighting or anything but it's just you know what we want to get done and who, whose priorities comfort."
383.0,Provider,me.
11412.0,Patient,"I got really upset yesterday I did take a lorazepam yesterday because of that. And I fell asleep I just fell asleep I woke up about 1030 at night, this happened at about four. And I just woke up and he was watching TV and I said wow I I fell asleep hard and he goes yeah you did and. I just rolled over from effects."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Will. Do you want some feedback about some of what you just. described and express. First of all, a move of house and move them home, even if it's a place that you are really it's beautiful and it's amazing it's fabulous and those waves, is still a transitional. trauma in a way to us, you know moving is is is quite a. disruption."
11412.0,Patient,And yeah.
383.0,Provider,"it's it's not easy for the psyche to. To make that adjustment and there's loss there's a sense of loss. yeah of your old life and there's an unfamiliarity with the new life, even though the but it's just kind of like unfamiliar and. You know kind of you just don't quite feel a home, you know, even though it could be a fabulous. And I think that is a really good move you guys made. yeah but it's still unfamiliar it's still kind of new and you don't quite feel settled there and so."
11412.0,Patient,"that's feeling out of control. I feel like things are out of control and I just shut down, you know what I mean. The horizon put back together. You know our whole Center misbuild with boxes you can't do anything till the remodels done."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so you're in transition, and these periods of transition, are stressful. it's very normal they're stressful they are sort of. Just they shake up our bottle of security and and comfort and. Maybe that bottle needed to get shake up and it's a good thing. But you have certain things in place that where your comforts. Such as you've described in previous sessions like you know your can."
11412.0,Patient,well.
383.0,Provider,I like that you were you liked it in your room and. And all that got you know shaken up and you. You are things that may be some things that you liked so.
11412.0,Patient,I don't even know some things that are gone. Right and i'll probably never remember.
383.0,Provider,"right which is, which is great that you remember, but the springs on sadness so sadness and your. Is is is not. Like there's something. that's not. not mean that's to be expected there's nothing wrong with with that that's normal response to change of. Opium and relocation, you have you're in transition, you lost or you, you know you let go of. Your life from before and you're not really familiar too much with this new life and it feels kind of there's a sadness that comes with that and I think that that's. So that's I wanted to say that about that. How does that just that validation How does that make you feel."
11412.0,Patient,"calms me down, I feel like Okay, I wrote it all down i'm going to reread it i'll rewrite it. And you know just try to get it to sink in that it's okay that i'm sad and it's Okay, because of the move it's just a really stressful time and until I get my my things back in place. Yes, handle my life. All those things aren't where they're supposed to be, you know, in my opinion."
383.0,Provider,"And that's a process that's a process, so I just moved off so. I moved and, as you know, and. and got rid of many things dive many things to get rid of, but I moved to a totally different place and. yeah there's been days of just like excitement and kind of the fun of being in a new place."
11412.0,Patient,flooring yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and then there's the days of some kind of unsettled feelings related to moving, so I just want to really normalize what you're experiencing the sun."
11412.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,"And just so a ways to sort of take care of yourself, I think, are you know you're doing. I think it's very good what you're doing of like taking NAPs recognizing that."
11412.0,Patient,"Oh. Okay, I don't like I was like cheating, or like just trying to evade. You know, by taking a nap."
383.0,Provider,No it's I think it's healthy to take NAPs to just take some NAPs here and then it's just so that you can you know it's overwhelming. You know boxes and stuff out of stuff out of place and the move and the financial cost is becomes it can be really overwhelming and taking just a little nap. it's like you're sleeping all day. From what you're saying i'm not getting up out of bed. But. But taking some taking these NAPs is kind of it's a restorative.
11412.0,Patient,"yeah It gives me a break from feeling so out of control, with everything that's going on around me. Right, the kitchen isn't put together because they're painting it right now. The only place that sort of is my bedroom they did this burst, so we could move in here, and so my bedroom is slowly. Coming to where I was before, but there's boxes of stuff in the summer room that I can't get to, and even if I, and you know Those are some of my my my things that I. You know, like the candle and the light and the music and just different things I haven't been able to get them in place yet and I don't want to stress him out by saying I need you to find this box that as such in such in it, you know."
383.0,Provider,Right right but I.
11412.0,Patient,"I want to, but."
383.0,Provider,"Maybe you can find a compromise there of. You know, when you feel you know good maybe in the morning or coffee, you can ask him, you know i'd really love it if you could, could you kind of look for this box if it's labeled I mean. that's the problem, sometimes box on Labor but if it's labeled and it has something that you know Oh, the two would like to have you know Would you mind. Taking a few minutes and looking for that box and because you'd really like to unpack some of that stuff in your room. there's nothing wrong with that that's seems perfectly reasonable and something to kind of give yourself, because I know when I moved some of the most important things for me where to put up. For some reason, putting up the artwork on the walls. That right up to me feel like I was inhabiting. yeah. So some of your your treasure things are some of the things that make you feel like you are. Making your mark in your home and it's yours, you know those are important to kind of get in place to kind of settle you down to that you start to feel like you're, not just in kind of no man's land at the thing."
11412.0,Patient,"i'll ask him. i'll see what he says what can it he'll think it probably say no, but."
383.0,Provider,"I you know, sometimes timing is is really good with making requests, you know choosing a time."
11412.0,Patient,When right.
383.0,Provider,"When you feel calm when you sense that he's pretty calm and it's feeling pretty Okay, you know I mean, knowing that you're both going through the stress of moving kind of. picking and choosing a time and maybe. not making it being a huge request, just like if you could find this one box and you can emphasize it's just this one, you know box that has the special things in it that if you if he could maybe take a few minutes and see if he could find that for you. So it doesn't seem like a big deal, you know."
11412.0,Patient,"OK, so the timing of the request."
383.0,Provider,"A timing, that you are in a calm, space and that he is also in a calm good place you know so."
11412.0,Patient,yeah okay.
383.0,Provider,"And, and also knowing you know just knowing that this is the time of transition now life has all of these kinds of chapters, there are you know. phases and there's phases that are up, they are transitional phases, they are. And and that's what you're in and when we're in a transitional phase. Things are you know, things are not stable, they are, they are in mood they're in flux and so a move is a time of transition, where things are in flux there. and And so you're going to feel less control and that's how and it's a good. Time to kind of learn about you know you being a practice you being okay. With your own self and your breath and things around you to be in flux and you're still Okay, you know that's going to be part of what you're kind of. Learning or. that's what the stretches before you right now yeah."
11412.0,Patient,"Right right, this is a stretch for me that for sure."
383.0,Provider,right if you tend to like to be organized and kind of like. Like control like like like things you know sort of in their place and.
11412.0,Patient,"Yes, that's me. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Give yourself a pat on the back for taking this on I mean you really. taking on. You know, big thing. yeah what's coming up for you right now just emotionally, as we have this conversation."
11412.0,Patient,"But i'm a control freak and I can't handle it when things are not within my control. And I have to realize that. This transitional phase. it's going to pass it's a season and i'll move into this season only by a transitional phase. Transition means change right. Right and I, I just have to handle it better, I guess, I have to really do some deep breathing do more of that. And I need to call my. find a way to call myself. Just Center myself and realize it's Okay, this is OK, you know."
383.0,Provider,"And this is part of. part of what it takes to get. What you want, on the other side, which is to not you know, to live to live in a smaller house to downsize to be able to move from your bedroom to the kitchen to. You know all of the things which, which you know you know. The reason I moved."
11412.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"So, reminding yourself that you know you don't couldn't get to where you are right now, unless you. did what you're doing. And so, if you've got to go through that discomfort to get where you want to go."
11412.0,Patient,that's right. that's right. you're right. And i'll get through it.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
11412.0,Patient,"I don't feel like it right now, but I will get to it will get unpacked my things will be in place soon it's just gonna take a little more time."
383.0,Provider,yeah and that's just what i'm yeah.
11412.0,Patient,"I can only do so much you know if he brings boxes in here, I can unpack them 15 minutes at a time and then I rest and then. Like my back just started to really hurt I can't stand there and do things myself. I want to ask. ask him to help me with every little thing. me with you know hardware kind of stuff. nails screws and all that kind of. But I shouldn't make him feel like he's. My. he's my way to get back in control by utilizing him to fix things and new things to do. I can't put all that on him, you know, this is my inner crap and. He doesn't handle things the same way he's pretty happy go lucky. I just I can't use him to get through this transition for me, you know what I mean."
383.0,Provider,"Right right yeah I mean I think it's also kind of sometimes it's a false sense that Oh, if he just puts all this up i'm going to feel better you know i'm going to feel fine."
11412.0,Patient,"yeah it is it's false, but that is exactly how I feel it keeps to this but I don't say it, I probably do say it, you probably feels it. Right right. So it is be modify my behavior."
383.0,Provider,"Well, doing the deep breathing and reminding yourself, this is, this is, this is what transition looks like you know this is kind of what changed looks like before you get and to. What you're creating before you get. What you're right, you know you can't Have a nice floor that's. You know, clean and neat and tidy or whatever, unless you. pick things up and and yeah I mean construction is happening for a reason it's to to make the changes in your living space that to make it. Better and Nice, you know, maybe think of those construction that construction is what what needs to happen is to create the kind of life that you want so you're going to be patient with that."
11412.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,So kind of. From your thoughts. wrapping your thoughts around this with more perspective.
11412.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"you're the perspective of you know, in order to have something the way you wanted it needs to be built, and so, therefore, you can play, you can play these contractors to build things to the it's the way that you want it, so this is the Net, this is how things get built in the world. Deep breaths to deal with that anxiety that comes up around things being. In a state of relative disorder."
11412.0,Patient,"yeah. So this is how it is when we're trying to get things pretty. You know, even with myself, I mean with makeup or hair whatever right I you know some days I just don't want to do it and other days it's like you know what. i'll feel better if I do that not every day, but you know if I do it a couple times a week it makes me feel better about myself, you know, so there are all these things that I can do. To not feel so stressed out."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and give yourself those NAPs and those periods of rest. Yes, because yeah because of the stress. You know I don't want to downplay the stress of it, you know it is stressful. yeah. So do self The self soothing make yourself tea and and take those moments I think to enjoy. When you can't. yeah you know, taking those little walks outside taking a look around and going wow like look at look at."
11412.0,Patient,"By a lake. I was pretty outside, but if I don't go outside to look at it, then I don't see the beauty, so I I do need to. kind of appreciate that more you know."
383.0,Provider,take time to to to take that in also. So um I noticed that you had scheduled 30 some 30 minute appointments so they are more abbreviated appointment.
11412.0,Patient,I don't know if you knew that. I did know.
383.0,Provider,well.
11412.0,Patient,They have okay.
383.0,Provider,"When you schedule your appointments with the carrier navigation. You just want to confirm with them how long they are because we have 30 minute appointments 45 minutes therapy appointments and 60 minutes therapy appointments so that you have they scheduled them for you, maybe without you know."
11412.0,Patient,Being aware of that they didn't ask no I wasn't.

11412.0,Patient,"We went on, you want me to. Work on the 30 minutes like. Do you want to set another appointment or extend the one that's there."
383.0,Provider,"Well, your next appointment is on the fourth of November. So if you want to try to get in before that. Even if it's just another 30 minute appointment next week, maybe because you missed it you missed a couple of appointments because of your move. yeah so I don't think you've got your to therapy appointments and for note for October. know this month you canceled all of your many appointments, because I think if you move. For October, there were two appointments scheduled for you, and they were cancelled in early October, and so, if you. want to call the virtual clinic to see if. there's. time for next week, even if it's 30 minutes."
11412.0,Patient,It might. So we didn't talk on the fifth. We didn't talk on the fifth.
