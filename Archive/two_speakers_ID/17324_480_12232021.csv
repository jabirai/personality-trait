17324.0,Patient,"A good, healthy relationship and then you know when I didn't turn out perfect well we don't know how that happened right yeah. it's always it's never their fault it's always everyone else's. But uh."

17324.0,Patient,"not really actually I mean I dabbled as a teenager like acid RC dumb stuff but I didn't really start doing any hard drugs until I after I had my first daughter, I have fibromyalgia and I have to suck that's my neck. Oh, and I. started taking painkillers after my first daughter was born, because it started becoming more prevalent when I was pregnant with her, because of the late on my body. yeah and."

480.0,Provider,She just took this.
17324.0,Patient,"On and. I had really bad postpartum depression, with her, which I didn't realize was postpartum depression. yeah and the pain killers gave me energy they may be able to get up with her. Because they didn't slow like opiate slow, some people down they don't do that."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
17324.0,Patient,"Give me energy they kept me up and I started taking them by the handful because I could barely move, without them, I was so I was sleeping all the time I was miserable I couldn't figure out why I was so sad I did now looking back I realized I had really bad postpartum but I. didn't realize that's what it was them. yeah and the pain killers made that better and as the story goes you needed more and more and more eventually turned into heroin heroin and cocaine and IV drug use and yada yada yada and then smoking crack and just went from there and I. got clean from heroin in 2000 and. The 14. Okay, and I haven't looked back since. And i've been on suboxone ever since mostly because of the pain, at this point. hmm because, at some point i'm going to have to be on chronic pain management. Right and walk so manages the pain."
480.0,Provider,"So, since 2014 you haven't had any relapses with any opiates. No Nice. good for you."
17324.0,Patient,"I i've relapsed on cocaine and crack yes. Oh, but not opiate."
480.0,Provider,So when was the most recent relapse with cocaine crack.
17324.0,Patient,"march coven basically. I had a really. When we lost our jobs and everything sort of only word and we had all this extra money. yeah and nowhere to go and nothing to do with it. yeah idle hands are the devil's playground, you know."
480.0,Provider,Is your husband and two. Yes.
17324.0,Patient,"it's likely yes. yeah he's been clean for seven years, so. we're and he's behind me 110% just. I you know the problem is is I also, at the same time, got pregnant with danica and we were not planning on being pregnant. And I love her to death, with everything in my heart but and I hate to say this, but I did not want to be pregnant with her like when I found out, I was pregnant with her, I was not happy about it, you know what I mean."
480.0,Provider,100% relate to that.
17324.0,Patient,"I am loved it with all my heart now, but I was not happy about it."
480.0,Provider,Was it because of the postpartum and all the mental stuff.
17324.0,Patient,"And and going off and mental health manage and everything like that, and my bipolar and everything else, I was in that yeah and I become a complete train wreck when i'm pregnant because of all."
480.0,Provider,"Well, you definitely shouldn't feel bad for feeling that way because I felt that way with my last one, and a lot of women, I know about that way because of similar issues and. it's totally normal to feel like that, and like you said it doesn't take away from how grateful, you are now to add her it's just yeah absolutely normal to have those feelings at the beginning and think oh my gosh here we go again."
17324.0,Patient,"Right and because I was done with carly she I mean she was five when I found out, I was pregnant with Danny we were done she was my last did it was. We were done having kids and then I found out, I was pregnant with her so rise, and it was like."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
17324.0,Patient,i'd like I was done with diapers and. How do you training and. Babies period and I love this little tornado but.
480.0,Provider,I was not happy about it and it took me a while to really get into it and then.
17324.0,Patient,"You know, going off my mental health man's and then I just kind of lost it for a while and I did search dragon and I just kind of detach myself from it all together."
480.0,Provider,"So, was that, after she was born that you."
17324.0,Patient,know before.
480.0,Provider,Before okay.
17324.0,Patient,"I got myself together, thank God, and when she asked three days after she was born, I put myself in the mental health facility."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, good for you okay."
17324.0,Patient,"It was hard leaving her in the hospital and walking away, but especially not being able to bond with her immediately and having to come home to a three month old but."
480.0,Provider,"So, how was the bond then at three months old do you feel like you're able to repair that a little bit."
17324.0,Patient,"yeah. we're great now she's. she's my little shadow, but it was tough At first it was very it was different. Like my five year old and I are super super close and i'm like that, with her now but it wasn't immediately it wasn't just there, I had to work for it."
480.0,Provider,That would be a very interesting experience for sure.
17324.0,Patient,"yeah it wasn't just like having a baby and knowing that they know you and. yeah actually I she had to get to know me, and that was it was different. It was hard, I had to I actually had to work. For my baby to love me and I had to try for her you know, to know me and want to be part of my life right she had."
480.0,Provider,One I don't think it was that you had to work for her love it was that you had. To work for the trust.
17324.0,Patient,Because the right.
480.0,Provider,action within that was there.
17324.0,Patient,"Well, and my mother in law flew up here for that time so as my husband and my mother in law, taking care of her so she had caretaker."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
17324.0,Patient,Because I didn't need me. yeah and that was hard for me to like she didn't need me.
480.0,Provider,That would be really hard so do you feel like. What. How old is she now she's a year.
17324.0,Patient,year old now.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've been. Number One."
17324.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so um, how do you feel like. That was for you emotionally and where do you feel like you're at now as far as like. stuff that triggers specifically the relationship with her."
17324.0,Patient,I feel like things are a lot. Better now I I still went through a pretty bad Funk in New York for a while. Just. I don't know I just. Just New York in general I think we just needed to start fresh I think getting here and having a fresh start and just a new beginning and better schools and better opportunities like we've just had a Napoleon family since we've been here but.
480.0,Provider,"Were you up there, your whole life like born and raised in New York."
17324.0,Patient,"Think. I can't help it she's beating a performance doesn't know what a Fort is. um I just I feel like we have a great relationship now, and I feel like we have a really good bond because of all the effort, I had to put into it, you know what I mean."
480.0,Provider,"yeah well and I was wondering, because a lot of times, having to put so much conscious effort into someone else is actually a really good coping skill for a lot of the things you were saying you struggle with. So I could imagine that it could have either gone one of two ways like it could have triggered a lot of guilt and shame and made you more prone to. Those kinds of spirals or it could have had the opposite effect and made you more present and more grateful and given you more confidence and self esteem."
17324.0,Patient,Are you there you froze on me for a SEC.
480.0,Provider,"um Okay, so when did it freeze I was just talking to myself."
17324.0,Patient,it's a year I frozen. They say someone's to self esteem and confidence. yeah well okay.
480.0,Provider,"So that was pretty much it so yeah so it sounds like you went that way for you that I gave you more confidence self esteem made you more secure in who you are, which is awesome because that probably helped overall with recovery more than you weren't even aware, at the time."
17324.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
480.0,Provider,So what would you say. You want to focus on in individual therapy.
17324.0,Patient,I definitely I have a lot of issues with like my ptsd I still have 11 night terrors. Okay um. I have a lot of issues. With trust and boundaries.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
17324.0,Patient,I struggle with boundaries.
480.0,Provider,and your ptsd is not related to childhood.
17324.0,Patient,"Childhood teenage socks and. stuff that I did, while I was out in using like I used to work in the street so things that have happened to me from. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness."
480.0,Provider,Show me your four. Oh wow. that's pretty good.
17324.0,Patient,She said Jay ham.
480.0,Provider,papi jimmy's copy.

480.0,Provider,um.
17324.0,Patient,don't you be a baby. i'm walking away from over you.
480.0,Provider,So. January appointments what's the best day in time of day for you does.
17324.0,Patient,"um any during the week is fine um and. any danger of like during the day when she's in school, so I only have the baby is probably better."
480.0,Provider,"that's better for me and actually people prefer. afternoon evening, so let me see what I have and we typically for people that are pretty stable in recovery which it sounds like you have been for a little while I typically only scheduled 30 minute appointments if we start like really getting into trauma work. Then we can always extend it to an hour. But um, especially with having the kid it might be easier to do."
17324.0,Patient,"Well i'm still working on getting my psychiatrists and therapists worked out, I just made like I said everything I was saying yesterday i'm working on. But every place I call says they need an actual referral from a doctor it's not like it wasn't a rush to region, literally go into the walk in places."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
17324.0,Patient,and walk in and get a therapist.
480.0,Provider,that's weird. yeah hmm.
17324.0,Patient,"I call, all the places that you guys sent me number two and they said they wanted referrals from my doctor."
480.0,Provider,"Where are you what city. rally i'm. Very strange Okay, so I am going to schedule. You how about Fridays. So i'm thinking. 14 on the 28th at 10am is that too early January 2020 emma's perfect. Okay, and then the 14th of January at 10am to."
