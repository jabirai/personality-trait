So, as you saw like two minutes in. i'm starting to the penance and my Internet just. decided yeah we're not going to work for a good 55 minutes, I could not. I know slack I couldn't even notify the care navs like what was going."

510.0,Provider,"it's just been a wild time for me so yeah so I need to kind of get you up to speed, because I was out unexpectedly last week. For a family emergency, so I didn't I was like oh I don't know she's in group, but thank you for letting me know, and I feel free to share feedback of what happened in group, if you need to talk through anything. The week prior, though, because I have not seen you. have I seen you. As our last session because I don't think i've seen you to notify you about my resignation, I think this was my first Oh, because I had to cancel an appointment that we had last week."
11237.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah.
510.0,Provider,"that's why so there there's a handful of clients, that I was not able. To see one on one. Last week in preparation, because I had given my notice at the end of August. And started my notification on September 1 I."
11237.0,Patient,Had.
510.0,Provider,"A family issue, I had to attend to, and so I apologize that I knew this now being able to notify you. intentionally given a lot of time to give. bright heart. plenty of time to be thoughtful about you know who's going to take over my caseload I have not been told who that is yet. My guess is whoever takes over my I do back to that group so she'll until on Tuesdays My guess is, it will be someone you know, whoever takes those groups groups over will be your new therapist but once I find out. i'll share that with you and I are we scheduled. For the rest of September, let me make sure we are."
11237.0,Patient,We have.
510.0,Provider,"yeah we do. I think we do, let me just double check."
11237.0,Patient,We have Wednesday the 22nd which is next week.
510.0,Provider,"that's right because you and I was glad you were able to get on this week, even though it was a short session yep I have you Wednesday later in the day. My last week is filling up but we certainly can look, if you want to do a final session that week."
11237.0,Patient,We certainly talked about it but.
510.0,Provider,I want to sort of sorry I had to share all that I. just wanted to know what happened yesterday to. It was like a total alien grab like where is she like not great so sorry.
11237.0,Patient,"don't worry about it it's Okay, like the care navigator when I had spoken to them about like what is it called I don't even remember what I had initially asked them about. But they were like oh hey like we also since i'm on the phone with you right now need to reschedule tomorrow and I was like. what's tomorrow, so I checked my calendar i'm like oh yeah starting care and they told me like oh yeah she's got like you know a few things going on in her personal life so we're gonna have to like move it to a different day so yeah. And you know you've been pretty consistent with like just your presentation of self, as well as like. You know, showing up for us in group and with one on one, and I feel like you've done a pretty thorough job of being yourself so okay yeah like of course it's not like."
510.0,Provider,"I know, and then it just comes back."
11237.0,Patient,"Somebody has things to deal with you know now, I know I think I know."
510.0,Provider,"I appreciate your kindness and and most everyone has been extremely gracious. You know I just always do my best, because I tried to be that holding environment, but sometimes life I am human yep yes, so I appreciate that kindness deanna that says a lot about you that I already know, but I do appreciate it."
11237.0,Patient,"huh yeah. Well, first entered college Oh, we talked about this before, but I changed my major few times and I realized over the years. This is a very recent revelations that like you know that was. The. To me in my head the safest option, just because, like you know I had really all gone to college to. Not to make my mom happy because it was the only thing that was going to make her happy, but like. To. show her that I was serious and not just like you know sitting around and like you know, with the exception of accounting and stuff like that I was just like okay like I want something more interesting that evolved. and It was. Until I encountered a professor, that really just like she specifically like was a good person herself, but like because her view on psychology was so rigid like it really turned me off to everything, and I was just like okay like I can do this right now. But I always knew that like eventually. You know what i'm more financially stable just given the fact that, like it requires just a little bit extra schooling and, at the time I was like broke bro. I knew that like once I was financially stable I would be like. comfortable with the idea of return to it just because it's not like. it's not like I was just pursuing something to pursue it because somebody else told me, it was like a thought that I had, but I was like okay that's you know something. yeah."
510.0,Provider,"I think you would be great. yeah I really do and going through the process to me that makes a therapist that much better when you've gone through the process yourself. it's. it's not a prerequisite, but I honestly think those that have gone through it tend to make pretty good therapist because they're acutely. aware of what it feels like to be on the other side. yeah speaking of school, though, like, how is that going because you were there were some really interesting personalities, you were having to manage with your school and getting back in that routine and the hours and the shenanigans they were trying to. pair."
11237.0,Patient,"How is that going so. I don't remember. Exactly if, like I had spoken to you about this specific instance, the most recent incident being that, like the professor, who I was definitely 100% like the least thrilled about seeing. She teaches something else now, and she decided to like. Just. To said something along the lines of we're gonna have to talk to you about your schedule, because you're not supposed to be here. And I was like Okay, not only that, but she like did it in front of other people."
510.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness very."
11237.0,Patient,shaming yeah I.
510.0,Provider,Like.
11237.0,Patient,"You could have definitely said it a different way and I don't know what you mean also by that because i'm doing everything that I was instructed to by the head of the department, and if you guys do it differently now. than whatever it was that, like you know you guys were doing it before okay like it could have very easily been a completely different conversation. And I think that your approach is really bad and she was like well I don't. I don't remember the verbatim thing what she said, but she just made me feel like an idiot."
510.0,Provider,"yeah. a bunch of strangers she's she's saying. She at least was attempting to shame you and, hopefully, you did not let that stick to you, but that's what she doing. Making achy achy that's the clinical term. awful."
11237.0,Patient,"awful so that happened, I think, like almost two weeks ago, so I was just like Okay, you know what like i'm done talking to you, I will not be talking like communicating with you about anything. yeah anymore like not the head of the department, you are. Not. Anything other than this specific classes, Professor. Right okay so. That day I had gone to. Ikea with my friend i'm also like at her house right now she's completely room so. I had gotten a phone call from a professor who's really been really helpful. And she was telling me like okay like don't talk to her anymore, and I was like. don't plan on talking to her anymore cuz you know i'm going to go off on her and she was like no I know but let's focus on like right now. And don't like you know think too much about like. The potential of like you, having to go off on her. Like let's pretend that she just doesn't exist anymore and we're just going to ignore her and she was basically like okay like. I am in charge of the class that she's teaching so don't drop the class. But don't show up."
510.0,Provider,"seems like a lot of effort to accommodate. When he sounds like it's being really inappropriate to a student but okay i'm with you, so now you're basically. you're in the. show up yeah."
11237.0,Patient,"yeah like it's fine it's fine i'm just thankful that like you know, there are still some people who like understand. Like what."
510.0,Provider,"Yes, needs to be done. mm hmm."
11237.0,Patient,And like I don't care I just don't care.
510.0,Provider,Okay.
11237.0,Patient,"um so right now. You know even even my 8am class that is supposed to be Monday through Friday is asynchronous now, so I don't even have to show up like. Either on zoom or on campus until 7pm. Okay, so I still have like a lot of daylight freedom. Like. Better for me now because, last week I did like I don't know, three weeks worth of homework and like two weeks worth of exams, on my own time in one day."
510.0,Provider,"not good for you, Miss motivated all right."
11237.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean I hate having to like, if I have the ability to do so i'm going to do it all like either. ahead of time or all at once, when it's do like there's no. um."
510.0,Provider,I can't.
11237.0,Patient,"there's no in between myself. Yes, Okay, I cannot pace myself."
510.0,Provider,"yeah but it sounds like you get it done, however, you get to that you get it done all right right."
11237.0,Patient,"it's been a huge relief like being able to do that and, like taking the time to kind of like remember. What pace is good for me. And to realize that, like you know. everything that happened before I had, like so many different factors working against me and this time around, like the only thing that could possibly stop me from like not finishing would be myself and i'm like way too motivated to like not."
510.0,Provider,"yeah now you sounds like you got the. yeah the drive, which is great so, when will you be able to kind of be done done."
11237.0,Patient,"Then okay so. I will have completed my hours by mid October, but. The professor, who was helping me out did, let me know like if you finish the rest of the Semester, then you can get your a and something that I had I don't remember if I talked about this either, but like I talked to a school counselor and she was like yeah I don't know if you knew this. But I do know this, you have the potential of having like for associate's degrees and I was like how the hell did that even happen."
510.0,Provider,Oh wow I bet.
11237.0,Patient,"It was a surprise to me because I was like Okay, well, I have changed my major three times but two out of the four are not majors that I had ever had on my record or pursued. So one of them's language arts, the other one is social sciences and. The other one I psychology and then. This one would be Cosmetology and then she was like yeah I mean the option is there for you, it doesn't really matter if you do, but like. Even if you didn't get your degree from Cosmetology she was still have like three associate's degrees and I was like trying to figure out how in the hell that even happen and how i'm only getting a notification about it now starting Community college like. Nine years ago now. And for the I was out for like a grand total of three years. So I mean i'm sure it adds up somehow. Like we we put everything on paper and like she's not lying it just looks really crazy."
510.0,Provider,"yeah but. That really provides a nice stepping stone, if you do want to pursue a bachelor of science or artists, I mean you, you definitely have your first two years. covered for sure. Nice very well rounded I mean. yeah yeah all right."
11237.0,Patient,"I mean like you know originally I was like holy shit like i'm not going to get anything out of this because, like. You know I always thought like oh yeah you can't fucking stick to anything because you've changed your razor so many fucking times and like you have so many of these outside factors like crushing you. And here I am being told that I don't. Just qualify for one associates degree there's three others. I guess something right."
510.0,Provider,I don't know that is unfair or confusing.
11237.0,Patient,"Well, but it really kind of lets you kind of."
510.0,Provider,Whatever you decide to really pursue I mean you have some great avenues that. You have those first two years. done by you seem to really like the Cosmetology So do you think that because that's also what you've been. Doing and making money on so are you thinking that's really the direction you want to go into.
11237.0,Patient,"So I think overall i've kind of have like a soft plan. With like doing continuing with you know Cosmetology, whether it be like you know me doing hair coloring or like. I actually have to bridle gigs at the end of the month. My for makeup specifically and like you know you don't need to Cosmetology license to do makeup but it's like. makes you more trustworthy and if you have certain prices, then people won't question it because you're cosmetologist. yeah."
510.0,Provider,"So so true it's true, though absolutely you have some credibility, I. feel you on that, yes. So."
11237.0,Patient,"I want to do that before like my hands give out because now i'm starting to get nervous that like. You know I won't always have the ability to use my hands, just because i'm already like losing not sensation i'm not losing sensation like mobility, I do have to be like, on top of like you know my hands stretches and like. All that stuff. And i've come to realize that, like you know if my hands do eventually give out, this is not something that I can do forever, but I want to make the most of it."
510.0,Provider,You know.
11237.0,Patient,If it's even just 10 more years of me doing this. Man I make the most of it that i'll be happy.
510.0,Provider,"yeah what. yeah right, I mean because some people could really look at that differently, like they could really go into that depression like see I can't do this it's net why even bother. My I love that you What a beautiful reframe like i'm going to make the most of it i'm going to take advantage of my time now. And that is what life is about using your time now it's not a means to an end of eventually i'll get there no use it now. I love it yeah."
11237.0,Patient,"approach, and you know as much as I would have loved to have the mental capacity to stick to one thing like first of all my life circumstances were never like stable enough for me to even consider. Having that yeah I. can't even picture it one to like you know the reflection that i've had over the last two three years just coming to terms with my slowly thankfully declining physical health with my hands, like the rest of my body is fine just my hands. I don't want to feel as though I need to. Take something and and that's my job until I die."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11237.0,Patient,yeah that's it.
510.0,Provider,yeah.
11237.0,Patient,I think in the back of my mind that's how i've always been.
510.0,Provider,"there's no rule book I know a lot of people are like Oh, you know pick your major and you know you're going to do this forever honestly I that's not really the reality, most people aren't to change their jobs and professions, many times. Over in or reinvent and kind of do and kind of a skill set start to move themselves in different directions so."
11237.0,Patient,"And I need to keep it fresh keep it different absolutely. So it's been really nice like. realizing all of these things, and like being able to recognize that i'm not just doing any of this crap for nothing."
510.0,Provider,you're not.
11237.0,Patient,know what i'm doing it to entertain myself and that's it like Jason would open me. yeah.
510.0,Provider,"yeah no good oh i'm glad i'm glad you also kind of have a plan for that other Professor I use that word very lightly, so that sound like a professor, they should be more professional with students. Good all right, well, are you still taking your medication Howard sleep appetite how are those things going okay."
11237.0,Patient,"Well, I forgot to take them this morning. And i've been doing this annoying stupid weird thing where like. i'll snooze the alarm for because i'm sleeping. And then i'll turn it off. beforehand, and then I let the bird scream at me. Because i'm so tired and I think it's just. I think it's honestly, just like having to like you know be present in class."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11237.0,Patient,"that's kind of like making me feel that way, and like I have currently no resentment. More like negative feelings about it it's just. i'm tired that's all. like this is. The most amount of stuff with the most consistent amount of stuff that i've had to do in like. A year and a half."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11237.0,Patient,and I you're managing a little bit better okay about like it. Because this is the. third time in two weeks that I have accidentally not taking it at the right time.
510.0,Provider,Okay.
11237.0,Patient,"feel okay I just know that i'm getting more distracted. Okay, and like I feel as though, like I can't fully focus the way that I can like with the medication. But I don't feel like. Withdrawal symptoms, if that makes sense well that's that's what it is, or yeah yeah I don't feel withdrawal symptoms I just know that i'm a little bit more confused."
510.0,Provider,Some.
11237.0,Patient,Dr Harry.
510.0,Provider,"neuro chemistry wise are very sensitive when they miss dosages are aren't consistent, so you, you might be one of those and some people can miss a day or two and nothing. everything's Okay, which is. Great but not everybody has that experience so okay."
11237.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Okay yeah I don't feel crazy or Moody or like anything else, but like it's just that, like I. fell out of my head. What you know that's. that's exactly what it is. Do you feel like you're managing because you're right, you have a lot more sort of in your schedule now and it's sort of a."
510.0,Provider,"juggling and. I am curious like, if you think of a stop light green means go, things are moving well you're moving through the intersection kind of on point yellow would be. i'm starting to have some you know I need to slow it down starting to have maybe some warning signs, I might need to kind of tighten up and read would be I am off the rails, like, I am not doing what I need to be doing etc So what do you, what do you think you are on the stoplight."
11237.0,Patient,"um let's see I would say, like with my daily schedule and the tasks that I need to complete, as well as my mood definitely like. Not suffering at all, so I would say, green like. i'm turning in my assignments on time. Participating i'm like actively making sure that, like. I eat on time. Okay it's still really hard to eat it's still super super difficult. But i'm overall like still trying to like figure out ways to make sure that I at least get my nutrition, because even. Even if I am not you know sitting down and eating as much as I want to, or like anything like that, first of all, it doesn't feel like disordered eating i'm not like. Being insane and holding food off of myself. You know. i've been kind of know what that feels like and that's definitely not it."
510.0,Provider,Good good.
11237.0,Patient,"um and I haven't been like that, since sometime last decade, so i'm good right now on that it's just I need to remember that I still need nutrients so."
510.0,Provider,Even i'm not.
11237.0,Patient,"Eating it, which is so fucking hard I kept eating is so fucking hard. But like. You know, making smoothies doing like i'm getting. Green juice, making sure that i'm having like vegetable stuff."
510.0,Provider,you'd be a great. candidate for that right yeah and just sort of have it ready to go in the fridge and throw it in and zim zim exactly.
11237.0,Patient,yeah you know you're getting some of those nutrients okay.
510.0,Provider,"Yes, so. yeah and I looked at, I always look at your survey scores, thank you for staying on top of it, and I think these are the best scores i've ever seen for the anxiety depression, they are in the minimal range like. almost nil so that's good. yeah compared to when you first started. What are your reflections on that that's fantastic."
11237.0,Patient,"Thank you, by the way, I appreciate that deeply so let's see I started seeing everybody what like may early May. So I had just moved. That was chaotic and I feel as though, like even before then, I was having a very difficult time, like. Even though I was always like you know regularly trying to figure out like you know self regulation, I was having still difficulty with self regulation, in addition to like. I don't know feeling as though. How do I explain it feeling as though, like. Even if I just get through, one day, then i'm going to be okay. Like I always had a hard time like remembering that. I think, right now, since I don't have to constantly work hard for my domain, because it just comes to me. Most of the time then like you know it's easier for one I think also that the medication is helping with seasonal affective disorder which, like lately it just. it's either really, really hot or really, really gloomy and kind of cold, so I mean yeah there's there's that I think it used to have a huge dampener on my mood I can. recognize. tasks in front of me and actually just like do them I don't have to convince myself to do things, most of the time anymore. So I don't put anything off. yeah and overall I just feel regular."
510.0,Provider,"you're a human right, well, no one gets a free pass there's still going to be suffering that you know that occurs, but I think you're. feeling more comfortable in your own skin and sort of your day to day and your your surveys reflective, which is always great to see that progress, even in the short time like sometimes it really takes some time to start before we start seeing the trending downwards so it's always. Really, I think that speaks to what you're doing. In therapy away from therapy think medications doing its part that, as you know, meds aren't the end all be all that's one. Right, we all."
11237.0,Patient,All the other pieces that you're doing for yourself. so good.
510.0,Provider,So good to see I.
11237.0,Patient,"Think, the biggest piece of it all was like finding the motivation to like make sure that i'm consistent with everything. yeah so. You know the executive dysfunction could easily just kill that like oh yeah Maybe I should meditate right now now you don't want to. You just want to lie down and do nothing, or like you know. Even though i've always been a pretty tiny person like an almost anxiously tidy person I would certainly like yeah like the only reason why i'm cleaning is because i'm feeling crazy."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11237.0,Patient,And i'm not doing that anymore like right right yeah I just feel regular and i'm okay with that I feel good good.
510.0,Provider,"like this that's what we want feeling Oh, my goodness yay yay all right, well, we I want it before we wrap up so we. Are for a full 60 minute session next Wednesday, did you want, I can try to figure out. It would probably be a 30 minute session, the last week, or do you just want our last session to be next week, you will still have group I will see you in, I think, is that when you will be back in group the 28."
11237.0,Patient,let's see.

11237.0,Patient,So first okay.
510.0,Provider,"yeah so i'll definitely see you in the final group, which I have another appointment, but I want to tell you what we're doing in the group. Because you're not going to be there, next week, but do you want our last session or individual session to be on the 22nd. Or do you want me to try to find another like 30 minutes to do one final that last week in September."
11237.0,Patient,"yeah that'd be nice, I mean if there's space for and i'd love to squish in there."
510.0,Provider,"yeah I can squish you also seeing Okay, so I can do with 330 Pacific on Thursday the 30th work."
11237.0,Patient,For us 30 Pacific on the 30th. I think it would work.
510.0,Provider,"That would work okay yeah that's I think my only slot the only all I could do a 1030 in the morning, that same day, but I don't know if that works better with your schedule."
11237.0,Patient,probably be better. The 1033 30.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, the three three Okay, then. i'll i'll get you in for the Thursday September 30 330. So really quickly since you're not going to be in group next week and, hopefully, my Internet holds up um I am for my last day with group on Tuesday with all my groups, I wanted to share this lot yesterday but i'm, I would like to do what's called a show and tell. and basically. i'll be bringing things that I want group members to bring whether it's a video if you can bring your bird I want you to kind of show until like. something about us something that you care about something that's important to you. You don't have to participate, I will always have some backup things, but I just you know I wanted the last group sorted, to be a little bit just more fun and certainly there'll be process that you're welcome if there's a video or something that I need to share my screen. You are welcome to email me at my bright heart account. And I do you have that it's just T Golan at bright heart health COM. T for Tara my last name go want."
