13894.0,Patient,Hello. How are you.
416.0,Provider,i'm doing well.
13894.0,Patient,"just going to make my screen bigger ones. yeah I was so worried, I was gonna miss this appointment I i've been up since four o'clock. Well, I had homework to do too so i've been studying. That yeah hi."
416.0,Provider,You made it.
13894.0,Patient,yeah i'm gonna just take a SIP of my coffee real quick.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, please do go. yeah critical. haven't made mine yet, but i'm very much looking forward to."
13894.0,Patient,"um. let's see so. I guess well, I have a little post it note I took some notes made some notes."
416.0,Provider,I know you always can prepare. You knew you'd be on it.
13894.0,Patient,One of these days i'm going to show up totally unprepared.
416.0,Provider,Okay. With that too.
13894.0,Patient,"Well, I guess, I wanted to talk to you because I. I started going to the adult children of alcoholics meetings."
416.0,Provider,And you told me a little bit about that last time it sounds like you're going really regularly now huh.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah I found i've been going three times a week. and listening to everyone's stories it's been so helpful because. I just really recognize like the patterns and. I ordered a book. Oh, my cats working in front of me."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
13894.0,Patient,"She just she's really, really sweet but she's just like. wants to be right in front of me. The laundry the laundry list workbook."
416.0,Provider,Oh it's not when I go okay.
13894.0,Patient,"I haven't started it yet, but i've been so busy with school but. I guess it like breaks down all the different traits. So i'm going to i'm going to start that but um. So I was really i'm still going to go, but I. I just noticed that there was some. Like a power dynamics within the group and I guess. That typically happens in a group situation but. The woman running it and this let's see i've been going I think for like two or three weeks at this point and. She was she kind of like lashed out at everybody and said, you know i'm the only one doing anything which sounds like such an adult child thing to say. Nobody is helping nobody's taking responsibility. Just like."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, the irony yeah."
13894.0,Patient,"Which another person pointed out to her. Later on, but um. I almost was like oh good Do I really want to be here, but. I came back, and I was glad because she kind of apologized for acting out at the next meeting. And then the last meeting I went to this guy came in from. I guess he's in. Which call it alcoholics anonymous. And he was just dropping by I guess he's also an adult child but. He was like. Talking and then he said. I don't want to kill anybody and i'm not a killer. was just let it go."
416.0,Provider,Where did that come from.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like Okay, you said it like three times. So."
416.0,Provider,used to.
13894.0,Patient,doing something I don't I have no idea you was just kind of rambling but i've had my. My actual photo it's a zoom meeting and I just changed it to like a. An Avatar.
416.0,Provider,good idea.
13894.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. So, because I was like Maybe I should stop. But then I think that that was just sort of a random thing and."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13894.0,Patient,I think if I just have my my first name and Avatar also a lot safer being. I guess it's like you're being so vulnerable in those meetings. And having it be on the Internet with random strangers feels a little.
416.0,Provider,"it's yeah it's interesting because they can kind of go both ways right like there's some there's some anonymity about being on the Internet with random strangers. But when something like that happens, and you get someone who's just like ooh making you know, making a hair in the back of your neck stand up."
13894.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I mean it's sort of raises that awareness that you need to employ some basics.
13894.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,I mean that's the thing about these movies it's like anyone can come to them.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah and in real life too so yeah. Absolutely um. But I figured you know, and then I was thinking, maybe i'm just looking for an excuse not to go, you know to so I don't want to do that. And i've kind of committed i'm going to do it for one year and see how I feel at the end of the year. Because."
416.0,Provider,I mean it sounds like you're also getting a lot of benefit from it.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah and I haven't shared anything yet myself. And I guess that's Another thing I just wanted to mention to you, I feel like. there's so much that I want to say I don't even know where to start really so I need to find. Maybe just a place to start. In order to share."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13894.0,Patient,"And it was kind of trying to get my sea legs, a little bit too, because they have like a script that they follow, and you know certain rules and like i'll kind of wanted to. see what that was all about. But I think i'll share."
416.0,Provider,Talk about vulnerability right.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean the thing, though, too, is that the people that have shared who have been really vulnerable. has helped me realize, you know i'm not alone and. That it wasn't me, it was my dad who had the problem and. it's been like. A big relief to realize that you know. A lot of people have been talking about. The silence in their homes that. You know, some people come from really angry parents, but some from really cold silent parents and it's just a. lot of what they've said is really just made me realize. i've been holding on to the stuff for so long and. It wasn't my creation, it was something that. I grew up with, and I just felt like it was normal when it really wasn't normal it was unhealthy."
416.0,Provider,"yeah it was normal for you. yeah it did shape you right in ways some ways that probably make you the amazing person, you are today in another. way that might not feel so good right."
13894.0,Patient,"yeah that's true, I think that. I mean i'm glad know for my. sensitivity and awareness, I think that they helped shape that so."
416.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I mean that's the thing about. The thing about moving past trauma. That I find is to I think there's a couple of elements that that are necessary right and moving past trauma is to find meaning in it. Great to not not necessarily like. Oh, this was because of this, but when I say, meaning, I mean like. finding ways to see the impact that it's had on you, coming from like kind of a position of strength right like I have survived. This has helped shape me in ways that I am now really strong like I wouldn't wish it on anybody, but I have now and then. And then also finding ways to take your power back. Right so and that's another one that's a really, really big piece of this. I mean, with people who experience like this, or it gets stuck my."
13894.0,Patient,Oh that's okay.
416.0,Provider,"with people who experienced like the direct trauma like people who have been abused and neglected or like violated in some way often recommend. And like self Defense classes, rightly so much of it is about finding your power again finding finding that confidence to be Stephen your own two feet and like sort of taking back that power i'm."
13894.0,Patient,"Julie, I just want to grab my notebook so I want to drop that down. yeah i'm. In mice stack of books that I have to read. So let's see I want to write down finding the meaning."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean I that's a bit and. I don't know I I said it and then i'm like Oh, is that what I really mean it's not exactly that but it's sort of like to come out on the other side of trauma I feel like one of the most important things is to be able to recognize. Your personal strength in the recovery right and how everything that's really tough that's happened to you. How that's changed, you also. Right like how that's helped you. Being amazing person that you are. Not being very articulate."
13894.0,Patient,This no no i'm totally listening. I just have lost my writing utensil. Okay.
416.0,Provider,"I still feel like i'm not being very articulate so sorry about that, but I."
13894.0,Patient,"know I thought you were. I thought you were being very profound. So. i'm just gonna write that. Taking back power. And it's interesting, I think. When I do take my power back, I feel, or I have felt. So uncomfortable and so like. guilty about it, you know and."
416.0,Provider,i'm trying to get people child of an alcoholic right there for sure.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah i'm really trying to get past that and. Also. Just. realizing like. interpersonal dynamics. Especially right now with my mom's ex husband. he's been a lot sweeter to me but. He just moved into. An Assisted Living place and it's a really nice one because he's. Financially very secure and he moved into like a really nice place. But just family dynamics are so strict his he has a daughter from his. First, marriage before my mom named Linda. really gets really confusing. But um. she's older than I am she's. About 10 years older than me. And she always takes this very authoritative role and. He is very controlling and. He has good qualities to but he's. Very controlling and. She is also very controlling and so. He moved into this place on February, the eighth and she told me don't call him, yet you know he needs to get settled in. Just let them get settled for a little bit before you call him."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
13894.0,Patient,"And I was like Okay, and then. my sister talked to him and he complained to my sister that I haven't pulled him yet. And it's like."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13894.0,Patient,"um but then I ended up feeling guilty, because I didn't call them yet, and I was trying to do the right thing by listening to his daughter and. I guess what i'm trying to say is. I finally just stepped back and said, you know what. i'll call him in a couple of days when I feel like it and. i'm not gonna worry about. Just I mean other people have their own reasons for doing things that I I can't figure out, and I think it comes back to what you were talking about the circle of control like. You can't control other people, or how they see me or i'm just trying to worry less about that and just live my own life and and be as good a person as I can be."
416.0,Provider,"I mean I. it's it's a much easier thing to say then to do, but I totally think that you're on the right track."
13894.0,Patient,"And to I have family members who are really religious really Christian. And i've always felt like you know they were judging me because I don't believe that way and. Lately, to have just been really trying to just let go of like other people's. Judgments or I dia's of who I am because it's just so exhausting and I. I won't I can't change that anyway."
416.0,Provider,"Also, true okay."
13894.0,Patient,Just things that are running around in my head.
416.0,Provider,"I mean it's really nice. it's a very liberating things if you can do that right. Yes, there used to be this thing that was floating around all the time it was like. Let me see if I can find it. This is it, this one, have you do you remember this when it was spinning around it was when I am when I am old when I am an old woman, I shall wear purple."
13894.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's really I love that.
416.0,Provider,"it's like. it's the it's the epitome of a story about like. i'm going to do with my wife, as I get older and I just like feel most comfortable in my own skin right which I just think is so lovely."
13894.0,Patient,"I want to wait, does it show the author of that. i'm gonna look it up. I would like to revisit it."
416.0,Provider,"yeah i'm just I just googled that. When i'm old woman, I shall wear purple with a red hat which doesn't go and doesn't suit me and I will spend my pension on brandi in summer gloves and satin sandals. and say we've no money for butter actual sit down on the pavement when i'm tired and gobble up samples and shops and press alarm bells and run my stick along the public railings and make up for the sobriety of my you. I shall go out in my slippers and the rain and pick flowers and other people's gardens and learn to spit. You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat need three pounds of sausages that ago or only bread and pickle for a week and hoard pens and pencils and beer mats and things in this. But now we must have closed that keep us dry and pay our rent and not swearing the street and set a good example for the children, we must have friends to dinner and read the papers but maybe I ought to practice a little now. So people who know me or not too shocked and surprised when suddenly I am old and start to wear purple."
13894.0,Patient,Oh that's great I love that thanks for bringing that up that's beautiful.
416.0,Provider,"I haven't read that in a long time, oh it's really cool."
13894.0,Patient,It made me tear up even well.
416.0,Provider,"yeah it's really about that right like, let me start practicing that now. It doesn't rain, I can start. doing a little bit so people you know so people aren't shocked when i'm old and i'm gonna wear purple."
13894.0,Patient,"Right. yeah and you know my housemate asked me also, and I think that it was a very innocent question but it got me thinking. My master's degree is is finishing in May. And she said so, what are you going to do that. and My immediate response inside my head was. A float in the pool and smoke a joint. Like I feel like. We can the graduate you know when he's. Like Oh well, no. But my answer is really well, it sounds impractical, but it's what I really want to do and. I want to. write a novel and record an album of songs and make jewelry. And just spend my time creatively and for the first time in my life. that's a possibility, because I have. My disability income, and I can do it. and I guess, I was feeling guilty about that too, like oh my God like you know, maybe I should try to find some. part time shitty job, so I won't feel guilty. No, why would I want to waste my time with that."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm. And this is where it comes back into sort of taking back your own power right.
13894.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,This is this is that part.
13894.0,Patient,yep.
416.0,Provider,"Right and you're becoming a lot more aware of it, even if you're you know you're not fully there yet, but even being aware of it, is it is like. Because you know you we have these conditioned responses which you certainly do right you're conditioned response from childhood is, I feel guilty if I take up any space I you know. David, I want to do our faith even have wants or needs of my own, and then to, then you know just to even start being aware of that conditioned response and then start to move toward. A wheat, I have every right to take up space, I read land the pool and smoke a joint and float around right like oh fine I can do that if I want to."
13894.0,Patient,"write and that reminds me Julia wanted to tell you also that I was thinking. When I was like. I was in a relationship with a guy and. I remember telling him. That I felt guilty all the time and I felt like. Like I was full of shame and guilt constantly. mm hmm and he didn't understand like it freaked him out, he was like what are you talking about. And I was trying to. explain to him, because we were in a relationship how I was feeling. um. And ironically we're still friends to this day. But we ended up breaking up and he didn't understand like. Why are you carrying so much guilt and shame around and at that time I didn't have an answer for it. Yet, but I was just remembering that and that. I really if I ever do end up in a relationship, again I don't want to feel that way and I. that's why. I cat. that's why I think it's so important for me to like. be here with you and also to. Not quit the a CA meetings. yeah because I think that. Probably a lot of people in therapy quit just when they're starting to realize what's going on. Yes or freaked out."
416.0,Provider,yeah happens all the time. People take them. You know it's normal to take take a couple swipes at it yeah.
13894.0,Patient,"And I just want you to know like i've had. How many therapists before like two or three before you and. It just never really felt like. They got to the heart of the matter, and I really appreciate like I just feel. I really lucked out in getting you because. I just want you to know because I feel like you really have guided me in a great way and that you. really understand and. I think that that's hard for people to find and I just randomly stumbled upon you, through my insurance company so i'm so grateful."
416.0,Provider,"i'm grateful to I mean yeah I you're a very easy patient to work with, as far as i'm concerned and that's it, you know I always love working with patients who are like. we're raring to go it's so gratifying for me, too, because you know I can be thought of this and you're like oh i'm ready down, you know, like the best thing ever."
13894.0,Patient,"Oh. Good good, and I wanted to show you two I just saw this book. or heard about it on npr and i'm going to get it, it sounds really great. But I thought, just to tell you about it in case you have older patients. it's about finding purpose This man was talking about. As you get older in life, you get crystallized wisdom and it happens around age 55. For some people and they get like much more focused and I feel like i'm one of those people, because in my youth I was very scattered. Now i'm really, really focused and I want to make like get things done. In my life my. personal life, and so this book sounds great it's called from strength to strength. And it says. Finding success happiness and deep purpose. let's see. yeah from strength to strength happiness and the purpose in the second half of life, but it just sounds really, really good."
416.0,Provider,"Oh yeah that does sound good, and I do have. Quite a few patients who are I don't know second half of life, I suppose. yeah I mean, I think the currently the oldest patient I work with is 82. Oh wow so yeah I definitely have some older folks on my. On my caseload that are blessed to work with."
13894.0,Patient,"Oh that's good. And I know a lot of people are transitioning right now with jobs and stuff and. Like pandemic related um. let's see, let me look at my notes real quick."
416.0,Provider,"Well you're looking at that I want to see make sure that we have our next appointment scheduled and also, are you coming to group this week."
13894.0,Patient,"i'm next week I, I can only come to four. sessions per month my insurance only covers. For per month, so I have group next week, but I did set up our next appointment."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're set on that so i'm going to give you one more thing then and. I want you, since we're going to do this group, this week. Have you ever seen as we're talking so much about this today, I know you're familiar with Bernie Brown. yeah have you seen the power of vulnerability for talk."
13894.0,Patient,"I think so, but it's been a really it's been a while."
416.0,Provider,"feel like it's really applicable right now for you, I just have it in the chat so you can open it up it's about 20 minutes and then there's also the follow up to that one is her Ted talk on listening to shame and I recommend both of those for you."
13894.0,Patient,"i'm writing them down Julie, because the chat is so tiny for me."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah it's just you could just Google burn a brown power of vulnerability."
13894.0,Patient,And the other one was called.
416.0,Provider,Listening to shame.
13894.0,Patient,"Okay, great yeah she's really great. And those are both Ted talks."
416.0,Provider,"About Ted talks I mean she's written books about those things too, but I think the Ted talks are really good."
13894.0,Patient,"Okay, good."
416.0,Provider,You. triple check that I have you on my calendar. Oh yeah we're set through march yay.
13894.0,Patient,"yeah I figured out a way if I call it the the beginning of each month, I can get I scored a 9am time spot i'm so excited. Because some it's weird I mean sometimes I can get up early, but most of the time it's like. You know I get up around eight o'clock and that's that's plenty early."
416.0,Provider,And I would do.
13894.0,Patient,That yeah Another thing I was thinking too is that. um my mom ended up with her first husband. Was physically abusive and cheated on her and then my dad was an alcoholic and then this last husband who she said she really was crazy about was really controlling. So. You know she had her patterns to.
416.0,Provider,Give me.
13894.0,Patient,"bless you. I was just reading last night. A vindication for the rights of women by Mary wollstonecraft for school. And she said something about like. Women being valued for their beauty only. and I feel, in a way that my mom. She was really, really beautiful and. I think that, because she grew up very poor. She wanted to be taken care of and. She ended up. Like not I mean not being taken care of because. i'm still trying to work this out, but. Like because she wanted to be taken care of so badly she ended up with men who. kinda did, but then kind of didn't also oh."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah and. It sounds like maybe you know that need to be financially taken care of sort of overrode the connection that you might have in this sort of authenticity of a relationship.
13894.0,Patient,yeah but I guess to it was different times I mean she was born in 1925 so.
416.0,Provider,Very different times.
13894.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, she was born in the wake of the First World War right or."
13894.0,Patient,yeah the First World War was 1914 is that right.
416.0,Provider,yeah to. Choose right in between.
13894.0,Patient,And she lived through the depression.
416.0,Provider,First World War was 14 to 18. yeah she was born kind of in the wake of all of that and yeah definitely depression and then World War Two started. Okay.
13894.0,Patient,my sister told me recently to that. They were so poor that my mom had to line her shoes with cardboard because. They would get holes in the bottom of them and and they couldn't afford new shoes so. She had to put cardboard inside her shoes so.
416.0,Provider,it's a world that we probably can't really imagine. And I think when you're in that position. it's pretty impossible for us to even imagine walking in her shoes because it's great.
13894.0,Patient,"And I don't know if I mentioned this to you before either, but. My. My mom told me that um. She never like her parents never. hugged her or told her that they loved her. They they had like. six children and they were really poor. And I think they were always struggling to like you know just. survive, but um. I guess i'm bringing it up, because they feel like. In a way, i've been carrying. My parents grief around. Now, also."
416.0,Provider,Such a thing as generational trauma.
13894.0,Patient,Is that really like is that real.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my God it's real yes."
13894.0,Patient,How does that work exactly.
416.0,Provider,"um well people have different arguments about it, and I mean Some people even say that trauma sort of changes your DNA I don't know I don't know if how I haven't seen that but."
13894.0,Patient,"You guys heard that but it sounded a little like. Like I don't know. whoo whoo. But I mean, I can see where. I mean i'm open minded about it."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I think it makes more sense to say that trauma changes our brains right. And then, when we have a brain that has been shaped by trauma it's going to change the way we parent, of course it is. Right so to me that's sort of how it happens that. i'm going to there's a woman who is so she's kind of the authority on this and i'm going to remember. What her name is."
13894.0,Patient,And I guess to Julia feel like. Because of that. I feel so sorry for both of my. Parents but then I also feel like angry with both of them.
416.0,Provider,"Okay right right. yeah well, I mean Okay, so what is her name. She actually has done a lot of work on intergenerational trauma that she did this whole thing on it was a post i'm trying to remember, she called it post slavery syndrome. home and."
13894.0,Patient,That sounds really good.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, no i'm kidding i'm actually finishing up to people Okay, so now, the person i'm thinking. Of is. For the intergenerational trauma it wrote a book. And it's pamela Alexander."
13894.0,Patient,pamela Alexander.
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm and then the other person who's really the kind of well known expert on trauma. And, including intergenerational trauma is. His name is Russell Vander call this guy and he wrote this book I don't know if you've seen this one."
13894.0,Patient,um.
416.0,Provider,What is the title i'm sorry yeah the body keeps the score.
13894.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah I have that on audio book.
416.0,Provider,huh.
13894.0,Patient,"Oh okay great I haven't listened, yet, but I have it's."
416.0,Provider,"yeah he's he's kind of a recognized expert on all of this, but I would also, and if you're interested in research, I would look into. pamela Alexander she wrote a book on intergenerational cycles of trauma and violence. And my. Like not through the medical side of things like vessel Vander coke is actually a doctor, but. She sees things through more of like an attachment and sort of a family systems perspective."
13894.0,Patient,Oh that's great i'll look that up for sure. And my friend recommended to me I just got this. it's the body keeps the score workbook.
416.0,Provider,"which I haven't had time to start. Up it's go through that too, I have that same workbook and we can absolutely I have other patients that I do this with that I go through the workbook with."
13894.0,Patient,"Oh, that would be great that sounds really good. Okay cool i'm gonna look her up. See. well. I know, like every time we meet I just give you a bunch of work to do. love it, though, and. Especially after May, when my program ends i'll have more time to actually do the work. But I like having assignments, I discovered, if I have assignments like I get them done."
416.0,Provider,awesome well good like I said I love that as a therapist it's like music to my ears.
13894.0,Patient,Good.
416.0,Provider,So um we're all set for our next appointments and nightmares about that so i'm gonna let you go.
13894.0,Patient,"Okay Julie thing. Again, and i'll see you next week in the group. awesome bye."
