13582.0,Patient,Hello.
740.0,Provider,How are you.
13582.0,Patient,shit. i'm not doing good right now.
740.0,Provider,Okay what's going on.
13582.0,Patient,"So I have moved out of my house. I am super far away from my family, I have a lot of anxiety, I am. i'm moving like quarters so i'm doing quarter system now, instead of semester system, as I was before i'm nervous about that i'm nervous about being away from family um. I just knew environment and just the thought of classes was just making me anxious and yeah."
740.0,Provider,"well. college period being away for a family can definitely be. A scary place, especially when you're so used to being around people they love you the most. But the thing about it is they're not too far away. And so anytime you need him i'm sure they're just a phone call away or. A facetime away and hopefully you're able to build it and then."
13582.0,Patient,"yeah. it's still scary like I have friends here I am classes haven't started yet. They start on Thursday. But I guess i'm just overthinking them and just made me at once. And I. yeah i'm overthinking and the anxiety that's making me. freak out for no reason, because I know I can handle it I. Know good student and I know I can handle it I got into these university for a reason."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13582.0,Patient,"But I mean obviously new environment and everything still just freaking me out and. I spent my first night here last night. It was great I mean my my cousins were facetime and me and my friends were talking to me I fell asleep like I knocked out right away, but after I woke up, it was. That was when I was feeling anxious about about being here and I don't really know where the anxiety was coming from I wasn't really thinking of anything, all I was thinking of I need to go grab breakfast."
740.0,Provider,yeah. So what is something that you're doing in order to help manage your. anxiety will kind of take what kind of custom fields are working for you.
13582.0,Patient,"walking mainly walking and reading skills of breathing exercises but i've noticed that breathing exercises don't work as much as blocking because I guess like it just lets me get out of the environment. that's causing it. So, and I mean the campus is huge so i'm like by the time what I got lucky was that by the time I started blocking to the CAFE the dining area my anxiety just decrease. Okay, but then the minute I got here, I was getting ready for the day that's when it started again. And then I got work. To do some of my school stuff that's coming up, but my mom's leaving today. So she stayed in the city for one night, so I could have the peace of mind of like she's in the city i'm comfortable if something happens, I can just literally texture and, as you can pick me up she's 20 minutes away um. But you know the walking really helps and I, like the fact that the weather over here helps me out a lot. The cold, I guess, like. I don't like whenever I get a panic attack or anxiety attack, I feel like I feel really hot, so what as soon as I left out, he left my room and it was the cold air hit me that's when I was like Oh, it was like someone just do a bucket of water on me like it jolted me back to reality. So that that helped out a lot yeah."
740.0,Provider,And where are you currently located. In.
13582.0,Patient,San Diego uc San Diego.
740.0,Provider,And how far they are from home.
13582.0,Patient,"one hour from flight. On eight hours driving. But i'm i'm i'm flying back home in. From today, it should be nine days next Friday."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
13582.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm going to be there till Friday Saturday Sunday. Not i'm sorry Thursday, Friday Saturday Sunday Monday, five days. Okay yeah."
740.0,Provider,"So what should be used worry what should be this concern, what is it that's really triggering the anxiety."
13582.0,Patient,"um the classes, the being away from my mom you know, like it's it's I mean everyone i've talked to they said the adjustment period in the in the beginning it's going to be hard it's like the first week will be extremely hard. But then. By the time like my on my whole family knows i'm coming back in like nine days they literally said, by the time you come back you're gonna love it so much because this has been like my dream school, since I was 14 years old. And they said that you're not you're going to wish that you could leave the our home and come back here just to hang out with your friends, because, like. These are technically the best years of your life you learn more about yourself, you grow as a person, and you know you experienced so many things um. So I i'd like that's like my hope, by the time I get there, and I know i'm going to feel better. In a week asia's the moment right now I don't like the bumpy ride that i'm going through right now."
740.0,Provider,Are you a freshman age is your first.
13582.0,Patient,You transfer i'm a transfer. Student yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Well, I will say this um what's your family's told you, is right. For more one former college student loan, many years ago. To you, everything has a. Everything has a. A period to wear a transition period right, and so, if you were at your previous school more acclimated to being at home or more closer to your family and then now you're going now you're coming to a school of your dreams of course right. Through the sopranos and go to you work i'm sure you worked really, really hard to get to the school because if you're a transfer student, that means you know you have to do it, you need to do. grade wise and whatever else was in order to be eligible to get to the school and Avatar finally in this moment so were you able to be at a school that you dreamed about since you're a teenager. Is a huge thing it is a hard transition at first, because again you're in new territory i'm so far away from home I don't want to have any family here like that. um you know, but at the same time it's just like your family fit I mean they they gave the best advice. Eventually, after a while you get so acclimated to school and being on your own. Not having you know why they tell you what to do, what's happening go to bed what time you need to wake up now having a wife, no dishes and clean your bedroom. You know you don't have to make your bed, if you don't want to you know you want to be a yuppie json data and to know what makes you change of clothes. You know, things like he would you want to eat if you don't want to eat no vegetables you don't have to, if you want to eat chips play every day they're fine with you. So it is you know you have those kind of liberty, you know i'm saying they like they fed once you go back home, and you got to tell you why you wake up in the same time, you can rely on where to go but."
13582.0,Patient,"yeah I also my my also issue right now is that so when I was 10 years i'm 20 right now, when I was 10 years old, my father walked out of my life. And when I. That was also when I had just moved to this country. Like as soon as I moved I moved to this country in January, and he walked out of my life in June mm hmm like literally packed his bags left the country and I never saw him again. And I guess, like me, being I mean. This is what i'm I am a psych major so like this is what was so my This is like deep down inside i'm kind of like. subconsciously my mind's telling me like now you're it's been 10 years since you've you've seen your father, my father tried to come back in my life he's trying to we can build relationships, since May i'm making him work for it because I have trust issues, I have been been. Issues um I. I struggle, you know yeah so and now now 10 years later i'm leaving my mom and I think a part of me has this fear of like. On my mom's leaving me too and, but I have an older brother who's five years older than me and he got to spend more time with my dad and he stayed close to home, he lived an hour away from our family home it and he would come home every weekend. So I guess that's also a little part of me is bugging me because, like I won't be able to see him. As much because he's been like he's been a father figure to me he's like taking care of me financially he ever my mental health issues like he's been my biggest like advocate biggest supporter, but a part of me still scared that like i'm losing my mom."
740.0,Provider,"I mean this this this valley this river Valley. A lot of time and he really and truly. Your mom isn't going anywhere but it's the fact that she has to leave. You there basically triggers you to say Oh well, she's leaving me too, but that's not the case and i'm gonna tell you why it's not the case, because is your decision to come to go to the school."
13582.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah i'm saying and the thing about it is, is that your mom support is your decision, but she can approve her life and move to San Diego. But anytime you need her i'm sure your mom is your number one thing and i'm sure your mom is your biggest supporter and maybe this is something you should share with your mom hi mom would you leave, and you know this is a really trigger moment for me for me. Because it just seems as if you know i'm saying you're leaving me to, just like the idea to 10 years ago that's something you should express to her so that she can reassure you. Right sometimes you need to be reassured right if we, I mean you know your mom loves you because. The fact that your mom came all the way to San Diego okay so make sure that you had a peace of mind that you were adapted that you release and getting acclimated to being in college, make sure you have everything you need i'm sure she says you to walmart and gotcha you lose. You know, went to the grocery store and got all used to the snake, which you know, so you know, so that they. that's the difference right that's the difference between your mom and dad dad and give you know notice that he was leaving he just left. way and even through their time you know i'm saying your mom a your brother, of course, you know they cared for you, with such a way so that so that you wouldn't have to constantly feel that boy every day. Right, but now their mom is leaving and then you here in this in this in school this fall fall away, sometimes it can it can be very triggering. It can be very triggering and honestly honestly if if, if I may say this, you know it's okay to share what's your what's your mother's things that you're feeling right because of the fake Steve me they you know Paris down now unless you say something. You know i'm saying and then like I say to basically make sure. That you just kind of openly communicating with mom like this is a very, very triggering mall with my anxieties out the roof. My favorite was telling me the TV, you know, because the thing about earlier she may not know, and maybe a maybe maybe that maybe she could stay another day. You know, maybe you know she can do something to kind of help you know, bring you the peace of mind, or that assurance that she's not walking out like debbie that's not that's not that's not the case at all. The case the case, right now, and a lot of times, you have to bring things into perspective. right because I mean as a psych major you'll understand this at the brain a lot of times tank a pastor fire thing. It, which means it can make a thing, bigger than what he's saying. Right and so, then when you when your brain catastrophizing thing then all of a sudden, everything that you've experienced in times past it was traumatic for you, if you bring that back if they always she doing it to me so when that's not the case. Right, so you have to keep things in perspective is sometimes you have to talk things out desktop is a very, very important cultist view is a very, very important component. You know i'm saying, because you have to really bring it. bring things into perspective when your brain say as well, your mama leave you like your Daddy is that you have a question right his mom are relieved me like my Daddy is like what's the evidence that she's leaving you like your day. what's the proof was the pro. Or the fruit is she's leaving you like baby what's the proof that she's abandoning you. Where is it worth what's the evidence, do you have any. Young you're saying, and so a lot of times that's this that's been able to reframe your thoughts right, you have to really work on reframing it, because what happens is is that sometimes our brain can make up something. Right, he can over exaggerate the situation and things of that nature and so sometimes you got to pull yourself back. into reality, and then they question that motive question their core belief that you have their Mamas leaving and be like hey if she really leaving you know if she really abandon me issue really neglecting me, what is the proof. me i'm saying what is, you know the word that you have the word that you have, are you wearing that he could happen or you wearing data will happen, and if you could have to you have to have some kind of evidence. So let the empty."
13582.0,Patient,"So far none yeah. There is no openness. I guess i'm i'm just trying to. Prepare myself for something that I mean rationally I I know is not going to happen because she's proven it time and time again that she's in it for the dates does like she's not leaving me till the day she does. she's not just said he shown that multiple times just and you're right, the fact that she showed up here. I mean I cried for the I flew here on Friday. And since Friday i've cried and today. So far, since today I have not cried at all yeah. So I mean she's called me like twice she's texted me twice my grandparents have text facetime mean my my cousins and I have been like talking on the phone, so I feel like I mean see like seeing. them privately show me that hey we're not leaving you were still here the relationships still here. And that actually put myself in a little peace of mind, like I I haven't. I didn't wake up from anxiety today, which is really great because the past two to three days i've been waking up at 4am from anxiety and then having to go to my mom to fix it like just hug her and then go back to sleep. But today I would I didn't need to do that. My I, like my brother did little things like he left me. He put. He sprayed his Cologne on my blanket So when I go to sleep, I can smell his Cologne apart be like be. You know just feel comfortable and stuff like that, like she gave me so many over her own stuff to keep here, so I mean she's proven to me, but I think a part of it, like I need to hear from her. Saying hey i'm not leaving you yeah i'm going to do that today."
740.0,Provider,"Thank you yeah that'll work. yeah hopefully and sometimes I mean I just say i'm just saying i'm just saying that we're on up with a father and drove one myself. You know i'm saying, and so I understand where they come from the same abandonment issues I understand them a great. young man, I understand those things and for what I am saying is is that you have to be able to appreciate the ones that are still there. A lot of times, of course, we can say well you know i'm saying, since this happened to me, I must be a little charm, for they mean it really vitally that my life me this now that you know, sometimes we take it too far young. yeah but again anytime you feel that way you have to be able to provide the evidence. Yes, right, and so you can say, and at the same time, share those things with mom say mom you're saying I you know i'm having a moment right now to where you know I feel like I feel abandoned, I feel, is the. You know i'm saying that you're going to leave me here and they were going to lose communication that you're not gonna you know the it, you know, even though you're gonna you're gonna you're going home in nine days."
13582.0,Patient,yeah my subconsciously i'm feeling this way yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah I like you're going home entire day, which means you get the kids grainy and then you get the curious grandpa you get to her brother, you get. Your mama again, you can get the lay back in your room we do cover all that kind of stuff you can see a little constables on a while of all your. People like you get to do all of that in man days for five days."
13582.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,"No i'm saying and so. You know, like I said there's just something maybe they can help you tell your mom so she can reassure you that she's my goal. And I know this will I mean it may sound like she's a fantastic mother, so I know for a fact that she not going to work is not that many parents to stay overnight, what a key I mean I don't. When I was the garbage mama when we me, I will not by myself. So I would just Lucy should be fun, so I mean that's a huge thing you know just for her to say hey I want you to know that you're going to be okay."
13582.0,Patient,You know i'm saying and so.
740.0,Provider,"That that that that's amazing, but at least do that express it to mom allow her to reassure you that she's not going anywhere have they're vulnerable mobile with her before she leaves. And it will make you feel better it will you know i'm saying you know I know a lot of time sensitive nine days away you like oh nine a murder so that's that's all."
13582.0,Patient,And yeah.
740.0,Provider,"They like it, I mean came to be tomorrow, can be next week, you know things like that. But at the fair and trust me nine days don't go by a."
13582.0,Patient,yeah yeah I yeah I know that. that's what's getting me through that's what got me through the first night um yeah so yeah i'm actually I feel better letting it out right now.
740.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13582.0,Patient,"And I just wrote down that i'm going to talk to her today and let her know yo i'm feeling and how. My biological father is technically triggered during this whole thing, even though I know she's not abandoning me. yeah yeah."
740.0,Provider,"But I mean sometimes when you see familiar when when when something is familiar like when you feel like a familiar or read. An action that is familiar, then of course it can be very triggering."
13582.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And so, managing your feelings with, and it is not invalid. you're not making a big deal out of something you don't say. you're just being really triggered that's all it is and so that's why you know, send out this law gave you try to help you keep things in perspective because that's what happens when you trigger you have to bring yourself back. Okay."
13582.0,Patient,For the.
740.0,Provider,"Eminence looking for a. Conclusion the baby. baby. There were actually hit that will help you because everyone goes to some kind of trauma. yeah right, but a lot of times first you got to figure out what's triggering you and you've you've already figured that out. yeah and so now, you have to bring things back. And like you say provide the evidence before you jump to a conclusion and then moving forward. Because i'm a college, you want to have a whole lot of more anxious moments."
13582.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
740.0,Provider,"This is not the first, this will be the, even though this is the first one, it won't be the last one you're gonna have a whole line of room."
13582.0,Patient,But look for the evidence.
740.0,Provider,before your conclusion and some. It until you heal you could do. A nice to get it was quite.
13582.0,Patient,"Honestly, just I I haven't you smile now I. i've never thought of it that way. You look for the evidence that's going to be my motto look for the evidence before you jump to conclusion. In okay."
740.0,Provider,"You have a whole lot he has the whole lot because sometimes we try to which have to put people under the same stigma that the people who heard of. So, which are real profits based off of what somebody has been. In."
13582.0,Patient,To get rid of them.
740.0,Provider,"yeah so you know you'll find yourself pushing people away because you feel like they're going to hurt you, in the end, anyway, so might as well get rid of them partners, no that's not that's not the case with everybody. Some people's intentions towards you are really appear and really, really genuine and like I said, you know saying, even with mom or does it look at it every day if you can't find them hey. You know, pull yourself back like mom my mom and then think about that this will you can find the evidence that you have to reassure yourself. Even even even if you even if people don't pick up the phone, you have to be able to look at the evidence of what you do not. Even if you can't find the evidence of what you don't know I don't know she's gonna abandon me I can't find evidence she's going to neglect me. I can't find the evidence that she was going to turn our back towards me, but I do have evidence that she loved me I have evidence that she's there for me. I have evidence that she was my number one fan, I have to say, being able to reassure yourself, even when no one else is there to reassure you."
13582.0,Patient,Okay yeah now. Do you recommend. You recommend like writing down the stuff.
740.0,Provider,"Yes, get your journal."
13582.0,Patient,"Writing down on the all the things that may. mean like positive evidence, instead of. Just negative evidence and just. Do it yeah. Okay okay."
740.0,Provider,"Good children and down. and call it evidence call it evidence before conclusion. And like I said in day we have those answers moment you say write down your answers moment whatever you want, whatever the moment he is writing down and then puts us at work so what's the evidence that this. At this moment is support, it was the evidence you fly genesis includes with evidence you got you got bad evidence, but then you got the good everything you i'm saying so, you know so. If i'm having a trigger any moment i'm going to write down a moment and then i'm going to write down the evidence of what makes dish true. that's the whole purpose of evidence, the evidence is I need to have evidence that this whatever is making me anxious in this moment is true. Right and then, if you pay fine, then that means other the evidence, then you want to have to have reassurance evidence the say i'm going to reassure myself i'm basically did I know that this is not true, is evidence by this this this."
13582.0,Patient,"Okay. Perfect yeah I I wrote down talk to mom and get an evidence. yeah proof of evidence journal. And i'm going to get started on that. And today. When I get home because I they're dropping me back here. before they go to the airport to fly back. I know that's going to be a hard time. But I. i'm going to go take a walk right after they dropped me off, as soon as they drive away and then clear my mind and then come back and write in my journal. yeah so."
740.0,Provider,"Or, or you could take your journal, which you on the walk. And you a nice tree or. find you a bit of this shady spot outside and and you know and just listen to your favorite tune and and and and writing your arriving your evidence book."
13582.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. that's that's the goal for today. that's what my goal is today perfect, let me i'm gonna. write that down and my other journal. Okay i'm a journal yeah I am a. journal person."
740.0,Provider,"Oh that's that's amazing I encourage you, is really, really, really, really good. To have it. Especially you it'll excuse me to do another moment I mean. You know college is a step into adulthood, is something. However, I got a few questions to actually. i'm happy, they were there just to get this the first. i'm gonna let you finish writing it down and then let me know you're ready. Already in a what before we move on anything else in the topic anything else do we need to deal with."
13582.0,Patient,"um. No, I can't think of anything now."
740.0,Provider,"Okay cool. So i'm just going to ask you a few questions just about yourself district, I know you a little bit. harder, you know you a little bit a little bit yeah. So what what brings you to treatment and why have you decided to come now."
13582.0,Patient,"i'm obviously the anxiety and the depression, I miss them me, who was a laid back relaxed like did not give an excuse my French did not did not give a Fuck about anything. just wanted to I was like to go with the flow type of person now it's like I need to write it down look at it and try not to look at the rest of the week type of stuff so my goal is to not go back to that person, but you'll be able to combine those two people. In a healthy way and. learn not to overthink over stress, for no reason. Hopefully. and be pretty much mentally healthy because I feel like the healthier I am mentally, the more successful that's my like philosophy, like the healthier, you are physically mentally emotionally, the more successful you are. Compared to financially because money really can't buy you happiness, but. The bed good mental health. can make you look for happiness and places that most people don't look for happiness. yeah yeah so that's why."
740.0,Provider,Any history of substances at all.
13582.0,Patient,"No substances, I have been prescribed I have been prescribed. lexapro 20 mg. And then X 0.25 mg. I was informed, to take the xanax during this transitional period, but other than that I don't take it, because I have fear of rejection yeah."
740.0,Provider,"um any history of treatment in the past, before you came to by heart."
13582.0,Patient,"therapy, yes, I took I had treatment my senior high school from a private therapist but eventually. She even she agreed that, like. Start you don't really need therapy, like, I was in a good place and I didn't really need therapy for until there was another transitional period happening in my life so that was at the time I was like 30 years later, so yeah that's the only yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, any history of suicidal ideation upon the fatty issues with their home."
13582.0,Patient,"When I first got diagnosed um I had like a split second moment of like what would happen if I wasn't here just what would happen, but after that I literally just rip that thought process and got that out of my mind. i'm yeah i'm a huge ego. kind of me like Why would I do that, like i've so much it to worry about. them yeah. um but yeah."
740.0,Provider,"So no carry awesome. All right, okay good deal. So growing up what was your family life, like."
13582.0,Patient,"um I spent 10 years in boggis on. Over there there my parents marriage was not good at all i'm, to the point where I have absolutely no memory of me, being in that country, it was like I was born when I was 10 years old. And that was when I moved here. I mean throughout the years i've gotten a few my memories back, but none of it has been like you know significant people will show me pictures and i'm like I don't know why I don't remember this i'm sorry um. When I got here, I obviously like I said, my father walked out of my life I was staying with my me my mother and my brother were staying with her my mom's parents. My grandpa became a father figure, and so my brother he. My grandpa used to do like menial stuff like picking pick me up from school when I felt like it, but other than that I used to walk to school. On my own I would. I tried to be as independent as possible, because I felt like I was being a burden. And I sometimes still do feel like I was being I am being a burden, if I call on my brother too much or someone like you know, like I get worried I get worried if someone's worrying about me. yeah so. there's that. I. Then you know my my relationship with my grandpa is the best I love him I don't know what I would do without him. He and my brother have been like my number wouldn't supporters, they have been. The minute they started seeing like I was crying too much they may be, at least, that you need sell like they weren't in denial, they were trying, they were pushing towards me getting called i'm South Asian August on it, so there is the stigmatism of negative stigmatism of. Mental health means something is completely wrong with you or there's there's no such thing as depression or anxiety. So, but they were super supportive all considering my grandpa's very traditional um my grandma and my mom I have been a huge port, but I am much closer to my grandpa than I am with my grandma. And my mom has been my rock she's she's worked nine to five so like I would see her three average via three hours after I got home in the beginning, I was very closed off I wouldn't talk to people, I want to talk to my cousins I was very antisocial. I would listen to music 24 seven I would be watching TV 24 seven and now, but as the years went by after my diagnosis, I noticed that a lot of things changed for the positive. My relationship with my mother got so much better, because at the time. because she was working so much and I had this belief system that my mom doesn't care about me she's just waiting for me to leave because my dad left, and I mean he just taught me that love means leaving. You know um but after them my mom and my relationship got so much better my relationship with my cousins got so much better we can go a day without texting each other. Something or and same with my brother it got so much better. I I noticed that my maturity level skyrocketed so until I was 18 years old, I would act very childish. um I think it's because I don't remember my childhood and I think that I was trying to make up for the thing that missed out on like the stuff I would say, like the comments I would say it wasn't like yeah it was a. I was it was very childish not. Not like derogatory way, but I guess. You understand what i'm saying like yeah. But as soon as this happen, like my my whole family notice the change immediately, I was more. With my cousin my little cousins I was very much more. hey this is wrong, this is right, but when I was their age, I didn't care about those things, or I didn't even if someone told me. If I was like 1516 and saw what a nine year olds doing I would be acting like a nine year old so. yeah i'm, that is what happened my college was my Community college spend during coven so that was a. That was an experience I in throughout high school my brother and my mother didn't let me work because they wanted me to focus on my classes and Community college because of co bit, and I was still living with my grandparents. I was in charge of taking care of them. Rather than working so I have not hold down a job, but I have done, like volunteer work I love doing volunteer work and stuff like that um my high school experience. around the time of my diagnosis like I pushed out away all my friends and I just found new people I started hanging out with them, I. mean, I guess, a part of me realize like they were kind of negative people I was hanging out with my grades got so much better after I pushed away my previous friends my mental health got better my relationship was. A lot of people got better. I mean yeah there were a lot of nights where I was crying where I could not sleep in a room alone because because of the anxiety, or I at one point. I had sleep paralysis, because either I wasn't sleeping at all for days or I would sleep like an hour and then cry the rest of the day, so like there was a lot of dehydration and stuff like that lack of eating. I could barely eat a piece of toast. Today, but. Today I was this few days, I have been struggling to eat food um but the most I can eat, with a few bites of toast but today I was able, able to eat half a piece of toast because I still had any ID which, for me, I think it's a plus I was able to get there. And then, again, I was walking back and forth and it's a holy place so that was yeah yeah that that's my whole spiel."
