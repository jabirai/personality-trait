All right, I was running on the treadmill a couple years ago right. mm hmm and uh and like I had this vision and like that I know it sounds so crazy, but like it was real I don't even know what the word elo he meant. And I guess. that's the original name for God and Hebrew."
740.0,Provider,and
17025.0,Patient,"And then, it said why ah, who i'd even know that's how you spell it your way. And then i'm like the original Jewish when like the subtitles changed it felt alien and like it told me like it was a message i'm not gonna lie about anything i'm just because I don't remember everything that it said. And, but like i'm pretty sure said, there are two teams and then it's set up something about being humble and that's good and but I don't see how I could not be because my life nevermind and then uh. um yeah it said, like this, like message and then like after that I Google like what like that word meant and then like it was like oh that's God and Hebrew and I was like what the heck and then all right here's this out. And I know. What these people are trying to kill me over it's pretty interesting story so. um I had like this crazy panic attack like years ago and I thought everybody was out to get us like a schizo frantic attack and I was at the airport terminal leave the country and my dumb ass called the FBI for help. Never do that and I said that games are after me and I said the Mexican mafia and all these Games were working together, trying to kill me and it's the law of attraction. think it speak it or believe it think it's speak at Wa and uh I guess like they have like have to have this whitey bulger Program. You know I guess that that's the only i've never even met an FBI agent in my freakin life, and then they hacked into my freakin phone and they hand it over to this FBI mob boss, apparently, and then. They put a hit on me and then three years later, this was like years ago, like a long super long time ago I don't even know anybody from the freaking car till I don't know I used to have just mental breakdowns over them like I don't freakin I was out of my mind and then um. I was in this relationship with this girl not doing drugs and then she got involved with these gang Members, I guess, my name was on this list, and then a. Catholic the craziest stuff happened to me I keep escaping them and she murdered somebody and I had this remote viewing thing. And then, like it was a vision and there's this dude tied up in a chair and she was with this other guy. If she's slits his throat with the kitchen if that the guy has turned bloodsport are fakes blitz always worse from your head and then she started making out with this dude. And then, like she had me set up there's all these people they're trying to get me and I purposely went to jail, because I didn't know what to do and then um but before that I told her what she did, and she goes oh my God, how do you know that you know what I mean like she was just. dumbfounded on like I saw happening like I kept having warnings about her and stuff and dreams like warning after warning and then like I think like what where dreams come from I don't know but. Like whatever like the crazy thing was like they're like I don't think he gets it, yet you know what I mean so like. yeah sure. Exactly what she was doing right there and it was so real like I can't make up that other guys face that she started making out with like it goes a real like it was a real event she admitted that was real. And now she's faked in her death because, like I guess i'm supposed to disappear I don't know, but my dreams or, better, so it might be like because God God controls everything right. Like maybe like oh no I read in the Bible in the Old Testament and stuff like that, but like you know, like this happens, like, I was being punished for being with her and going down the wrong path, but I don't think I deserve it, that tag but. yeah I don't know. yeah."

And all my wi fi is being taken over and they'll say gang names on it will say mark I had people tell me that I don't even know what a mark was. I had people tell me that it's a mark mark man i'm my ex she told me things like that. She was following me around my every time I turn on my phone it have all these gang names on the wi fi signals and asked a COMP I was like what does that mean, he said. Before they're taking you to jail, because that all these people following me around this one day when my ex girlfriend trying to set me up to get murdered and. I was homeless and I didn't know what to do so, I stole a car, I found the keys under a car and I turned myself into jail, because that's so many people freakin following me. That it was jail or death jailer death I wouldn't installing the car I wouldn't have been in the situation if it wasn't like it was a life or death situation. But then when I got in the police car, I asked him I was like what's up with this gang stalking and um what's up with my wi fi signals being taken over, he said that only happens if an FBI mob boss puts a hit on you. So that's bad I said oh my God, I was thinking that it all clicked together and it's like Oh, it made sense and then all the stuff that she was saying, like a she had me meter in a hotel room one night and. She was she alerted me in with drugs, and then there is do that she was with, and he was talking about how messed up she was and I had this crazy gut feeling that. I was going to get freakin killed out shaking I was having panic attacks and there's all these gang Members I heard them talking about what they're going to do. And I like a bunch of i've been escaping like but I gotten the guy's car and he's like yep he he admitted he's like you really think you're going to get away really think you're going to get away and then um.

I started shaking his car and he was like an old 50 year old tweak or guy and I kicked him out of his car to school, he was trying to murder me and I crashed his car into a freakin. into a close close down supermarket into the doors, because I didn't know what to do, there's all these people following me in their cars. And then he's like you're so smart you figured it out he's he's like he's basically he admitted that it was going to happen. And I was like Fuck i'm not going to let them kill me right now my family thinks i'm crazy they were withholding they had $4,000 my money and they're holding away from me saying is irresponsible, because i've been. telling them that what's going on and they're like oh you just have mental health problems, so they wouldn't give me my freakin money, so I could get away and get a plane ride and I had no other fucking option, I had no other option. So I crashed my car into a fucking supermarket. and got arrested by these COPs Oh, the constraint on it to they're all fucking it's all dude the legal system is a joke I don't know what to fucking it's been so bad it's like my worst nightmare became I don't.
