298.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, thank you for sharing guys, it does help me know a little bit about um just know how your week was, I am going to be sharing with you what i'm. Our worksheet for today. So the first question is what are two questions you are currently in the process of answering what another way to put that is. What are you thinking about in your head, what are you trying to come up with a solution for. Go ahead Anthony."
15565.0,Patient,"Where exactly I want to go back to work at for the winter, I have a couple options. And then, if I want to show you my car for a truck."
298.0,Provider,"Okay yeah all right well let's apply. These questions um. it's a little bit of it, this is little hard, but I, I want to work through this I heard this done like three times yesterday, so I don't know why i'm finding it a bit of a challenge is. let's take the question about where should you go work when you do, that the questions I have is what are your biggest triggers when looking at that question we're not talking about substance use we're just talking about that question. i'm helping, can I start to challenge your limiting beliefs on it, where did my core beliefs begin, how can I know myself better emotionally so with those kinds of questions with your problem. What, what are your thoughts about what's triggering you one way or the other, on like what are the."
15565.0,Patient,"right for the job. Probably the one of the. options is pulled hours alternating shifts so one of the shifts will be 7pm to 7am for four days in a row, then it will be three days in a row for 7am to 7pm. And then the other one. Is landscaping and I wouldn't make as much money as the other one, but I will be running my own crew."
298.0,Provider,Okay. Which is it doesn't come down to our money issue.
15565.0,Patient,"He is no i'm going back to the forest service next summer, but what really comes down to is what's the best on resume. So i'm trying to build a resume."
298.0,Provider,"wow. That that took it to a new newer level, so if you take the one that's the night shift one well that looks better on your resume."
15565.0,Patient,"it's a significant amount more money, and even though i'm not really focused on my other ones have supervisor position now. So i'd be running a crew so on my resume would say. Like shift supervisor."
298.0,Provider,"think this is a good question but i'm having a really hard time applying it to these questions, maybe what are two questions you are currently in the process of answering. Can somebody help me How did we How is this, how can we take these questions and apply it to a question emotionally."
15565.0,Patient,um I can start up whether I want to stay with my boyfriend or not.
298.0,Provider,Okay that's a little bit easier why don't you go ahead heather and try to apply these questions to that scenario.
15565.0,Patient,"Could you wait, can you repeat what the question."
298.0,Provider,Okay it's pretty it's pretty little isn't it. Can you see it.
15565.0,Patient,If I come up close okay. What are my biggest triggers.
298.0,Provider,on that.
15565.0,Patient,yeah okay i'm in that relationship or.
298.0,Provider,let's try it that way.
15565.0,Patient,What whether or not my biggest triggers are with him is whether he stays clean. or not. Whether he keeps his word and stays out of shady shit. And how he treats me and respect my boundaries. some kind of ask the question or.
298.0,Provider,"I think so. I think that's what what two questions are you currently in the process of answering so when you go to answer that that's a factor for you, your your trigger those are factors."
15565.0,Patient,"And then how can I start to challenge my limiting beliefs by believing in myself and keeping my boundaries, strong and maintaining them."
298.0,Provider,"How can you challenge that by. If you have an automatic negative thought about. Something, how do you challenge that do you go to a friend and say hey you know challenge."
15565.0,Patient,"I talked to Denise to challenge me about it to you know whether it's not whether or not of being right or wrong, but what's right for me what's best for me. To challenge it to to have faith and believe in what he's saying. kind of thing I guess. guys and where do I begin, they begin in my heart. it's an end for my sobriety it's it's what I need what I want the stability and consistency."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and so what what. What did you see growing up, if your parents had a similar situation. Usually our core beliefs were formed at a really young age."
15565.0,Patient,"My mom my mom's even though she when she got somewhere, when I was nine and my dad kept drinking she stayed with my dad because she wanted to wait until the youngest of my sisters graduated high school so she stayed. and tried to make it work she stayed so that's I believe that, no matter what I need to stay and put in my best effort to make it work."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's good that you kind of see that that was a role model, do you still have that core belief."
15565.0,Patient,i'm kinda I guess I we've never been sober together the two years that i've been with my partner we've always been using so I want to know what it's like to be sober together. Without giving up on it just because it's tough just because i'm in a sore face and he's trying to do it on his own again he's he's been through treatment before and it isn't willing to go through it again is legit to quit. and hopefully it is his I wanted to believe him in assessment as behaviors was going to show me what is that you know his actions and behavior welcome to seven what is truly going. kind of things.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and how can you get to know yourself better emotionally."
15565.0,Patient,"By being honest with yourself about my feelings, to express my emotions. And to be open and honest and talk about what i'm feeling and what my needs are."
298.0,Provider,"Sometimes I like what you said, expressing yourself, sometimes we don't even know what we're feeling until it comes out of our mouth. Like no need to process it."
15565.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean that telling him what my needs are, then, how is this behavior supposed to change if he doesn't know it's not properly, you know appropriate. For what my nights are now. Right so that's what I don't I can't think of another question."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I think that. I think this is geared towards. emotional choices, or you know something. like that. Okay, any other brave soul, what are two questions your current how about just one question. What is one question you are currently processing the answer."
15565.0,Patient,"i'm. me trying to stay with my girlfriend my current girlfriend I don't know whether or not or stay with her there's a big trigger. Because I really care about her and. I want her to do good but. One thing that's triggering me is that she's using and. I don't want her to use no more. How can I start to challenge my limiting. By testing the waters and asking her whether or not she wants to get clean so far she's said she will. But so far. She hasn't come to see me like she said she was, and I still think she's out using. Where. did my core beliefs began. i'd say from childhood from my mom. just learning things from my mother, you know. I can't think of anything in specific and then how can I get to know myself better emotionally. By trying out new games I guess. You know. that's it."
298.0,Provider,"These are not easily easy questions, I mean, I have to stop him on and think about these things. Who takes time to get to know themselves better emotionally who does that. The jobs to be done the job Oh, my goodness, all of you. Are you doing it more because you're in rehab right now."
15565.0,Patient,"yeah, I feel that way."
298.0,Provider,"You. get some time alone to I mean, how are you doing it, what are you doing."
15565.0,Patient,"um. I just sit down and and what I have time to myself, I actually think you know. I think it Marty plays a big part of it and we're in our steps yeah for sure."
298.0,Provider,"yeah. So I know about myself that my love language is words of affirmation, and I know that if I want to like recharge myself, I need to like fill my own love tank because not nobody else is going to do it we're not really I mean my husband isn't around very much. And I use this thing from. From Amazon and it's kind of silly but i'll play it for you."
15565.0,Patient,"I read a bunch of course and self affirmations every day I have like 20,000 collected on my phone."
298.0,Provider,Oh.
15565.0,Patient,yeah that's that's what gets me going is reading things that I can relate to and giving me that goes so.
298.0,Provider,"I love that okay heather you you've got the message that I was trying to make. What about you other guys, what do you do that helps you just fill your image of yourself emotionally get to know yourself better."
15565.0,Patient,Mainly our view.
298.0,Provider,"And when you say, Mr T is that because you're working in a workbook answering questions. Okay that's."
15565.0,Patient,"A more we can cognitive nation, no recognition recognition train. So you, you have to get in touch with your emotions and your feelings. In order to. Do to work, the workbook to work, the program actually."
298.0,Provider,"Right. All right. let's keep trying anyone else have something emotional that they're trying to work out a solution for that they'd be willing to share. Man, so this one was a hard worksheet. In what Mr T. Was I don't you guys were the first group I tried this worksheet on and I don't think I can do it again."
15565.0,Patient,"I, I feel that would be as being a woman it's easier to express. Emotions and to think about them well I can't speak for the gentleman here, but I, I find that sometimes it's the mind can my my general can be emotional or. Fast the case, but to actually talk about it or think about it it's it's harder for it's hard for him, anyway, I don't know about these gentlemen hours but. yeah I kind of don't want to like dive into that."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Right now. You guys have a new person that just came to grip the just showed up there D number one is it's making behind the camera, by the way."

The insurance has been covered it, yet I don't know, maybe you need to resend it again i've been getting free samples, but I don't know how that works, because I haven't gotten anything from the pharmacy."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'd probably have to put in the order again and a person who is a good resource for you i've seen him do it before is wes he he will ask for help, I did put it through on the 29 and like nine days ago."
15565.0,Patient,"Oh again okay. And the first time, so."
298.0,Provider,"Well, usually called ponies and chloe's will tell him yay nay do this if that doesn't work, and you can go to bright heart health and we have a prescription department, but you can tell anybody that says, I need a prior authorization for re lar so that my insurance will pay for it. And you can tell him that."
15565.0,Patient,"Okay, so go to the primer. Young what where exactly."
298.0,Provider,it's the braveheart clinic.

298.0,Provider,now try tricks.
15565.0,Patient,No tricks oh yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just pulling up your. Information right here what we've got you on yeah we can we we we can definitely do that let's go up to two tablets a day. Okay, and. Let me put it to this way let's go to 100 milligrams a day, so that whatever tablets that you get Oh, they it only comes in, so it'll be 215 a day, and let me know if that helps okay."
15565.0,Patient,"Okay, should I space it out at all or."
298.0,Provider,"You can try spacing it out, you don't you don't have to. But you, you will find what works for you, it doesn't help that you're a little bored it doesn't. But. i'm glad that you came to me and told me you're starting to get cravings are you having dreams just interested thoughts."
15565.0,Patient,i'd say both have an added some weird dreams that are you know kind of dive into that and then i'm thinking about it. More often than not.
298.0,Provider,Okay okay and um you started the Prozac yes. and depression. and any notice of any errors are just too so.
15565.0,Patient,I mean I don't feel as depressed as I was when I first got in here but i'm not sure how much it is like doing the work here and groups and stuff well I do start feeling better and i'm able to talk. easier in front of people so.
298.0,Provider,"Okay that's a good deal I wouldn't want to go up on the medicine and here's the reason why. Sometimes, when you can get into a serotonin you can start getting enough where you just feel flat and I don't want to get you so that you completely flattened do you feel like you're still having emotions."
