9546.0,Patient,Hello. hi. How are you.
252.0,Provider,Good. How things been going for you.
9546.0,Patient,"Okay, I guess. just stressed stressful. everything's really stressful right now."
252.0,Provider,For what.
9546.0,Patient,"Why, I live in California so we're the first state to mandate vaccinations for children 12 and over. So, unfortunately, that affects me, I have a 16 year old in high school and then. My 11 year old will be 12 and November. um I don't want to get the vaccination I think i've been vocal about that you know i'm and I don't want my children to get it either you. have a lot of decision making of what i'm going to do, because. i'm going to stay strong and what I believe. And the research that I. Am and a medical professionals that are family members that actually work in our medical industry that tell me that there's no way in hell, they would ever get shot even more solidifies that I shouldn't get it. I have now in San Diego what i'm gonna do. Now it's mandatory to go to public school. i'm sure private school as well. But yeah we have until January they're saying right now to fully vaccinate."
252.0,Provider,So January.
9546.0,Patient,"yeah. Which is weird it is so weird. um. yeah so don't know what i'm gonna do that's a really big a big stressor it's huge I got the call two days ago, and I have not stopped stressing on it, I feel like i'm going to have a fucking heart attack i'm like I am stressed, you know just those. people believe in taking it I believe in the opposite, I really do I am not for this, this is, I really, this is a choice I have family members, unfortunately, they are all in their 80s and 90s, they have gotten this shot, but nobody else. Everybody that I know. Has gotten sick from it, everybody. Like what perk and you can still give it and you can and you're even more, you know contagious when you. Short yourself up with live Kobe i'm like I am pleased that. Like that's I don't understand and people are really. it's crazy, I never thought in my entire life I would see people be so negative when we live in America, this is America. You know we're the land of the free, we are able to make those choices, do we want to put that in our body that is our choice, and it seems like here are kind of getting the vicious. yeah it's like it's not a choice and, but it is. yeah it is. So, like it's just too much it's just too much and then my granddaughter was born, two weeks ago. But my granddaughter was born, two weeks ago."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, and."
9546.0,Patient,we're not allowed to see her because we're not vaccinated.
252.0,Provider,Oh.
9546.0,Patient,"So you know I mean we even I haven't talked with her, I said i'm sorry that you feel this way you know um. I wish it was different but. You know."
252.0,Provider,wow.
9546.0,Patient,"My God tells me not do it, and I have to stay strong to my beliefs. And not just that and as much as I want to rush out and go okay and obey her like i'm a child and need you to instruct me on what I should put into my body. We stood fast against it and said no i'm sorry, you know that was a choice that you want to make and I respect it. And you should respect mine we're not sick. And if we have any inkling of being sick, do you really think we would come and visit her no we wouldn't but that's beside the point i'm not going to have that conversation with her like that, because I feel like. she's a grown ass woman, this is her child, and I have to respect her decisions. Like she should respect mine. yeah and I just don't want to have, especially since she just had the baby i'm not the person that's going to have that conversation she is my bonus daughters not my daughter, you know. Because like I told my husband, I said, if it was my child, because I have a 26 year old and I have a 23 year old. If it was one of my boys. i'm not going to ask you to come visit my grandchild I promise you I won't i'm just gonna show up, and I can guarantee you that my son would not reject me. it's just not gonna happen. it's weird but you know, I have the support of my family, and you know. Hopefully that eventually that changes because I don't want her kids ever feel excluded from us, because we are going to be good grandparents, we do want to be hands on and in their everyday life in very. involved who want to show that you know so when other kids come in, we just don't want her children to feel disconnected from us like we don't want that, when we do you know so it's weird how that's going to play out I feel like I just don't know but. it's a lot it's just a lot and i'm going down on medication, you know, Mary has me on like Tuesday Annexes A day. and i'm having a lot of anxiety, with it, but i'm doing it, but I feel pressure, because every time I talk to her she's like tell me when you want to go down, I know i'm not going to go down like. Within the month but going from four to two I think is pretty good, but I still feel pressure I always feel just pressure like i'm not. But I also don't like the way my body feels like I don't like feeling like i'm dying all the time yeah."
252.0,Provider,I don't like it remember if are you practicing anything you've been learning and.
9546.0,Patient,"I am oh yeah. Definitely and that's the only reason why i'm not having straight panic attacks. I just have continuous anxiety it's just all the time, like I am if you could be in my chest right now we relate I don't know how you Bob and function with this level of anxiety. Well it's not normal you know."
252.0,Provider,"For those a piece of it to brandi that if you get when you get all the way off of. The xanax excuse me that's my granddaughter screaming out there. Once you get all the way off xanax anybody has time to figure out what its normal is then your anxiety it'll spike up right. you'll be able to move because you have the tools that you know what you need to be able to do it. But it'll be at a manageable level, and if you tell yourself that your anxiety is high and you tell yourself that you can't handle it that's the message that you're sending your body."
9546.0,Patient,"yeah which i'm trying to learn right now I think that's where i'm trying to learn, right now, because right now. I don't care what I tell my message is not getting through there's like a wall, you know. To where yeah i'm easily myself."
252.0,Provider,too.
9546.0,Patient,yeah. So i'm so nervous I just i'm shaking all the time and loud noises. You know just different stuff i'm just jumpy and I hate it.
252.0,Provider,it's part of the detox.
9546.0,Patient,yeah and I worry that that's the thing that's getting me the most is I just like okay last Monday and group I think her name is Noah is that her name Noah.
252.0,Provider,Okay.
9546.0,Patient,"The girl that was in our group yeah I have thought about her all this week. Every day all day i'm like why didn't I say anything I should have said something to her, those are the exact words my dad said, you should have told her brandi that this is a hard walk but it's what I should have said something I didn't say anything. it's bothers me. All week I have played that exact moment of listening to her talk. And going oh my God, I see it, she's broken she's like she's literally telling you that she's gonna do this, you know. And then i'm heartbeat you didn't say anything you're a coward you didn't say anything to her, you should have said something. I it's just I don't know my brains everywhere."
252.0,Provider,"going through a process right now, you have to remember that. That if you've been on benz's."
9546.0,Patient,"I have been on them strong for November will be 12 years. hey i've been on them for 20, but I wanted to get to a really low point sometimes where I would take maybe like one or two a day or when I got pregnant with my daughter I didn't take him for six months. Because once I found out there could be possible problems with taking the anxiety medicine, I don't know how I was able to do it, I mean this was 12 years ago I was like no way, so I just you know when I would get it, I just eliminated everything from my life that was. What to get me upset. which was hard to do, but I did it, I mean I even eliminated my mother. I was like okay i'm not going to speak with her i'm not gonna have anything to do with her until I have the baby just because I cannot take this medicine and I didn't. But. Once my blood caught in my stomach bro. That and then it came in on a different level because Prior to that, I think I needed a little bit more. I used to now that I have the remix I get out my force myself but for like I would pull up to the store. And I lead totally dressed have the kids ready to go in and then I would just sit there. I can't go in I just can't do it, and so I turn around and go home every time. But then I had my surgery, and I was like oh my God, I could drop dead anywhere. anywhere and nobody's going to help me. Especially if my husband's father, because my husband came home probably like. Five minutes prior to the incident happening like literally minutes. If he had not been there. Nobody was there old enough to save my life so. I wouldn't be here and it scared the daylights out of me that I was that comfortable died. I just went comfortable, so it just the so I just I don't know trauma of it, it said nope you're going to do this, you know now you're going to be scared. That this can happen right. And i've been sick. Two weeks ago I kept getting like a weird feeling in my stomach my lower abdomen was like gosh I feel like. I have a book. I was like i'm just gonna like. flush my system. and get rid of it. And it was just getting we're getting worse knows God I don't know what this is. Well Sunday came actually like walk so my husband took me to emergency in the middle of the night and. My diverticulitis was severely infected, so my whole colon was swollen and infected. wow so yeah they had a CT crazy, so I was down for two and a half weeks. And a mate. i'm nervous something wrong with my colon because this is like the first time stuff has been going on lately it's weird i'm just having all these weird stomach issues and i'm losing weight again. So i'm just i'm nervous and they were like you need to go here. Probably need lastly there's so much nervous like. This one thing it's another you know I, but I know it's life it's just. Just a lot. It is a lot a lot. yeah and now my I let my 16 year old go to Toronto, I live in modesto so it's about five hours from us. I let her go with her boyfriend and his family, they went, she goes all the time it's like a little mini vacation for four days and she is so allergic to everything there and I guess there's spice so the sky is like black she says she can't breathe. So she's like super sick and they're not coming back till tomorrow, so now i'm worried about that. Like the one medicine, I didn't send with her is the one that she needs."
252.0,Provider,Something she could buy at the store.
9546.0,Patient,"I told her that I said, you need to ask his mother I should call his mother myself, but I said that you need to ask his mom to run you to the store. See you because I gave her money to get something for your cold and I know she won't she she just won't do it. She comes home tomorrow so. But her symptoms are stuffy nose. And she can't breathe. So i'm like Okay, I want to see when she comes back to those go away because she's out of that environment, because if they does it, you know, then those are covert symptoms and like I you know I can't send you to school with any of that you know we got to go get you tested. But. She would have been exposed two weeks ago, like. We haven't played around anybody that's tested positive and the school they notify us, you know if somebody is next year child they like track the whole thing it's a whole system they go through. And she has and she wasn't sick when she left that morning at the time she got there that night she had been there, a couple hours that's when the symptoms came on so I have a feeling it's just the environment, you know she does that she's very sensitive to the air trees all that. So, but i'm worried about it, like I just i'm ready for it to come home now. This is why I don't like you guys to go anywhere this happens, this is the craziness that is us."
252.0,Provider,So. I would definitely call the mom.
9546.0,Patient,yeah i'm gonna have to some like I know you're not gonna say anything. yeah and. Put a bug you need an allergy medicine.
252.0,Provider,Find out from the mom how she's doing.
9546.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,Get that second mom. perception so that you'll feel at ease for the next 24 hours so she's home.
9546.0,Patient,"I don't think so his mom is. she's not that type of mom. Like if Jason gets sick she is she's like oh you'll survive it. snow she's a. single really busy. kind of they raised their stuff mom their boys, you know so. I don't know she's different I like her she's you know really nice person, but I can tell. yeah that i'm gonna have to call her and be like you know, can you just go get this of her telling me she'll be like Oh, she just you know she's okay she's gonna say she's gonna say that, like well but she's saying she's miserable when she takes weeks is how are you not good. i'm like well. yeah allergies are like that my child for do you I can't drive to Reno and or taco and bring you medicine, you have to tell her i'm sure there's like a walgreens or something there it's taco so difficult. But yeah. So just regular stuff but trying to deal with it. Trying to go down on medication that's where i'm at. You trying to just focus on. try not to worry so much, but. I am. But i'm trying to do the best at it i'll put it that way. you're doing the best I can."
252.0,Provider,"I at least i'm not panicking exactly I think you're doing pretty amazing. yeah I think the stuff that you're worried about you know is definitely life happening. we're gonna we're gonna worry we're gonna have anxiety over it. paying attention to the message that you're telling yourself. paying attention to what you're thinking about these things right. Why, through your symptoms breathing with coping statements in your head. it's Okay, whatever happens. it's going to be the same with the Cobra testing, especially in the mandate you know your. What you feel is in the best for your family and remember that."

You know brief. You will get through this everything is going to be okay. your daughter will be home tomorrow. Those are the messages that should be going through your head, not the what IFS."
