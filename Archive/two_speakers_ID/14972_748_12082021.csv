14972.0,Patient,hi.
748.0,Provider,How are you.
14972.0,Patient,"i'm fine, how are you."
748.0,Provider,"Sometime I don't believe you but. I don't know if you've ever heard what find stands for, but anyway i'm. uh i'm fine to. No problem probably a similar way actually. Like that's the convenient thing to say. Maybe a month anyway honestly i'm overwhelmed I just moved this weekend and i'm surrounded by boxes and stuff and. Oh."
14972.0,Patient,"yeah that sounds stressful congratulations on the new, though."
748.0,Provider,"I can, I think it's going to be a good move, but it's it, you know getting from here to there. that's. yeah i'm moving a three bedroom house and. 20 years of racing my daughter without her step two. into a one bedroom apartment. Oh, oh yeah So there you go I have shared a little about me now I am looking forward to hearing about you and your visit with your dad and. All this going on there with. The baby and."
14972.0,Patient,"yeah um. Well that's. what's going on, I guess. I don't know I. I have been meaning to call him and I feel like I should. um and then I feel like the month is going by fast or this year has been and my mom wanted me to go. Over there for Christmas. And I don't know I. I feel like I have mixed feelings about that. and My brothers joining the military on January. Which is part of the reason I think they're. Pushing you to go. And I have spent Christmas there and heard a long time, I guess i've only gone there once I moved out when I was 17. So I don't know there's a lot of feelings there um."
748.0,Provider,"Can you unpack those feelings, a little bit today."
14972.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'm. I guess. A lot of it has to do it's. Like. A you usually feel when i'm. around like my mom and my brother and my sister like I have to take care of things. And that's that's fine. But, and now my mom's doing better. And my brother and sister are kind of taking care of themselves pretty well because they're older now. But there's still like a sense of responsibility that I feel around them, and I also feel like i'm in a place. Where I. don't. I don't know it feels like a lot. And even though I know it would be different if I went and then my mom would probably be trying to just make it a happy time. And stuff and she offered to help me with costs going up fair like gas money if I get my car registered and stuff like that. It should I guess i'm just not used to. That dynamic. And I don't know um. I don't know."
748.0,Provider,What.
14972.0,Patient,Is this.
748.0,Provider,What do you want it.
14972.0,Patient,What do I want to do. um.
748.0,Provider,"I hear what they want to, but what do you want."
14972.0,Patient,"I got a part of me wants to go. Especially since. my brother is going into the military in January, and I know that, even if I do go I won't see them for a long time, so it would be really nice to visit. At the same time. I didn't. Because it my Nana when she was. dying earlier this year and. There was more going on, when that was happening. But. I. I have been thinking a lot about time is. and It. feels like a lot with how much time it would take like I don't. I don't feel like I want to spend. five hours driving there and Pack for. Christmas, when I couldn't even. Like they were offering to pick me up to see my Nana and I was like 40 minutes away. And I feel like for where i'm. Like I don't want to do that and there's a lot of fear tear with like leaving everything making that big of a commitment for a trip. And so I think a lot of it is so sheer and. yeah. I guess, a lot of it ties into fear in one way or another."
748.0,Provider,You identify what the theories what's the what is the few.
14972.0,Patient,"i'm. A lot of next thing is, I guess. and I have to bring my dog If I win. And I know that that'd be fine and we be able to figure that out, but last time I saw them earlier this year with my dog. They have a German shepherd and he was kind of freaking out and he ended up fighting me which. was fine um. But he is territorial and my tiny Chihuahua doesn't. really respect that, and so I know that that's just another thing if I went that I had to take care of and then there's also the fear of like just other things going wrong. And I know a lot of it. Was wouldn't. Like it's just running around in the back of my head. But yeah. i'm."
748.0,Provider,"So what a what a way to say it be that, based on what you've been through this year emotionally and what you're working on. Just mean that, at this particular time in your life that's like an expectation to go do that. And that you need to take care of yourself, you need to. not commit to that trip."
14972.0,Patient,"yeah I surely that's a good way of putting it um. And I I think they'd understand if I said it. i've also. kind of already said that to them multiple times this year. Because they've been wanting to see me and then with going to thanksgiving with my grandparents and my dad I told them about I guess I also feel like. If they. feel a certain way, if I told them the thoughts, the reason again. Even though it's a lot different and I haven't seen them and I have seen for like I didn't see my dad and my grandparents really put that I did make a stop well it's different, though, so I don't know. and I kind of feel like my fiance brought it up when I was talking to her about it, and she asked me if it was one of the things where I. don't like I think that I don't want to go, but then I end up going and it's fine and I have a good time and I am really happy that I did go anyway, and I feel like that's really possible. I don't know how to. change that i'll be like, if I do end up going i'll be really anxious about it and i'm going to try to it until i'm there and it's kind of going to be a miserable process until i'm there and then it turns out, fine. And that's. It just sucks."
748.0,Provider,"And the one thing I would say to that and I it's interesting that you just mentioned what you did, because in my mind, I was thinking. It has felt like your fiance has a really good sense of you and your needs, despite what your brains telling you. Right and that's that's the way it is, I mean you know my my brand i'm just going to use me as an example because using other people, and I know that there are people who don't agree with this style of counseling but there you go to bed and. My brain tells me stories that aren't true all the time, but I. don't know that. Yet or need their true and I have anxiety around. And the truth is as easy uses uses to say and as hard as it is to do, the only way through, that is to walk through this so that each time you do it, it gets easier, each time your mind says five hours is too much I can't do that it's. I hear you know the stress around the dogs. And if you were to go and it was good, you have that experience, under your belt, so to speak, so that the next time it might be even easier. And you also then, and this is just a piece of information may not be a big inner peace, you also then don't have the potential for guilt. When your brothers. That you didn't see. Now, if you decide not to go I would highly recommend zoom calls so that you're there, even though you're not there. I don't know how they are about that, but I would think your brother would be good, with it."
14972.0,Patient,yeah Thank you that's a good recommendation.
748.0,Provider,"it's not the same as a hug in person. But it's more connected than a text that's for damn sure and more even more connected than a phone call because you're seeing each other and you're. you're able to like feel the emotion, because that's what happens when you look in each other's eyes, you can feel the other person's heart."
14972.0,Patient,Thank you. it's good.
748.0,Provider,"Would your fiance go with you, or is."
14972.0,Patient,She.
748.0,Provider,"Oh, she would go. yeah so she isn't going to her family, I was wondering if that was a piece of the. puzzle so sweet."
14972.0,Patient,"You know i'm. know her. Her mom and her grandma lived nearby. But there's I. Think, I feel like there's also some things it was seeing and i've been wanting to um. But there is. It hasn't happened. So I don't know i've. also been. kind of wondering about fat. But then there's also. There hasn't been like specific Christmas questions about it. And I. And then, if that did come up. Then it'd be a lot easier to kind of do that, instead, in my mind, because then it's like you know she has done a lot for me and then like she did go to thanksgiving with me and so it'd be a lot easier to tell them. That we're doing something else with her family, because of that. But hasn't. come up yet yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Well, I was just curious whether that. You know, was a part of your commitment as a couple or that ship whether she had things going on around her family um yeah and it could be that that's. that's part of the reason that you're not able to go, but it may not that may not be a factor at all, it just may not be the right time for you to go until you feel more evened out in terms of all you've been walking through before you take on a trip like that."
14972.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"I you know, there are challenges there right emotionally historically."
14972.0,Patient,"yeah not necessarily for the holidays um. as hard as it's been my mom has always tried to make holidays, a happy thing and no matter what she was going through you know she tried to do something and. When I was younger I kind of resented it because it felt really fake like it felt like a show with her not being there and then suddenly showing up for Christmas or whatever. But so. You know there's baggage going up there and run our own, but I know. that it would be relatively pleasant. Because that's what she's made sure of my entire life."
748.0,Provider,"Well, as you check in with your intuition each day you know right, especially. When do you feel as though you need to make a decision about them."
14972.0,Patient,"Realistically, as soon as possible, I should have made a decision weeks ago. But i've kind of i've. i've really been putting off making decisions. And I feel like I haven't really been trusting my decision making. and So I don't know i've i've been putting i've always been bad at putting things off as long as I can. But I noticed that it's gotten, to the point where I don't feel the pressure like there's not enough pressure ever, even if I miss it like I feel all of it, and then I still don't act on it anymore so like with. thanksgiving, for example, they asked me a month ahead of time and I kind of responded, but then, even when they would. ask me more questions or trying to make a plan or something I wouldn't be involved, I wouldn't know what to say I couldn't make the decisions, and they kind of made it for me they picked it up, they picked me up. And they arranged everything and if they hadn't done that, like I wouldn't I wouldn't be there. And so, even though I should have made a decision about this weeks ago, like honestly I don't I don't know like I feel like if. Even though I need to make one it's entirely possible that. If they keep asking me i'll keep saying I don't know up till like Christmas Eve. Which isn't good and i'm trying to avoid that."
748.0,Provider,"Well, so let me just acknowledge that some part of you just know. Some part of you knows what's actually best for you, this year, you may not be able to access that. Right now, or yet because of anxiety self doubt. The pain you've been in for the last months. History around decisions, all kinds of things. But I can tell. By witnessing that you've got a lot of innate wisdom you've got the inner knowing of what's really best for Spencer. and We have so many should send our head from the past and from other people in our lives that sometimes we're afraid to even acknowledge those our inner voice. We don't trust it. So it does feel like and I could be wrong because clearly i've only known you for about 10 minutes, but in that in that short amount of time in the conversations. That i've heard you expressing group and then, especially in our individual session, it feels as though your fiance a has your best interests at heart. Really sees you clearly and gives you very valid feedback. And I wouldn't say that if I didn't actually feel that in my gut. And I could be wrong, I of course I could be wrong. But I think it's worth listening to. What she's saying and trying it on. and continuing to talk about it. Today is Wednesday may be through Sunday. And then, giving yourself. A date to to actually make a decision, even if you don't tell anybody else, even if you continue to doubt it, but if I were to make a decision, right now, my decision would be. and see what comes up. Does that make sense."
14972.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Usually, there will be a response from our gut. I feel scared but I really want. I want to have, and this is just i'm making this up it's coming out of me. I feel really scared or anxious or. nervous about the idea of going in the five hour drive and trying to figure out getting my car registered in time and. But I, but I think the bigger feeling for me, and I would regret not seeing my brother before he left for them. Like that might become clear to you if you keep talking about it for the next four days or it may be. How close, are you to you by the way, I know you helped raise it."
14972.0,Patient,"i'm not very anymore. Okay um, especially when I moved out um, I guess, I was 16. yeah um. You know that I didn't talk to my mom for a few years and I didn't talk to them, because I would have had to talk to her. And then I only visited them once or I guess now. Twice and then my sister was living with me for a bit, so I got I got closer differ, but I still haven't talked to him much, and I don't agree with him on a lot of things now that he has his own opinions and he's Baker. and So I I kind of have some guilt about that still about not being there and not helping him and like. um. But. You know, so I i'm just not very close to him anymore and. Okay, I don't I don't know."
748.0,Provider,"What that helps me with is that the things that I was just saying that I was making up now, I feel a different way now now I see them a little different I haven't been that close to my brother i'd like to cultivate a closer relationship with him in the future and develop that. And I think it would be really stressful to try to go, so what i'd like to do was have a zoom meeting with my mom my sister and my brother. For the holidays and then. Make sure that we connect and get together when he's on leave in. Six months a year I don't know how long it'll be before recently, but because I don't the military is, I know it's it's really like another planet to me and. So I know there's their intervals when you're in training and. People can visit you, but I don't know if you get to anyway, you get the idea I don't have a clear sense but I don't hear that if you don't go you'll feel guilty about not seeing human person I think you would feel. I think, which means, this is more about me. I think you would feel. Not great about it, if you didn't even talk to him prior to his leaving so making sure there's a connection during the holidays, that is authentic and hopefully on zoom like I said. But I don't hear a lot of. If you go even though you're stressed right now it'll be really cool by off, you know, I think, I think, whichever way you choose to go, you can trust that intuition."
14972.0,Patient,Thank you yeah appreciate your thoughts about it either way hearing your thought process helps and I feel like talking about it with my fiance will be easier. yeah Thank you.
748.0,Provider,how's the anxiety. And how's the medication. Two different subjects I know.
14972.0,Patient,"it's. I don't know it's it's hard to say I guess my anxiety has been pretty bad. But and then. I feel like the. medication has been been good. But at the same time, like just the months and months of things building up and piling up and there's no way around that really even though it's easier and I. can get some things done on my medication it's still like i'm now functioning normally and now there's a giant pile of shit to do and there's no way to catch up and what I. need to be doing on my meds is like doing like figuring out ways to you know function better, even when i'm not on them so things are just easier and just because I haven't been able to do that, and then I have to fight back against a lot of. The self doubt and stuff that has built up with everything. And so it's just kind of exhausting even though i'm doing better it i'm I still feel kind of terrible and it it's been a struggle."
748.0,Provider,"Well, it was even two weeks ago we were still trying to get the medication prescribed at the right level, so it barely enough time to even be able to notice enough of the difference, really. It seems like."
14972.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,You can feel it.
14972.0,Patient,"yeah and it's still a much lower dose than I was on for a while, like when I was in college and I had a higher demand of like having to sit down and do things for long periods of times I was on a much higher dose. But now i'm like I feel like that the dose is fine for doing everyday things but still if i'm i'm told to. You know, do the dishes, for example, and if they've piled up a bit i'll avoid it to know and because it's still hard for me to just stand there and just do dishes and think about doing dishes and nothing else. And that's a pretty short task to it's but it's it's a lot better. And i'm kind of happy it's a lower dose, especially after being off of it for so long and I don't like relying on medication and I have a lot of feelings about that and it took me a really long time. To even get that like you willing to be medicated To begin with, because of my parents history. So. I don't know i'm yeah. But I do feel like things are getting easier and i've had a lot of help and my fiance even cleaned my room for me and kind of helped to organize it. which made a huge difference and once she kind of like organizes some things and tells me where it goes, I feel like i've been pretty good i'm, making it a habit and just putting it back where she showed me, but then. You know it. And that's been a huge help that i'm really grateful for. But it still sucks not being able to do more. Especially. mailman coming. Especially when I feel like I used to do a lot more on my own and be able to, and I know a lot has changed but it's still disappointing. yeah. yeah well it's."
748.0,Provider,"It is towards knowledge, how much trauma impacts. And that it's a it's a delayed response, sometimes you know because. we're in the midst of severe or significant trauma. or in survival. And then it's not until later that the falling apart can happen that debilitate us. So. yeah."
14972.0,Patient,i'm.
748.0,Provider,"glad she's so gentle and supportive with you, so you can see it modeled for you to."
14972.0,Patient,You as well. yeah Thank you yeah.
748.0,Provider,Well i've asked questions i'd rather I like not i'd rather i'd like very much for you to just talk about anything that's. up for you that you might have wanted to bring to a session.
14972.0,Patient,"um. um. I feel like i've been. With drawing more lately. And that's something that has gotten a lot of tension i'm thinking oh. hey. Like I haven't been able to think about it, much more than that, like I realized that it's something that i'm doing that it's not healthy. And i've been trying to be mindful about it, but I don't feel like i've been doing a good job with that and I know it's been affecting. My fiance you know the. I know that it's been affecting her and it's. I don't like that. And I. Maybe I haven't you know where now but I. don't know. that's that's what's been on my mind lately and that's about as far as it's gone without."
748.0,Provider,say more about how you're withdrawing.
14972.0,Patient,"I. guess i've just been kind of shutting down really easily, and I do kind of. have a habit of. Shutting down that's then from my childhood I kind of either shut down or RON and. I. I don't know. And i've been trying to. I guess be more present for her, but I like if I get. Too emotional or something if, like some small things are upsetting or overwhelming, and then I have already been easily overwhelmed with how much stuff is piled up send like small things i'll just get really upset over like putting the this morning. I was helping her put on the little phone grip. For the backs of the phones and it was off Center and I got really upset about it and kind of. threw a fit I just felt like I had to be alone. And it's not about the phone grip and it's just whenever I end up. With drawing I just like it's not about the thing I just kind of emotionally withdrawn i'm not there. And she's realized that too. And I don't know. I don't know."
748.0,Provider,Is it that you get agitated and have to stop.
14972.0,Patient,i'm.
748.0,Provider,"In other words, can you can you sense what's happening in your body."
14972.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like a lot of the times yeah. And a lot of it is like when i'm getting overwhelmed it's like a lot of. Body emotions I guess that's what emotions are and if it's too much I start. Shutting down because I don't know how to fix it. i'm just sitting here feeling a lot and then. I don't know. I guess agitation, is one that. is more difficult for me to deal with because I feel like it usually comes up in situations where I don't do something to my own standards, and so I get agitated with myself, and then I feel like there's not something to do to fix it like there's no way to. To like I just have to feel it it's not going to go away and if I try to think about it more or talk about it more I end up getting more upset because i'm feeling it more. Whereas if I feel like it fits just passes then it's fine, but then I feel like that's not necessarily healthy. Like not like kind of ignoring it, so I."
748.0,Provider,"Well, big ones like what you're really doing is waiting till it gets buried. Right like it, because what i'm hearing is the next time something similar happens you're not just experiencing nat event but all the other events from the past and what I really here is perfectionism. Spencer think Spencer needs to be perfect. Spencer needs to Center the phone REP perfectly the first time it's not okay to not have it work, the first time, and so, when it doesn't the reaction is bigger than a phone. it's it's like you know the phone where it's been everything else you've ever done wrong according to your judgment your whole life. it's an indictment of yourself that's the word that. you find yourself guilty you you, you know you charged yourself with the crime, you find yourself guilty and new sentence yourself to isolation."
14972.0,Patient,I feel like that's accurate I don't.
748.0,Provider,Get amnesia. And then you get to come out and play again until you Fuck up sorry for the language but that's what i'm hearing you do to yourself.
14972.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
748.0,Provider,"As opposed to Spencer gets to be human just like other people. and i'm just going to take a really wild guess here that, if the phone grip doesn't get up put on perfectly the first time. No one's going to show up at your door and a rescue problem I could be wrong, but i'm thinking that it's it's. it's likely Okay, the only person ambition okay."
14972.0,Patient,yep.
748.0,Provider,So.
14972.0,Patient,I don't know how to change that but yes.
748.0,Provider,"yeah and so how we change those things is one. Second, at a time, and it is you know the the term that gets that that resonates for me, even though it can sound triton cliched is re parenting you never got loving parenting. No one ever told you, I don't think I mean I was unfair i'm not psychic but it's what I hear from things you've described, no one ever told you that the way that you learn is by making mistakes and that that's not only Okay, but it's normal and necessary. And that makes you human and just as lovable as you were five seconds ago no one ever told you that, because you raised yourself. Yes. And then you raise your kids at six. And had so much responsible."
14972.0,Patient,I guess that's something to think about.
748.0,Provider,"Does it feel accurate, or does it feel like i'm full of it."
14972.0,Patient,"i'm not sure I feel like that's something i'll have to sit with to think about because. I it's not wrong um. I also feel like it's something that. i've had to tell myself and my brother and my sister plenty of times. At the same time that doesn't mean that I incorporated it yeah. So I feel like it's just something I have to think about more and it's important to remind myself of and. Maybe. That I. told myself that I do when I stopped practicing it, so I."
748.0,Provider,fiance say that she see you being hard on yourself.
14972.0,Patient,"yeah. And she doesn't like it and she's very, very nice and very kind and very gentle. And I feel like that's part of why. I withdraw maybe i'm, especially when i'm feeling that way I get kind of agitated if I feel like i'm being reassured because i'm not looking for reassurance i'm looking. I guess I told myself that i'm looking to be better. But it and. I know that i'm just agitated or whatever i'm. annoyed i'm upset like i'm just in my feelings, one way or another, and I I kind of just think about that, and then I it's really hard for me to not feel a certain way when I feel like i'm getting. reassured when i'm feeling that way you know I and i'm grateful for the reassurance, and I do need it. And that also makes it more difficult. That I. am getting upset when it's what I need and I don't know what I would do without it, so I don't know."
748.0,Provider,"yeah but I hear you that when you're in your feelings, you also need it to just be okay that you're."
14972.0,Patient,yeah I guess.
748.0,Provider,"And not here what you should do different. Including being nicer to yourself, like that that may need to come later. Because you've got a process through the moment I mean that's what I just turned to set. And that's about that's about asking for respect which is really good."
14972.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,Sir anything else that you'd like to. Share or say before we finished for the day anything you'd like to focus on for the next unit feels pretty clear that the biggest thing you have in front of us making that decision.
14972.0,Patient,yeah I think that's the biggest thing I can't think of anything else to really talk about I feel like we've talked about a lot.
748.0,Provider,"So you know I know now pressure, no rules, no nothing i'm guessing our next session will be somewhere around the 22nd so. I will look forward to hearing the choice that you come to for yourself, knowing that it will be the wise one for you and. And i'll look forward to seeing you soon."
14972.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you good luck with your mirror and have a good rest of your day."
748.0,Provider,I promise I will take good good good here.
14972.0,Patient,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
