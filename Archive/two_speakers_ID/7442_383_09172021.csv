7442.0,Patient,i'm great how are you.
383.0,Provider,Good thanks you have a puppy on your belly.
7442.0,Patient,or any any big one.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, look at that. wow."
7442.0,Patient,"His name is Jasper, we rescued him a few weeks ago, he was dumped in our town. And so i've been able to rescue him back to health. Because using really bad condition before. And he just fits in perfectly here."
383.0,Provider,"talked about him and grew but I had, I mean there was no idea was such a. sizable dog."
7442.0,Patient,No yeah yeah. he's a big guy. Like there's the other dog that we have this year. But. compared.
383.0,Provider,Right so did they have. Any problems getting along if you might be getting along famously.
7442.0,Patient,Now yeah he's This is like the sweetest dog in the world i'm so just shocked on like. Just one if he was so abused or neglected that he doesn't have more issues like socially with other dogs are people but it's just such a sweet dog that if he was like this before I don't know why that ever even would have happened.
383.0,Provider,"Sometimes, its economic situations that people just they can run into some real problems, and they have to you know leave their home and they just don't have the."
7442.0,Patient,"Resources, I mean your nose I know there's definitely a lot of other people that. didn't grow up with animals and thinking of them, as you know, like part of the family type of thing, and they do just like leave them behind in their abandoned house or wherever they don't rent anymore. Who knows what and just let it go but yeah he only had like a week or so left to live it seemed like if he was in that same condition. And it. was something where he must have been like that, for at least a year, if not more, before he was actually dumped so it's."
383.0,Provider,Did he. Did you get him at a shelter.
7442.0,Patient,"Know like he it was just within the like little town that i'm in now the lost and found pets kind of one of those Facebook pages and he was just dumped in the middle of the day, and like in the alleyway between like where the. Between roads, where garbage cans go, so he was just dumped there and, obviously, mainly because he's so big it's not like a dog that would have been able to wander there and been found at noon, without being seen between eight to 12 basically. It was like 105 that day too so it's crazy hot."
383.0,Provider,"Well, what a what a. lovely companion. My goodness he looks pretty young like."
7442.0,Patient,"Yours yeah they think it oldest maybe like three or maybe five if they're trying to give him an older age it's just so hard to tell if he's like this full grown and young or this full grown and older. And then obviously it depends on the diet, because the vets go off of their teeth to check the age, so if he had a good diet he'd be older with bad teeth kind of thing, but if you had a bad diet, he could be younger with bad teeth. So kind of still up in the air on that age, but I think he's pretty I think he's more on the younger side than the older side because he's good with dogs, cats kids. yeah everything."
383.0,Provider,"Well, what a great find actually."
7442.0,Patient,Here that i'm only one of those I don't know who's more lucky kind of thing humorous.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness that's such it so you are your kids enjoying spending time with them to."
7442.0,Patient,"mm hmm, especially now that they've been we're able to tell them that we're able to keep him because I was the one thing is after finding you know stray dog, you have those two weeks of notifying shelters and such for the owners to be able to find them. But it's been about four weeks now so with him so we're able to tell the kids like now we're keeping him and they're like what really is ours. there's just as much."
383.0,Provider,If they check him for chip. yeah.
7442.0,Patient,He didn't have anything.
383.0,Provider,"Which is crazy, because if it's the same he's a Saint Bernard."
7442.0,Patient,"So that's like a pure breed for sure, and those are usually pretty expensive puppies."
383.0,Provider,A neutered or a boy a girl.
7442.0,Patient,he's a boys neutered when we found him so who knows it's just a up in the air and speculated all sorts of stories.
383.0,Provider,Right right well how are you doing.
7442.0,Patient,"i'm i'm doing okay we've had a lot of socializing the last week or so. And it has been nice but it's also been hard. mm hmm because it kind of seemed like so like the first few weeks of moving in here with I moved in with my boyfriend and the first few weeks were hard, because it was just. Like just going back into like working on my trauma and stuff you know it was like with my abusive relationship, the last like choice I made that was a bad one, basically, was to move in. So I. Just."
383.0,Provider,need to be because you had broken up with your boyfriend. I haven't seen you in a while so seems like together and you moved in together.
7442.0,Patient,that's what's hard with the one month appointment yeah what happens in one month that I can't explain everything in group.
383.0,Provider,"Well yeah for sure, like these kinds of things might not come, be able to be shared in group. So that's big that you've got back together and your relationship."
7442.0,Patient,"yeah um so it first It started with i'm like so we weren't together and then. I wouldn't we ended up talking like just talking to each other again that's when I found out that he was going to his own therapy that he started after a breakup. And that was kind of something that like I we talked about before, but I wasn't necessarily sure like. If he was going to go through with it or not, you know kind of one of those things that sucks when someone else is telling you to go to therapy and then they're just doing it to like a P zero most and just get it over with but they're not really there for it."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
7442.0,Patient,"And then, it was after we broke up and I didn't know that he actually did go but he's started it all on his own and then has continued with it too. And then just a lot of our talks since have been very good and supportive on both of our cases so. In the longest story short. I was a those were kind of pretty much some big spots big reasons why we're together now."
383.0,Provider,"Well, to take that to a place of moving in together was kind of was. You kind of took a pretty. yeah I know you've been together."
7442.0,Patient,"With that, too, though there was part of it was like a few things because I wasn't in a rush on us moving in together, but we, it seemed almost, though, like our issues were more heightened because we were apart and he always had to go back home in, then I was always back there. And then that just like all that kind of little dead space time you know just made my overthinking even harder to really kind of handle. And then, it was harder on us in general, because we had the conversations you know, like Why do I have to keep explaining this and I just have to be. Like I was still worried because it's just like one of those like I don't know what are you doing, are you really in bed, are you really asleep, as someone else over there, did you just not want to like be here. But then the times, he would try to come over and we had to have like long talks. It would be hard on him because he'd still have to go to work so it's still have to go home to go take care of things after hanging out with us to just talk to me. And then on so like it was something where it seemed like it was going to benefit us and a few ways as well, as you know, my kids are all about it but. The big thing that kind of pushed it for me was the fact that one of my friends, the one that was pregnant that i've helped her with a lot of stuff and she's like her, and I have just become closer. I let her move into mild place so she was able to also like I was helping her get out of her bad situation. And she was able to take over my place and then I moved in here. On also like on the agreement that me and her gonna kind of tag team, the single mom babysitting while working type of. Business you know of i'll watch your kids will you work your watch mine, while I work in because that's still pretty much even if she's in a relationship when i'm in a relationship. When they're all it like the geyser work it's still pretty much that single mom type of life of how do you make appointments and go to work on your own with kids and school and all that. So it was that and then also with her having. With her being at my place I didn't lose my. Little I guess like kind of security and independence of having my own spot so if him and I don't work out or say that. Like we just jump too fast into this and we start butting heads for six months instead of getting better for six months. That, I would still have my place that i'd be able to go to because i've talked to her about that to like you know hey like feminine I don't work out that means i'm going to be here i'm coming right back in."
383.0,Provider,I just didn't.
7442.0,Patient,"want to that was hard for me to be able to move in and be like Well, this is his house and if we don't break up or we do break up i'm going to be on my own with two kids now and he's just going to be chill like i'm gonna be the one that's in the harder position so it's. It was helpful to be able to make the move with my friend, helping in that way too."
383.0,Provider,"I see okay all right, that makes sense, I just want to quickly just ask a quick question about your group frequency taking a little detour for a moment just because I see your chart. and"
7442.0,Patient,"I tried to go yesterday, but like I said, with the moment it like it was like what six o'clock I was in the middle of doing the surveys. And then someone just showed up and came over and they were like I just broke up with my girlfriend how are you guys, can I hang out like and then by the time I got back to like oh man I forgot about my surveys, let me finish them, it was already past that 615 time."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, are you is your intention to attend group weekly. Every week."
7442.0,Patient,"My yeah my attempt is i'm trying that. Okay, and i'm just started to try to get on myself to. Because I don't get any reminders anymore, I feel like I got reminders all the time in the beginning for my appointments and such. And it's like I don't get anything for the day of or the day before it's always like weeks away, or something because it's whenever I schedule it they send out the reminder right away. And i'm like that's fine, but if it's weeks away it's going to get lost I literally wake up to 40 to 50 emails every day. yeah."
383.0,Provider,We want to just get a calendar and. You know ball and just. write it on there.
7442.0,Patient,"i'm saying like finding the survey links and such you know i'm trying to make sure like i'm just digging through emails and. But I feel like because, with all the other therapies, I have, I always have reminders So this is the only one, I don't, and this is the one I struggle with the most to get to and that's the most common thing I see is."
383.0,Provider,"You know, when you when you do the patient satisfaction survey and write something down, maybe you might want to do that because yeah I don't have any money. No jurisdiction, I can mention it to my supervisor, you know, but if you can show something out in the patient satisfaction that you know you'd like more frequent reminders. that's just something I have no control over."
7442.0,Patient,"It really good shred bring it up, that the care navigation or nine time I checked in and stuff from like you guys send me something and they're like we'll just look back at your old emails and like that's obviously not working for me. Like I need something different, and I just know that reminders are helpful and I put up a bunch on my own like I have my phone that you have an event five minutes it's in 10 minutes it's an. But the fact of like something else just catches me off guard in the middle of it, I don't know why but it's easier for me to blow off my phone notification kind of thing then it oh yeah no I got an email, I have to go, like, I have a text message i'm supposed to go oh hi."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well we. tend to prioritize things in our own way and finding a system that works for you. I know that you know usability in terms of. Some a platform, you know that's a whole thing in itself, you know some platforms are more usability friendly than others and. that's based on design and and something I have no control over whatsoever, but um if you, you know I know what I do to try to keep things track of stuff and that's having a hand written calendar, where I just literally write stuff down."
7442.0,Patient,"I was, I wonder. what's your advice when it comes to. Trying I don't know when you know that you have your therapy that you're supposed to go or an appointment, or something, but then people show up and people are here that's when I have a hard time like. Because I feel I don't know if it's because of my. Like lack of close relationships or just how I view them like I feel like I need to. Like it's really rude if I was to ignore them and go into the room for an hour kind of thing."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think you're onto something that maybe because your life your appointments. Are are a priority. And, but if you don't try or a ties them, and you have prioritize someone that's coming in dropping in as a friend and you lean into that. that's that may be due to your you know, an attack an attachment issue from your childhood feeling like you didn't have a lot of social connection so now when social connections are coming into your life, you really you know you're craving."
7442.0,Patient,"So, and I think a big part of it, too, is that since i'm. Here at his house we with our relationship, a lot of there was a lot of support in the beginning, but this year and this month are like these few months. Basically, every I can do we just went through the very typical the relationship was really shitty in the beginning, because I was cheated on and he was fucking around, but then. He was telling his friends that he was such a good person and hiding what he was doing from them and so all his friends thinks that i'm just like this crazy toxic person and a nowhere. And he's just been really good so then after like our breakup and us getting back together they're trying to tell him like dude Come on, why are you doing that. And this is a big reason why we are so together is because of the fact that he started to actually own up and acknowledge what he has done. In our past and admit it to his friends and everyone like no that's not the case, I was cheating on her this year I did this, this year, like. She broke up with me, for good reason kind of thing not at all issue this crazy person you guys are trying to say, if anything, I was the one that was bad that she shouldn't be with. But we've been having and it's gotten a bit better with some friends now but it definitely seemed like we're kind of like. Like I just have to defend myself left and right so and it's almost like when they come over they like or anybody comes over I really want to try to show you know, like get to know me kind of thing, because no one has tried to. And that's the only like in person moment that I have to try to you know, like just show who I am on like a fun side good side and not."
383.0,Provider,Because of their judgments based on their judgments of you.
7442.0,Patient,"um yeah and. they're only like it's there i'm. Like his big supportive like his friends and his group, and specifically even like his brother and then his parents to they're all saying that like i'm changing him and they don't like he's this different person blah blah blah and. Like it's just all nonsense because they're just holding on to it's almost kind of like they are projecting like his family, his and his friends are projecting their personal issues with him on to me."
383.0,Provider,"As the problem and because, like."
7442.0,Patient,"And so that's kind of been the issue is that i'm just aware of these arguments, but they don't bring them up to me, no one talks to me they're not around me. All of these only happen. When he goes to hang out with them and comes back and then tells me about it and so it's kind of like whenever there's any one of them come over it's like No, let me show you you're wrong. But also, I want to try to take it off of him because that's also a hard thing is that. He was just over there, trying to defend me when that wasn't even the conversation he wanted to have. But the simple example of what his friends thing because. fencing like i'm a super liberal."
383.0,Provider,yeah let's take a moment and. We let's see if we can address the other topic and complete that. Regarding the prioritization of your connecting with his friends and repairing some relationships to what you're saying before about prioritizing your appointments and your things.
7442.0,Patient,"yeah so I just think like there's. there's times when people come over and if it's either one of those people that I don't want them to judge me too harshly for walking away or it's either someone that I feel like I do kind of connect with and I want to build that stronger relationship or rapport with. And this is one of the few random times they're actually over here in nowhere it's like therapy is every week I it's always going to be there, but this person's not going to show up again at this time and no and."
383.0,Provider,"Right right but The thing is, if you paid let's say you had to be paying $100 you know, for that appointment that you made. And you are going to be out that hundred dollars, if you didn't show up. You would. You know, be you know you would want to. To honor your own commitment to yourself."
7442.0,Patient,"And, knowing that it was."
383.0,Provider,"Last to you and that person. would be in a second you know sort of second place with that relationship because you've made this commitment to yourself and you're investing into it in it. And so maybe consider that you know what whether it's brighter health or you know you're an appointment with. Some a vet for your horse or something like that you know that is yours is something you care about or something related to your dog could be really anything that's matters to you that's about your well being you know, are you putting that to the side to. To take this time with this person to try to prove something to them to so that they will accept you. Which is a slippery slope, you know because someone else's opinion about you, is sometimes like you were saying it's like it's not accurate. hmm and and yet you're putting all this effort into that. That, rather than putting effort into the thing that is something that is really important to you, and you know it. i'm saying."
7442.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it, it makes me think that there's like the two parts of my personality that tie into this as well. And the one of them is like the Fo mo you know so just the fear of missing out and so it's like it's fun, you know they're going to be over here, I can totally help them feel better. And I will get like I will feel better about myself being able to help somebody if they were over here and just in a bad mood and wanted to come over to like have us help them get through a breakup you know, like because that's what yesterday was."
383.0,Provider,"Right, the thing."
7442.0,Patient,"That I don't know something's going to happen so like I want to be out there and then not there's like. The people pleasing part of me where it's like do they need something I need to be that one to give it. Right like push my priorities aside. Because this person needs help, and I can help."
383.0,Provider,Right.
7442.0,Patient,"And, but they are even if it's just show social."
383.0,Provider,"yeah they are posing in that moment, you know. What yeah they're they're expecting you to bend your plans for the evening to attend to their needs. Rather than hey you know, maybe talking to your boyfriend and saying let's plan Friday night, you know, a dinner and a Barbecue or something like that and that's invite. You know these four people are these two people, so we can spend more time together and get to know each other. And planet, you know, so it works for your schedule so works for your life because you know you have kids you have responsibilities you've got stuff and you might want that event to be. You might want to kind of choreograph the event so it's like you've got some. Time and you've got some food and it's going to be an event that you also will be able to enjoy you."
7442.0,Patient,know.
383.0,Provider,"In a House that where you live. So that's also prioritizing your needs like well I kind of want my evening to I, like my socialization to kind of be like this, rather than just like drop in you know. me put my. Appointments aside run to kind of make it work for them. So i'm just encouraging you to prioritize your own needs, even if it's socialization like How would you like your social time to be you know, maybe you might like to have a picnic you know and meet online and. What does that How does that land on you those just those thoughts."
7442.0,Patient,"um well, I mean it makes me think that. I mean, as much as planning something would work it doesn't necessarily like I don't know there's only so many Fridays there's only so many Saturday kind of things. And, most of the things that came up this entire week or completely last minute like the whole just called in the morning by a friend hey do you guys want to come here for this. And no and then plan somewhere else for like they decided to just come back over and hang out afterwards, instead of like you know separating ways. I am one of my best friends actually she did something for herself That was really well and I feel like that actually might be a path because it seems similar what you were saying. But almost kind of like the opposite of like. What she's doing for herself is something I feel like would be helpful to seem similar what you were saying in the way they she turns off her phone on Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays. So that she doesn't have the social media or friends or other people taking up her weekends, she starts her weekends how she wants without those distractions. But during the week is when she goes, and she does things because she's already up and about and then. coming home from work. And the only other thing that she does is a certain bedtime that she sticks to. But now she also doesn't have kids so that like she definitely doesn't have as many things that change her schedule. Whereas I feel like that's kind of the difference with us is that it's like all right, we have this here, we have to do this, like this kid birthday party on the weekend my family didn't on that one so now when are we going to fit in our time and then that's why I stay up late."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, you might just want to. kind of notice a pattern is there a real last minute fly by night oh how about we do this now, and if that's just the consistent way it's consistent pattern now you're in your boyfriend's House could be a pattern of his social how he rolls you know socially."
7442.0,Patient,And he's more he's able to be more social than I am. So I will have my social energy tapped out Ray earlier that he will.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and that's important because you, you mentioned that and group, like you're kind of really tired from really social your social weekend and."
7442.0,Patient,you're kind of social weekend lead to a social week. Like the dog.
383.0,Provider,"And then there's the dog door double I. knew more about dog. Well we're going to need to wrap up. Sabrina because this is a 30 minute appointment, but. Hopefully, this discussion has been helpful just to kind."
7442.0,Patient,"Of it has, I mean it is some like It made me aware, you know I just need to look at it, at what we're doing here and then find a way to put in a boundary between the socializing and friends and then our time and my time. And that could be different for me than it is for him, you know, like I could. Tell him, like all right, I got three hours with whoever but then lay in the face stage here for six those other three URL you."
383.0,Provider,yeah so um it sounds good i'm glad you've got some awareness around that.
7442.0,Patient,"song keep an eye on it to try to figure keep an eye on on like our life and see what it is that I could try to wear that boundary is that I could fit it in if it'll work like my friend does are. doing no friends on the weekends just during the week or the other way around, or some no."
383.0,Provider,"yeah you can plan your life, according to what works for you and your kids so that you know you want to consider yourself and your and your kids needs as well, and how you know. how it works for you, you can choreograph your. connections in your own meeting your own social needs to. let's go ahead and schedule your appointment you're still seeing your trauma therapist. Yes, okay so that's."
7442.0,Patient,Every week on Friday.
383.0,Provider,Okay well that's. Excellent what time is your appointment with them.
7442.0,Patient,three to four.
383.0,Provider,Do you want an appointment around the. 18th of October that's a Monday or would you like a.

383.0,Provider,"And if you can you know check in 24 hours in advance. to your groups and also just those yeah the surveys, I know we're kind of time consuming but. You can start them."
7442.0,Patient,"With your Google just get distracted. that's the you know, think about this is where my ADHD ADHD struggles. yeah. I like the right doing the button soon the buttons in a way, and then all sudden my phone's closed and I forgot that I was in the middle of it."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, just doing one thing at a time. I just want to say that the old fashioned way of like writing stuff on a calendar. Sometimes helpful. And having it on your wall."
7442.0,Patient,"Yes, I like doing that there's you. scratched out days of the wild but yes trail the reminders I promise."
383.0,Provider,Okay well i'm glad you have a cuddly dog to spend time with.
7442.0,Patient,Thank you alright what's next to.
383.0,Provider,The thing you to Sabrina take care bye bye.
