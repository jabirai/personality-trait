And I said okay so Tuesdays are great I said, but the only day I can't do it is the next Tuesday the 25th at 11 because I have like a skin check and it's like six months out to even get the appointment, I try."
462.0,Provider,"Okay they're like I can't even put you at once a month. So you don't have to worry about it you've been in the program for a while, I mean there was just an issue with the Washington group and you've been going this long without it you're not receiving medication through us right."

462.0,Provider,"This coming Tuesday yeah that's fine i'll note that and. yeah, if you like, the group, you can come more otherwise. We can put it at once a month, especially because you're not receiving any men meds the big part of the group is getting refills and checking in and just making sure."

462.0,Provider,"it's you know it varies basically how it goes is each week i'll bring some type of a therapeutic topic like boundaries or attachment styles or. You know something, something it could be a very wide variety of things and. i'll present that at the beginning and give everyone maybe a little bit of time to kind of think about it journal about it a bit and then. We just check in one by one, so everyone will share a high from the past week, and a low from the past week and then their thoughts on the topic of the day."
9393.0,Patient,"Okay, I love it okay. sounds really wonderful actually. i'm actually super excited to be in a group, because I haven't been going to my a. writings because i'm just. Over that and that was trying to find you a women's group here and I so far kit or. I guess there might be one happening at some point but it's not now everything's right is all weird because oh. yeah oh my."
462.0,Provider,"God, I know it's hard it's hard. So they have anyway good and it's a great group of people. it's not fixed so sometimes new people will pop up there's no like we all started together it's kind of mixed like that, and again everyone just kind of goes through gets their chance to speak. If someone relates, you can speak up and say hey you know I hear what you're saying i'm experiencing something similar and it's just a nice place to hear what what other people are going through bounce ideas around and learn a new type of therapeutic topic."
9393.0,Patient,"You know I love that so much to this because I am so isolated, I mean like I mean i'm like especially so even just to hear for me not actually i'm not so excited for me to speak, I will, if I have to, but like i'm excited to listen to people. just see here, there were others are at like. Like yeah."
462.0,Provider,you're not alone that's for sure you know.
9393.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I mean the only interaction and really have as through like instagram and this and that and that's getting more and more weird as the days move on and I. think I was telling you that you know I got like found out right. But."
462.0,Provider,"instagram you mentioned that last time, then there was a lot of people popping up some some scam bots and everything."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah and so i'm still dealing with that, but i'm getting much i'm getting really good at blocking. And i'm good i'm getting really good at knowing who's not really interested in is and so it's actually been kind of cool because, even in my requests a look at them and if it's just hi hi i'm like delete. yeah but, if you like, your stuff or Thank you if it's some kind of more positive thing then i'll engage."
462.0,Provider,You know.
9393.0,Patient,"But then I don't engage that much and i've been setting boundaries you be proud of me. Someone reached out to me and I wasn't sure if it was a scam he actually looked like a real person. Okay, I love your this era he's like, would you be able to do it in gold and blue and i'm like Well, I can I said, but the hand painted ones take me, you know, a very long time and they're costly. I said, but you know, I do have all my entres available for immediate purchase on etsy and I said from the site so i've been kind of doing that, like like I already have these done let's wait. And I like that idea, you know go from there, but if he is a real guy he'll come back and if you really want that."
462.0,Provider,"very true okay well that's exciting you're starting to just learn how to respond to those in a I think we always talked about like having that kindness, but still being firm and setting boundaries."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's been really some days have been just awful. today's a better day like if I there was, like, I think it was like two or three days ago I mean I was just in tears, I was angry, I mean it was just it was to say the fan, I could manage it, I could barely self regulate. And so i've taken more time to just do what I need to do to to regulate you know, like water. uh huh reading a nice story. Doing breath work can be more meditation but yesterday I got a call that my mom had a heart attack and walgreens and she was air back over to like."
462.0,Provider,Oh no.
9393.0,Patient,"hospital and. And so I was just. One of those things like. Trying to call her and trying to figure out the doctors, it was like a lot, so I took I went out and took a walk. And I walked. To woods coffee and I got like a mocha and it cookie."
462.0,Provider,"Oh, good for you a little treat."
9393.0,Patient,"To get something i've been so good, like not spending any money not having sugar and that was like."
462.0,Provider,"Oh, my God, I need something you gotta have something."
9393.0,Patient,"Right yeah so, but then I felt ill for the day cookie mocha but um."
462.0,Provider,"Anyway, yeah okay so that's a lot in one day, as you described in but it sounds like like you said you know your coping skills and your self regulation skills and a big part of that is you know breath work, making sure you're."
9393.0,Patient,doing your meditation and.
462.0,Provider,"Your practice and then also just some of the basics Okay, we need to have a glass of water here right to make sure all the basics are covered, and then you just continuing to give yourself a treat here and there, and rest when needed."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah you know it's yes good anyway, it turned out that she actually is okay, they discharged from the hospital so it's. All strange to me but anyway so that's good that it sort of good that that happened because we. my sister and I both realized that like. She needs our numbers like she needs to know how to dial us from the House because we never got a call from her."
462.0,Provider,So anyway yeah.
9393.0,Patient,"kind of taught us a lot of how to maneuver through this um. and You know there's something that happened, which I wanted to talk to you about which I find kind of amusing in a way. Because it's like you know my mind like probably most people can always go to the negative side, and I have to really work with it, like my self critic is pretty active, you know, but I have to just keep sort of managing it every day, every moment pretty much and so. And it seems like I said the negative stuff like like like i'll get an email, like, for example, i'll just get an email from a client before I even read it i'm assuming that I did something wrong in this email like it's just my own. How I go with this."
462.0,Provider,client that was very angry last time.
9393.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah and they're still not getting their way because of no fault of anyone's you know, but they are. it's been a lot so, but you know in on all the emails always just it's always this pushing I want this I want this, you know so it's I mean there's never an email that comes through that's like oh my God Thank you so much. Never. yeah, this is not how. So, so I did get an email like a couple weeks ago from a guy who contacted me through my website and said oh we're building a new house. we'd really like to talk to you about it, so we arranged to talk about it, and that was like that was last week, and so I talked to him in his wife on the phone not zoom but just talking. And it sounded really good actually invented really wonderful. Because what he said was he's like you know. he's like i've hired a lead nice attorney i've hired landscape architect i've hired i'm going to hire an interior designer I have a biologist on site and getting the survey done and i'm just sitting there like like. They all put that on me and I have to. write at least i'll hire the people or figure it out. Like Jen i've seen your website and I just want you to do architecture just do what you do best. And I was like talked about last time was setting boundaries of."
462.0,Provider,"This is your job, and that is not so that's something."
9393.0,Patient,"I was so amazed. I couldn't like I get the email, you know, the net not even 25 hours later it's like joy and I really want to work with you, this would be great, and I mean I was just you know are because this doesn't happen, but it did happen. It because it happened actually it put me like. Like I. Like almost didn't believe it like i'm just shocked. That this actually is a good way like coming at this in a great way like a foundational way, and this is possible, but like I think i've just never had this before. So you. A kicker. And I said I said, you know I charge, you know $125 an hour and i'll give you an estimate so i've done a project very similar to this recently, and it was about 18,000 in total, I said, but you know. yeah, so I think that's what I said and then, when he comes back he's like let's just let's just say it's like an estimated 20,000 you know go from there, like, I mean you want to leave it up charge a little bit like. Sure let's make it 20,000."
462.0,Provider,"All right, well look at you yeah so that was. You know, it sounds like and sometimes when you start to put thought towards some things and energy and effort like you have been. towards boundaries and then even just the concept of hey people are having me do work that's not my work or mad at you for stuff that's not within your job circle right you're living in here and they're mad at you for something over there. And you start to think about that set boundaries, you know, sometimes things just start to come together."
9393.0,Patient,"You know it's true, I mean, I do believe in the law of attraction That was something."
462.0,Provider,That you do believe in that.
9393.0,Patient,"But you know it yet right we just talked about it that it actually happened, but I sat back and going. Like in a way, I should feel good about it, and I do, but there was a part of me that almost didn't believe it because it was so foreign right and never."
462.0,Provider,it's never happened before I actually used to.
9393.0,Patient,"This way for the past 25 years so i've been embracing this new way of like change and boundaries and setting things so it's it's it's great i'm still in super high anxiety, though all. isn't that I find that interesting like this is actually going well and now i'm super anxious of having to perform is my one job. laughing at myself like. Like oh yeah they actually want me to just do what I do, I was like. i'm actually. excited contract i'm super stressed so. it's crazy I know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well that's a lot of follow up on what we talked about last time, but it mostly positive and just, then you managing your own kind of personal stress and like you said that inner self critic."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah and the inner just the anxious like. Like I like i'm almost looking for the problem in it like i'm looking for. Like the threat in it, like in a way, like it's so. Because i'm yeah it's it's a it's a wonderful thing I do feel like I said elevated to a next level of of boundary making."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's such a. Such a good statement your elevated to the next level of boundary making and you are it's been a lot of practice and even just starting really small you know, like with that woman months ago, and with the man who blew you off and yeah."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah and then with the clients and then and then wait what was something else that have. This week's been just crazy my son hasn't. been to school back he's still he's I you know, I was thinking tomorrow and then too so none of his friends are in school is social. Worker so. Part of me was like what if you went to school today he's like well i'd be alone so to get lunch and. he's like I can do my work from home and."
462.0,Provider,"really feel for the kids and teens. These days, it's tough."
9393.0,Patient,"So. Then I get an email from my ex yesterday, and he was. Laying because he's getting the absence, you know from the schools he's like is there anything I should know, and I was just like hey i'm just making decisions, day by day, through this coven surge of like I mean I didn't even know what to say. So what I said, like I just don't I just don't know it's not is so not easy, like there are a bunch of kids going to school, but they're they're getting pokemon. Go."
462.0,Provider,And then there's a lot of teachers. who are unable to teach because they are spreading around so much Is he able to do virtual stuff.
9393.0,Patient,"Oh yeah everything's on computer so he's able to do all his work, the only thing you'd miss if there's some in class, you know something but. I know part of me is like hey as long as you during your work, you know. It also."
462.0,Provider,keeps both of you healthy.
9393.0,Patient,"I know I mean I basically told the school he'll be out for the rest of the week so so i'm gonna he's gonna go to my ex usually we do it on Sundays, the switch but it's going to be tomorrow after after school. Because he actually had him for almost three weeks because they couldn't get them back from Hawaii so he's gonna have him for a week and then he'll come back to me for two weeks so we're gonna so i'll have a week to to kind of."
462.0,Provider,decompress a bit yeah.
9393.0,Patient,The be really nice actually because. it's been hard to get. stuff done not possible he's actually really good kid but.
462.0,Provider,"yeah it is tough, though, when you're both home all the time it's. A lot it's a lot of togetherness, and again it's kind of all on you in that it's just an awful lot and then was there any follow up on the braces."
9393.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, so this is what I would say thank you um So yes, this is really interesting so remember I had put that boundary out about January."
462.0,Provider,yep yep.
9393.0,Patient,"So it was Ontario 11 that I got a ding on my phone from then mo and it was from his girlfriend. paid me. amount, so you know I like."
462.0,Provider,"You yeah well that's a result of your boundary you set a date and you said, this is it and it happened."
9393.0,Patient,"yep yep so you know what I mean she's a mom she's got kids I mean part of me is like this is so yeah I was very thankful, and I. know that was great to have the option and then load do a little. heart like so I did my heart."
462.0,Provider,"Good. You know it's good to be yeah civil and again, always be kind in the process of setting boundaries, and I know that's not an easy relationship for you, with what happened but. You did what you needed to do on your end to set boundaries, to have the fair financial breakdown of this big cost for your son and boom and happened. It was like she means business."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah you know i'm so glad because it that all it's all worked out that's all work I didn't have to go through the courts, I didn't have to."
462.0,Provider,"That was that's such a relief, it is. And it just shows how much of a difference, communication and boundaries can make you know when really focused on."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah so and that was actually really important lesson for me to to set that date and you're, the ones who suggested that because, otherwise, it was just too loose right like pay me when like. right we helped. So."
462.0,Provider,"yeah you gave a very reasonable time frame enough time to be able to kind of think about it get it together on his end and then. After that, as you said, okay it's time to go through the courts which stinks right Obviously nobody wants to do that, but you didn't have to because you were very clear."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah so anyway i'm super thankful, and I, like her, now, so you know I can."
462.0,Provider,"I can do that yeah. that's a sign it's a sign of. respect you know at minimum, which is good."
9393.0,Patient,"You know, it is, it is so yeah yeah or or fear not sure. Because I mean there was a part of me right, that could have gone out and he wouldn't I mean, eventually, he would have gotten big trouble right for following the degree so. Right, I think it's all it's all been good for everyone, but."
462.0,Provider,"yeah very, very good work to you, this has been an overarching you know long term goal with many, many short term goals in between so."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah it's really quite interesting I mean I had I gotta say yesterday was actually the day before this such a shitty day I was also going to get my period, which I always know. But like you know just so emotional and the world's coming down on me and everything's wrong, and you know I went through that. Because I can look at any aspect of it and say it's not working out right it, but then like I can also do and I just did. Right and. Looking over it was that are doing well, so. I am. It definitely helps me to stay in the wellstone."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's an important thing to do when you notice yourself going. down, but everything that's wrong start to again reframe well okay here's the things that are right."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah well you know I couldn't do that in the moment it was only until pretty much this morning is a shift. That happened so but in those moments, you know what I just was like Okay, this is how i'm feeling and I just keep doing more like oh God, I made sure I did rock work every day because that relaxes me. yeah so it's i'm realizing how to sort of manage my state and then i'm kind of nuts, most of the time, but I always have like. me like like, no one has to know how nuts, it is right, like, I can just manage it. Because you know, like in my conversations I know i'm I know i'm good with my clients, I know, like how I do outwardly is very different, as long as I can you know, keep that. filter. right away right. Because I know that that stuff in these just it's a lot of it's not true, is what i'm realizing to. So, and why the storyline keeps going that's not true that's like really self critical that shaming that's like super negative."
462.0,Provider,yeah the.
9393.0,Patient,it's upsetting to me. Because.
462.0,Provider,Understand I will.
9393.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,I can think i'm been.
9393.0,Patient,"You know I could think of like a girl who I really I really liked her and she's sweet, but my when I first think of her it's negative stuff that's like, why does that come up I don't actually think of those things I. Do I, like you know, like an A. it's so that's kind of weird to me."
462.0,Provider,"it's. it's not though this is common for a lot of people it's just really conditioning, you know, like training a muscle your muscles been trained to kind of go in that direction and. it's just important to remember the little phrase thoughts are not facts, so you can start by just knowing this isn't fact this is just what's coming up and tried to start reframing in the moment or. yeah at the end of the day, at least writing down, you know, maybe it was a thought you had about someone and then a reframe thought reframe."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah So do you think reframing is also like opposite of because it almost feels like that, like if, like, for example, if I if I think oh valerie's. You know I don't like her, because she acts super jealous would that actually be because we're not what i'm hearing is it's actually my jealousy projecting onto her."
462.0,Provider,"It is often it's not always production but yeah, it is often projection and that's really. You have a lot of awareness, to be able to recognize that it's projection right. Because oftentimes when those things come up you might wonder well what am I upset about here well i'm actually the jealous wonder. i'm upset that this person can act so freely, even though right now i'm it feels like they're just being obnoxious I wish I could you know live freely like them and be obnoxious and not care or something like that so yeah. yeah it can often be a total production."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely you know this, and this is going to sound kind of well, maybe funny but i'm realizing it's. Part of the creativity, I guess is the. Usually in the mornings on every morning, maybe, like every. Maybe twice a week three times a week, you know i'll do a post on my my condo by design site, because that site it's I only post things that are uplifting. You know, and when I write because i'm ready for my heart in the morning, you know it'll be like maybe after meditation or before meditation it's my special time and this morning, I wrote one on Saraswati. You know, and I just a little bit you know just. Not too likely and but it uplifts me when I write that and get that out there. and it's actually been kind of therapeutic on my end to."
462.0,Provider,"That absolutely. Is a little bit of writing and sharing with no intention to have be paid for it, or have to do it for work, you know there's something very therapeutic about that, where it's just purely for your own enjoyment and maybe even a little bit of service for others."
9393.0,Patient,yeah well and I should be honest that it's also I do want people to see the ultras and by the end if they feel that they know better.
462.0,Provider,"right, of course, so and that's really low. Interest, but further and the writing can help with that, but ultimately the writing is just like you said it's comes after your special time in the morning and it's something you enjoy."
9393.0,Patient,"It is it is so that's been helping, but I think one of the reasons I wrote us Ross wiki this morning because I felt like that opening because you know Saraswati is words so power words. And so words the words we tell ourselves first and foremost, not even, not even the words that we say outward but like what i'm thinking of myself when i'm with myself. You know and i'm noticing that more especially that inner critic and how actually how. Just demeaning it is and why and where that comes from and how I can stop it and i'm realizing i'm not sure I can stop it, I think it just does its thing and then just maybe, knowing that it's like a bad roommate like it'll just."
462.0,Provider,"Separate separating yourself from it, too, is a good thing. Again, like seeing it as a. Bad roommate or just a separate part but not you."
9393.0,Patient,yeah yeah who you are yeah.
462.0,Provider,"This was this came up last time, just as one of your goals is kind of working on self affirmations and the way your father had kind of put you down as a disappointment, often and that's probably where a lot of this self criticism that you're describing stems from."
9393.0,Patient,"i'm sure, almost all of it does yeah so I mean like yeah a lot of it and and try to. Yet recognize that I mean. i'm not sure really what to do with that exactly, although I know it just comes from conditioning like. No."
462.0,Provider,"conditioning and the brain can be trained to be rewired and that comes by just consistency daily practice a lot of thought reframing journaling. Through separating yourself from it, you know, recognizing thoughts are not facts recognizing you are not your thoughts."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah that's the big one. it's funny too, because I can I read you know I read a lot of really actually i'm reading currently I read at least two or three things with the Tyson one i'm reading the. Really, a. biography it's written it's called the great swan you might know of it it's. Oh, oh my gosh it's so powerful it's um basically devotees journey with Rama Krishna."
462.0,Provider,Oh wow okay.
9393.0,Patient,"It is. emotional and so amazing in so of lifting I mean it is just like it's it's ecstatic love like and how they write about it, so I, and I can only read one chapter little chapter night. It is like. To lot to have that let's super uplifted and then I. get it with Dr butler's. Oh such an amazing man he died, only two three years ago, or so, but he would. His wife actually does this now, but every like a couple months I get like his writings that he gives and they're just little bits but it's about basically the power of now, the power of the present moment."
462.0,Provider,Right yeah.
9393.0,Patient,So super uplifting again and just little nuggets like I found a lot of reading but um but that's all what you're talking about that reframing.
462.0,Provider,that's. that's exactly what it is. A big part of it is just starting to catch it. And one technique that I mean that we use in therapy and psychology is is affirmations but I mean it's also traditional and yoga to use montrose and. there's a nutty nutty nutty monitor have you heard that one.
9393.0,Patient,I share do yeah not.
462.0,Provider,"That crazy yes right every time those thought comes up nutty I am not this thought. That see i'm not the thought thinking, the spot that T i'm not thought yeah you're you're beyond. All of those. Things and this these thoughts don't define you and these thoughts are not facts right so it's maybe you start using that mantra when you feel that jealous thought towards a woman come up nutty nutty nutty or, if you have another. affirmation or mantra that helps you but that one just came to mind for me and."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah no I love that one. I know I have so many mentors, and I mean I have. You know the one that was the main one initiate to me that you probably know, own the machine. yeah I use that. To me like if you were to cut me open you'd probably find open the mouth sheila like it just in my blood, because I say it all the time. And I don't just say it consciously i'd say I think it's unconscious in me to do this only."
462.0,Provider,Enough yeah which is really good.
9393.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,Good Practice quite a bit.
9393.0,Patient,"yeah that one has become like the home base like actually when I was in the hospital that one was repeating throughout my whole body. and actually was kind of funny because I was is when maybe like they to the hospital and I was so weak and so, as I said that I was just in on the machine, I was in this stream of ownership and the doctor came in I couldn't see him because I was, I was a wreck. But he thought on any sort of like took my hand. And I sort of started coming through, and all I could say was owned a machine, all I could even."
462.0,Provider,Like what.
9393.0,Patient,The beautiful part when I finally like could see he was an Indian.
462.0,Provider,"Oh, how beautiful okay that's really cool."
9393.0,Patient,That was yeah that was like oh that was so great so yeah yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have a strong practice with affirmations and mantras already so maybe you try to attach it now to your thoughts."
9393.0,Patient,yeah I think that's the place to work. And so. If I look at yoga is where it's the witness it's got. moving back right. we're seeing my this this negative negative so. Negative I get objectify it. yep right.
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah you can start to witness it start to gain awareness around it, and that leads to change right and a big part of that gaining awareness and reframing can be the mantra right you notice I just thought that you know this person X jealous oh no mushy by our nutty nutty nutty."
9393.0,Patient,"Oh, combining them I like that."
462.0,Provider,"or yeah or combining them yeah without you know, whatever you start to connect to the most and think will start to stick, but you know it just takes practice and it takes witnessing like you said and. Then paying attention to those projections and seeing what am I so bothered about by the these other people or by mice so."
9393.0,Patient,"You know I criticize myself so much. I know what it is, I know it's it there's an object, with as a part of self worth in there. Because you know I there's a part of me that right 50 years old of like professional like you know super smart person, but like I look at someone that people, and I mean they're really living well. Like you know, like it's hurtful like I. And so, but I also realized this isn't forever right, like, I do have a idea that when they will own House again. will be able to have a dog or cat like just little things you know. Right um but you know I see some of them are really nice clothes and i'm just thinking like how do they even do with. It some of them don't work great they. Do yoga all day. To not. Do yoga all day like. I think I think would be really happy."
462.0,Provider,"I hear you and I can even catch that in myself, because I would also love to not work and do yoga all day, but then you have to see that. You know everybody's path and purpose is different. And also, we don't know what's really going on there could be mass credit card debt, there could be you know they don't know they don't have enough money for food really we don't know and so making. Those judgments. Just comes from, as you said, own self worth issues and insecurities."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's so it's been I go down the rabbit hole when I start comparing. When I started, seeing it, you know and. yeah so. I mean you know general things actually are going well you know it looks like I have i'll sign on to a new job. You know, which will start in a couple months. You know, so I have work here, and I get to beautiful heartfelt reviews for my altar work this week that we're totally."
462.0,Provider,Unexpected good.
9393.0,Patient,"Like I didn't even ask for them, so you know that was it is nice to get letters of appreciation like it, especially because I was so down this week, so that, because I, I really truly hope that these youngsters are a benefit, you know and. Right and sometimes I mean there was a point this week, I was like i'm just gonna stop selling them this is like i'm just getting robot calls and like just I was just so annoyed with."
462.0,Provider,ready to quit.
9393.0,Patient,"In the funny here's the other I know i've been jealous i'll tell you this, then I got really mad because the one person that I really wanted to see my artwork. didn't even like it or look or like us on instagram right, but like say that he's supposed to look maybe he's busy maybe he doesn't get me like what does it matter that I attached so much emotion to this, but then my head goes Oh, he doesn't put my work."
462.0,Provider,"I mean, I was off to the races right. Right. trying not to make assumptions and other. thing to principle to keep in mind right, I mean you don't know what happened with them, it could be."
9393.0,Patient,"So many things you know, and I think there's a part of me that really would like to date, like maybe when springtime or but I don't even know how to go about it. it's almost too scary to like think about."
462.0,Provider,"That would be a really big step we. We kind of talked about that ones that you're just not quite ready yet, but also feel. That you want it to happen sometime."
9393.0,Patient,"I mean like to me I think of like when spring comes to have like a friend, just to get to know someone awesome. Like and go like have a coffee or go for a walk or like."
462.0,Provider,My life.
9393.0,Patient,"Like I didn't have to be like. crazy, you know. he's really nice."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well that can be something you start to maybe just start to think about it doesn't have to be you're making any moves on it, yet, but is there an online dating site is there a community that you could meet. Someone yeah."
9393.0,Patient,"I mean I just I see my friends like swipe right swipe right like what kind of world is this, I mean maybe maybe I maybe there's some good stories out there of people meeting on maybe there are some different websites that are like. better than others I you know I don't know."
462.0,Provider,yeah i'd say there are definitely some are better than others more serious and. yeah so it would be something to kind of proceed forward with mindfully.
9393.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we'll see I mean right now, obviously we're all in the concert and life is weird and. yeah it is, but like you said, someone awesome where you could just get together and it could be a slow process."
462.0,Provider,Just something you can start to reflect on as maybe like a longer term goal just trying to date or trying something.
9393.0,Patient,"yeah I I feel like that I feel like that. become a nice I feel like this year as it's you know I didn't set any like intentions necessarily resolutions or anything like that just didn't. want to see how this year's unfolding, and what I what I do feel that started to happen is, I want to do things differently, I want to do friends. New and I, and with this sort of boundary where like just because I did something last year doesn't mean, I have to continue with this year, like. I think it's true yeah I think it's refreshing. So i'm kind of looking at that newly and seeing where where's that coming from in me like is that at a growth like do I feel like I just do the same thing i'll be you know, doing the same thing, like not really growing and. Like like, for example, that meditation group I was in all the last year, you know it got kind of cookie a group thing it was zooming but right."
462.0,Provider,That was part of that girl and.
9393.0,Patient,"Part of me is like. yeah I don't think I wanted to I don't know if they'll do the same thing this year. We don't know yet, but part of me is like I don't think I need to get done ball, I want to find something different."
462.0,Provider,"For you, I can you know that's evil. it's important to evaluate how you're spending your time and what benefit it's getting back to you it's very easy to just start coasting and not really reflect on you know where the benefits are."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah exactly exactly and like what could benefit me more You know, as I change and grow so."
462.0,Provider,"Right now that's really good reflections and I actually think sometimes setting resolutions it's good and it's important but, as you said, sometimes it's also good to just see kind of what comes and start to just move things around based on that."
9393.0,Patient,yeah I like that it's a little more fluid. And I think so long as I just. Do it with. The right intention and. yeah I should be fine you know so. yeah. yeah it's it's feeling pretty good actually.
462.0,Provider,And how has your just overall health and.
9393.0,Patient,"well. You know, been weird with the overcrowded surgery, I mean I haven't done any kind of exercise i'm gonna find my son here like sometimes I can have like a dance party, but not with him here. So it's you know a little weird like trying to make decent healthy meals, you know, but like it's a little tricky right now but next week, when I don't have them. I would love to find like it used stationary bike or I don't know something I could just like get on sweat like I think it would help me."
462.0,Provider,So there could be some. valid think about if there's a use. type of equipment out there and yeah. Again fusions still. Kicking in as they're supposed to be.
9393.0,Patient,"You know, I think, so I think I just I haven't been eating the best this week, and so I definitely have felt my body will also I was really stressed with overcrowd not sure the school and I think it my day was it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible. I also had that cookie which was. Like everything in it, and it was so that didn't go over so well so um. But they're better care of myself this week. Starting soon. But i'm gonna try to make a healthy meal tonight I did buy rice and chicken and broccoli and stuff so it can. Because I think good for me and my son."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, it seems like overall things are going really well and that boundary stuff really kicked in with your the father of your son and the braces the architecture work and defining what your job is versus what's not that's amazing."
9393.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,And then just kind of in relation to what we talked about and with your higher self critic and projection on the others what would you say your goals are caring.
9393.0,Patient,"For you know I like that goal of trying to do that more reframing and maybe even. Working with my thoughts, a little bit more. skillfully think that's going to take a lot of training. yeah so I mean like if i'm comfortable with mantra so maybe every time I think of my mantra which has become really common I can. sort of weave in the reframing why I had to go to the monitoring, to begin with something."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
9393.0,Patient,I think that's a good start seeing.
462.0,Provider,"start to seeing what works, but attaching a mantra to that thought and then wondering like you said a little bit of reflection, why now Why did I have to go to that mantra what. yeah Am I projecting here what part of me is getting a little triggered."
9393.0,Patient,"yeah because you know I think if i'm able to do that, I think the benefit that I see is I think my relationships with people when when I see people again might be better because. You know if i'm listening to that critic that i'm going to destroy their relationships."
462.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
9393.0,Patient,and
462.0,Provider,"That would be a good thing to write down. Keep listening to your critic you're going to keep destroying all of your relationships, including with yourself."
9393.0,Patient,yeah so yeah yeah yeah I want you to write that down. I can't remember what I say two seconds later so. If listen. yeah. yeah that's a good one okay and myself so. Okay. So.

I just this is seemingly never a problem with you, but for groups, we asked that everybody wear headphones because there's private information being shared That way we know it's just. In your ears, you always wear them anyway, and that there's no one that would be behind you walking around that could kind of you know, be looking at the screen. No driving like I said i've never had you do any of these things, but I just kind of let everyone know driving during group privacy. And then you know i'll go through, and call on people to share and if it's your first week i'll let you go last so you can kind of watch everybody else."
