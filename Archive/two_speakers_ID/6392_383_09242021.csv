6392.0,Patient,There we go sorry I couldn't. I couldn't hear now.
383.0,Provider,hi.
6392.0,Patient,How are you i'm pretty good.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, I just done just so we just maybe take care of business I ahead of time or just initially. So. I just got a note that said you wanted to attend group every other week and and sessions for therapy like once a month and that's totally fine. yeah I was wondering if you even want to do that."
6392.0,Patient,"yeah um I mean I don't I guess I don't feel like it's like i'm trying to reduce the frequency like as much as possible. And it's just a matter, no. I don't wanna say hasn't helped out, I understand that the. thing is. The more the more sessions do to that you know, the better it is for us to help them the personnel, but I guess in my situation i'm kind of like at home or just like all right, well, these are again going to get a lot busier and then I honestly just. yeah I just don't feel like I. I don't feel like I need. To be going as often I mean i've definitely taken some lessons from it so."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. You have a lot of demands in terms of you know your parenting classes and what's going on, you know what you need to do to in that regard with you know in my friends to your son and so i'm sure that you've got a lot of you've had a lot of sort of demands. on you to attend this appointment and that appointment and. and"
6392.0,Patient,"I can imagine it just sent to be a bit. I guess what i'm what I was what i've been used to before i'd be like. You just make an appointment I show up to my therapist appointment and it's once a month. yeah it tends to get a little bit like where it's like I miss this survey and then a Mrs appointment, but like. it's it's more like but I got busy with this and I prioritize this and it's been quite it's been quite a year, I mean i'll be honest with you, like my life for. Then I guess it just just an example, I mean I had my child co would have been like my grandma passed away last year and then my grandpa passed away this year it's it's been quite a quite like. Just just just stuff that you wouldn't I wouldn't normally I mean the custody thing obviously like. it's been it's been quite a quite a quite a journey, I would say i'm gonna say journey but. yeah one with frank, where i'm just. starting work. On October 1. And I know it's going to be a bit demanding cuz. I mean I you know with custody, we have an m mediation on 29 so. Hopefully you don't push back again and I know that's going to be if it goes through, and nobody calls in sick or has emergency then um I want to say I should be getting more time with my son, so it just it just getting busier and I still have to make time for. You know, which is staying in shape and I felt really good going to the gym again, which is hopefully this time around Kobe doesn't just burn that. And then yeah just it just getting busier and then I still had that i'm still trying to study, although lately has been. i'm trying to get back on track with what i'm setting up for but um. yeah it's just busy. you're busy."
383.0,Provider,"i'm telling me, what are you working full time you're going to be working, what is your job that you're starting on October 1."
6392.0,Patient,"So i'm going to be starting at Amazon, I mean it's just getting them to be working full time 10 hours a day, four days a week it's gonna be a night shift because honestly I can't escape. And that's been one thing that's been brewing like another thing that ruins my appointments that just my sleep is never I could never i'll never I don't feel confident that i'll ever be will have a normal sleep schedule I don't I try to but, just like it's just. and on top of that, they just tend to pay a little bit better working at night so it's just another thing that. yeah. But it's the same kind of work that i've worked before like I yeah so there's nothing there, I mean. I think my biggest challenge would probably be a. I won't say anxiety. But like. trying not to let. The things going on, and my with whole and it's going to be like the whole custody thing that's been the biggest restaurant try not to let it deter me from. keep going to work that makes any sense but i'm i'm my my mentality is I gotta do what I gotta I gotta do what needs to get done so it's not even that choice to me I don't know if that makes any sense it's just vs before I felt like it was just more like. You know, like do I have to kind of thing or you know, can I can I not can I still like trying not to work, the so you know, like I don't know if that makes any sense like I think it's it was it has been that fear of anxiety, but also there."
383.0,Provider,"Okay well that's Okay, I mean. i'm glad you're voicing that that there's a concern about your anxiety there's a concern about this job and and. Maybe it is, if you can squeeze in if you think of it it's just three hours a month that's two groups and one individual therapy just for you just to support you during this you know, going back to work, working nights managing your. You know what may be a kind of tricky custody thing I mean you know we're here to support you so i'm just. I understand you don't want to add too many you're busy, but at the same time. You know, having that place where it's like you can, if you need to address your anxiety with chantel you can you know you're already in you're in a program you don't have to go through the rigmarole of you know, getting. reelected and everything I don't know just as you get you know approaches very beginning, part of getting back into the swing of working and. It might be helpful to just keep keep your services with bright heart health for a couple little while I just thinking I don't know what do you think."
6392.0,Patient,"I mean. I mean you definitely want to continue services but. It just it's it's been one of those things where it's just like well if I miss an appointment and it has to do with this or that or just you know my head it, I want to say it. It forces like a type of obligation, where i'm not fulfilling my responsibilities and it just doesn't look like, for me, I have to think about well does this look good on paper you know at the think about that kind of thing like. it's not."
383.0,Provider,"Oh wait a second. Like. hey all sounds like I mean it sounds like you're trying to think about this as a strategy like are you going to get what you need to get and if it's going to look bad and you're not you know, rather than how can you help support yourself through this difficult time and it's. I mean meet the you don't think that that's. I mean you don't want missed appointments on your record, so it doesn't look bad is that kind of."
6392.0,Patient,"I mean I don't want to give the wrong impression that i'm missing appointments because, like i'm forgetting too much because of this reason because I don't know what's going on kind of thing like I don't want to give the wrong impression and yeah I got to think about like. This possibly like being brought up in court and I had to have that mentality and I don't. want to have somebody but."
383.0,Provider,that's positive with that okay. yeah so. To get your medical records from bright heart health from a court. perspective is. not the easiest thing in the world.
6392.0,Patient,yeah but.
383.0,Provider,It might not.
6392.0,Patient,I guess my.
383.0,Provider,"records are available to. You, my dear."
6392.0,Patient,"Sorry, my my biggest example is like because I didn't end me and I don't know I honestly think and, obviously, people say it's for you live out what. My county doesn't seem to be it definitely has an effin and health when it comes to the code thing, so I mean to me that was just like, but when it comes to. For example, my mediation, how they were able to get me to or my Lord not say anything when it came to the had mentioned group there be that day. And then they had said something about like okay well you know they basically kind of put that in the end the paperwork and that's hurt me like I feel like it's hurt me, which is like Father must attend and follow up with his with his uh. With his therapist and it didn't seem like it and i'm just like well how is it where they are able to ask me. About that day and I asked, I said, well, I just you know that day happened this like it's her group therapy, so I fell in good moodle what, what do you see in therapy for what's it for. And I felt like that, like looking back at it, I think that was an appropriate thing isn't appropriate for them to just force that and then my lawyer not say something which is like hey you can just you can just make him go to therapy like that's that's weird and especially when. That that court. Order like it just looks I hate to think like that, but they kind of feel like it was it was forced you know if I had if I was. Like be able to go back and be like no way i'm like I do that voluntarily I do that on my own i'm like I shouldn't it shouldn't be at the be in the quarter to say. You know something happens or i'm able to go for certain reasons that it's just that means i'm not i'm not seeing as somebody that's trying to help myself because i'm not attending group therapy it's and I hate to think like that, but it just like I don't okay."
383.0,Provider,"So what do you want to do I. What do you want, what do you because I just got a note that you know, to reduce your frequency to one time per month in terms of individual and two times per month for group. Do you want me to, but I mean this your ear and. do not want to be want to be discharged from the program is that what you're watching right now, because it is. It is your it's we're not related to the. courts for you. it's important to get the. Information you know correct."
6392.0,Patient,"This is, I mean it's it. it's it's not related, but at the same time, because it's in their court order like for me it's been like."
383.0,Provider,part of their court order.
6392.0,Patient,"Well, they don't say bright heart health but they said, like in the group and a quarter says that that I need to follow up with the tenant group therapy and I even had to. And this is why I had to contact right heart health, which is like where i'm at in terms of like like my my on my status, so I just I asked for medical records because it's so big and I literally had to turn that into to the mediator. Which is the Court and it's it's odd to me that I had to do that, you know man."
383.0,Provider,"And man you well. I feel like you know. with you that. You know there's some there's some question marks with regards to the actual facts of the things that you need to report or not report. And if these things are not vague. With regards to court, I mean that's the thing about the Court it's not that it should not be vague, so if it is vague you how your within your rights to clarify exactly what is needed and i'm not sure that that is clear to you."
6392.0,Patient,"So so so and I 100% agree um the The thing that that's been horrible that the thing that's been pretty hard is the last mediation had was in January we're supposed to have a follow up on me, but because I had was able to get a lawyer, they the other attorney pushed it back till. A month ago, and then they pushed it back again so it's been like this, this mean I be able to voice out saying hey I don't believe that should be in the corridor because one and speak to I believe it's there's so many reasons."
383.0,Provider,You have in your are you not discussing this with your attorney. That you don't like again the reports.
6392.0,Patient,"I speak to the paralegal, and I mean that's This is something that I said I said specifically like I don't feel like this should be in the quarter, as it is because you're at you guys are asking me for. Something that's so vague in there, he asked me how things are going with my my group therapy therapist. And I said well what exactly is it that they're asking for it because I gave them where i'm at you know where it's what says well my chart and my charts pretty pretty empty, you know. But like what what what exactly are they asking and into the E group the couple therapy the couple the mirror the Co parenting counselor just the fact that he even. Even required me to get like some type of approval from my group from my therapist or group therapy or whatever, that is another thing that I was like okay well obviously they're bringing this in you know they're roping this, in which I don't I don't think it's right for them to do."
383.0,Provider,"Well, the thing Okay, but this is not an this not at all uncommon in custody custody situations where there's it's not uncommon that their. Reports or or just dis updates, how are you doing you're doing well you're doing great you're showing up you know, a very, very superficial report that's not an uncommon thing."
6392.0,Patient,"yeah but, but I still have to say this, this example that same example which is co parenting counselor requiring that I follow up. With my group therapy or therapist or get approved from doctors, saying that i'm able to keep going to co parenting counseling and then to me to me i'm just like what I asked them. I believe we mean you discuss this, which is well what exactly you're asking, he was he wasn't sure what he was asking for you know and that's what i'm saying this. I don't like I don't want to look at it that way, but like can even like overall like my biggest thing is has it helped me out, yes, it has. Do I feel like I need to be attending as often I don't feel like I need to be attending as often I guess my mentalities more like things are moving along things are busier and then i'm just like I don't. I won't say i'm better but. it's it's just the frequency of it is a bit too much, but no I don't want to the point to the Program."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you don't want to end being in the program and so will reduce your frequency to one therapy appointment per month and two groups I don't think we can go down in groups. So that so that you're showing up to group every other week."
6392.0,Patient,"yeah, the only thing I guess, I would just set the it would be the. The change and I don't know and that's what I had said, like is there a different time because, like I can't i'm trying to fit this 3pm slot on and. it's going to change only because, like for me 3pm so basically my words starts at four. And that's something I don't know who to discuss that with if if. If I can get a different three time and 3pm or."
383.0,Provider,"OK, I will I will ask chantelle there's another group. And will be within another therapist, but it was still be with her so that would be good."
6392.0,Patient,I mean so so I guess it's like my situation there if I start worked at that for and it's and it's basically half an hour away um. You know I had to yeah without through an art.
383.0,Provider,Like with 11am work for you or 12 noon.
6392.0,Patient,"I mean the I would likely have to be like Friday 12 noon. yeah cuz. or whatever, whatever the latest I can get like it really is that my. wife used to have my own schedule it's still be night, so I would basically sleep until i'd have to get ready for work and then yeah so he's asleep as much as they can be. But again, that Nice ship is a bit tricky so."
383.0,Provider,"Okay i'm sending her a message about that and we will see if we can get you into a group that's more convenient for you. and So let's see if we can schedule your next individual appointment and. Maybe when we come to your individual appointments, you can maybe be thinking about you know what is it that you want to work on or discuss like do you want to discuss. anxiety that you having a work or communication. Issues or."
6392.0,Patient,"I mean I I guess I don't. It just it's always going to come back to the same thing, which is, I don't I don't get it. I still I keep asking myself like. How long before this stops like I don't I literally don't get it that's like keep asking like Why is still happening I just it's it's I don't know that's I don't know what I just I don't know if i'm refusing to. I guess i'm i'm always say i'm just upset at myself like. Keep thinking myself like okay like you did what you're supposed to you're supposed to tell the truth you're supposed to try and be not Honorable but like do the right thing and I feel like that's hurt me like I say I swear that feel like that her milani try and do the right thing."
383.0,Provider,well.
6392.0,Patient,And I don't get it. So to cope with that I guess.
383.0,Provider,"doing the right thing is the right thing, so I think you're questioning that but. I just like to validate that you know your choice to try to be honest, now, sometimes we we can be more skillful and our communication and learn communication skills that where we can get our needs met a little bit better but. And maybe that's something that we can. Work on. You know, unfortunately apartment is only 30 minutes today and we just kind of. sorted out some of these logistics. I feel like you know you could really benefit from the support of. Just this independent breitbart health it's not related to how you're doing in the courts or any of those evaluations it's it's. it's just for you good thing."
6392.0,Patient,"I just I don't think I. Think talking to himself, but like it, I feel like it can only go so far I just don't know."
383.0,Provider,"What sounds like I mean you're you're in such a better place than even three months ago, and then you are you got a job lined up, I mean you put yourself out there you've got you know you've got hired."
6392.0,Patient,"Well i'm I am I have that that feel like that determination that I had maybe like a year to go where I felt like the way he's the few I like I said I like working I like I. i'm a bit of workaholic when I when I get into it like and then I just had this for me it's it's i'm trying get back and talk to studying, but I still have that determination or what am I, what can I do to get me to the next level for my kids. And like how am I going to get him to House how am I going to get into a farmer how am I going to get him like you know, and not just that, but like. better health care, better things like activities like that's coming to I can't do that off like not working, you know so. And then, how am I gonna how am I going to circulate around this situation with my access he's not flexible i'm saying that she's been she's been a nightmare, I mean that's that's period. You know she she has this authentic way to be nice and sound like she's she's so likable but at the same time, so like not understand that she's. she's not what she's saying just because she literally said well i'm saying in a nice way, so why are you saying i'm like you're not doing what's right friend i'm not going to get into that too much, but yeah I basically got. i'm a bit more focused and I know this is what I gotta do and i'm happy with the decision as something i'm interested in and yeah working it's gonna help out i'm getting a place of my own, for me, my son and then going on to that next career path that that would be into it and. going from there it's just it's interesting. And then, if I, and then I can do that from home if I have to so it gets it buys me more time so, then I have more time. You know, to navigate around discuss anything so it's it's just so I feel pretty happy about that."
383.0,Provider,"that's great. that's awesome that is really a really big. You know it's it's tough for from where you were you know which, I think that you are really overwhelmed by what had happened, the you know what your ex had done. That loss of your child, you were just. Really overwhelmed with that and even working at that time felt overwhelming and he turned a corner, you know you're ready to get back to work if you're like you said you've got the motivation so that's all really good yeah. So I know I know she's a call I know. So we have a group. And it's on Fridays at 11 and that's. that's an option for you, we can switch you into that group. starting now did you maybe starting next week."
6392.0,Patient,"I mean. that's I mean that's that's the latest we can go there, I mean I asked because of this."
383.0,Provider,yeah it's only one I mean chantelle prefers to have me into the folks that I see in my group so that's The only other group that I run on.
6392.0,Patient,I just I don't want to keep I don't want to stop going to to I want I don't want I don't want to see stop seeing seeing you I you know I think it's a familiarity and obviously you knowing the background helps out um but I don't it's yeah I don't wanna. I don't I don't. I don't know how to fit that 3pm schedule is what i'm saying like I.
383.0,Provider,"got 11 on Friday, and if you can just think of it as sometimes we do these sort of little mental. tricks like okay it's only two hours a month like I can do that I can show up two hours a month for group and sometimes it's it gets dismissed early so it's really kind of 45 minutes and."
6392.0,Patient,"So is this, I mean this tool like you're like part of the same."
383.0,Provider,"yeah exactly it's just going to see different people it's the same thing it's me running group chantelle running group. she'll tell and I, together. At 11am."
6392.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was asking, which is like what if it's still the same group with like you and you're in shontelle."

6392.0,Patient,"Okay over 21st so 45 yeah that should work it's pretty. There isn't okay and i'm sticking to my physical calendar because that's yeah that way, I was trying to do the phone my phone is just. And that's me I like I tried to put too many things on my phone and i'll turn one of these little things often yeah that's yeah I wrote down some um we should be good to go that works."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great. So that will be a 45 minute appointment once a month. Like the third week of the month will try to more or less do that and. And then your individuals. Starting Friday next week."
6392.0,Patient,Alright sounds good.

6392.0,Patient,"noted that. Now that that should be fine I mean i'd like to I don't mind like I said it does just the frequency and I don't just the core the core definitely definitely influences influences my decision making, so. I think the custody think so yeah."
