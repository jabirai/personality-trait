298.0,Provider,"Okay, so I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner, and what I do is diagnose and prescribe medication and, if you would like a psychiatrist I can give you referrals outside of our company, but mostly we're all psychiatric nurse practitioners."
15722.0,Patient,"i'm her husband. or not, not so much interested in you just prescribing drugs, we want someone to do more, therapeutic treatment, not just evaluate attain put her on a mood elevator that's not what we're looking for i'm looking we're looking for more psychiatric therapeutic."

15722.0,Patient,or not he just he just going to prescribe medication.
298.0,Provider,"So we are a mental health program and what I don't do the therapy part of it, we have therapists who are doing it i'm happy to get you a referral to what you're looking for i'm sorry that you've made it this far to see me."
15722.0,Patient,"Well, she filled out all those forms and specifically. was supposed to be a psychiatrist or even a psychologist but not someone we don't cheat on she saw our primary for medicine."

298.0,Provider,And bright heart right heart health does not have psychiatry to see patients. We have psychiatry. Which is what all of us psych in peace are.
15722.0,Patient,"Like that I that I misunderstood what you first said, you said i'm going to get an evaluate my wife and prescribed medication is that what you said."
298.0,Provider,"And so, a part of our program is I do evaluation and prescribe medicine and then the therapists there's all different it's within our program but it's not me who does the therapy part."
15722.0,Patient,Right so shouldn't you so that is part of your Program. Right.
298.0,Provider,"It is part of our program therapy, I know i'm just not the person who does it."
15722.0,Patient,"Right so shouldn't you shouldn't you send her to a therapist it's part of your program you just said i'm confused confusing us, you said there's no therapist part of your program other therapists you can send it to."
298.0,Provider,I can send her to a therapist but you need to go through an evaluation through me first.
15722.0,Patient,right but it doesn't necessarily mean you're i'm a physical therapist I understand the healthcare doesn't necessarily you're going to evaluate it not going to necessarily put her on more medication or you're.
298.0,Provider,Correct correct. So she doesn't necessarily mean that that is correct i'm not.
15722.0,Patient,"i'm not looking for i'm looking for a lot of medicine, so you can do your EVAL and, hopefully, then you'll send it to a therapist sexual talk to and work out whatever is bothering her."
298.0,Provider,That is correct.
15722.0,Patient,"Okay, so we need to go through you to get to your therapists okay."
298.0,Provider,That is.
15722.0,Patient,"i'll leave the room, but let's not jump on just prescribing medicine okay. Okay. How about doesn't always work okay i'll leave you with my wife that's why officer."
298.0,Provider,there's one.
15722.0,Patient,What why yes.
298.0,Provider,"there's one more part to our program that I wanted you to know about to make sure if we're on the same page. So you see a therapist online you do that on zoom and you do that about every other week it can change a little bit based on what you want, on the. The individual therapy another part of our program is group therapy that's done once a week and it's done online on zoom and the therapist is there and about eight to 12 other people are there. And that is a time what happens in group therapy is the therapist brings a topic matter there's a discussion on it and then anybody who needs to stay and speak with me they can, are you willing to do our Program."
15722.0,Patient,I don't want to do a hook that up I don't want I don't want people to know and hear what's my poem I don't want to hear that Alma mater.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm not sure you're in the right place still i'm not sure you're in the right place."
15722.0,Patient,Because i'm not dealing with drugs or a alcohol.
298.0,Provider,"And and there's I have mental health groups so there's there's none of that. And you only share as much as you want to share, but if you don't want to be a part of that that's something that I cannot take away from the program like it's a it that's the umbrella part of it."
15722.0,Patient,"So it's every other week a private. therapy and then the other week is group so once a week group and the other, and then the next week is prior."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, correct and."
15722.0,Patient,Patience I similar problems or why.
298.0,Provider,"I didn't come so a week I group them, so people who have addictions, they have their own groups and people who have mental health. challenges they have their own groups I don't separate it out by diagnosis is like there may be somebody in there for depression and then there may be somebody in there for anxiety. Somebody in there, who has ADHD I don't divide it up, because the topic matter that's done in group is um it could be something like boundaries or shame, or something and there's a discussion about that."
15722.0,Patient,kelly's lessons or therapist.
298.0,Provider,"So the group therapy is one hour long and the individual sessions, that is determined when you talk with your therapist if you choose to add how long you want them to be."
15722.0,Patient,"And what a what a qualification, so a service what are there."
298.0,Provider,So how I decide when I meet when I do the intake is I look at what the needs are so we have. What they call LM s to a licensed marriage family therapist we have social workers and I usually choose between those two there are others who are counselors and they're called. I don't know what it's a PC something like that professional counselor.
15722.0,Patient,"I guess it's a start first. When do they are I will stop because funeral for us out that means a health policy might not cover that is that what you're saying. or health plan, if you refer out to a psychologist."
298.0,Provider,"I we try to stay if I made a referral, I asked that they look at your insurance and only refer within your insurance. If you choose to go that yeah."
15722.0,Patient,So you could do an evaluation today with Christine and then you could send her out if she would rather go to a private psychologist maybe you could do that.
298.0,Provider,"Not the way that you're thinking, yes, I can do that, but I don't I the company sorry the the. The part of our company that does the referrals is not a true sense of the referral like the next place doesn't get my evaluation. What they get what you get is a list of what your insurance will pay for within the criteria, and you have to make the phone call and ask for an appointment so yeah so it's not a true referral like in the sense that he my notes won't leave here."
15722.0,Patient,"Right, but you have the referral I said she can call."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, that I do yes."
15722.0,Patient,And that was a psychologist probably.
298.0,Provider,"If that's what you're requesting is psychology versus psychiatry if if you put if you tell me I want her to see a psychologist, which is a doctorate level psychologists then that's what we'll look for."
15722.0,Patient,or a psychiatrist but not necessarily. Evaluation say take Prozac or something.
298.0,Provider,And that's kind of what you get with psychiatry I fortunately.
15722.0,Patient,I don't do like a wise yeah.
298.0,Provider,that's that's more psychology they have a psychology has more tools for what you were just talking about.
15722.0,Patient,"yeah yeah okay so, then we can do two things you can do here a bow. You could set her up in the group, and you can refer us if she's not happy that she'll have the referral base to. What you want to go that route so let's do those things do you. grow, what are you going to give us a list, how does she get that list of WHO."
298.0,Provider,"So it comes in an email, and you have, and you make an A request you make a request through me for that and I notify that I want the research done for it, and then it comes in an email from our company. So yes, you can meet with me today, you can meet with a therapist you can meet with a group, and if you don't like us, you can discharge yourself and say, I would like, and set the criteria for what it is you're looking for and."
15722.0,Patient,Christine will send that email to you. and
298.0,Provider,"know she can ask anybody in the virtual clinic and say, I want to discharge myself, and I want. I want, whatever it is you want they sent to me for approval, and I say yes, and then it gets sent it out to her."
15722.0,Patient,But I got an email now to fill it out and then to see Dr Jonathan can be.
298.0,Provider,"No i'm Jonathan campy is not a doctor, he is the C E O of our company."
15722.0,Patient,So why is he asking for more payment and credit card Informations.
298.0,Provider,he's the chief executive officer he's but he's not a doctor.
15722.0,Patient,"So i'm just going fuse get started complete your home and to see Dr. You know I wasn't sure why am I gonna ask for. Payments again when I hit get started, they want my credit card again to see. Dr Jonathan scampi. i'm confused."
298.0,Provider,I.
15722.0,Patient,I got an email.
298.0,Provider,"I can tell you, Jonathan is not a doctor that I know of."
15722.0,Patient,And you for today or your company is a copay is that right.
298.0,Provider,That is correct now you don't want to proceed right now I can have the charges reversed.
15722.0,Patient,"No, I think you should go there. Because, for me, when I call the 800 number if i'm not happy, I could always change to something else, because they were asking me if I want to do a zoom meeting this is what I get. When I want to see in person go defend well can she see that psychologists were talking about Oh, she needs to go through your first."
298.0,Provider,"You can go to your insurance company and ask them. For the psychologist. But but but I mean you can do your own lake work to find a psychologist. If you wanted to, and not even go through me."
15722.0,Patient,So that difficult to find psychologists within the health care plan.
298.0,Provider,I think um let's see em mm hmm do you have a card that says a number to call. on the back of it.
15722.0,Patient,So that's how I get to you.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and how you get to me as ask them say I want a psychologist period, you know, and you know put your foot down that's what you want."
15722.0,Patient,Right that's what they told me if i'm not happy with you doing this room is always change it back.
298.0,Provider,And yeah yeah and a lot of people do because we are a program there's a yeah so it's not what they're really looking for.
15722.0,Patient,Right so. No nothing against you.
298.0,Provider,"No, no, I get it, I get it, I totally get it. I will reverse it right now."
15722.0,Patient,"Thank you, Nicole, the health plan and."
298.0,Provider,"Actually i'm going to go ahead and make a request and you should get an email also. Just stating what I found out also in about a day and a half, you should get an email from me, but if you want to get a step ahead of me call your. call that number and say. This is what I want, I am not do not want to do this with right heart health. Okay, all right, thank you. bye bye."
