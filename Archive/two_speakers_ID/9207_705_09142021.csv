Yes, Okay, then that's what we're gonna do today, and then it's different than a counseling session. When we meet in a counseling session will more. explore things talk about coping skills, some of it to William. is more sensitive in nature. This is a. Non judgment zone, this is a safe zone. As you know, confidentiality and privacy are important, is so if someone called me. Tomorrow yeah if they call me tomorrow outside of. breitbart health and said. You met with William so what you know what were some of the things you talked about, and what were some of the things that you see this part far as his treatment I couldn't confirm or deny that I even know you William until you give me permission with that consent of release you signed."
9207.0,Patient,Cry right.
705.0,Provider,"And then the other things I always share with people were mandated record. For if it's CPS child protective services or adult protective services if there's something that's reportable we are mandated reporter. reporters at the other thing is, if you say you're going to hurt yourself we're going to get you help right we're going to get to the support you need, and if you say you're going to hurt someone else we're going to get them the support they need, and you the support that you need. And if it's something like you need 911 because there's a medical situation happening we're going to get you help so outside of that though confidentiality is. Any questions about that. yeah."

You know, but I was like comfortable with talking about it, you know in some i've been through it all my mom those are things i've been through in going to do, but I just didn't want to really improve, I want to kind of get a one on one session on one therapy.

9207.0,Patient,"Okay, you too, I appreciate it."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely William take care. bye. I William is no suicide risk he denies only after his father died, he said he briefly thought about not wanting to wake up, but he never had a plan never had the intent or anything like that never thought about collecting pills. So no need for a safety plan because patient does not state that he is suicidal so no suicidal risk he mentioned two protective factors his family's have friends, he gave a list of reasons why he wants to live. And so, for him, no risk."
