I had gastric bypass. And so, ever since that surgery and has like really bad pain up in my left shoulder and I don't know why, but they said because they do like the nerves Descartes you know someone inside, they have to do with that, but it hurts when I break and it's been there for so long.

I made sure all three. work to make sure they are condom food they bring along for you so let's. Just make sure their joy is like. I really like I don't like to say so, you.

Quiet this to avoid conflict, but I just couldn't take it anymore, so I just started pushing and pushing and pushing and I mean you actually have to go. On the bus driven by showing which is Oklahoma and I moved to California, such as kind of a way for him, so he had to go on a trip home and then come back in order for them to figure out a serious, you know that. Is all I was asked him so he's trying to make it work as best as it can sign in health wise I have like quite a bit of help, I guess, I could say it still seems like it's not.

My oldest well my oldest son, I only have one son yeah he's he was like you could tell it was like. my daughter, she was the one I had seen and she kind of felt the same way and and have. been trying in so it's like I try and make sure all three of them get one I just I didn't make something happens like I don't I don't even mess around they actually five minutes, so they get all my attention stuff so that part is during the two. Like literally I don't even show up when I say I have 20 almost 24 hours a day like I was able to put my baby sleeping under State for a minute. And just sitting there to do this, but then usually I have. Something."

748.0,Provider,Great. So how do you cope with your Depression and anxiety.
5718.0,Patient,"So, mostly it's like the medications I feel like that helped me a lot, but other than that what are some days when the medication doesn't see me. I just kind of you, I just kind of have to know if that's the way I look at it. I don't really give into a lot of it, though, because I know that my feelings can get the best of me, so I just can't let the emotion like. i'll think about it process it and I let it go kinda like. Depression or. it's been snowbirds to me like as far as my life."
748.0,Provider,"What do you. see as being a trigger that started here, though."
5718.0,Patient,"You probably my abusive relationship that I was in for a long time, when I first got married with my first child I feel like that was a big deal that changed a lot. Because it got turned around on me and I didn't even I wasn't even the battery. And so I did I like. term because just changed everything. see my eldest daughter now because again like and I live in an hour I live in a town an hour away so it's like he. agreed to me. He. turns. out just for the record. So he's taking advantage of that so that's my daughter. Right yeah so it's like that part has no bearing just because of that situation you previously with them."
748.0,Provider,How old were you when that relationship started.
5718.0,Patient,I was about. 14 when we got together. yeah he was eight.
748.0,Provider,And how did you end up in person.
5718.0,Patient,"So what happened was my Okay, he was actually a good he's been. i've been drinking, because after a while can be drinking a lot and then anyway, so it started like that or just like he was started putting hands on stuff. And finally I got so mad I like I took a steak knife and was trying to like tell them i'm gonna throw it out and I didn't even throw in. There like he was getting crazy Julie crazy started this is stuff he's done previously he started and kind of software, everything was just like. He was grabbing that it was killed himself and I just and then, when the COPs and get there and stuff it would look like I was the one doing stuff which I mean they know I didn't tell him anything but like. It was just like when they got there my brother just got there too, and all the words that I speak nicely. Like oh hell and that's exactly what it's called spousal abuse with. yeah basically. yeah spouse or cohabited. Balance yeah. it's within Canada with. Injury it said with corporate. No injuries from you, he had cut himself like weeks before he even told them that he was no crush on him from me whatsoever, so it was like literally I had to just squeeze out of jail, you know. In order to just get out of jail for a little while but I ended up. Because I didn't take it to trial like I should have to cuz he wouldn't even read for me them. guess so like the whole thing is crap and then, and then it happens again with my new boyfriend since I knew boy for knows. That, I have a previous charge you got mad at me and called the COPs and said I was eating on, and so they came to my house interesting and I had. And it was just like oh my God, so now seven years presences to spend it sentencing and amanda and I can't even mess up introversion one time or else i'll go back and do another crazy. crazy. crazy ever since having to go to do for that situation and then. i'm like. I wasn't very old at all, but I."
748.0,Provider,"May, if you were starting with them at 14 you were a baby."
5718.0,Patient,"yeah exactly and we'd been together that whole time problems, but you know what I mean I guess it just at that point in time, matters throwing situation at the wrong time and it just changed my whole life."
748.0,Provider,course it does.

5718.0,Patient,yeah exactly no.
748.0,Provider,"I have a. I have a. an organization that I actually am connected to that i'd love to share a video clip from an it in the chat. Because I think it might be really helpful for you, for for our communication, if we weren't able to talk about this, my guesses they've given you in fact I know for a fact that they. have given you the aces questions does that ring a bell."
5718.0,Patient,home.
748.0,Provider,Adverse childhood experience questions.

748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so i'm in because I can't walk and chew gum at the same time i'm going to disappear you'll still see me but i'm going to disappear for justice SEC. While I pull up backflip. and i'm just gonna pull it up and get the. Link for it. didn't start good you know what I could do is play it, we could watch it together because we've still got half an hour. To do that would that be interesting to you."
5718.0,Patient,How long is the video.
748.0,Provider,six minutes. Sure let's. Do that except it's not letting me do that so i'm going to do it on on YouTube instead because I want to get on. there. Back to you. You know what i'm just going to copy the link and send it to you it's i'm not figuring out how to do it and I don't want to waste your time. it's just not doing it easily i'm not as familiar yet with all the systems.
5718.0,Patient,it's complicated.
748.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm used to it on my own and my own computer not that bright heart health and. And that's really simple, for me, but this one, was it so."
5718.0,Patient,here's.
748.0,Provider,"The link. and If, for some reason you lose it just remember it's compassion prison project. it's pretty powerful, so I think based on your history, you might find it healing it and I will say you might also find it. Well, the word I would use is the evocative. Like it might bring up a lot of. And if it does. Just know that we can talk about it during your neck. Because. That. You know I know that."
5718.0,Patient,For you.
748.0,Provider,"The history that you've had physically. i'd love to talk more about what it was like for you growing up, and you said you carried a lot of weight. I don't know how much a lot is. It obviously impacted both your body but also your part i'm sure being in school kids aren't very nice. And and. But I, I wonder how much your trauma around being in prison, has been addressed. hey have you checked out that."
5718.0,Patient,"No, no. Okay. No that's okay. Okay, go ahead. he's shy."
748.0,Provider,hi.
5718.0,Patient,hi.
748.0,Provider,hi sweetheart. I just last week to. yeah how. Do you.
5718.0,Patient,Say i'm good.
748.0,Provider,I like your pinky pinky.
5718.0,Patient,She likes to be. jumping you're shy but.
748.0,Provider,Of course i'm brand new when i'm in her face.
5718.0,Patient,"Of course, oh yeah. So yeah I don't even take them out either so like when I think one of the gas stations was he was in a while they're like i'm really shy. or not even like that at home, you."
748.0,Provider,"know. Because you're not a stranger. yeah yeah and that's just a natural part of their experience right now. So anyway, I and and the other thing and i'm not you know i'm not saying that there are reasons for all of the systems that we have in place in the world. Based on different viewpoints i'm not not trying to be too countercultural here, but what I will say is that. works for you and what you walk through just my observation, for you to have been in the situation you were in that got you arrested means that you were already traumatized. That was a traumatic experience and instead of having that trauma address and giving us the rules and the time to process to do that led to that experiment that whole night. And what you would been through instead you got punished. For it and Marie traumatized. And so, all of that is stuck in your body. And what I would love to do is work with you."
5718.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,I might have you.
5718.0,Patient,not really not really be honest.
748.0,Provider,"yeah I mean when I think about what's happened to you, all I can think about it so much, I want to cry. And you seem like you're this solid wall. That just has to be strong."
5718.0,Patient,"Like the only option, I have so i'm kind of like i'm used to expecting the very worst situations and then that way i'm not that way i'm not let down. So I kind of just building something smaller than you expecting the worst which could be getting the rest of the truth side because my kids, but I just sometimes I expect anything to happen anymore show it's like I just said, turn out to."
748.0,Provider,"See if we can't move you towards your life, where you have some. expectations that aren't about not having it be so awful that it's devastating and then having an expectation that maybe you could have some dreams come true. yeah. And some positivity."
5718.0,Patient,will be really.
748.0,Provider,"So you, you also said something that was a bit of a concern to me about your current relationship, it sounds like there's some abuse and that one to."
5718.0,Patient,"find there how's it been really like he he has a bit of us have heard anything it's just what was going on, I think shoving and. Calling the COPs and so on. And so it's like. So, but ever since then we haven't done that either, so no that's not really."
748.0,Provider,The sort of you know pitch.
5718.0,Patient,"All right, yeah I don't like swimming around him, which is good guys excellent when I used to like to live in."
748.0,Provider,"um so My guess My guess would be in this as a guest but i'm asking you. that you have a pretty. Yes, I can. trigger response like you can get triggered really easy easily because of how much trauma you've walked through in your life."
5718.0,Patient,yeah that sounds data.
748.0,Provider,And yet you come across as seeming like you've got it all under control.
5718.0,Patient,"I hope so, because I feel like especially offices and. I really do I feel like i'm like I wonder how I come off other people because i'm in my own head now i'm not in any analysis I just wondered about that you know they have a positive impact, when I meet people. that's what I hope, for I know I can be like someone intimidating because I just have like someone just having a look on my face because. I just have like endlessly So yes, and people can even just being really serious and i'm just i'm just thinking or something but i've gotten that a lot of people and, like you know, and my statement thinking you know and and what the tattoos or anything. Like working in social media someplace else but i'm i'm really like actually a nice, personally, I try to do it and. Then I like to feel happy like they don't like see anybody down. i've seen them for see I guess one other. point of view which stops I feel like I said. it's Okay, though I understand. Now."
748.0,Provider,"I know it sounds like you are really. Sensitive person who's learned how to protect yourself. And so people don't see that sensitivity and you mentioned. The tattoos and and the way that you, you may not even be conscious of it, but the way that you hold your face so that you are. Okay well. you're in big. trouble now with me, because now, I know who. Lives inside there. When was the last time you cried."
5718.0,Patient,couple days ago.
748.0,Provider,Okay What was it that triggered the crying.
5718.0,Patient,"Just. Just I think it was me my brother got into. The roster. But. I just don't like playing with family early like I like them a lot, so it sorry move it."
748.0,Provider,Like.
5718.0,Patient,"They always try to sneak off attention but. secretly i'm paying attention. Anyway, um yeah. some kind of pity fight over something. escalated into where it just cause he just called emotions and stuff like. That is that what it means to run money or whatever the hell, it is, I want you to be. let's move over like I shouldn't have to go there, so it's just ridiculous like we wrestled around for a while, so dumb who's like clear wrestling but still I got it like the table. like this is down. And we're like i'm almost 30 he's got like 31 and 32 are only a few years apart together and stuff so like pruned say data handling dead, it seemed like i'm the music rock. So he made to look at software selfish person. So. When i've used and stuff like that don't."
748.0,Provider,You what say that again.
5718.0,Patient,Like a dopey.
748.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
5718.0,Patient,So. and
748.0,Provider,"i'm glad that you still can I was, I was a little concerned that you've worked so hard. To create that. That bravado that wall love I solid. Being. As being tapper cold and you're not."
5718.0,Patient,Exactly I. have worked hard to do that. To try to do that.
748.0,Provider,"yeah but you've got to have that release, with everything that you've walked through. sounds like it started really young. To if that first relationship was. Did you see other abuse, when you were growing up."
5718.0,Patient,"Like physical. I mean i've seen it, but I didn't grow up around it. yeah."
748.0,Provider,How about verbal abuse.
5718.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,Okay.
5718.0,Patient,A lot of that.
748.0,Provider,"When you were growing up. that's amazing how we internalize that I know that's been throwing money on why we internalize verbal abuse or or painful words, even though there was no physical abuse and yet how we show it when we get older is to get involved in physical abuse. yeah in in some way it's almost as if we've learned that we deserve to be punished and Intel we recognize that that's what we've created and we can't change it. And I definitely have seen that in so many women. So many women so i'm really glad you're changing that pattern for yourself. Because, ultimately we're the only ones who can do it. We have to change it internally before we create a deck externally, otherwise we keep attracting the same person. Over and over so So what are your dreams I would love to know what your dreams are."
5718.0,Patient,Just to be happy and.
748.0,Provider,What would make you happy.
5718.0,Patient,probably be inside of.
748.0,Provider,What would make you proud.
5718.0,Patient,i'm sure I wished her wanna feel completely confident about. As far as it goes. I want to. Be mentally and physically. Caution for that can take their. Followers followers right now.
748.0,Provider,Okay.
5718.0,Patient,"I feel like I feel like there's gonna be a lot of work. You know, when I. feel like it's getting later, but there's a nice thing to do. So i'm kind of just working with that with that. I know I should. Be expression."
748.0,Provider,Then you probably need another five years before so that your kids during all your kids are in school. yeah and then you can start to put some energy into what's next.
5718.0,Patient,For you.
748.0,Provider,"Not that you can't do a little bit right now, not right now but soon. Maybe once your youngest is like. yeah. But what would be a way that you can imagine you're in. A crowded, you will have a."
5718.0,Patient,"Quick i'm. Sorry. Okay, what was."
748.0,Provider,"The best Okay, I know you've got a lot on your plate. So what I asked you, is it, I hear you want to be independent, you want to be proud of yourself, you want to be on your own have your own place what what is the avenue that you'd like to see yourself on that would take you there, so do you have a career in mind."
5718.0,Patient,not really that's the thing. not really. What know.
748.0,Provider,excites you.
5718.0,Patient,"What am I doing here now. With all the G, you know. Okay um and then. yeah I would love to do that for sure."
748.0,Provider,That certainly seems like it would. fit who you are. yeah and it still has to do with appearance and and self expression like hair and nails you could even combine them.
5718.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
748.0,Provider,"That would be really cool. yeah um and then, how do you how do you take care of yourself in terms of sobriety staying clean and sober you, you mentioned alcohol, but I didn't hear you say anything about drugs have you had drug issues in your life."
5718.0,Patient,yeah was well. Mostly. My worst my drug of choice was a phone.
748.0,Provider,Okay. You did way.
5718.0,Patient,I struggled with that for a little.
748.0,Provider,While okay. And what was your avenue with math. know.
5718.0,Patient,How to do. Everything.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, so a combination of everything. Okay. All right. So i've got. Over 30 years experience working with addiction there's no I definitely know that when you take the drug away it's great and. it's absolutely wonderful that you're clean, but I also know that what's behind it, is the real truth it's not the drug one of my favorite people in the field is a man named gabor ma today I don't know if you're familiar with him. i'll have things to share with you from him to about my favorite quote of his at least currently is don't ask why the addiction ask why the pain."
5718.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
748.0,Provider,"that's what it's about is the pain so let's get you as I, you know it's easy for me to say let's get you connected to your pain oh. yeah see. I know that isn't fun, but that's where your freedom is and that freedom is what's going to take you to the capacity to be able to start pursuing your dreams. And you deserve those dreams. Even though the system has told you, since you were 14 years old, that you don't."
5718.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And you have believed that you don't have value, I can feel it. Am I lying."
5718.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,So how do you offer your children love.
5718.0,Patient,My time.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, do you tell them you love them."
5718.0,Patient,"Just. A moment close even kisses there's just a lot, a lot of like there's that's one thing that starting and it's just the important part of my life is that there is a lot of them if it weren't for that I don't know where we. it's that's The one thing that I choose to live for is that feeling with my kids."
748.0,Provider,yeah. So you've considered not being here.
5718.0,Patient,"Not necessarily in that aspect where like. Not in this situation, like, I was it if I didn't have my kids are now probably be doing drugs. Maybe maybe would have killed myself and on accident by overdosing and this made sense of Stupid decisions and not good not good care of itself, like everything, so I mean it could be, you know or I can be prison could be nothing compared to where else I could be. Absolutely yeah I feel like I don't even know."
748.0,Provider,"So why I was asking you, the question is some because I want to make sure you love your kids because I can feel it I can feel how much you love them, I want you to start talking to you the way that you talk to them. So if you hear yourself tell one of your children today I love you I want you to go look in the mirror and look in her eyes in ashley's eyes and say I love you. And then feel in your body, what happens because my guess is there will be a reaction and it won't be positive. So it's going to take practice. But you know, one of the things I often say to people is once i've met you I stock your ass for life. So you're stuck with me now. And I can really I mean i've seen you in group twice, because the one time, I was visiting and none last week, but I haven't had a chance to really feel you if that makes sense. yeah and there is a an incredibly sensitive soul when they're."

748.0,Provider,Do you take your kids to the park. When was the last time you got on a swing.
5718.0,Patient,"yeah back probably do it on a swing or something like next to them, probably spent about a year i'd say. Okay, I did that."
748.0,Provider,that's your assignment for this week.
5718.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"I want you to go to the park with them and let them see you swing and play and that way I know you'll do it if it's for them, but I want you to see if you can feel inside that young part of you that needs that. That little girl who saying, please take me out. it's your boyfriend is he there now."
5718.0,Patient,And yeah he's asleep.
748.0,Provider,"Okay okay I just I wasn't sure, but based on what you said, whether we actually live there, right now, because of the bus trip by what I got a little confused but. What do you to do together in your relationships that's about enjoyment or play or relaxation or."
5718.0,Patient,"We don't do much actually like when I did have my car running sometimes we were. Like I don't know what it's been one spot of the whole year that we've decided to like go walk over the bridge here, where we live the fridge and it's pretty. Like you walk over so it's nice to do that, like we've only done that once out of all your so. We don't do much we basically when we when the kids are sleeping room well we just desire what I desire. And we just lay there and watch movies firing line you know eat our dinner enough and then later and watch movies, but we possibly can so. he'll stay up like most of the night, where I sleep and then I take care of the kids during the day, a couple hours sleeps and then we're touring like he gets over on to are like well sometimes if i'm lucky yeah so. that's our day basically we don't really in and he did he's not the type I could take two movies, he doesn't like it now that all that kind of sucks because I do like doing stuff like that it says he doesn't come on why so you don't get to do much like that."
748.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay well we'll we'll keep looking at whether that is is whether there's a way that you can incorporate him into. doing some things that are about. Celebrating you rather than what you what's on your to do list because you've got a long to do list every day with three kids yeah that's for sure. So I brought up I know we've kind of moved all over the place during the time we've had together, I brought up a lot of. different issues, and a lot of sensitive things I just want to check in with you and see how you're feeling."
5718.0,Patient,Good.
748.0,Provider,Are you lying.
5718.0,Patient,No.
748.0,Provider,Are you shut down.
5718.0,Patient,No.
748.0,Provider,"So you would tell me if you were feeling raw vulnerable. Yes, okay all right and you'll be in group tomorrow, so I can check in with you, I of course won't bring anything up about. Anything we've talked about, but I just want to make sure you're Okay, if things come up because of everything we've talked about. And of course you're so busy they may not, but if they do just give yourself permission to take 10 minutes and go do some writing or even color with your kids. Something that will help you sort of release it from your body, so it doesn't stay stuck in there, not that I expect you to fold into a ball on the floor and cry for the next 12 hours but. But just really honored that part of you, maybe put your hand on your heart and take a breath and say it's okay so okay. Okay. it's really been an honor to get to know you. And I will look forward to our next session."
