First, one is the box and I don't know I don't even know like I don't know there's part of me now like, I question with regard to promote like I know that I am. But I think the first time I was just taking I don't feel like the thing like I did when I that's i'm doing okay I don't know if it's gonna work out five now. Because my husband started business now sweating it out my body's processes medication. Having like thought more now you know, like crazy thoughts into because I guess it was about like cravings and stuff like that drug dreams and stuff I never had before I don't know it's like medications not working or if it's just like Okay, I really am at now, when I was the first time."
165.0,Provider,"So I mean it looks like you're using a lot of opiates and and I, you know i'm not a doctor, so I can't change your dose I am going to make a note that your that your dose it seems inadequate. Definitely bring it up to her talk to her about it because it's not abnormal to start at a higher dose. Usually, what happens is people start like you know we start people around 16 milligrams and then. Should they need it will move up a little bit, but if there's a dose identification Phase I mean anything like up to three is pretty much the the CAP like your receptors at that point can't really handle a whole lot more they're pretty reflooded. But it's normal to have cravings and thoughts at 16 milligrams I just don't want you to use both that's My biggest concern so just. Like like."

Okay, so I will so i'm gonna let her know that the dose is kind of wearing off for you, but make sure that you tell her about that talk to her about it because she'll. she'll want to talk to you about it and make a decision with you, I just can't change it, because i'm not a doctor and she you know I can't change it goes in between encounters but. i've been i'm just doing this payment I usually don't do this anymore so.

No okay i'm just crossing t's and dotting i's um okay so let's look at your thing here, you were right, you do have an appointment on the 30th that is an individual therapy okay. I do want to just break this down for you, because it seems like it helps people when they hear it this way. On the 30th you have your first individual therapy session they call it a bio psychosocial it's really overwhelming, in the name bps. it's just you know what how you met with the doctor, for the first time, you did your intake with them. With her it's exactly the same thing with a therapist is just treatment planning so don't get weird and like it's a good thing it's a good one to attend and we also have like will get mad at you, if you don't do it within the first couple few weeks okay. And then your prescriptions get shorter and then it's not just make sure you go to that. I got."

Now I have CBS on oh and Dr for you is that the is that the pharmacy we're using. yeah okay perfect. And i'm just going to write at my chart note here, I might even talk to myself for a second, while I do so, and then i'll call with you here on the phone, so I can tell you in real time that it's done. soon."
9810.0,Patient,Why people don't feel funny their little routine.
165.0,Provider,"I don't care no like me I people people either, like me, or they don't, but they do. I."
9810.0,Patient,"Look, when I go pick my prescription that place. i'm like I could be you know Rebecca musical."
165.0,Provider,"Well yeah and that's The thing is, if. You were there getting something else it'd be like I mean like you know you could get have like a million oxycodone and they wouldn't. flinch and then. yeah i'm so sorry. No. problem, let me know."
9810.0,Patient,coupon. Even more hey how y'all doing it.
165.0,Provider,"Oh, my God. Well, you know, in the more your normal that the more you're gonna break that stigma, you know. that's The thing is like. I mean yeah I mean I use IBM methamphetamine for like eight years eight or nine years and people don't know it when they see me, and so, when I when I hear that people have stigmas i'm like. It sucks because only because you know only because you see the medication like it's only like if you. Like I would get probably really weird looks if people knew my history if that by looking at me, you know and it's hard it's it's just I feel for you guys. I mean I don't have a medication that I can take for mine but. that's the only reason why I feel for you well, but I wish I did that'd be cool. So i'm going to call it a six day supply number 12 films to CBS on own Dr i'm just going to disconnect from audio and then i'll bounce back in when i'm done if it's all if there might be a hold but i'm, not forgetting about you i'll just be here."
9810.0,Patient,Thank you.
165.0,Provider,"All right, we are good to go, I called that into pharmacists Ryan over there okay. And then the only other thing that I would say, is, I saw they were smoking, so if you ever feel like you want to decrease your use of cigarettes, I know that don't do too many things at once, but. If you want to decrease your use or eliminate your use of cigarettes talk to your doctor about it because she might have an idea of something that might be good for you to."
