304.0,Provider,hi how are you.
3846.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, how are you."
304.0,Provider,Are you are you home now for the day.
3846.0,Patient,yeah I literally just walked in and then took a shower and then yeah. yeah oh get out of school until. Four and it takes an hour to get back on Thursdays so.
304.0,Provider,Oh that's right so you're having to go to a different campus.
3846.0,Patient,carbondale that's about 15 minutes for me.
304.0,Provider,"wow okay so you're doing it that's why you're doing a little bit in person, a little bit online."
3846.0,Patient,"A three of them are online I tried to get the last one online, but unfortunately they didn't he wouldn't let me do it. Because there's like a group project involved. But so yeah. Unfortunately, that class has two days a week, and on Tuesday I got to go all the way up there. Just for like a 15 minute class."
304.0,Provider,Right you spend more time driving.
3846.0,Patient,"Right, but I mean Thursday on more okay with because then i've got the class and the lab all my other stuff is all online. Which so far hasn't been too bad this semester so."
304.0,Provider,how's work been.
3846.0,Patient,"busy i'm proud of myself I got asked to work overnight on Thursday next week and I told him like hey there's just i'm sorry but there's no way I can do that. I can't go to school, all day have a test and everything and then have to work all day at the hospital on Friday and work overnight Thursday night I just can't do that."
304.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"kind of proud of myself for saying no. Because my first instinct is, how can I rearrange my schedule to make it work for those people."
304.0,Provider,You you were really just firm saying absolutely not I just can't make it work.
3846.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I asked, we asked a little bit i'm like well i'm sorry I can't because blah blah blah blah blah blah, but I still said no so."
304.0,Provider,"Baby steps it still counts, yes. Do you find yourself. Right like Well, I can. Because this, and this, and this, and this. or. Just just explaining and justifying because there's all those thoughts of like what are they going to think they're going to think i'm a bad worker and I have to give those sort of excuses or reasons um and yeah yeah you said no, which is is the point. But yeah I think is you get like a little a little further on just say no, no."
3846.0,Patient,"Well, after that, on my way home, I was sitting thinking to myself and i'm like well. You know, I have to think that. While this other person's conferences, important and, while this other person vacation is important, they aren't more important to them my class or my job at the hospital. Those things are important to. And I mean I know we're really short staffed and everything sucks for everybody in the world, right now, but. And I think our newest drama is that they've decided to add on like 10 jobs because of grants Illinois has gotten as far as crisis care. Which is great I love that Illinois is responding to like the defund the police movement with stepping up of crisis and mental health care, I think that's awesome. But because of that the state is now mandating that we hire like. Wanting engagement specialist and peer support specialists and crisis workers extra ones. And we don't have any room now. So I don't know where they're all going to go. Because we've got teeny tiny little office sharing them right now, and I mean I can't I can do some of my work from home, but most of it, I can't because it's not like I can bring clients to my house. And I mean I go to their houses, sometimes and I guess according to stupid state of Illinois rules i'm supposed to do that 60% of the time spent a natural environment. But the natural environment, you know. What is this big."
304.0,Provider,What does that mean.
3846.0,Patient,"So I they what they mean is that 60% of the time that you spend with the client. should be in the Community in some way. Whether that's at their house or. taking them to the store or whatever. And I mean, I get the purpose of that, but you know some of my clients don't want me in their house."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
3846.0,Patient,Like I got. You I got a mother son hoarding do that are really not okay with having people with their house.
304.0,Provider,And oh I wouldn't be wanting to go into their house either.
3846.0,Patient,"I mean I don't want to, but it's kind of my job so we're doing baby steps next week we've been working on like background and then next week, I am going to their house. i'm going to have her bring a box outside and we're going to sort through like one singular box of items. out how it."
304.0,Provider,looks yeah yeah.
3846.0,Patient,we'll see how it goes.
304.0,Provider,yeah maybe then you can eat your way into.
3846.0,Patient,Like.
304.0,Provider,The garage or the.
3846.0,Patient,"She wants to do her kitchen my I had her set because I like concrete, tangible goals, because I think it makes people feel better if they can see their own progress, and you know renews motivation to want to do more, so the tangible goal is for her to. Have a clean kitchen within the next six months to a year. Her son's goal is to because he doesn't he's got some health problems and doesn't really like to not to do anything other than play video games, so my goal for him in the next three months is to make it all the way around the block walk with me."
304.0,Provider,yeah. good place to start. yeah i'm doing.
3846.0,Patient,"healing slowly but surely, I mean i'm a little. reserved resentful at the moment just because of. I don't think we had the world's best attorney for his case or I don't think the Attorney took it very seriously, because nobody explained to us until I had to start researching it for one of my hospital clients that hey he could have just quit and then we could have gotten unemployment. I mean you don't normally get unemployment if he quit but in his case he had a justified reason for quitting he couldn't physically do the job anymore, so we totally would have gotten the unemployment we wouldn't have just had to be poor all the time. But nobody took the time to explain that to me."
304.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
3846.0,Patient,You would think the lawyer would have. No insight.
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, and that was always like my. I don't know misconception, I guess is that right it's only if you're."
3846.0,Patient,"You know, let go let go."
304.0,Provider,yeah and I quit.
3846.0,Patient,"But I guess it counts. quitting is okay if there's like a tangible physical reason you can't do the job because I mean then it's not your fault that you're quitting. But on the positive side, he is going to. start working at my old job in the next couple weeks. I kind of feel bad because I signed him up for it, and my boss likes them and that's going well, but. he's all worried that she's not getting back in touch with them fast enough and stuff and i'm like I promise you, they want you, they just are so overworked that she doesn't have time to call. But she will I promise, because your adobe. I mean, she already told the height the clients that she's hiring a man and some of the clients got all excited about it so. that's where I worked at the mental health residential. i'm done in May I just keep trying to remind myself that it's only a few more months of crazy."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"it's awesome alive, but."
304.0,Provider,"Well, but really like you'll have I don't know if you get like fall break you know thanksgiving long Christmas break."
3846.0,Patient,We get a month between semesters.
304.0,Provider,yeah that's nice that's good. yeah we put.
3846.0,Patient,"We put down a deposit on a. Well, our 1010 year anniversary is in October and we wanted to go away for it not anything extravagant just like a three day vacation. But because of school and work and everything else that's just not going to be possible, so we're going to go in January, instead, and we put down a deposit for. Like three nights in a cabin So hopefully it works out."
304.0,Provider,"And then my in laws are going to come hang out with felony animals. Nice we're just somewhere in like by the lake or by the mountains, I don't know I guess there's no mountains close to you."
3846.0,Patient,I don't actually know but I mean it's just in the woods somewhere.
304.0,Provider,Would yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"My my my only like requirement was it was that it had like a hot done. Anything with a hotter but just one. So. I mean, I tried it i'm trying to get better, as I get older at not getting ridiculously disappointed about stuff like I wanted to be upset and cry that we couldn't go in October, when our anniversary actually is because i'm like look it's just one more thing. That doesn't work out the way it's supposed to but trying to be positive and be like it's okay it's still going to happen it's just a couple months bear right. Yes."
304.0,Provider,And you can still do something on your actual anniversary right I go to dinner yeah have a date night.
3846.0,Patient,"Sorry, this is normally the time of day, where i'm getting all my crap ready for tomorrow."
304.0,Provider,"So no worries Mary well let's um. Are you going to stay you're going to stay in the 7pm group that. I mean, I wish. I didn't have to I know. wish I don't know."
3846.0,Patient,"Not I would much rather go to an earlier group. And just. For the Group purposes, but I mean. With my schedule the way it is right now I just can't."
304.0,Provider,"No worries no every every time, like any of our groups have gotten really crowded I tell the care navigators and I do not schedule anyone else into that group, like it's full and they're like well well well that's the only time the patient can do it i'm like wow."
3846.0,Patient,that's not fair to location here.
304.0,Provider,"Maybe they need another provider did I did I did you hear me say that I don't know if I guess you were in group on the 7pm Group when I said that when people were or no Maybe it was people from I think it was. This week, people in the 11am group, so no you didn't hear this people in the 11 o'clock group were saying well hey if I miss my 11 o'clock group or if I miss you know the 12 o'clock group can I come to the 7pm and I said no, I said, you know this group is already crowded enough. So we really not was."
3846.0,Patient,"Fine, when we only had a few people."
304.0,Provider,"Right, I said, you know. In the 7pm group, like are working full time, and so this is really the only time they can do it, I said so it's really not fair to them that, like, if you want to come and then that group is just even more and more crowded when just because you overslept. So."
3846.0,Patient,It really seems like they need to get another provider yeah and make like another evening group that's on a different day.
304.0,Provider,"And, did you hear that there's there's two new doctors. Getting on board. yay oh yeah so that will be great so anybody new will um well what are those those two new doctors and a new therapist and."
3846.0,Patient,"Thank you, they get a new clinician to them."
304.0,Provider,And in a new therapist yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"Okay, good."
304.0,Provider,"yeah so that that will be someone else's. figure out yes yeah so they can figure out um yeah I hope they might recognize that there is a need for evening because then everyone's going to say, well, no, I want to come without the holsters evening group and we're like no. So yeah we'll see but hopefully a few people from like from our 7pm group because yeah I really want to save that. For for people who are working, I don't think that you don't like to wake up in the morning as an excuse, so."
3846.0,Patient,yeah no certainly not when you have like a 12 option. I mean there's plenty of.
304.0,Provider,"yeah so i'm hoping i'm thinking it'll it'll get a little bit more balanced yeah, especially now that we have these two new doctors all the new people can go to them, and I mean I. Sad to say, but I mean people will drop out so."
3846.0,Patient,Honestly it's been we had I don't know they have several of them so i'm sure you've heard of it gateway. foundation.
304.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"The REP from there came to buy us all lunch yesterday. On Wednesday. So that was an interesting conversation because i'm like sitting over there lonely in my corner, the only one that's like kind of progressive on things and i'm was have to keep my mouth shut. Because I like I. tried to ask what I thought were good questions i'm like you know well, are you going to offer. Continuing map therapy and are you going to offer you know outpatient options and so far they're like yeah we don't really do that because we don't really believe in that and i'm like okay."
304.0,Provider,wow you're like I tried.
3846.0,Patient,"And I tried. But most of the people I either work with, or even the gateway guy you know they. They have a lot of experience working with whether it's like parole and probation or D CFS and so you know their experience is pretty negative as far as client interaction and retention and following the rules and stuff like that. And I mean I get that but I think at some point it's like you can't let that just jade you forever into not trusting any clients. That point I think you need to switch positions."
304.0,Provider,Right right and I feel like if you're. In in that those organizations like you should really like that population.
3846.0,Patient,"Right exactly. And I mean they I said because i'm a sucker I said this is done in May that I would go do the CBC. which I will, although that's actually going to screw them a little bit, because then they're going to need to shuffle my clients around because i'll have to have at least 51% be substance abuse. Like i'll do it, but you're probably not gonna like the way I want to do it."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"My philosophy is going to be a little different than yours. But i'll do it. But that's my plan short term is i'm going to. In May, when i'm done because the bachelor once I have the degree that that will cover I think like 100 hours of the CDC for Illinois and then i'll only need like another 50 hours before I can go take the test so shouldn't take that long."
304.0,Provider,"yeah over the summer, maybe."
3846.0,Patient,"yeah so get that done, and then I can get that credential because I mean we all we both know that this career path is how many acronyms can you get at the end of your name. And do that and then si you is offering finally a completely online masters in social work so."
304.0,Provider,yeah you told me about that.
3846.0,Patient,"I mean i'm i'm i'm struggling with it a little bit because I feel like that's the path of least resistance and it's the easiest path to like get me immediately, where I want to go. But. I don't know if that's really, what I want because I don't know that I really want a social work degree, like, I would really rather have. An llc PC CPC and be like you know. licensed clinical social worker license sorry licensed counselor but it's much harder to find degree programs in this area that do that and I guess Illinois. One of my other bosses was a cleaning. For the clinical social worker, you only need the one license. But for. The licensed practicing counselors or clinical counselors you have to get like to."
304.0,Provider,"Well, and you know that social workers are the only ones that can bill medicaid."
3846.0,Patient,"And I know and that's part of the problem we're having as a. organization is that we can get our medicaid and medicare clients and pretty quick, because we have more social workers but we've got a waiting list of bajillion miles long for private insurance."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean yeah Mary I have i'm probably out of 60 patients, I have two that are self pay, maybe three that are self pay. I mean really for for my bright heart people probably 90% or medicaid. So that's why i'm yeah I have to co sign, even the lpc sees notes. So. They can't yeah they can't build medicaid independently."
3846.0,Patient,"So do you think it's. Because, where I want to be is across the desk from teenagers working without."
304.0,Provider,A social worker can do honestly I mean a social worker is a much broader scope of practice than an lpc. Their equivalent they can both practice independently um I mean outside of medicaid so an lpc can have a private practice and can bill insurance and be credentialed for insurance or you know just accept self pay. But yeah lpc sees cannot bill medicaid. And so.
3846.0,Patient,Does that work the opposite way. For workers bill private insurance.
304.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah. Okay yeah social workers can be in private practice can be in. anywhere so. yeah you can do private practice, you can be credentialed with all the big insurance companies. If I set up an llc I could have my own private practice."
3846.0,Patient,Have you ever thought about continuing on and getting your doctor.
304.0,Provider,No.
3846.0,Patient,I was just curious because I.
304.0,Provider,yeah.
3846.0,Patient,"I mean you don't really need one. Mental health, not in social work."
304.0,Provider,"Because a doctorate in social work would be more. research and teaching. And a PhD in psychology I mean really like I would be doing the same thing you know I maybe i'd make more money as a psychologist if I really wanted to do things like testing for kids. You know, psychologists do a lot of those a lot of testing. Right in like autism, you know a lot of those those just psychological testing things."
3846.0,Patient,All I knew I always. go into psychiatry I have no.
304.0,Provider,Interest in going to Medical School.
3846.0,Patient,"Because, and I know that they mostly just end up writing prescriptions all day and I don't want to do that, I want to actually do the therapy."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you know can online, and you can even search like i'll see us w versus lpc. And the you know, once you get to the full level of of licensure it is equivalent, but I think the agencies that are willing to hire social workers there's just so many more opportunities, just because the scope of practice. Right is so much more and it'll take you, you know, two or three years to get your lcs w. So. are more likely to hire an LM s w then like I don't know what the counselor equivalent would be because LM s w can practice. You know, under supervision."
3846.0,Patient,"Right, the girl next to me just finished at the same college i'm at. And then took an extra trauma informed care course so she pretty much is going all on her own she's just you know we need those Supervisor to sign the notes or whatever."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean so, so I think agencies and social workers are are there's more you know so an agency if they have an lcs w. You know it's like Okay, now we have someone to supervise you. And you get that."
3846.0,Patient,Right.
304.0,Provider,"You get your hours you know, so that you can sit for your exam. So."
3846.0,Patient,"I mean, I think I think that's probably the best course of action is to just go and do that because the online PR it's all online and it's they said, if you do part time it's 18 months or 24 months and full time would be 18 months."
304.0,Provider,"And look at like your practical to you know, so your first year practical is maybe you doing it where you work, but maybe your second year practical. You know you really tailor it to something more clinical you know something to do with teams, you know something that's really focused on on the population, you want to work with."
3846.0,Patient,"Well yeah that's the hope. I mean it's just and unfortunately I, and then I want to like I was ashamed to Dan and my dad like really want me to walk in May and i'm going to do it, but it's against my nature to do it because I kind of feel like I don't deserve it. Because I took too long to do it, you know what I mean it's like you're not. You kind of this is silly you know what I mean. But i'm trying to be more understanding and be like well okay yeah you're. But you took 10 years off to raise a kid and she's a good kid and that counts do."
304.0,Provider,"Yes, yes it's okay um. yeah i'm. Well i'm gonna let you get to your family and. Get."
3846.0,Patient,Do you want to just make our next appointment on Tuesday.
304.0,Provider,"You know i'm looking right now, I have a bunch of stuff going on. In October i'm. Can we do later in October, like the 28th is a Thursday."
3846.0,Patient,"yeah do you have later in the day, like this."
304.0,Provider,yeah um I could you. So October 28 is a Thursday yeah you want to do five o'clock again or No six o'clock.
3846.0,Patient,yeah that'd be great.
304.0,Provider,Time okay. awesome.
3846.0,Patient,Could you either send me an email or remind me of that.
304.0,Provider,"I will yeah I know sorry so far out, I had to go through all my dates and like."
3846.0,Patient,"I know it's time for other people that need you more than I, but I also know that. For the Agency rules, I have to see you occasionally."
304.0,Provider,Right and i'm hoping i'm like now that the new doctors are coming on I think like that'll even out our groups and that'll even out. My case a little bit too so.
3846.0,Patient,"Good luck, I hope so."
304.0,Provider,"I hope so too. Well, and then they call."
3846.0,Patient,"crazy brains going on, because. I have curly hair."
304.0,Provider,that's your trick.
3846.0,Patient,One of them yeah.
304.0,Provider,"yeah I know I they tell me they're like well, they say you're only available two days a week i'm like yep."
3846.0,Patient,"I am, what do you, what do you do the other days."
304.0,Provider,Take care of my kids.
3846.0,Patient,"Okay, so you just work part time."
304.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah I do.
3846.0,Patient,"I thought, maybe offer another agency, there is."
304.0,Provider,"No yeah this is, this is my this was my whole goal that I get to work a little bit, but basically be home with them so yeah I started. I wanted to just keep it at 10 hours a week, but now my youngest is in preschool so she and she only goes two days a week, so i'm trying to kind of keep all my days like when they're in school. Thursdays, I do I do late, but then you know now i'm doing Tuesday, so I kind of like to give that Tuesday evening group to somebody but we'll see."
3846.0,Patient,So you don't want to leave oh.
304.0,Provider,"yeah I know I know it's hard, because you know elementary school they're in school for someone to the day. and it's like gosh I miss you their whole day is in school so yeah i'm trying to just balance everything out but i'll be here for now yeah i'm kind of stick to like 10 hours a week."
3846.0,Patient,"So all right, well, I will see you on Tuesday."
304.0,Provider,"sounds good, Mary."
