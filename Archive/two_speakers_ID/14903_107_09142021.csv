107.0,Provider,Hello.
14903.0,Patient,Hello.
107.0,Provider,"hi can I get you to give me your name and your date of birth, just so I can verify who you are."
14903.0,Patient,"Yes, Angela can gora and may 1 1990."
107.0,Provider,"Perfect Thank you very much, Angela my name is Helene a row here, I am a licensed marriage and family therapist and I will be working with you today to do a level of care assessment. Your insurance company recommended that we chat about that is that makes sense to you. Yes, okay so i'm just going to kind of jump right in with information that you provided me, but then we're going to get into kind of what brings you here, your big picture and we'll hopefully catch all. The things we need to talk about today, but if, at any point in time you're like what are you talking about you need a clarifying question just stop me. and ask your questions okay okay so before we dive in is there anything pressing that you have concerns about or worries about in our meeting."
14903.0,Patient,And no not at the moment.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so in looking at your survey, we had to do a couple of different surveys, we had to do a pH Q nine, which is a rating on how you may feel in terms of sadness or depression. We had to do a gad seven, which is about anxiety and then we had to do kind of an overall, how do you generally feel about life day to day in terms of emotions and then, as well as looking at eating disorder behaviors or or behaviors around food and exercise that kind of thing. So, based on the surveys, it looks like for your pH Q nine, you are a seven and for your dad seven you were attend so depression seven gadson or anxiety attend What that means is that you were still in the mild range. So there's a zero or like it's not an issue mild moderate severe and one of the skills moderates here so. When you kind of made note of your various emotions, you were either neutral little bit low or an under neutral a little bit high over neutral, but it sounds like that kind of. sits with the mild, so there are things that come up for you in terms of feeling sad or feeling anxious but it's not necessarily something that rules your day, would you agree with that or."
14903.0,Patient,"um yeah. I think, to a certain extent um I have like a lot of anxiety, I would say, sometimes it just varies. Each day. Sometimes, like I have like very good days and sometimes you know it fluctuates where i'm feeling very anxious, or you know what might happen or like just kind of anxious about the thoughts I might have like throughout the day so yeah I would say it's pretty late. mild moderate. Okay okay yeah."
107.0,Provider,"to your awareness or understanding is there anything that happens that kind of cues up your anxiety or provokes your anxieties there, maybe, like the way you slept or certain situation or people or circumstances that maybe."
14903.0,Patient,"um yeah there's maybe I noticed like if I don't see bright, you know things I at like tends to like increase throughout the day. But sometimes like little things like in terms like those week my eating disorder like i'm. Just like those thoughts come in my head like throughout the game of course. And that causes anxiety for me."
107.0,Provider,Do you talk to a therapist you have somebody that you're working with on a regular basis in terms of managing your mood.
14903.0,Patient,"i'm not at the moment I used to see a therapist just over the phone um but. My doctors trying to have me see her again because I was seeing a psychiatrist but I wasn't taking or I chose not to take any medication because that's what I prefer. So um. There was no reason for me to continue seeing this psychiatrists so she wanted to switch me over to. My therapist I was seeing so not seeing her at the moment, but I should be in the future, like."
107.0,Provider,A scheduled appointment or.
14903.0,Patient,Not not yet.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so. When you were talking to the psychiatrist about medication what types of medications were they recommending."
14903.0,Patient,"That I don't recall, I believe it was. And it's starting here with an Ai believe i'm not too sure, but I don't oh yeah."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, I was just curious. and your thought about medication what comes up for you, when you think about taking medication."
14903.0,Patient,"um I personally. don't want to take medication. I have taken. antidepressants before. Over three months I don't recall the name it was say probably 2016 17 i'm. interested in like how I made me feel, I understand that you know there's different kinds, but I prefer like a more natural way I don't want to depend on medication."
107.0,Provider,With me. Do you have anybody in your family who's ever needed to be medicated or struggles with mood issues anxiety depression anything like that on mom's side dad side siblings.
14903.0,Patient,"My mom's side, mostly my cousins they take like antidepressants my mom has taken some, but she doesn't favorite either. Yes, so. um but besides that that's basically to what I know who takes them."
107.0,Provider,And is there anybody in your family or somebody close to you that struggled with addiction or substance abuse or anything like that.
14903.0,Patient,No okay.
107.0,Provider,What about anybody in your family who struggles with food stuff.
14903.0,Patient,No okay.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so what kinds of skills, would you identify or things that you do to manage when you're feeling sad or anxious."
14903.0,Patient,"um. I will okay I picked up a lot on journaling. And that's very helpful for me, because it helps me a link very grounding. into way might trigger the thoughts and like really nicely um you know here's a thought like being more aware of it. Another thing would be like going on my mind, for a walk i'm realizing like you know, instead of focusing on like these, like, I guess, like women in beliefs that i'm like feeling that's causing me to feel like a certain way, I could be more aware by just like going on for a walk and everything. Another thing would be like reading. Because it causes me like you know. To be more involved in my the story i'm reading in like."
107.0,Provider,"A little distracted. Okay, great. So when you go for walks How long do you go or how far do you go."
14903.0,Patient,um it's just around like the block. yeah just around my neighborhood.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm asking obviously because exercise can be kind of a thing is that something that you do to manage way or to deal with food or do you exercise."
14903.0,Patient,"um I am Eastern like do tilly where i'm at right now exercises not very late. An important thing throughout my day I do like to go on walks but, to a certain extent I also. forgot to mention I like doing yoga. More like I see it's more like to help me like. Like stretch in the morning and I see is more like my fully. I like to ride my bike and I used to before seeing that like a form of exercise too and i'm trying not to see it as that but more. Like a joyful movement."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like exercise may have been kind of a thing for you in the past but you're trying to be more mindful of how you take it on now."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah it definitely was in the past, it was like I use that I think as like. almost like as a coping mechanism like. So terms for my eating disorder like yeah I used it to like control my way in everything like an eye over exercise. And i'm trying to find like. i'm balance in that like lifestyle, like in the future, like when I am ready to incorporate wake movement in my life like like I are like exercise and want to be able to enjoy it rather than see as a way to control how I look all the time, like being really strict about it."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, great."
14903.0,Patient,mm hmm.
107.0,Provider,"So certainly your mood is going to be affected by how you're taking care of yourself physically and motion, you know kind of what's going on around you and then in terms of how you see yourself so in terms of your awareness of your body and maybe. Maybe you have some body distortions, because that can be kind of a thing, where you think it's one thing and everybody else would see it as something else. So is there anything else in terms of mood that we should acknowledge before we get into your eating behaviors and habits or can we kind of move into that now."
14903.0,Patient,"i'm in terms of mean I know that it just varies every day like. there's stuff that might trigger it, you know, like media's being one of them. Okay that's a big one i'm. Just certain like my be likes I can't like specify, but like things people say maybe throughout the day or like if I see someone like post like you know that they're exercising and stuff like that so it's more like. I guess like triggers of media."
107.0,Provider,composer you get notifications on your phone or how are you tracking the social media you just have the Apps open and you're looking at things are.
14903.0,Patient,"it's mostly through I guess like. instagram like videos or like snapchat like that I follow that. And like you know I I am aware that you know I can unfollow them, you know they can do their thing, but the same time, like you know it's like. To face reality like i'm going to have to be exposed like it's going to happen, like either way you know throughout my life so it's like best to like just learn how to cope with these things and just like. i'm realize like it's kind of like to each their own like they can do what they feel is right, and like honestly like I try to remind myself like social media is a pretty fate to like what people. want to see, or to be been so like I try to remind myself to like I couldn't follow them but they're my friends or like they know them, and so I can either meet them or be or just be more resilient to that. You just kind of like expose myself."
107.0,Provider,sounds like you're trying to tell yourself suck it up Sally.
14903.0,Patient,"yeah in the way, like this kind of more resuming because it's like Ross i'm going to be running around like with a lot of triggers and adding On top of that, in everything in it is like being are isolating myself and my guys to isolate myself so much just have to feel those. Emotions when they do get triggered in like I don't want to isolate my soul. Right."
107.0,Provider,"yeah I don't want you to isolate yourself either However, I wonder if there isn't kind of a happy medium, where you could take a break from some of it. Like maybe there's some that's a little more triggering than others, and as you're building your skill set you kind of take a break from some of that so that down the line you have more resiliency you can manage it a little easier."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah that is also true, I in terms of like social media like. Everyone has it, so I kind of tell myself like it's okay to have it my before I try not having like. Deleting lamps and then that was just like I went to be extremely and. The more I like. You know just completely cut it off the more I thought about it so it's just like little things like minimizing it. throughout your day and just like following more like I guess self help accounts like that's what really is helping me instead."
107.0,Provider,So yeah changing it around a little bit and how you approach it. yeah okay good. Well let's kind of talk a little bit about your history with food and your history with your body and kind of what you've done up to this point to deal with all that so Have you had a therapist Have you ever gone into a program or treatment or anything like that.
14903.0,Patient,"yeah i've been to. A facility in fremont it's called Center for discovery. Maybe about 10 days i'm. Like discharged myself, but I was impatient. or yeah."
107.0,Provider,"yeah i'm familiar sorry i'm familiar with their program was there anything in particular that was problematic to you that it was just hard to be there, or was there something going on that didn't feel like a good fit."
14903.0,Patient,"For me, listen to much really good fit just because, like I kind of wanted that like exposure again like. To be like more like reality kind of because we're waking up like at six in the morning showering every day and like um you know, like, I can get used to like every team like, if I had to you know but it's like. Coming out of that facility I didn't see myself like I still wanted to be myself, you know and have like. A more realistic reality like I don't wake up at six in the morning shower every day, like, I just wanted to be like more realistic in my. I love their resources in my foot therapy and like you know being together, I just didn't really like kind of the routinely hand."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you done any other kind of programs."
14903.0,Patient,"No, it was just that one."
107.0,Provider,And when was that.
14903.0,Patient,That was like in March.
107.0,Provider,"Of this year yeah. Okay, and. How would you say have things gotten better worse or the same since you left them."
14903.0,Patient,"um I feel like they've gotten better. Because they're at first like I mean. I have to give myself some credit like before going into the facility I just like couldn't imagine, where I would be like feature like can now but um. I would say, like after a discharge myself, it was like a little bit better and then they kind of like. And went back."
107.0,Provider,To goes up and down haha.
14903.0,Patient,"yeah and they will back down like where I just kind of. went back to like my old hammonds and like I started thinking. The same as I did before, but, and then I don't know like I started doing more like stuff to help me cope differently. In my. You know just little steps, I sent my little goals, I said each day and everything, I think that really helped me, so I am getting a little bit better you know, from what I was doing before."
107.0,Provider,And are you seeing a therapist or a dietitian now.
14903.0,Patient,i'm just a dietitian.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, how often do you see your dietitian."
14903.0,Patient,"um I have one. This month the 23rd I usually see her like maybe away. Twice a month, but it's over the phone so but yeah she did get in touch with. The dietitian that I was working with at the facility as well, so. Okay yeah."
107.0,Provider,Do you have a meal plan that you're following with the dietitian or what do you guys check in on about.
14903.0,Patient,"So um yeah she does like develop like sample like meal plans for me. I have a history with weight and calorie counting and like being like. So focused on that that like I kind of told her, she kind of works with me to wait help minimize that you know area, so I don't miss resort back to that because that's like very like I don't know like it makes me feel like actively counting all the time, like kind of like OCD tendencies. And so I don't want to do that and I haven't been doing that and it's been like helping me a lot, I mean there is times, where I just feel like I should have been, and I, you know kind of ground myself again to not doing that."
107.0,Provider,"So, have you guys talked about kind of measuring food or creating spaces on a plate that you feel so that it's not about calories too much is about space."
14903.0,Patient,"um she didn't. recommend me a what is it the portion clean. flight. You know you visualize like. The amount of food in everything and it has like its own sections of way of proteins car. Yes, and. fruits and vegetables and everything. But that also is helpful to me."
107.0,Provider,"So do you have a portion plate, or do you have a little area I mean have you been able to kind of recreate that so it's something you use when you eat."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah I have one I already in it off Amazon, so I have one."
107.0,Provider,Great how often would you say use it.
14903.0,Patient,"um. let's say, not as much recently. Because I kind of dislike I bully you know. I don't like using it, because it's using it too much because it's just like. I don't know I rather like use an actual plane in."
107.0,Provider,"feel like too much food, maybe."
14903.0,Patient,i'm. not always.
107.0,Provider,But sometimes. yeah okay. So it looks like mainly you restrict that kind of your gig that you are very conscientious and you're kind of limiting the amount of food that you can have.
14903.0,Patient,yeah yeah before I mean it's getting better each day I was saying before I would be very restricted and everything like yeah.
107.0,Provider,And it doesn't look like exercise is a big deal it's more about because you've been working on that it's more about what kinds of foods you're eating or how much you're eating or like worrying about. How much energy you're taking into your body things like that.
14903.0,Patient,"yeah it's more just like because I did have a history with like over exercising in restricting myself, which is why I, like my we went down dress and. Now it's more of just trying to find a guess that balance of late, incorporating like call foods in my diet. And like knowing like how much is like enough for my guy needs that kind of like guidance."
107.0,Provider,"So i'm gonna kind of go sideways here for a minute, do you are you working or going to school, how are you spending your time during the day."
14903.0,Patient,"So, at the moment um I was working before, but I got put on disability. Disability pain. And i'm going to school i'm taking one class online on I recently I was studying a lot for the nursing program and I recently got accepted, which is really."
107.0,Provider,Congratulations that's exciting.
14903.0,Patient,"Thank you, and like you know I do that kinda in a way motivates me to really getting how you."
107.0,Provider,"Carry yourself, maybe."
14903.0,Patient,So you can yeah.
107.0,Provider,and be ready to be a nurse so it's a lot of work. yeah yeah.
14903.0,Patient,requires a lot of energy. Human power you got to make sure your brains all. That.
107.0,Provider,ready to go okay.
14903.0,Patient,yeah I have to take care of myself break and take care of others so that's like that that's kind of keeping me motivated. And i'm going to go free to college and i'm taking one class but it's online okay. um yeah I just been working that. yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So when you work with your dietitian are you doing any kind of like recovery record or any kind of daily reporting or accountability, or you meet twice a month you just kind of review how it's gone since the last time you met with them."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah mostly the second one we kind of just like. When it's is your how has your diet in looking like or like what did you eat or like we talk about stuff like that, and like shooting on. kind of recommend slate on her site If she thinks oh like you know incorporate the same diet, or like maybe add my snacks you know and then she really goes along with like the meal example. But it's kind of I would say, like it is helpful because she wait gave me a sample or like a guy but in a way it's kind of like I know, every day, is going to be different. So it's like. word of flaky know. If there's a day like or I go out tea or something you know, and I used to be really scared of that like getting takeout and stuff like that so it's like kind of like. I don't know I feel like maybe if we met in person or she gave plate. Maybe another another sample idea or. I don't know it would be really helpful to see her more often, I would say."
107.0,Provider,"So i'm kind of jumping the gun here a little bit, but just hearing kind of what you're sharing and hearing your expectations in terms of work and school and all of that. It sounds like what would be a good fit for you is going into a partial hospitalization program which sounds very serious and scary but really what that means is that it's 20 hours a week. So it's not some where you live. But it's the support of getting the dietary support oftentimes you. Are interacting with somebody in a dietary fashion every day or five days a week. Maybe you're eating with the other people who are in the program so that you're working on kind of portion sizes and having some accountability with that, because it could be that. Something for you feels like the right amount, when in fact it should actually be this amount, and you have somebody challenging you and pushing you a little bit in that. And there's a lot to be said for that level of accountability plus you would do therapy groups and individual sessions and that kind of work. But it's not somewhere that you have to live and get up at six o'clock in the morning, so it doesn't kind of dictate your schedule in that way, it is a pretty involved program it's 20 hours a week is that, as a part time job for sure. But maybe based on your circumstances that's something that might be able to fit into your schedule fairly easy depending on what's in your area, it would either be online or in person there's a level of. Being in person and kind of having that accountability to the portion sizes that's really important. But you know life being what it is these days we'll see kind of what's in your area this recommendation. will come from your insurance company, so I don't you know I won't know kind of what's in your what's available to you in terms of resources and benefits but. that's kind of what i'm leaning to based on what i'm hearing, I think you need more than just seeing a dietitian every other week I think you need to have regular accountability and then, if you were to do that. And kind of take that pretty seriously and maybe you do that for a few months, then maybe you could drop down to less time a week till eventually. Maybe you're only doing one to two hours a week over time and you're building up your skill set and you kind of been able to conquer a lot of your fears and concerns you have around food and. perception of people's body, you know their thoughts about your body your thoughts about kind of managing all that, what do you think."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah I think so, too, my doctor recommended me a a place in Santa Cruz cuz I live near Santa Cruz. Okay it's called the Lotus collaborative. For you okay yeah it's like they do offer the partial hospital like. In and I did look into that and then that's what I was actually leaning towards doing since I do have this like free time. or late keno enough time to do that and it's close by, so it works out, but the thing is that their requirements are based off with BMI. And so. In order to have that or to go into that I have to be a BMI of 16 and right now might be in my is about like 14.2 so I mean my doctor told me, you know as. i'm if I really want to do that i'm gonna need to like you know at least try to get up to that BMI into in order. That partial."
107.0,Provider,"Tough to do on your own, have you thought about maybe. You go into residential for a short period of time and then and then graduate to partial so maybe they could help you get to the 16 and then from there you go to the partial."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah I would. I was considering that too. Okay um because, like as much as I want to say Oh, I can do it on my own, you know have that resilience, you know, there is a point where I have to like face it, wait I probably do need. The help, and if the resources are available to me, in that, and I can like. get the help I need my have that goal, where I don't have to be in residential to him, where I could chance. To finish. The partial that. would be really great."
107.0,Provider,"yeah because it's really not about suck it up Sally. it's really not about you just need to have more willpower you just need to be more resilient you just need to be I mean on some level sure that's true for everybody, about everything, but not where you're at right now, your brain is is pretty malnourished. You know i'll speak to the health care provider betting within you that there's your brain needs more food. And it's been malnourished for a while, so it takes some time, for your body to acclimate and it may take a little bit longer than. A couple of days to get you to a healthier BMI and then it's going to take even longer, for that to kind of settle. and for your brain to go okay it doesn't look like she's going to starve us anymore we're going to be okay, and then to kind of relax so. Your brain is in starvation mode right now so it's going to hold on to things it's going to take time, maybe to adjust and. It takes a while and everybody's body is different and our mindset and how we deal with that so today you're kind of open to it tomorrow, you might be like that's a terrible idea. And this is a horrible thing and why are we even talking about this. And I get all of that, but the reality is is that if you aren't able to make this decision for yourself and really follow through on this piece. Then you're going to just it's not going to get better it will only get worse and it's not because you are resilient enough or you aren't something enough. This isn't about being that this is about you're at a point now where you need a physical intervention. Just like if he had a broken leg, you need to cast you know if you are diabetic you need insulin you're at a point now where you need extra help. Right and you try and set your leg yourself or try and take extra natural insulin yourself, but the reality is is it's not going to probably be very effective and you won't heal correctly. Yes, i'm going to advocate that you really consider. residential for a little bit. To the goal to get you to partial to partial the outpatient you know intensive outpatient and then outpatient that's kind of the scale of things. And even though it may not be the schedule that's realistic for you it's temporary."
14903.0,Patient,Right yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So I think that's probably right because that was gonna be my next question is, if you know your BMI what is it because that really does dictate your level of care there's reality that. If a program says, oh no it's fine we'll take you even though you're low BMI what there's kind of co signing is that it's Okay, for you to be there and it's really it's not you need you need regular like 24 seven care. yeah serious and you know it doesn't feel that serious and that's what's so deceptive about this struggle. Is that you feel okay like you've got this now some days are pretty good other days, not so great and yeah there's kind of a concern but it's not like. You know you can't get up in the morning, your functional right so it's deceptive because you're just functional enough, you know it's not great, but it's not terrible it's not like you've got an arterial bleed or something. But feels like you can keep going, and you can just you know it'll be alright and. Right now it's Okay, but you do this long enough and it's there it gets to be a point where your body just doesn't want to recover and it just becomes harder and harder for you to change gears."
14903.0,Patient,yeah. yeah sorry i'm soaking it all in and make.
107.0,Provider,"sure to soak in, and I mean it's a big deal and here, and here I am who the heck combined the stranger coming in and telling you how it is, but i'm concerned about you somebody else's decided they're concerned about you, they want kind of the. An outside opinion to say what do you think and based on what i'm hearing, I think that that's I think that makes sense for you to go into, especially since it's a close by Program. And it's something different, maybe it'll be the right vibe for you, and if you do it with the intention of. This is for a short period of time and then you do the next thing and then you do the next thing, even if it's longer than what you think it should be it's all about getting better. so that you can be a nurse, I mean how exciting is that you've gotten into this program this is really cool you have a bigger goal now so maybe that'll help you kind of do the things you need to do to take care of yourself."
14903.0,Patient,"yeah that's definitely true yeah I wouldn't I mean like you said. Each day it's different so it's like tomorrow, like right now and really like. open to the idea of it. yeah and. I know it's like temporary and like that would be the goal and like doing that transition to partial. Because like I like I always see I know I can do, I just need the guidance. yeah yeah."
107.0,Provider,"yeah you're very capable, but you you're going to need the guidance and you're going to need to. Have those days when it's kind of crummy and it doesn't feel good somebody they're going, you need to add a few more things we got to fill up that portion and you're going to be like I don't think you."
14903.0,Patient,and
107.0,Provider,"you've got to have that kind of immediate feedback and somebody right there to sit with you and help you through it and. and work through those moments because that's those are the training moments, those are the teaching moments that's going to help your brain and your body. learn that it's Okay, and then for your emotions to flare up and for you to manage those and that's really where you start to develop that and it's hard to do that. If you don't have that 24 seven because it's, not just in that moment and it's then. five hours later, when you're like oh Why am I still here doing this, you know it's it's that day in, day out hour by hour minute by minute kind of moments that make a difference. In me in shifting these gears and I think that you know one program maybe wasn't a good fit for you, but I think, maybe it's time to kind of make that. You know, really consider this so since journaling is kind of Okay, for you, I would suggest, maybe after we're done talking that you take some time to kind of journal your feelings about it, so that you have a chance to kind of put it down on paper, what you're thinking today."
14903.0,Patient,Right yeah that's very true say could might look back and refer back to.
107.0,Provider,"Because you're going to be your own best advocate right, I mean. It doesn't matter what I say or anybody else says, even if you feel like it makes sense to you in the moment at the end of the day, you're in charge, which gay, you should be I don't. i'm not interested in being in charge of you, but I, but there are times when we as human beings do not always make the right decisions. You know, and we think that it's totally logical and it makes total sense, and we should absolutely be able to do that and, yes, I am a big fan of free choice, but. it's painful when we make the wrong choice, and we know that because it's not working out for us, you know it's not working out for us physically or in a relationship or my dog has something to say about it. I have no idea why hold on just tell her no. Sorry. miraculously that one. yeah, so I think. So that's probably that's going to be my recommendation I don't like to surprise people I want you to be aware of what's happening so. i'm going to recommend residential to get you to a place where you can then step down to partial so that that feels more doable for your day in, day out kind of life experience and that you can. Get eventually to a place of complete stabilization and feel really good and it's going to take a while you know, this may be. A year or two of process overall not residential but you know. stepping down and kind of going through it all and. You know, at some point you'll get to a point where you're only doing a weekly individual session or something like that, but it's taken a while, for you to get here so it's going to take a while, for you to work through it on a different level."
14903.0,Patient,"Right yeah I agree with that, then my doctor and also. referred me to a sagna, which is a monster, which is like different um. In terms of like it being temporary if, like if I did decide to go back to like let's see the three not one. Sure um. With them like have to do the assessment all over again, or they kind of."
107.0,Provider,"boy I mean they're going to take everybody's information, but at the end of the day, their clinicians are going to want to. Sit down with you and, and you know go through it again because it's the most immediate situation and it's right there and. You know just depends on the clinician how involved, they are but yeah it's it's likely i'd love to tell you know they'll just take it for what it is and move on, because it's just one more thing, but. yeah it's likely they're going to want to go through that. You know you have a couple of options, I think you, whatever your insurance companies willing to kind of work with and agree to in terms of recommendations. I would then talk to those different programs and say here's kind of what i'm dealing with here's where i'm at i'd like to know that I can go from one thing to the next and it's not just going to be like it's this or nothing. Like you have some options and that it feels like a good fit for you so that you can feel good about the process."
14903.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And also know that on that day, if you decide which I hope you do, for your sake, to go in, you know, three days later, you may be like screw this this is terrible I hate this. You know that's where go back to your journaling go back to your reflections and just look at hey, this is what I agreed to for myself for a short period of time in the Grand scheme of things it's not forever it just doesn't feel great right now and kind of help you stay if you can."
14903.0,Patient,yeah that's true. yeah I probably won't do that because I need every.
107.0,Provider,"Normal yeah it's you know this is normal it's it sounds it's all well and good, until you're actually doing it and you're not life isn't really completely your own right you've got a schedule you got to follow you. you're in with different people you're living in a different space and it just it's gonna be weird."
14903.0,Patient,yeah definitely yeah ticket it's temporary to remind myself.
107.0,Provider,"So is there anything else you feel like I need to have a heads up on or be aware of, or do you does that kind of makes sense in terms of my recommendations and my thoughts about. where things stand."
14903.0,Patient,"No, I can I can see where you're coming from so everything yeah makes sense."
107.0,Provider,"Any questions or concerns for me, before we wrap up for today."
14903.0,Patient,And will this be. spoken to with like my doctor.
107.0,Provider,"yeah so what's going to happen now, is it takes about we. The insurance company has their own kind of medical review that they have are doing and so we'll get that will pair it with my information. And then it'll go out to whoever you want it to go out to so you can certainly make sure that if you're if we have a release for your doctor that your doctor gets this recommendation. As well as it'll go back to your insurance company and then whoever you llc would like to have it, and we should have everything within seven to 10 business days."
14903.0,Patient,Okay okay yeah. yeah that's i'm pretty much shit that I have for questions at the moment.
