408.0,Provider,"Good morning, Mr donal. Do you are in your car but you're not driving right."
14841.0,Patient,No i'm not driving.
408.0,Provider,"cool okay just want to make sure you're in a safe space. All right, good. So I wanted to continue some of the conversation that we had during your assessment session. which would relate to the kind of work that we're going to do together. That would be consistent with your own recovery goals your own personal growth goals. And there were a number of topics that we touched on that I thought we could explore a little bit more, and you start wherever you want one was your history of attention deficit disorder. One was. finding out a little bit more about. Just the details of your everyday life. The with whom you're living the Community where you're living now that you've been there for about a year. What resources are available to you there to enhance your what we call clinically behavioral activation that means activities of daily living that are engaging productive maybe pleasurable maybe just productive. yeah so start with any of those that catch your interest."
14841.0,Patient,"um so one of the things I wanted to talk to you about was in group on Monday, we have been talking about things that we want to change about ourselves, and like what we can do to make that happen and. And so I talked about how I want to change my. it's not really my attitude it's more of my the way that I talk, I guess, I sound like I sound kind of mean sometimes. And I don't mean to sound that way, but more than that, I feel that way, and then I just get really quiet and I hate it and I don't it's all it's irritability is what it is and it's been like that forever. And so my counselor and group he told me to talk told me he said assertive communication or something I don't even know what that means. Okay."
408.0,Provider,"All right, um so assertive communication can be a useful set of skills, a tool kit when you feel like you just have to be quiet. Because you're having difficulty. Managing and regulating irritability. In order to have a meaningful conversation with someone."
14841.0,Patient,"So, and like you say we are."
408.0,Provider,sending them.
14841.0,Patient,"Right and at work, I am a ship leaders so i'm in charge of our whole night crew and it's. it's really hard for me to. Tell someone what to do, it's hard for me to boss people around and then it's also hard for me to do that without sounding really mean so and and more than all of that, I hate how I feel I get so irritated and it's, to the point that it ruins my day."
408.0,Provider,"Right and you said, this is really a long lasting issue that predates you're starting to use substances. yeah like the pain medications right so that sounds like it's really a component of your attention deficit disorder and that is a common symptom of attention deficit disorder, have you discussed with your prescriber resuming some kind of treatment for that."
14841.0,Patient,"No she had I am being treated for my add, and it has helped a little bit, but not as much as I thought it was I mean."
408.0,Provider,"that's right, thank you for reminding me. You are being treated for it but you're not seeing much benefit that's what we discussed as you going back to the prescriber and talking about a dosage adjustment."
14841.0,Patient,"Right, and right now I think i'm on an okay dose because, like last night, I was able to I was able to tell the people I was working with what to do without sounding mean and irritated but it's like i'm constantly having to tell myself in my head to really think before I talk."
408.0,Provider,that's excellent though that was an achievement. yeah definitely.
14841.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,So let's let's disentangle that a little bit so you said you use some self talk right. yeah you bought yourself around. yeah you told yourself. Think about how i'm going to say this. yeah and you think that's part of what helped you to be more successful.
14841.0,Patient,"yeah but it's it feels like it's impossible to always be in my head telling myself, you know not to sound like this or that so like i'm constantly having to do that, like remind myself, and I feel like that's not always possible. because sometimes. I get so irritated that I want to freak out."
408.0,Provider,"So I think we're still back at looking at your add treatment dosage. Because the when you talk about how difficult it is to stop and think before you speak that's called impulse control. yeah, it is also part of. A dd. is having trouble with stopping and thinking before you say things. yeah or or other kinds of impulsivity. Right stopping thinking for you make a choice or a decision or being attracted to some kind of exciting stimulus or high risk activity and being able to say wait a minute actually that's interesting to me grab my attention but it's not really a good thing for me to do."
14841.0,Patient,Right right.
408.0,Provider,"that's all part of impulse control. Okay i'm still back to the recommending that you. make an appointment with your prescriber tell the prescriber this conversation what we're working on and individual. Then, and that I wanted you to review your dosage level because you're still not getting maximum benefit for impulse control. Right, as well as the irritability now The other thing I think we touched on is that there are some things you can do to maximize the benefit of your add treatment. One is to recognize to find out, and then to recognize how long this particular medication is going to last."
14841.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,"In your system, because all the add treatments are relatively short acting they don't stay with you for weeks and weeks, the way an antidepressant would. Right, they only stay for a number of hours. Longer acting ones might last for 10 to 12 hours, the shorter acting ones last for about four hours. yeah and usually. You get the maximum benefit at the midpoint. So if it's short acting that would mean at the to our point you're getting the maximum treat. OK, so the longer acting that would mean about the fifth hour the sixth hour you're getting maximum treatment."
14841.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"After that it's rapidly the dosage is rapidly leaving your system. yeah you start to notice that it just ain't there no more, even if it's a little bit is that."
14841.0,Patient,Right yeah. And I definitely feel that.
408.0,Provider,"Right exactly and the closer you are to being under dosed undertreated the more rapidly, it seems to dissipate to go out our system."
14841.0,Patient,Okay again.
408.0,Provider,"A reason to revisit the dosing. yeah but in the meantime, think about when you need to give directions at work when you really, really need to stop and think before you say something try to time your. Your medication and I know that you know it's recommended at certain points of the day, but try to time the medication, so that it will be benefiting you the most so halfway midpoint at the time you're having to give your team instructions or to your team, if you can. Okay, does that look like tomorrow, when you go to work or today when you go to work, what would that what's the timing on that."
14841.0,Patient,"So, tomorrow I work from 12 to eight so i'm thinking I should probably take one at 12 and then one again. Maybe four."
408.0,Provider,And how long do your is it short acting or long acting dosing.
14841.0,Patient,Short acting.
408.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
14841.0,Patient,So it's not really work best.
408.0,Provider,"yeah because, certainly if you take one at 12 by four it's going to be completely out of your system if it's short."
14841.0,Patient,Right right.
408.0,Provider,Good good.
14841.0,Patient,"Okay, yes morrow."
408.0,Provider,"The other thing is to make sure that you're not interfering with absorption of your add treatment that means try not to take it on a full stomach. Okay, do you have have. stomach problems with the medication. No."
14841.0,Patient,"Okay, all right i've had some stomach issues. In the past, but all just because of like anxiety, but nothing major."
408.0,Provider,"Well yeah so some people really have a hard time taking add medication on a totally empty stomach because it irritates their stomach right, but if it's not irritating your stomach. Then, the best thing is to take it on an empty stomach because the absorption of the add medication is reduced by 25% if you have food in your stomach."
14841.0,Patient,wow I didn't know that.
408.0,Provider,you're lowering your effective dose by 20%.
14841.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,So that's something you can think about.
14841.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
408.0,Provider,"To get the biggest bang, for your buck and literally."
14841.0,Patient,I know i'm surprised nobody's ever told me that before.
408.0,Provider,"So why don't you try that for the next until you see your prescriber again and try to keep notes try to keep a diary or a journal. Of what you notice, whether it's helpful or not, whether these timing issues and taking it on an empty stomach whether you're noticing any difference or not."
14841.0,Patient,Okay yeah cuz I would be a journal. For group yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Good yeah. So medication monitoring that way would be very helpful when you talk to your prescriber about dosing, but it would also be helpful for us to talk about."
14841.0,Patient,Ray okay. I can do that.
408.0,Provider,"And I think I had mentioned to you last time that, for the most part we're going to try to schedule your therapy appointments at times when you are benefiting from your add medication. Right right. So I had been insane."
14841.0,Patient,yeah I had just taken it right at 11 o'clock because I remember that you said that.
408.0,Provider,"Perfect perfect okay yeah excellent excellent okay. i'm not peaking yet it's been a little less than an hour. Right, since you took it so. yeah right Okay, are you feeling some benefits from it already. yeah."
14841.0,Patient,"Okay, normally, it would be hard to sit here and pay attention, and I would just be fidgety and want to get out of the car."
408.0,Provider,Right right. And when you did take it at the right before this appointment. Had you eaten something right then.
14841.0,Patient,"beforehand, you know."
408.0,Provider,"Okay okay so go ahead and write down in your journal you're noticing right that. yeah taking it may be an hour before you need to focus your attention, especially if it's on an empty stomach you are noticing, it does."
14841.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,"So if you have your journal with you go ahead and write that down. Okay, or a piece of paper."
14841.0,Patient,yeah I definitely do.
408.0,Provider,"Good and also make sure you take a moment and celebrate your success that you observed, you had in your job. yeah Ben you were able to stop and think before you gave direction to your team. yeah celebrate that for a minute. Good because even apart from assertiveness before before you can really use the assertiveness skills that were referenced in your group. yeah first, you have to regulate the irritability and regulate the impulsive. Right, you have to be able to stop and think, in order to use the assertive communication skills. yeah right, and you have to be neutral enough that it makes sense. yeah stop and think and use us use certain skills. Right, instead of just blurting."
14841.0,Patient,I know.
408.0,Provider,"Right yeah so let's work on that, first, and we will also work on the assertive communication, but I think i'm working on that regulation of irritability and impulsivity is necessary right in order to fully benefit from using assertive communication. So let's look at, in addition to maximizing the benefit of your add treatment, which I think is key for both of those symptoms. yeah and impulsivity one thing you can do before you go to work, even if you're just sitting in the car right before you walk in so you might have to leave a little few minutes early. yeah and of course you're going to start taking your medication right before you start work. yeah and then again halfway through your shift right. yeah um, but you can also lower your arousal level and I don't know if you work on this in your group, the Group that I run we work on this we work on how do you. regulate your arousal level so that arousal is just a physical term that refers to the natural sympathetic nervous system stress response. or mood, if you will yeah if you're a little bit irritable all the time right that can feel like a little bit over overstressed over aroused. In your sympathetic nervous system, so. So a regulation skill for that, apart from treating your add is to sit for maybe three minutes five minutes in your car before work and do a relaxation exercise to deliberately lower your agitation irritability arousal to. baseline to a neutral. Point you don't have to be like all in you know. You don't have to be that deep into it just a few minutes."
14841.0,Patient,"Okay, and."
408.0,Provider,and lower your irritability. yeah it doesn't last long right doesn't last long you may have to do the same thing again a little bit later.
14841.0,Patient,But I think I could do it.
408.0,Provider,yeah.
14841.0,Patient,Exactly yeah that's a good idea.
408.0,Provider,"So, you mentioned that I think, am I remembering correctly, you like hiking walking on trails going to the park."
14841.0,Patient,yeah I love it.
408.0,Provider,"Good so that is a way to lower arousal. Okay, because you're focused on the sights the sounds the smells. Oh yeah nature. yeah and that helps you to focus and also to calm."
14841.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,Does that make sense.
14841.0,Patient,Definitely yeah.
408.0,Provider,"So so right before work or right before you need to speak to people. And first you need to notice how irritable you're feeling yeah like on a scale of zero to 10. Oh yeah now how irritable Am I how aroused Am I am I have 678 what am I right. And then notice that, and if you notice you're above of five let's say on a 10 point scale, then you can sit and I would do this regularly before going to work like I say sit in your car for three minutes. and clear eyes and imagine that you're in the park imagine that you're walking on a trail in the park. Okay, and imagine what you're seeing smelling hearing and while you do that slow your breathing down."
14841.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,"breathe in through your nose and out through your nose, but just a little bit slower than your regular rate of breathing. So let's try that for a couple of minutes right now. So you may want to close your eyes or lower. Your your gaze a little bit to block out distractions. and start breathing slowly in through your nose and out through your nose. And as you wish, begin to visualize yourself. walking in the park. And visualize first just putting one foot in front of the other. As you walk along. A path in the park. First, one foot than the other. there's no rush Take your time. And now visualize looking up from your steps your feet and noticing what's around you. notice what you're seeing. notice what you're hearing. notice what you're smelling. visualize yourself reaching out and touching something along your way and notice what you're touching what's your feeling with your fingers. And as you're ready visualize yourself turning around and leaving the park. slowly and deliberately again noticing your steps one foot in front of the other. Knowing that you can always return here in your mind whenever you wish. And now take a deep cleansing breath and bring your attention back to where you are a cleansing breath would be a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. All right, and about what level, are you now on a 10 point scale."
14841.0,Patient,Like a three I feel calm.
408.0,Provider,"So less irritable. and think about if you had to say something and instruction. to your team, if you were at work right now. How would you say it, what would you say and how would you say it now that you have an opportunity to stop and think and become."
14841.0,Patient,"I would just say it calmly but let them know that I mean it like i'm serious because I don't want to get spoken to by my boss, because I can instruct people what to do the right way, so I would just explain that to them."
408.0,Provider,And what would you say if I were your employee tell tell me how you would say that.
14841.0,Patient,"I would say, everybody needs to be looking at the closing list and checking it off, as we initial it. yeah That is how I would say that."
408.0,Provider,mm hmm. Good any point of. appreciation to reinforce or reward them once they. Do. What they need to do after they do what they need to do.
14841.0,Patient,yeah I do make sure I tell them all that I appreciate them and everything that they do.
408.0,Provider,It helps also define specific things. yeah right and specifically notice someone doing it the right way or doing what they need to do and notice them as quickly as possible after they do that because that's very reinforcing. Kenny right.
14841.0,Patient,"So the with the new with a couple of the new people, last night I had to make them take orders and they were really anxious about it, and everything."
408.0,Provider,But right.
14841.0,Patient,"But I told them to I feel the same I used to feel the same way, like everyone gets anxiety before they do that so when they did do it, I told them, I was so proud of them and that they did really good."
408.0,Provider,"Excellent excellent. Alright, so let's go back now to your D arousal experience there visualizing your walk in the park tell me a little bit about what that experience was like."
14841.0,Patient,"I literally can bring myself to a to a place like that, because i'm always outside, so I I don't know I like doing that because it does call me write down like I can literally picture everything around me the leaves the trees and where i'm at right now is so so beautiful."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, I bet yeah."
14841.0,Patient,really is I love it.
408.0,Provider,"Oh, I bet it's gorgeous."
14841.0,Patient,yeah it really is.
408.0,Provider,"yeah so. yeah and you can use that, of course, when you're doing de arousal or calming you can actually take a moment, as you visualize each different color. Of the Yankees yeah. Which is cool."
14841.0,Patient,I love that.
408.0,Provider,Excellent What did you notice about just the breathing before you started to visualize the walk in the park.
14841.0,Patient,"I feel like it was my breathing was a little faster before and then, when I was paying attention to it, I was able to slow it down."
408.0,Provider,Did that have any link or connection with feeling your irritability start to ebb away.
14841.0,Patient,yeah I think well I think so.
408.0,Provider,Good okay good.
14841.0,Patient,"yeah because once I started to once I started to do that, like like visualize the leaves and everything and my breathing was slowing down my heritability when down to."
408.0,Provider,"Excellent okay so that's a tool, then. That you have available to you, even if you don't have time. To visualize right in the park right, you can always take a few. moments to breeze."
14841.0,Patient,yeah definitely and I will do that.
408.0,Provider,"Excellent excellent okay. The other thing that can help you, and this is actually here's your first assertiveness skill okay for assertive communication, you can also work on the skill of observation without judgment so taking a few moments of mindfulness to observe the people around you. For the purpose of, whether you like them or not, whether you like what they're doing or not. But almost like a. Like if you had to describe them to a child to a child right so to a child, you wouldn't be loading it up with a bunch of adjectives about how awesome they are right. You would just say yeah you know, this is a person, they are very tall or they're not very tall, and they have here is a color right. yeah first assertiveness skill when you're getting ready to communicate assertively with someone or even just in long preparation it doesn't have to be at the moment right. And a few moments just mindfully observing the people or the person by distancing your judgment or analysis or criticism away from it just not judgmental observation, how would I observer describe this person, if I were describing them to a child."
14841.0,Patient,yeah okay.
408.0,Provider,"Just just being curious. about what yeah just about them. So why don't you make a note of that, because that's your first assertiveness skill and that's an observational skill that takes a lot of practice. Because we're not really wired that way as humans our brains are wired to take a quick first impression. And then rush to judgment."
14841.0,Patient,"I know, and I do I, like the you just told me that, because that is something I can be super conscious of."
408.0,Provider,yeah and just look at it like learning to ride a bike learning to use a new tool you're just going to be practicing this for a while. yeah cool all right well let's go ahead and set up our next appointment.
14841.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,That would be our starting.
14841.0,Patient,I know.
408.0,Provider,You know what your work schedule is the first week of November.
14841.0,Patient,"And it will probably be the same, so I will be off Wednesday if we could do another Wednesday, that would be great."
408.0,Provider,Oh cool. So before work.
14841.0,Patient,"On when i'm on every other day I go to work at noon, but Wednesdays I don't work."
408.0,Provider,"Because i'm another double point. Alright, so let's see. What we can do an afternoon, since you're off work. yeah let's um. let's see. yeah let's say. Four o'clock your time. Okay. Well, good I will see one."
14841.0,Patient,Okay Thank you so much. Thank you.
