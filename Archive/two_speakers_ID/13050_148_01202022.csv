148.0,Provider,"Good thanks, how are you."
13050.0,Patient,"tired and i'm positive for Kobe that's wonderful. and We another thing, though I broke my phone yesterday so. yeah. it's sad that something as innocuous as device could have such an you know. Such a powerful effect my emotional state but i'm so used to having my food. It was kind of weird. After I realized, it was just gone haha I do remember what it was like with as well. So it's it's interesting."
148.0,Provider,A lot going on.
13050.0,Patient,So we something.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, when did you test positive."
13050.0,Patient,"Well, we took the test on Monday we got the first result that statement, though we were positive by the end of the day. And since then we got the what is it called etc, or I don't know there's a acronym. And they said that yeah we're positive we just got that today actually."
148.0,Provider,You and your significant other.
13050.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,How i'm. How are your symptoms.
13050.0,Patient,"i'm just tired. exhausted frustrated. wow. No said came out yesterday after I found out that I have to go out and somehow get the contact with the irs which I mean, as we all know, is not necessarily an easy thing. They almost religiously avoid people. When I found out that I was i'm gonna have to go ahead and fight with the irs for $3,000 and then I was so mad that I just put my phone on top of the car and then it got ran out so yeah now I messed up and I must."
148.0,Provider,say you are angry.
13050.0,Patient,"You know. there's really frustrated. Like I because i'm worried that if I don't go ahead and you know getting in contact with the irs prior to my ex low than she's. Claiming savvy again what she's done for years. that's just like watching $3,000 disappear when me especially after I was an idiot and broke my phone. Now it's all right buddy."
148.0,Provider,You have financial stress this is stressing you out and you're feeling angry and frustrated because of it. But I hear you trying to push it down and just say you know it is what it is.
13050.0,Patient,i'm trying.
148.0,Provider,This.
13050.0,Patient,"Is gonna be something. there's always something. Okay, and for me to go ahead and get really frustrated about something in a moment, is. that's kind of myopic you know me looking at any moment, as if that moment, is everything but it's not and I get that it's just there's an aspect of me it's like really angry about it, you know. really just frustrated like really you did that you made the mistake Jason you did that that's like. an advert. In a know I don't know exactly how to deal with it without just saying it's okay and."
148.0,Provider,So I hear that you're angry you're frustrated but you're telling yourself that these emotions are not okay.
13050.0,Patient,"Well, for me to get really mad about it is kind of ridiculous, I mean I mean what am I what where, am I going to go ahead and direct right so, for example, I didn't get really pissed off and what like kick the dog I love my dog, you know. My lady love you know I am. But what to do with it."
148.0,Provider,"Let me pause you because I hear that you're angry. And you don't want to be angry because of your actions when you're angry. Your anger doesn't have to control you though. It you can feel angry right because we can't we can't avoid emotions I can't sit here and say i'm never going to be sad again i'm never going to be angry, because those are uncomfortable for me and I don't like what happens when I feel that way. there's a difference in allowing yourself to feel what you're feeling right instead of saying it's not okay to feel this way because of what happened. don't let your anger control you you control your anger, you know that when you're angry you act out how can you cope with your anger, so that you have control over it, so that it's manageable for you."
13050.0,Patient,"Well, I suppose, the only way that i've been able to accomplish that is just taking into. Consideration that it is a feeling and is finite it will end. So for me to go ahead and make long term decisions based on a finite feeling is ridiculous. So I try to utilize that, as you know, kind of a barometer. There are days, where it's successful and there are days, where it's not you know. But i'm trying to find that balance, and you know. I, I find this to be a really fun little. Psychological game. Because I mean I was literally talking about online I was talking about how we are completely addicted to our phones. You know so self fulfilling prophecy. You know. I wonder about that. I don't know but i'm just trying to understand why it is. I get so pissed off about my new things you know, this is something that would imagine a lot of people would get completely bent out of shape regarding you know losing their phone breaking their phone like that's $1,000 piece of technology just. movie yeah. But I don't find myself as bent out of shape, as I thought I would be. Instead i'm just like. Well alright. I guess i'll just. i've got so much tech around the House plugged into my lady love was the one who put it my face he's like you know, we have all sorts of phones was going to go ahead and plug your Sim card, and this up mouse will be five she's right she was right. So God bless that."
148.0,Provider,So you want to find. What underneath the anger.
13050.0,Patient,"yeah. I think so. Well, I told you about know said on a couple different occasions correct."
148.0,Provider,You talk to me about what.
13050.0,Patient,I know sanjay have I ever brought that up.
148.0,Provider,I don't think so.
13050.0,Patient,"So I refer to an alternate aspect to my mentality, as no such it's just Jason backwards. yeah well you know if you go back to. Romans and Greeks, they used to refer to something like knowing the darkness inside of yourself, you know, knowing your own shadow own your own shadow right, so no edge knows edge is my. By hide whatever I shy away from that anger that exists that's I you know we we all either accept it, or we just don't give it names I gave it a name, you know it's just me backwards. But no such is really an angry person. And it's interesting. The first, I remember the first time that no such became a part of my reality, I was in elementary school and like I really matter to do, I was playing pickle with. And he said he was safe I wasn't I got angry he jumped on my back I kicked him off and then a friend of his tried to jump on me and I kicked him in the stomach but no such came out when that guy is. He was you know he got kicked in the stomach so now he's on his hands, and you know his knees nance and then kicked him in the face. Which is really fucked up. You know, but no sense is that being inside of me that doesn't want to be taken advantage of doesn't want to be, you know. he's the one that made me leave my ex wife, the one bit me, you know he's the one who finally gets done Jason is kind and understanding, no such is done. With a bunch of shit so it's weird you know and a lot of cases, people go ahead and tell you that well that's. A psychological issue I don't believe that's the case because it's it goes, all the way back to Native Americans and they used to talk about there's only two wolves and you know, and I know that i've brought that up to you before there's the wolf that you feed."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
13050.0,Patient,"You know, so no savage thankfully, though, is there when I need it, but it's something that I need to go ahead control over because when I drink, no such as the only person there."
148.0,Provider,Not.
13050.0,Patient,scary.
148.0,Provider,So no such as a part of your subconscious.
13050.0,Patient,"that's exactly right. yeah. And it's scary. I know that if things get really rough you know. I lived in an environment where I had to go and defend people and I had to go ahead and be over the top. And I I didn't like it, but every time that things got weird I knew that that other part of me would come out like we're done here and fix it, which is really sad because I remember all it's not dissociative identity disorder, you know it's not like it's completely different aspect of. It it's who I am but it's a part that wants to go ahead and take control when i'm just tired of watching everything fall apart. I finally just get so frustrated that a part of me comes out it's like all right we're going to go ahead and make this work now because nobody else was able to do it. You know the first time that I ever experienced that was actually in high school and in. Where I kept asking people like okay well who's going to do the presentation or who's going to do this, what part, are you going to play, and this, you know presentation. And when people stop caring and just walked away I finally got so frustrated that I would say alright nevermind look you're good at writing you're doing that. i'm going to go and do the presentation, because the rest of you don't seem to understand what the heck it is you're talking about. And then you just do the research, you know just phone it and it's fine just give me an email, and you know and it wasn't because I was mad, it was just because I realized I wanted a good grade. So that that kind of part of Jason just goes away and those edge like look to how would this the time to get done and that. Was maybe I think about too much, maybe I think about to."
148.0,Provider,Send know sad is. You when you go into survival mode.
13050.0,Patient,"Agreed that's perfect. yeah. Then he doesn't worry about other people, you know I I tried to be as empathetic as possible, no says just give two shits."
148.0,Provider,yeah. Well it's hard to and you're in survival mode.
13050.0,Patient,agreed.
148.0,Provider,It care about other people's feelings and what other people are doing right you're caring about yourself.
13050.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,Is you're surviving you're protecting yourself.
13050.0,Patient,"Such as me, though, when I when I go into that mode i'm trying to protect family, the group when it's when i'm doing it at at school it's because everyone is going to get a good grade not just me the group. And I I get really frustrated when i'm in a group situation and a lot of people just they don't care. I snap and i'm like damn it if nobody's gonna go ahead, take care of well, then I will. You know, and I feel like. I don't know I don't want it, I never wanted to be a leader I don't want to be in charge, I hate being in charge. And, but, but then I realized that. there's no one else there that can handle the situation."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Now Jason this is good um. there's a lot of awareness and what you're saying, because this happens day to day for you justin what's going on with the world it's like you just want to protect others you want them to know what you know. You want them to have the information. That you have right."
13050.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,yeah so it really is not only you protecting yourself but. You want to protect everybody.
13050.0,Patient,kind of ridiculous isn't it because I can't.
148.0,Provider,"it's a lot to take on, I think you know definitely some unrealistic expectations of yourself. yeah. it's no wonder that you feel frustrated and angry."
13050.0,Patient,"and worry. there's things that I can't really put into words. You know understanding. You know, dark matter right that's that's fine I bring that up and people don't know what the hell i'm talking about right and bring up dark energy right I bring up quantum mechanics quantum physics. You know a lot of people don't even know record gives and that's fine you know, but I do understand that a lot of these things have a beneficial or, in some cases of detrimental effect on our leading weren't be we observed me contact me deal with every day. And when I tried to explain that to people it's. Well it's complicated. You know. I mean my lady love. She she knows things that I don't, and so I guess everyone's trying to understand a little worlds. Now I understand that we're in a lot of trouble as a species right now. and trying to explain that people's. I don't know it feels almost like you know beat your head against a brick wall."
148.0,Provider,cuz you have no control over the way other people think.
13050.0,Patient,"Oh great. What if I did, then I feel a level of obligation."
148.0,Provider,"You already feel that obligation, though. To some extent."
13050.0,Patient,"yeah you're right you're right. i've told my mother and I told family members and friends, I just I. will tell you this, when I was in high school, you know, there was a reading assignment or writing assignment rather by i'm staying and they were asking us to go ahead and tell them, you know what's, the first thing you do if you were the ruler of the world. And it didn't take me long my answer was quick I said retire. I swear to gosh who in the world wants to go ahead and tell other people who you would be how to think how to feel that's insane that's mean. So yeah. And I waited, though. Because you know God bless delivery I just waited until I was the last person in the class and I said. I don't know why anybody would want to do that. You know, and then there was another one, in that same writing class where she asked you know something about like what would you do in a school shooting shooters least talk about a loaded subject so I told her he said. In the said everybody and I again I wait till the end and I went in and I presented it I said I would imagine a lot of ladies here girls. are going to go ahead and say that they run away or they try to protect them and then there's a lot of males here are going to tell me that Oh, they would they go in, they tackle. Everyone here is like. Every single one. The truth is, you have no idea we because you've never experienced that. you've never had. Your life threatened in such a fashion. So you don't know what you. know I won't go ahead and tell you the truth, and that's what I said in front of me I got real enemies, after that, by the way. hey but. i'm just i'm that kind of cat I was a little bit weird and I want to go ahead question everything in some cases that makes friends and. Then, a lot of cases it's created a rift between me and other individuals."
148.0,Provider,And I just wonder where that comes from.
13050.0,Patient,"I don't know. i'd imagine. Perhaps it has something to do with you know my my father. And I don't know. You know. He died at 42 left a little bit earlier than that out about three years earlier than that. and I just didn't really have any sort of interaction with him for about two and a half, maybe three years leading up to that so there's a huge six year gap where we just weren't really connected."
148.0,Provider,How old were you.
13050.0,Patient,"and He died when I was 12 so it started, and I was about six. got really weird about eight."
148.0,Provider,Okay.
13050.0,Patient,"I did have some good interactions with him, you know. There was a time you know I told you about that I watched tremors the other day."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13050.0,Patient,"yeah and yeah he was at that point, it seemed like it was it was him again. You know, but that didn't last long because it seems that every time that we left. He was alone. He isolated themselves without call you know."
148.0,Provider,um. So there's a band and meant there in your childhood.
13050.0,Patient,yeah they're. they're not wrong there.
148.0,Provider,which has caused you to. Over protect.
13050.0,Patient,Like SWIFT.
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm. and that's where that control comes from. You want everything to be a certain way because. it's safe for you, if it's that way."
13050.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,Let me.
13050.0,Patient,"know so that's funny. It doesn't really matter how much. You push my efforts, you know the world handles itself the little mill and there's not much I can do that."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah. And that's scary for you. agree yeah. You like to write.
13050.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"wondering. How it would feel for you to get out a journal this next week and write about some of your fears, some of your biggest fears."
13050.0,Patient,probably end up writing poetry about it and that's fine.
148.0,Provider,I love that yeah absolutely.
13050.0,Patient,"Not the only way that I can go ahead and. express myself a lot of ways is by being eloquent because I feel I figure if you're going to do something do it right. I used to write poetry a lot, I used to write stories and everything but to leave it. might as well."
148.0,Provider,yeah. I think this will be good work for you.
13050.0,Patient,I think so.
148.0,Provider,"yeah I think there's quite a bit coming to the surface, for you right now."
13050.0,Patient,So. deal with it or deal with me.
148.0,Provider,yeah our secrets keep us sick. yeah. great work today.
13050.0,Patient,"No every every time that I. walk into a situation where i'm. bare my soul, I shy away from it initially like earlier, I was just saying like I don't I don't really want to do my therapy today, I really don't but it's funny seems to work out."
148.0,Provider,How do you feel now after doing so much processing with me today.
13050.0,Patient,Like I have a lot to think about.
148.0,Provider,"yeah and I just want to encourage you to take care of yourself through the emotions that are going to come up for you in this work that you're doing instead of saying I shouldn't be feeling this way right. Worse things could happen, I want you to feel them. Whatever you're feeling is okay to feel when you're feeling it. didn't never has to be pushed down or pushed aside or thrown out. Now, how you respond to that emotion is a different thing right. If that it's causing you problems are causing rift or closing arguments that's something different right. yeah it's still Okay, for you to feel that emotion, though. And it's Okay, for you to respond differently than you have in the past."
13050.0,Patient,that's going to be interested. You know. We become so ingrained in the way that we respond.
148.0,Provider,yeah have we talked about sober thinking.
13050.0,Patient,And I believe we have touched on it. I wouldn't mind if you wanted to reiterate.
148.0,Provider,"yeah so we're thinking is so I think it's good to have I love acronyms because when we're in the moment and acting on impulse it's like what can join us right. yeah yes, what can pop into my head that would make me think so, one of my favorites is sober thinking so you stop observe breathe. band you're thinking and then respond."
13050.0,Patient,You did mention that I love that.
148.0,Provider,"It forces you to take a step back. yeah and if you just say sober thinking right when you start to feel angry so we're thinking yeah right here me in your head just saying stover thinking Jason jason's angry so we're thinking, what do I need. i'm going to stop i'm going to observe. i'm going to breathe expand this thought process okay what am I thinking and then I can respond another one another really good one is the 16th six teeth. take time to think things through."
13050.0,Patient,"That makes sense. Well that's the thing when. When you. kind of resort to your odd old behavior like drinking right you're not thinking anything. it's it's impulse purchase it's the same thing you know it's you sitting there, and like like i'd love some skittles it's the exact same thing you're not thinking correctly in that moment."
148.0,Provider,"And there's always a thought, whether you acknowledge it, whether you recognize it, whether you talk about it or not, it's still there, so perfect example what were you thinking I don't know."
13050.0,Patient,yeah I wasn't.
148.0,Provider,Clearly I wasn't to do something like this right like what was I thinking. yeah.
13050.0,Patient,"Well that's the thing like why you know and a lot of people ask you what was your trigger what were you doing, how did you feel that was good idea. I didn't I didn't say same."
148.0,Provider,"And this is why awareness is so crucial just knowing Okay, this is how i'm feeling, this is what i'm thinking, I know this is a problem for me, based on you know my past experiences with these thoughts and emotions, what can I do differently now. It takes a very conscious effort to do this to."
13050.0,Patient,Oh.
148.0,Provider,"yeah, this is not an easy thing. by any means. But it is worth it."
13050.0,Patient,yeah well anything that's worthwhile is worth the effort.
148.0,Provider,yeah. yeah and.
13050.0,Patient,"I can't stand you but. So thank you. I was being sarcastic said I can't stand you, but no it's just it's interesting that, when I walked into that, like every time that I walk into like yeah and then you know near you make it seem like it's not a bad situation yeah actually you know."
148.0,Provider,put me.
13050.0,Patient,put me in a good mental state bank receipt.
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it doesn't have to be right. You can manipulate it any way that you want, you can tell yourself, this is bad my."
13050.0,Patient,Last so many situations and such a negative connotation to. It it's you know it's just kind of breaking out of that modality.
148.0,Provider,"Right right and that takes time, so be patient with yourself time to yourself, you don't undo these things that have been so ingrained in you overnight."
13050.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,Unfortunately.
13050.0,Patient,No well I.
148.0,Provider,wish we could but.
13050.0,Patient,"You know what, though, if it was if it was a quick snap of the fingers, then I wouldn't even feel right anyway. You feel like it wouldn't actually work."
148.0,Provider,"Exactly yeah yeah That would be too easy right, I know you like your challenge."
13050.0,Patient,Right it's not fast food here.
148.0,Provider,yeah i'm. Okay Jason just making sure yep you're already on my calendar for next week. Keep up the good work i'm definitely want to hear how this journaling goes.
13050.0,Patient,Next time we meet up.
148.0,Provider,yeah I want to hear what comes up. we'll do more processing next time okay around that. But you keep you take good care rest drink lots of fluids lots of water. yeah and feel better okay.
13050.0,Patient,Take care of.
148.0,Provider,You to see you next week.
13050.0,Patient,sounds.
