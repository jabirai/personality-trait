13714.0,Patient,There we go Hello.
214.0,Provider,How are you.
13714.0,Patient,"i'm. Better now that. my sister has been taken to the hospital. i'm a little bit more light in here. I am in and i'm in the House i'm moving out. and So. we've been trying for several days to get her admitted to the hospital. And i'm. The psychiatric mobile response team. was not able to get to her yesterday and they stop operating 2am so to em. boyfriend back. home. And then, this morning the medical insurance to meet them here. Oh, when an altercation with her yesterday. i'm sorry if I sound a little scattered i'm tired and i'm. So stressed out. Okay um so yesterday. When my boyfriend and I arrived here because I won't be able to her so he's been helping to sort of be a buffer. I walked in and I. sucked it up, knowing that she was you know, going to be there and then I have to encounter her deal with her. In. And I decided to be. You know as much as I could be in I offered to bring her some food. And she did not acknowledge the question and she immediately started in talking nonsense, so you should still even psychosis. and I had walked upstairs she had met me at the top of the stairs Edward was halfway up the stairs she's talking nonsense of both of us she gets in between me and my boyfriend. Blocking me from the top of the stairs. Cheese she's talking to him with her back to me and he's just. watching her he's just listening he's not really responding or engaging he didn't say anything do anything but out of nowhere she reached out and sat down. And I immediately was like okay we're not doing this. And I ducked into her arm and I put a inserted myself between the two of them, and I said that is not Okay, that is not acceptable. And I told Edward to leave and. And I left you know, shortly after that, and there was some yelling because. I to me that is beyond unacceptable I grew up in an abusive household and I have 00 comments for any kind of physical yes any kind of anything none whatsoever. And he had absolutely nothing to deserve out or provoke better anything and I didn't it never occurred to me that she didn't do that. It never occurred to me that you do that. So I already felt unsafe around her. And now I feel even less safe. So after that happened. We shared that information with the the Mr T dispatch person. And they said. You know if you're concerned that we might not be able to get to you today, you can call the police and see if they can take her or if they can maybe get their own psychiatric. team out there. To evaluate her. long story short, the COPs showed up yesterday. And when they got there when they got there they were like Oh, we were here yesterday. which was news to me, so this is now four days in a row that she's had to deal with you, because on on Saturday, they picked her up when her car died on Sunday, she walked to the fire department, and I think it, I think I told you about this. yeah and then apparently on Monday. She called them there to the apartment and I didn't get all the details about what that was about and then on Tuesday. Okay yeah yeah on Tuesday we had to call them out. To deal with her again and they spent a long time trying to talk to her through the open front door, she was at the top of the stairs that are at the front door and they were basically on the threshold not walking into the House, you know I gave him permission. and After a long, long time of trying to talk to her and listening to her just constant stream of nonsense and they finally were like. Okay Valentine one of the officers said okay Valentine that's her name sorry. Valentina we're going to come in and we're going to have we're going to copy Okay, and then started approaching her and, of course, as soon as he said that she fled, I mean what that was just sorry that was really not handled well, in my opinion. So she fled to the bathroom which has a lock on the door and she barricaded herself in there and. They were like we're we're not gonna we're not going to break down the door and they called their sergeant We talked with this urgent about and feel like we're not going to escalate this because. chances are high, that she would probably end up assaulting us and we've been a horrible qualification thing, and she probably end up going to jail, instead of the hospital, we were the ones that. So much to my distress they ended up leaving without taking her, and I could not stay and she never shut up by the way, the entire time she never stopped with her stream endless stream of nonsense. And when I left she was still talking loudly to who knows who in the afternoon by yourself. So. That was in the evening, and then we were still waiting for Mr T team and, for another like four hours until 2am when they stop service and then Edward and I were like okay well, you have to go back to his place, which is. 45 minutes when. i'm and try to get some sleep before we're you know we're going to try to be first in line in the morning. And so that's basically what happened in. The PM RT team showed up this morning. And they they talked to her for like 20 minutes actually she taught at them 20 minutes, she had she had made her way at some point during the night, out of the bathroom down to. The first floor the living room and she was just sitting there talking at them through the open doorway for 20 minutes and. They were attempting to get her to answer basic questions about you know, have you slept haven't eaten it's our. And then. After 20 minutes we all walk outside and they were like yeah we're gonna we're gonna put her on hold water and 5150. and So they call the ambulance and ambulance took a while to get there and then, once the ambulance got there they had to call the COPs for support as well, just so everybody was there at the same time. And then, by the time all was said and done, was like two hours ago, basically. We finally got her out of here. She was you know, obviously not willing to go. It took a long time, you know of just time to interject and trying to communicate with her about what was happening and what we would like her to do, hopefully willingly you know, in the COPs were very like we don't want to. escalate the situation we don't want to we don't want to harm her you don't want to like taser or anything like that, like and and apparently in the last year police departments have gotten a lot more cautious about that kind of thing and. The emt will also tell me something like that they were like a year ago, they would have been able to just take a little bit, but now they can. Not that I wanted her to get teased but I definitely didn't want them to leave for buying."
214.0,Provider,either by my.
13714.0,Patient,"um. So yeah that was very, very stressful. The the one of the officers asked me and and my boyfriend if we would be willing to try to coax her. Oh. While the PR team we're talking to her for that initial 20 minutes before anybody else got here. And I asked my boyfriend to get screwed over to her bathroom door and her bedroom door and take her locks off and he did, because I knew, she was going to make a run for it again. So. So she was not able to barricade yourself in any of those things. And instead she sat on the kitchen floor in her road with no other clothes on. And the Bob asked us to try to coax her to stand up to that they could puffer. You know, obviously the color that's the goal but. She was not listening to me at all, it at this point in her mind I don't think she. sees me as an ally anymore."
214.0,Provider,Right.
13714.0,Patient,I think she I think she sees virtually everyone is the enemy and. She was addressing my boyfriend more than she was me I think she feels betrayed by my calling authorities on firm. And I don't have the strength to lift her. In so Edward and one of the police officers eventually to her elbows and.
214.0,Provider,bottling up.
13714.0,Patient,"To her up. A Popper when she realized the customer going on, she started screaming she tried to get away from them. But they were they were able to comfort her and take her down and put her on a gurney and separate and put her in the end and listen to her and now she's being evaluated in in downtown la it will hospitals there. And they're supposed to call me in like eight to 12 hours when we figure out where to put her face on her insurance and the beds available and all that. So now she's out of the House, and I can finally get all of my crap out of here and finished movie process and i'm just praying that they keep it for longer than 72 hours because oh my God does she need it."
214.0,Provider,"it's not her first. I don't know how many other 51 like this, so many factors right. Not to make this worse, but you may only have 72 hours but here's the thing when they call you think about I need to let you know she has no way to live."
13714.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I need the social work I need their name I need the social worker supervisor I need the case management on the on the doctor side I need those names, so you know she's not she doesn't have a home you guys have to figure out next residency. And don't give them any information, other than yourself."
13714.0,Patient,yeah yeah um she she doesn't have my new address i'm just not going to give it to her because.
214.0,Provider,They they don't need that either. I can get in touch with you by your cell phone and the reason for that is.
13714.0,Patient,weirder things have happened that.
214.0,Provider,People have gotten somebody graduates.
13714.0,Patient,Any.
214.0,Provider,"You always run the risk of a patient getting the address papers left on the tables they think the pages now looking patient goes and grabs two pieces of paper in a folder this big you don't know three pages are missing. So she knows your name she knows the number that's enough, but I think you need to now, although as difficult as it may be, you have to just say and don't let them coach you into the guilt thing she does not have a residence, you need to help with that I cannot help with that."
13714.0,Patient,"I don't have no idea how that works in California, to be honest."
214.0,Provider,"Why what's going to happen is, if you say she doesn't have domicile why she hasn't stable housing did going to have to find some type of housing for in the interim, she remains in the hospital."
13714.0,Patient,Do you know if there's any way they can for sure stay medicated. cuz that's what she really needs.
214.0,Provider,"I don't know the that not only done, I know the laws, I don't know how mental health operates in New York state they can. sanction psychotropic medication injections, so they don't have to take pills they get a 30 day and then the team comes picks them up. takes them back to the doctor they get a shot next 30 days I tell the stabilizing yeah she needs psychotropic injection she has any pills because she's not going to medicate. she's gonna say you're fine and then she laid and then we're back so again that's a medical decision and I don't know what their protocols, or the desktop protocols here."
13714.0,Patient,So you're in New York so okay yeah i'm sorry I was thinking everybody right harvesting.
214.0,Provider,"Know we're all over the place. I think you just have to make it clear to the social workers, she doesn't have domicile. Now there's an going to start saying so, this charging as stop. don't need to tell me about this choice."
13714.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"You can get sucked into that siphon really quick and before you know it it'll happen, so I know it's another thing you have to think about but. In all fairness, from our last conversation today, this one pretty well because it didn't look pretty good how this was going to go down without the intervention of the team. But they did they went, they went and did what they were supposed to do now, the only thing that you don't control is hospital bureaucracy. Because it when they stabilize that like they're good to go, because I. know that it's not long term it's a quick band aid, and you know, sometimes holds or i've seen holds for two weeks, as you know. Three days i've seen him for 22 days it just depends on what facility if she had a primary care doctor, the prime macquarie primary care doctor can get involved by saying listen I need you to hold it tight configure all i'm going to cap off, but she doesn't have that either. So the advocates idea of his advocacy has to come from the social work and the case management team, they have to advocate okay she's got nowhere to go so let's keep it here too we can figure out next destination. I know."
13714.0,Patient,"I don't know if I can make arrangements to my stuff in 72 hours, I have worked on Friday and Saturday."
214.0,Provider,"well. There was a discussion I know it was. hypothetical while getting people were like you know, will they be at risk if she's there, you may have to get people there. You may have to pay the money, just to secure your out because she will go back there that's where she's going, and she gets off she'll find a way to get to that address yeah. So you know you talking about. She could be out as early Saturday afternoon in a in a in her perfect world that's probably something that's realistic and perfect world, we would hope that this judgment take place at least next one say. And I think once they know she has no way to go, that's going to put a lot of brakes on whatever they thought they were going to do."
13714.0,Patient,"So I guess. Tomorrow, when I hear from whatever hospital she ends up at. i'm gonna have to communicate to them. she's not she's not home."
214.0,Provider,"there's no there's not a residence for it to go to. I know it sounds cold, but some of the options we talked about last week really rough to even contemplate if they were going to happen that way. So all I know I know it's traumatic I definitely validate that for you, but, all in all, went down the way it should have went down, because these are the resources that should be available for people going through, we don't control is how about hospital opens and closes the gates."
13714.0,Patient,"Should I call off work on Saturday to move, but I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"I would say, listen I don't want to. I can't spend your money because it's not right and but maybe maybe the scenarios best if you concluded it. Like you're already cutting five or six different pieces now you're going to bring on another team to come get the stuff to bring it over there, it may be easier if you did it and it actually may just bring you some closure."
13714.0,Patient,I am not. i'm sorry.
214.0,Provider,"I think it would be best if you were able to do the move. don't hire anybody take off from work. Because it makes you confront it makes you confront all the trauma in the House and make sure confronted by going in in in our and realizing that this is the end of that part of trauma, this is the end of that movie it's closure like you get to close the door and it's done like. You need to start having some closure."
13714.0,Patient,"yeah and I was planning on you know. Being here, for you know the rest of the movie wasn't just gonna like people just expect them to show up at the last minute do that."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm not."
13714.0,Patient,"Her her stuff is here too, and I need to be able to differentiate myself."
214.0,Provider,Then you definitely have to be though no.
13714.0,Patient,"I have to but, but the question is like. Like can afford to take off work by Friday Saturday to get that done. You know if it's if they don't taking a risk that. You know they let her go to hospital before i'm done."
214.0,Provider,"I. mean. As much as tight as you are, this is a perfect opportunity to just like work as long as you can to. Start divvying up what's what and what's what already at least get that done, because as much close to the front doors, you can like there was some things you can do I know you're tired. But like methodically you could get this done before Saturday, a lot of effort and work sure, but that's what I would choose I would shoot for before side to side of these the risky day."
13714.0,Patient,And you know 72 hour whole guaranteeing 7072 hours right.
214.0,Provider,"Oh no. No, no, no 5150 it's the attendings outlook on what he or she believes. And they they don't have. The patience to worry about how severe something else. Know they'll probably give a how the altar just. Take a right out of any hysteria get a sedated. couple more things that depakote get a really sedated should be like well you know what's your name what days okay she's learned she's on she's good i'm giving you a worst case scenario. So you know today today won't count for anything. But tomorrow the clock stops starts."
13714.0,Patient,"Oh, it doesn't start."
214.0,Provider,"Now, because she's not admitted anyway she's not evaluated, so you gotta wait to release the evaluation. She can be admitted into the evaluate so that's when the clock truly going to start this Christian NGOs in the computer just means she's waiting for an admission she hasn't been admitted. To the 72 we go for upon admission, so if in a perfect world, she doesn't leave savvy they don't discharge on Sunday, it will be a Monday discharge that's perfect. You also cannot stress that you need help you need her to be there to lease next Tuesday, you are afraid for your life because you're moving now. I would, I would at this point, those little white lies and not gonna."
13714.0,Patient,mean I am denied.
214.0,Provider,"So that's another. Reason if you can buy some time. But you know we don't control that so you know perfect well this she could be outside of it now, where she is to wear that home is is something else, and I also don't know if they'll provide it with car service."
13714.0,Patient,means Los Angeles so.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so then she'd have to figure out how to get there, so that's going to give you a couple hours."
13714.0,Patient,And she has no money like I don't.
214.0,Provider,"they're going to give us something, because she is she for for argument's sake she's homeless they're going to give us something. they're going to give a voucher they're going to give a debit card didn't give it some how she utilizes is not their concern, so you know it'll take depending on where the hospital is and depending with our houses, you know you gotta you got a variation of additional two to four hours."
13714.0,Patient,gotta get. I gotta get a truck.
214.0,Provider,It just be easier for you yeah you start grinding that will now listen she gets on his feet God bless but the moves gotta get done because you just can't you don't know when the deep or the time is.
13714.0,Patient,Something is so. it's. So dumb that I. Even have to worry about.
214.0,Provider,"I know, but you're so you know in one hand the frustration, on the other hand, you're caring human being would you rather be a cold heartless I don't care person. I know it's painful I know. But at least you human like. Thank you so for that Thank you so for having all the empathy and all the disruptive mood you're going through, but on the other hand, these are things you don't control this, this is not why you're here. So it's a big MACs it's it's a bag of mix things, but this was the best outcome."
13714.0,Patient,"yeah no I, I agree, and looking I was but 10 all said and done, I was desperate for the vicar away."
214.0,Provider,I know I know I know I know. And don't forget to mention to the social worker she was already guardianship. sure. God collected yeah like because that's where they may go with this.
13714.0,Patient,"I had my sister my older sister. contact the she found the previous starting in indiana and. She emailed her, but what about. The opening he."
214.0,Provider,"has many candles, as you can light is how far you're going to see if you only allow one cameras so like reaching out to her, without waiting on her help anymore we've got that while we're waiting on is you know. what's what's really gonna happen and what's going to happen is going to be beyond your control anyway, you won't have anything to say because they're going to save you want to be involved and you got to take. Other than now you're going to have to accept whatever they believe is best for her. And when, at some point i'll be honest. This is almost like your lifesaver. This situation is uncountable is probably couldn't have came in about a time."
13714.0,Patient,"I mean if. If she hadn't been if she hadn't become psychotic. During this time, you know, like she was working on. Getting her trailer fixed up so that she can like live in. addition to become psychotic you know movie should have been able to finish that and at least have something for herself. But now you know she's psychotic and hospitalized and she's not finished with that and. knows, by the time she gets released the landlord's might have crime and. got rid of all of our staff and."
214.0,Provider,"This is all very, very real possibility but again I wouldn't hold on to it because it's not yours you didn't have you didn't play any role in this actually there was no role you could play. Like the movie you had to accept the script is written. You couldn't alternate you couldn't change it, and I get it, but like I think this is closure."
13714.0,Patient,Like what do I. What do I do with her coffee is a wallet phones and.
214.0,Provider,You can give it to the social worker.
13714.0,Patient,think it would come out.
214.0,Provider,"have to go, do you want to make sure she's gonna get it you gotta go there. But the faster you get rid of that the faster you get rid of the attachments, meaning that you know any strings back to you like this, and again I didn't even know that part. This is really going to be unsettling closure, but like healthy because, like there's no more attachment I don't have a key I don't have a phone and i'll have a while I don't have anything I this is."
13714.0,Patient,Like massive boundaries.
214.0,Provider,"don't mean Obama just wish, the only thing she could do is call you and then that's up to you to figure out if you're going to accept the call because you'll be given her mixed messages when you answer."
13714.0,Patient,"Last year. She called from the patient from hospital she called. Many times a day, every day. Claiming you often scary things about the place well i'm surrounded by criminals and murderers and rapists. got to get me out of here and blah blah blah. Right now, like. I just want to go start you know I don't want to like."
214.0,Provider,"You shouldn't I don't think. here's the thing. As much as you want to as much as you can. And, whatever it sounds like it's only for your best interest isn't being mean. you're not going to be your category you're not going to be hidden OSHA not going to be a psychiatrist you're not going to be a therapist you can't even be an assistant because she's not who she supposed to be. she's in a different role you have a fiance you have a job, you have a life. Like I know it's terrible but like. We have to move on. And and don't believe she'll get better and I promised to take my medication and this will not do not believe that one she's. texting you she's gonna continuously."
13714.0,Patient,"stopped taking medications Oh, I know that. that's, the only thing that really worked for her is it somehow she can be forced to stay medicated that's, the only thing."
214.0,Provider,"I mean I don't know what the laws are, though, again, but you know you can't leave somebody who's psychotic or constant psychosis to believe they have to take medication just think it doesn't make any sense, so I mean again, I think. To be an honest conversation to worry about that is beyond your control it's it's someone else's responsibility, this is, you were able to. Get the catalyst moving not feel guilty that you're just leaving it to the landlord and God knows what would happen to her she's in the care of the people who do this, all the time she couldn't be in better hands."
13714.0,Patient,Okay. You have to pray that I can get everything out of here by Saturday.
214.0,Provider,"i'm sure i'm sure your motivation is to make that happen, I don't think you have any lack of motivation on that."
13714.0,Patient,ability.
214.0,Provider,"Well that's that's true that's true you know Rome wasn't built in a day type of thing I get that so you know now it's resources, or whatever you need to do, but I think. I think it's best that we say Saturday and keep that as the deadline, and if there was more time so be able was safe by taking a Saturday."
13714.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,Take care take care of yourself and the things that you need to do she's been taking care of by someone else now it's time for you to take care of yourself. What do you want to do by meeting again.
