760.0,Provider,"Right so okay so that's already stabilized then great so you said, sometimes you do know what's the cause of the depression and sometimes you don't so when you are aware of the cause of the depression. What, what is the warning signs in those instances that you that you notice that are triggers for Depression and anxiety for you."
16133.0,Patient,"it's usually, something that would be considered very small. Under normal circumstances, sometimes it's a few small things like. messing up at work. or hearing someone the talking about something that reminds me of. God knows what. and Then I just start to. My mood just sours and then it just snowballs from there."
760.0,Provider,So people talking remind you of something did you have traumatic experiences in your life.
16133.0,Patient,i'm a few. my childhood was fine my dad lived in China. We were well to do. At least enough for. For a kid to not really want for that much. Now we don't have nearly as much money but. i'm 25 so I can make my way. and Forget where I was going with that.
760.0,Provider,"Is you about a traumatic. Experiences it. could be traumatic experiences sometimes it's inside the home, sometimes it's outside of the home, sometimes it's both."
16133.0,Patient,i'm i'm sure there are some unexplored things. because sometimes i'll just think of my childhood and i'll get that snowball effect.
760.0,Provider,Oppression gross.
16133.0,Patient,"yeah and but i'll be wondering to myself, like what happened to my childhood my childhood was fine."
760.0,Provider,Okay. So talk to me about childhood abuse could be verbal could be neglect emotionally us.
16133.0,Patient,"I think. it's just that my dad was on the other side of the planet and my mom is very, very good, but she was a single mom and she had a lot of work to do. So. I feel like maybe I just didn't realize that I needed more attention i'm just thought Okay, this is what it is."
760.0,Provider,So you you think your mom was. busy doing other activities or doing other things and didn't have time for you did you have siblings in the House or was it just you as far as. Other kids.
16133.0,Patient,I have a half sister who's 11 years older than me. She lives in San fran and just had a baby. and
760.0,Provider,that she live in house with you when you were growing up or no.
16133.0,Patient,part time.
760.0,Provider,Some of the time okay.
16133.0,Patient,"yeah so like over the weekend, or something okay. And that was when she was around in high school and. We would have to like get up at 4:30am so she can do the band and stuff."
760.0,Provider,Okay yeah high schools used to get I don't know I think they used to start at like seven I don't know why they do that but.
16133.0,Patient,"But, and then in high school is when it really got bad um. I. yeah just depression just took over I I was also really sick back then I am."
760.0,Provider,With with what.
16133.0,Patient,"At first it was graves disease we later found out or hashimoto they really couldn't make up their mind. And that. Combined with the workload, I was getting from high school. which was a really. Intensive one. Apparently, I was running on adrenaline. Because I didn't have any way to regulate my my energy with my thyroid so I I was constantly in a haze if I was able to stay awake at all and."
760.0,Provider,"So perhaps your trauma is your physical symptoms of the disease, you had then. And then the expectations to performance school when when it was like super hard for you, does that sound like something that could have caused it."
16133.0,Patient,"um it, I mean I was already depressed but it definitely helped that depression. get to what. and"
760.0,Provider,"And back to your mother quickly. Was she did you feel she was too busy for you did you want, for her attention a lot of the time growing up."
16133.0,Patient,"By the time I was a teenager my father had moved back to do here and started the business that I currently work for. and He was. We didn't really talk much he was. Over there, and my mom and I had a pretty good relationship, she was always very supportive and helpful. He still is, and we all work together it's a family."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how is that you say your mom is supportive and helpful, how was your relationship with your father now."
16133.0,Patient,"Now, very good, because when I started working for them as a teenager. That point my dad and I just did not talk. I mean. Like we weren't spiteful or anything. But. Once I started working for him, then we got to know each other and now it's pretty good mutual respect is definitely there."
760.0,Provider,"So maybe it was confusing to you that your father was gone maybe as a little kid you didn't understand what he was doing over there and then, when he came back it without strange."
16133.0,Patient,"I knew that I didn't understand what was going on and that's just how it was. And he came back he's a very rough guy. So as a kid that's really hard to read. Now, of course."
760.0,Provider,You mean grouchy.
16133.0,Patient,"rough like very good haul. Okay, very grouchy. Also very funny."
760.0,Provider,Okay. grouchiness is part of his. sense of humor.
16133.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. Okay, and you just need to know how to read them. Get. It he's meet he says it lovingly you."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, but maybe that confuse you because you didn't know your dad that well because he was on all the time."
16133.0,Patient,yeah. Like me that he would be. me but also he he has library problems himself and he sleeps a lot when he's not at work so as a kid there wasn't really any time to get to know him. But. Now we spend a lot of time of course okay.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and what are some of the internal strategies or internal coping strategies things that you do to take your mind off your depression, other than the alcohol use What do you do."
16133.0,Patient,"A like to play video games that's always a go to to just take my mind off. Any depression, because it's more interactive than watching something. And it's. It kind of takes away your. Internal monologue."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16133.0,Patient,"and her dialogue. And says Okay, you are focusing on this simple task you're focusing on it, but it's simple and it's not stressful. And if I want to like zoned in on something for real, then I do art."
760.0,Provider,What kind of art painting grinding.
16133.0,Patient,"Poverty, I used to do ceramics I loved I loved it, but now I will do I generally, I draw on my computer. On photo up and paint. Since the business that my family. runs his guitar business. Okay, we make electric guitars and we have all these exotic woods around, and so I don't want to put them to waste, so I make them."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um what are some of the pieces people or social settings that you can go to you that help you provide a distraction to you or help you, with your. Depression."
16133.0,Patient,"Well, especially lately. Those options have dwindled. Because of the corona. Okay."

16133.0,Patient,Friends okay.
760.0,Provider,"All right. What about professional support I know i'm bright heartfelt hopefully can be that for you, but is there any other professional like a crisis Center or crisis line that you're aware of that that's a professional group that could offer support in moments of. Intense depression."

16133.0,Patient,Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"So, to be more common patient. yeah I think it's relatively new I think it's relatively new I think that's probably is I don't know why they didn't think of it before everybody knows. 911. So. Well, you could call 911 in that case, but that's a different. that's a. At the. Mental health focus would be better. OK so."

16133.0,Patient,"A lot better than it was. Like before I drove I couldn't. I couldn't really make decisions for myself. without beating myself up. And just going into that spiral automatically. But now. i'm i'm definitely more confident and since i've been working on the guitars I mean. it's a job that will get you a lot of. A lot of just. interest. People are very interested and. it's. I I know i'm a better person now and hell of a lot stronger, but certainly. don't. know what pride feels like. Okay i'm like I can go about my day and if someone is being crappy I know that that's them and not me. But. I also can work, really, really hard on something and then it's done and it works out it's good and I hate it and nobody else does. and i'm like all right cool it works move on and they're like wait what you should."

16133.0,Patient,"it's it's it can be a thankless job. Even if a lot of people are interested and stuff it takes a lot of. skill and time. And there's so much to do that, you. You very rarely get the chance to look at what you've done."
760.0,Provider,hmm.
16133.0,Patient,"will be proud of it, or like see oh yeah this guitar is going to Germany, and we have fans Germany actual fans and. Like. People have. come around to me it shows and been like oh my God, this is the last woman who is my dad."

16133.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean. he'll he'll think you're full of shit but okay. um does he also has that problem like he paints very well, but he doesn't like any of his paintings. And my mom is the most perfectionist woman, I know. By far."

16133.0,Patient,I have definitely been told that I have.
760.0,Provider,"cool, why do you think you are."
16133.0,Patient,"and Certainly not as much as my mom and. I i'm kind of in the middle between my parents like she's totally perfectionist and my dad can sometimes be a little too lacks, so I think i'm. I think go in."
760.0,Provider,There you go back and forth between the two.
16133.0,Patient,"yeah I tried to find the. The medium for example um I would say. to redo something, and my dad would say to just let it go through, but I need to know where the right decision is for the."
760.0,Provider,Business the balance. yeah.
16133.0,Patient,"Is it is, in my hands."
760.0,Provider,that's kind of a hard place to be. And we mom and dad.
16133.0,Patient,"yep it's a lot of he says she says, and a lot of my coworkers come to me to figure out that middle ground where they would agree or disagree. So sometimes. Their decisions I I like tell them how my for my folks would feel about it. they'll ask me. So. and I know I do important work. I know that much but. I don't really feel proud of it i'm just kind of like that's my job."
760.0,Provider,"So we talked a little bit about your alcohol use is that you use any other substances or have you ever abused any other substances in your life, other than alcohol."
16133.0,Patient,"I have an abused, we, but I do smoke quit. It Okay, it always helped with anxiety and. Issuing those. snowball effects."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so is that something you you you smoke as well, I occasionally yeah. Okay, no often. How often would you say smoke weed."
16133.0,Patient,About a bowl today okay.
760.0,Provider,Okay. And is that something you want to work on.
16133.0,Patient,"um I feel like. I just want to. I think i'm fine with with how that is but. I would like to have a life that doesn't help sorry. Sorry, my mom was calling. Sorry chief I have this thing yeah. i'm. Sorry we're will be."
760.0,Provider,"asking you about your marijuana use, and if you wanted to. change that."
16133.0,Patient,"i'm i'm pretty good with that, for now, I just want to work on everything. Okay, everything else I don't need it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I do want to caution you about substance use there's the concept of tolerance, the more you use something, the more you need it to get the same effect, I don't know if you've. experienced that yet. The other thing that I want to question you about with marijuana that I know and understand that it can. help with anxiety in the short run during the time that you're under the influence of marijuana but over time. You know, as you continue to use it can make the symptoms of anxiety depression works. So I kind of want to caution you to kind of start considering those things, and the other biggest concern about I have about using substances is that. You know people I understand why people use substances, because they want to turn off those those you know horrific emotions, they want to turn it off and have some relief. But the feelings are still there is what happens is that your frontal lobe just kind of goes dark and so it can't really process what's your feeling, but the feelings are still there. And it robs you of your opportunity to learn to cope in a more balanced way, I just going to throw that out there, for your consideration. But it's your life i'm not going to tell you what to do. So i'm just gonna just going to suggest that for you to think about okay."
16133.0,Patient,I appreciate that Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so you've never been into treatment for substance abuse at any time right just the mental health stuff. Okay, all right i'm."
16133.0,Patient,Like I never drink during the day I hate that. name I never I would never drink and drive. Whenever I get that. Like oh God people do that.
760.0,Provider,"So yeah yeah. it's becoming. I think that's being becoming more common that people a lot more people I think are starting to avoid that that i've been a change with that, but. um. let's see any family history with mental health i'm. Your parents grandparents."
