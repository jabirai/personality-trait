So I have sent the medication over, and let me tell you how to use it, but I think you already know nothing in your mouth 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after. put it under your tongue let it sit for if you can do it 15 minutes you can spit it out after it doesn't really do much good in your stomach okay. And the longer it stays in your mouth, the more of the medicine gets into your system, sometimes on the first day that you use it it's good to cut your strips in half and use it like. Four four milligrams every four hours, and that would get you through a whole day some people just say nope i'm taking the whole eight milligrams right now and then, when you feel it. Like you're starting to go through withdrawals again they do it again how you want to do it is okay with me but you're got two strips for 24 hours okay. Okay, any questions for me no Okay, it can cause constipation doesn't taste good all those kinds of things it's very nice to meet you I look forward to working with you and seeing you get better.
