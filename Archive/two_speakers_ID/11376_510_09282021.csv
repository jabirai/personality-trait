510.0,Provider,I know you did. So we're raised.
11376.0,Patient,Texas roadhouse.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, you said that Texas roadhouse oh. Goodness I am so excited this is going to hinder you a bit yeah and it gave us some money, so you can continue to be financially, you know, responsible and pay your bills. yeah oh good good good good. um will we have at least 15 minutes to talk katie or."
11376.0,Patient,um yeah i'm kind of getting dressed as long as that's okay.
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay all right well give me an update it sounds like you seem to be an a pretty positive mood I think a lot of that, with the recent job because I know about a month ago, we had the relapse but. It sounds like yeah have you kind of learned and kind of sounds like you, are moving forward and recognize, you are not a complete failure you build on that."
11376.0,Patient,"Yes, um i've been trying to say pop and I missed a couple groups illegally bought some suboxone because I didn't want to relapse again. And I owned up to it, I talked to the doctor about it, he said, I appreciate your honesty I said well if I can't be honest with you there's no sense in me logging in i've had other places. i've had other places, that I was honest with and I didn't go back because they didn't take me for who I am and what I do and. It was all bad and. I don't know Dean, I put it right here. And then you moved around um. Anyway, I was super honest and they were super accepting of it, and I said well that you know that makes me feel like I can stay, you know what I mean like. I can be honest and not have you guys shut me down and shut me out, so I had run on suboxone so I was only taken one a day, so it was rough so I kind of shut myself in the House, other than going to a couple of interviews I had. And then I got hired at the Texas roadhouse and I made my point yesterday, and he said look i'm not saying i'm going to relapse but he wrote me a prescription for clonidine, just in case I. have it, because he said I know you've been struggling you along with back and forth, he said i'm not saying you're going to but just you have a backup and I said okay that's good I like the fact that i'll have that as a backup. Just in case not saying that i'm going to because I actually made it this time without it, because I kept telling myself. it's okay you're only got one a day, yes it's not a lot or going to survive it's going to be okay like you've only got a couple more days, I know that i'm doing this bad way, I know I shouldn't be purchasing all for somebody else but I made it work, and here I am still sober."
510.0,Provider,"I know all right well and I, like the self talk, you know I cannot do this, you are really kind of giving yourself that pep. talk like you have the confidence you have the strength within you it's not a character motto and people relapse. Just means you might eventually me more intensive support so i'm hopeful that you with the job that this will provide the structure and balance that I think you've been really yearning for. Yes, it will i'm really excited about this i'm like super I was so happy when they hired me because i've all i've had. Recently, I know you."
11376.0,Patient,"really need to we actually went there to pick up food one night and he was like hey are you guys hiring me and she goes, yes, who do you want to, and I was, like me and she's like girl put your APP in your higher and I was she was not kidding."
510.0,Provider,"Nice well good, I know that kind of helps boost your self worth when we have a. purpose somewhere to be there, depending on you it's it's there's a win, win. For and and it allows you not to be sitting at home idle. yeah I think it's been tough for you okay. Okay. um I did want to share that I finally I have been given a name of who you will now be assigned to after later this week on October 2 because my last day remember is this Friday. If your group member manny."
11376.0,Patient,he's going to be your third cool.
510.0,Provider,You know him So how do you feel about that. That was a good fit.
11376.0,Patient,"Yes, and I just actually asked him yesterday, and he said why don't know who it is, but they should have it lined up I know they had a meeting and they said that they had everything pretty much lineup so that's kind of cool. All right, yeah that's it yeah I like a continuity for you. I don't want to like start completely over because he came. In with one on on that makes me feel so much better now."
510.0,Provider,"And i'm really glad that's I immediately thought of that too, because, and I appreciate your honesty last week, you were like I really angry and just know as a day or I can handle that I can hear it. But I would. Please when manny was assigned because i'm like that will help the continuity for you. So you feel like you have heard. All over yeah."
11376.0,Patient,"And I said that to him in the doctor yesterday, like it sucks like I was almost in tears, I was like I had to start all over, and you know it's hard and I didn't want to have to, and now now Now I know Okay, this is this okay look."
510.0,Provider,i'm on another.
11376.0,Patient,"got a good counselor to replace my good counselor like hello, I was really glad that I saw that connection."
510.0,Provider,"So good excellent all right, well, it sounds like things are moving in. a really good direction, not that they weren't before."
11376.0,Patient,"But I know we were slow, you know we want that instant gratification and then blow that always like. Come on, and I was in that low and now it's like things are moving forward i'm like okay I waited it out, yes I slipped and fell once but I made it and i'm sober and it's good so like hey."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, what do you think, in addition to just maintaining your appointments with bright heart are there other things that you recognize that you want to be doing to kind of sustain your sobriety and you might already be doing them. Friday, but I wrecked my a book last week. Oh Nice."
11376.0,Patient,"Okay. I mean I kind of locked myself in the House because i'm on a bad street and I was like I can't go outside because, like, I know I don't have what I need right now, and like I need just like me, so I was like oh correct my book and. Stick my head in there for a little bit so yeah that's I did that and like i've been easier with myself, as you said, like i've been kind of trying to talk to myself a lot nicer and like be a little more gentle with myself."
510.0,Provider,"So that sounds passion, yes, that self. compassion it's really difficult, especially when we know we've messed up or we feel. failed something. But that truly is the anecdote recognize what you're feeling allow it, but then comfort attend to yourself, which it sounds like you're doing so now you are the one who told me about an APP in the room, or in the in the. In the meeting yeah are you doing. Yes."
11376.0,Patient,"I heard, I have not actually logged into that I did bring it up in the group a couple weeks ago after we talked about it."
510.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, I was thinking about that too, since i've shared that resource with others, so it was a great resource that I wasn't aware of."
11376.0,Patient,And I shared it with everybody in there and then. The doctor also not the doctor the counselor what's his name oh my. Name wrong man. yeah he um he actually then shared a couple that he knew about as well with the group so that was kind of.
