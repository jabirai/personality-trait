Okay, so I have what normally would be you know individual therapy with me would be quite a bit more low key and a nice even pace. you've had some impression of me from group, but even more so there's this whole other impression to get in working with me and individual therapy, but this is not going to be a great first impression. Because I got that's a two hour assessment, I got to get done in about 15 minutes so i'm pretty good at it so, but the way that I accomplish it is. Encouraging my clients to follow a couple of tricks. i'm going to be asking a lot of questions and the natural human impulse is going to be to want to explain why you're giving me the answer so hold back on that if you can and we're going to get into why. You have the answer you do at a later time there's no way we'll get through this assessment if I hear why you're answering really war, so if I say for shoes of an opiate and you want to tell me about an A surgery.

12309.0,Patient,Though.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, all right now, this is the harder of these. may be listing a bunch of words and they are words that describe the quality of the relationship with your mother and the lifetime sometimes over a lifetime it changes. that's fine. don't worry about when it happened. If it happened then endorse that word by saying yes adequate. Not close yes consistent very fulfilling so that's what i'm looking for me to say these words only because you're not looking at the list i'm reading them to you i'm going to clump them in threes but they have no relevance chunk together. Okay."
12309.0,Patient,Good.
105.0,Provider,"Just tell me if they represent the quality of the relationship with your mother, for example, any of these adequate closer consistent."
12309.0,Patient,"you're looking for, yes or no."
105.0,Provider,"so well that, yes, would mean that they were clumped together. So, so we can do it a couple of different ways, you can be like yes adequate. And all assume if you don't say yes to one that I won't mark them if you say out loud, the one you like or two you like, then I then that will be the way we'll do this."
12309.0,Patient,"So, if one stands out more than the other two then say that one."
105.0,Provider,Or we could do it a really hard way and I could read them one by one. it'll take a really long.
12309.0,Patient,Time i'm just trying to get an idea of what you're. looking for.
105.0,Provider,"yeah I want to listen closely you're almost there once we get it if the switch will go on, if you like these, if they represent words that are the quality of the relationship than, say them. Adequate close when you hear one or two or three say the ones you like how about that will do it that way. Okay, and if I start saying too many at a time, maybe threes too many I can shove them into tues. So let's say you're doing great.

What is it that you think, and this will be maybe one of the first schools i'm going to want to have a goal for substance use that's anything you want to, we want to work on, you can tease them apart, if you want to some people lump them all together. But this isn't a quote it's what you want it will follow us every month we'll look at it and see how you're doing. i'm going to want one that has to do more with. personal growth or your wellness program I don't care what it is it's not stuff I am asking you to do it's where you want to see some improvement. Typically, we think in terms of I want more of this I want less of something else to be thinking, I want to increase this, I want to decrease that. that'll make the the treatment planning really sharp and useful but there also might be something with the family, there might also be something with the marriage take a minute and think let's you can start with any of those topics, you want."

105.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is a crisis moment."
12309.0,Patient,Okay.

12309.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
105.0,Provider,"that's Okay, I know I know well that just means that you have remorse and you care about her. Okay, you can you can have earned trust back, we can lose it in an instant it does take time to earn it back."
12309.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and we'll talk we'll talk with her and find out exactly how and what she needs to see. We need to know what it is that she's measuring and if you're open and curious and humble. If you can hear the painful truth of what she's going to use to measure and not be angry that it may take time and repeat and repetition of it then there's hope Okay, but we got to be able to hear what she's measuring she may not know either."
12309.0,Patient,She does she's she's trying.
105.0,Provider,she's trying okay.
12309.0,Patient,I don't want to use every good.
105.0,Provider,"I don't want to use now I use specific with what you don't want to use. Anything okay I don't want to use anything. Right. Now, on a personal growth level where do you have room to improve which you'd like to see more of you'd like to see."
12309.0,Patient,More time with my family.
105.0,Provider,"like to spend time with. that's a lot, you gave us really, really good goals and that will steer, at least in the beginning, where we go, so now. Have you already talked with her about meeting you and I haven't met so there's no rapport there's just no baseline at all. I do kind of recommend you meet with me once at least to get a flavor of me so that you can have confidence when you then have to sell to her, I trust this lady she can be quite unbiased and she she'll she'll help i'm not saying i'm going to be the couples therapist. I can't do that right, but I can use. The intervention itself to support your goals and it clearly is what brought you to tears just now, so I know it's a major stressor for you and I can do that. But. What have you already talked to her about what does she want to do is she willing to do so far."
12309.0,Patient,he's willing to talk to you. She just doesn't know. Where that. Is in the timeline to be most helpful. In my situation. She wants me to be more reliable.
105.0,Provider,"And you sound very, very willing to do that you're willing to show up you don't mind being measured in that way i'm getting that feeling and so. that's a welcoming I just want to fix things. Okay, all right Okay, so that sounds like there's some damage there, and so, first let me get a sense I do want to meet with you, let me let's start with that. let's schedule an appointment, I want to hear because I don't know you, yet when it comes. To the skills, you have I mean, I can see the humility. You know. But I don't know anything about your management of your your emotions I don't I don't know what has really happened over those was about 10 years you were an active addiction."
12309.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,Okay right so um.
12309.0,Patient,"Well, I mean more than that, if you consider the drinking them were 20 years so it's been 20 years."
105.0,Provider,"So let's say you do so, so let's just start with, I want to meet you. kind of understand what your current resources are on because before I do something I want to make sure, because you're going to remain my client. client will not change into the couple, you will remain plant, and this is just an intervention My hope is that she'll feel good in the experience and if it turns out that what I bring is not enough to facilitate enough of the structure for you to. Carry on you, the healing together that you go out and that you find someone that you trust, but you'll have a flavor of my way, and then you can be a consumer of that in the next couple of therapist okay. Oh okay alright so let's first start with scheduling something just with you i'm just going to tell you right now the next week is difficult. Because all that's left, right now is a 7am spot on October 21 so we can move it to the following week and then card out, and I will start to protect a time that works better. I think some of your days you go in at 10 or something I can't remember."
12309.0,Patient,"For. And you go in, through no. I go to work. I usually leave my house at about 5pm and I worked until 6:15am."
105.0,Provider,"Alright, so let me ask you I can't remember if I asked when I first met you some people when they do that late night shift thing they still have enough reserve to meet with me some people are so cognitively wiped out, they can't possibly do that."
12309.0,Patient,or yeah I usually tend to come home and go right to bed.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, that won't work because you're going to be completely so um once what's the earliest that you can get up, can you get up at 12 and meet with me, can you get up at 11 and meet with me."
12309.0,Patient,"yeah I can get up at. The little bit later, you have is better."
105.0,Provider,"yeah I can see it now, because if you're home at six you can often sex when you land at the House."
12309.0,Patient,"I don't get here until. seven seven in the morning. So what I do do is I work. Sunday Monday, Tuesday every other Saturday, so I have worked three and then i'm off three and then I work for and then i'm off for so the days that i'm off. You know I can. I can get up. At noon, or one."
105.0,Provider,"let's do that you I won't remember what you said. What you do, which days you have off next week."
12309.0,Patient,"Next week. Next week, is my Saturday Sunday Monday, Tuesday, so i'm off Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Every every week i'm off Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
105.0,Provider,So what would happen if you.
12309.0,Patient,"Say have group on Thursday and we can't do those same day, if I remember correctly."
105.0,Provider,yeah That was the 7am spot that I had to and worked anyway yay. well. What about. What about one. One o'clock on October 22 that's Friday.
12309.0,Patient,Okay. yeah. October 20 to 1pm.
105.0,Provider,"And i'm going to let's go another week forward and start to carve these out so that. there's some protection Okay, so that on that week you are off Saturn. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, maybe and week."
12309.0,Patient,"i'm off I work every Sunday Monday, Tuesday."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, I see."
12309.0,Patient,"Every Sunday Monday, Tuesday, alternating Saturdays so i'm off every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Those are guaranteed days off. Every every week."
105.0,Provider,Okay okay um.
12309.0,Patient,My schedules rough I know. Those 12 hour shifts are brutal.
105.0,Provider,"Group. same thing I guess it's one o'clock on October 29. So the problem with these is there's zero room if that ball gets dropped there's no way to make it up oftentimes people they something happens i'll say up well, let me another day this week there's no once you missed that so that's just keep that in mind, because it's connected to. The frequency of the prescription, if you want to have this sort of compliance thing happened. Right so i'm just saying you gotta going on won't be an issue but it's it's just a little harder for people when it's at the end of the week."
12309.0,Patient,Okay. yeah though it won't be a problem.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so. October 29 so you have to 1pm Friday appointments. Through together. might start to be the deal since really Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are not options for you. Okay meeting a group on Thursday okay. Okay, do you have medication bridge to today, in other words, you will be short i'm. know you have your group tomorrow, so my guess is, you have to get you had your dose today."
12309.0,Patient,Do you have right. Tomorrow yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay you're fine so just make sure she really knows. I do need a prescription, although she should probably know that."
12309.0,Patient,"yeah i'm down to up and taking it exactly pretty much i'm down to. What like to. To the strips left, I think, so that would be today the rest of today and tomorrow."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
12309.0,Patient,So I should be fine.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and so you're you separate them to two doses in a day you do that."
12309.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's to two doses per day.
105.0,Provider,"Okay right for now we'll leave it at that, but there's there's some wisdom to not doing that and we can explore that another time most of my clients just take a dose once in morning but we'll get into that another time okay."
12309.0,Patient,Okay that's just how she started the prescription.
105.0,Provider,"that's fine, you have a reasoning, but sure caseload most people take it once a day but we'll get into that. And right now we're just getting the settling in you're getting a comfort level we just did our bio psychosocial so we have great goals and we have a plan for the next couple weeks. And sounds like Shell for services a bright heart show up to the commitments you make in your family and in your marriage."
12309.0,Patient,And you.
105.0,Provider,Know like yourself a lot more.
12309.0,Patient,"yeah I just hope I haven't ruined it, you know that's. it's the whole i've tried to stop a few times and said I you know, I was doing good then following the off she's having trouble believing that this is."
105.0,Provider,"For real yeah, and so I don't know either so i'm going to do a little vacation all investigate about. Which didn't didn't do with these other treatment modalities with this year long and so i'm gonna i'm gonna try and understand a little bit about what change, you did make and which didn't. Know let's see. let's see what you can commit to but, honestly commit to it because it's it's a big commitment, this is a lifetime commitment."
12309.0,Patient,"yeah yeah well, the thing about this is, I was getting all this stuff in place, because I was getting so out of control that. Then, the last time that we had an issue and we had this okay you're you're back doing this again. I had this in place so that helped solidify but I was done, I was finally done before I always had it in the back of my head, you know just stopped now I can I can use a little bit here and there, it's not not the mindset anymore, yes, it is totally it's a different mindset so. i'm done with it."
105.0,Provider,i'll see you tomorrow.
12309.0,Patient,Alright sounds good.
105.0,Provider,I think it's you.
