14304.0,Patient,Now printed it out and worked on it and.
741.0,Provider,Would you come up with.
14304.0,Patient,"Well, I found out that when i'm about to well. In the past I haven't done any lately, but when i'm going to relapse i'm feel very anxious and I have, I feel lethargic and not want to do anything you know and. I don't get angry or anything you know I don't have that kind of problem is just that I feel like something's missing, you know and then. And so that that's where the anxiety comes in it's like well you know I really could use the drink right now, but then I decided no and best, not because you know if i'm feeling this way I may just overdue, and then you know go back to where I was."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
14304.0,Patient,that's what I got out of this whole thing you know air to be early the little bit of depression of course anxiety and. So you know. that's that's basically what.
741.0,Provider,"yeah so. Okay, so activity is good, I mean and you've got plenty of."
14304.0,Patient,holidays.
741.0,Provider,Good busy i'm. Depression. will have to work on CNN figuring out. Where that comes from and what we can do to combat it.
14304.0,Patient,"Well, you know depression is one thing and depending on what's causing it, as you said, but you know alcohol is a depressant to start with."
741.0,Provider,Right and makes it worse.
14304.0,Patient,"and worse. So when you don't have that to fall back on, then you feel like well there's something missing, you know. And, as I told you, before I tried to substitute sparkling waters and stuff when I started to feel that kind of a deal, or if I feel like I needed a drink after. yard workers hard Labor or something you know I do that so anyway, I think i've found a way to cut it off, you know what i'm saying before it really gets to a point where I go into total depression and it's not a bad depression i'm is just kind of like feeling. kind of like this morning um you know."
741.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and but you know, I think that that is, those types of just a little bit of depression not anything serious, is where we get into trouble when we don't address it, because we think it's not that big of a deal. We don't handle it we don't deal with it."
14304.0,Patient,"I mean it's not so bad, where I want to harm myself."
741.0,Provider,No.
14304.0,Patient,"crazy, you know it's just."
741.0,Provider,Low if she's still a little bit.
14304.0,Patient,Missing you know and it's just that's how it feels like yes.
741.0,Provider,I get I get this restlessness.
14304.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
741.0,Provider,"And that's not necessarily I mean. I have plenty of things I can do, I just don't feel like doing."
14304.0,Patient,"Lack of lack of activity, you know. When yeah when it's like I would just sit down do nothing you know. I don't achieve anything by doing that, obviously."
741.0,Provider,"Well Okay, but is there. Some activity that could be um. That you enjoy that can be sedentary. Like for me, sometimes taking care of myself is coming up with a cup of coffee and a good book."
14304.0,Patient,"i've done that, and I do that right in the middle of a real long. Under Hamilton and it's like thousands of pages. very interesting. But you know it's like. When I have time i'll read it, but then, when I don't I don't you know because i've got so many irons in the fire. But then when I feel like I have nothing to do or feel like doing nothing, then I will do a cup of coffee and read you know I do exactly what you were just saying so."
741.0,Provider,"yeah just. Just find that little something when you start feeling that restlessness. Right and you don't feel well like like this morning. This is one of those things. Okay, give me a cup of coffee or a drink that i'm that I will comfort me. Right and then sit down with a good book because I don't get to read very off."
14304.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Too much going on, or i'm reading because of professional you know continuing education or whatever i'm talking about finding something that I want to read some fiction, or something that i'm wanting, and then that takes care of. me that makes me feel good. Right It nurtures the slight depression and. Sometimes I sometimes I want to sit down watch a movie."
14304.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,Because I can be sat there are times when I need to be mindless I need to put my mind to rest. So i'll sit down and watching TV.
14304.0,Patient,Sometimes when i'm watching a movie I feel kind of bad because I feel like i'm wasting time you know.
741.0,Provider,I have to make sure I don't do it for very long but yes.
14304.0,Patient,yeah yes.
741.0,Provider,"So yeah those are that those are the types of things that that we can do. That will um. They nurture us, whatever and you know we start feeling lot. A look just a little bit depressed and like we don't want to do something or restless, then we need to nurture what's going on."
14304.0,Patient,"Facebook, yes, we need to, we need to channel that feeling into something else instead of just you know, having that feeling and dwelling with a few call it such."
741.0,Provider,"Right well i'm only Lena checked, then we start our mind starts wandering off the stuff that we probably don't need to be doing, you know. So and. I was gonna. check oh see. There is, I don't remember which one it is, though. There is another one. That kind of. Oh that's that's cool. But I think we've already pretty much. handle that emotional self care. That we use affirmations for but."
14304.0,Patient,"And sometimes when I get into a Funk like this, I will sit down and just be calm and do some meditation and think of positive things. Which right to you know. avoid being so negative about the situation at all."
741.0,Provider,"yeah i'm changing our perspective and our attitude, one of the things. That I like to do is um. I start my morning was a gratitude list. And I actually write it down. You know. What is it that i'm grateful for, and not just the straightforward stuff but the paradoxical stuff that i'm. The things that you know, like being grateful for a negative situation, something that I don't particularly like or want to experience, but because I go through it. I get positive changes from it."
14304.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"i'm like like addiction that's not I mean most people it's a really horrible experience. But without the addiction. There are so many things that they don't learn about themselves about the people around them. About a lot of people don't gain any kind of spirituality unless they have an addiction and I have to rely on a higher power. Right to help them get through it. And so, those are the type of of things that they're a little more difficult to find. um, but they are. they're important to think about and they help change your attitude um I have a client. who's living in his vehicle. hmm makes me very, very grateful that I have a home. yeah you know i'm."
14304.0,Patient,home and squirrels and raccoons and whatever else you know.
741.0,Provider,"yeah exactly exactly i'm perfectly okay with that. i'm Okay, this one relapse triggers and Q. Be. Let me see if I can pull that one up. Okay we've got that second bullet here. Okay, so these are triggers and q's what's your pretty you already pretty much have a. Solid understanding on. um. But like it says, we have to stay aware of the things that can trigger us. And you've pretty much pull up some of that like not feeling quiet your best. restlessness and depression and it can also be um relapse can also be triggered by sights sounds and situations um when I first got into recovery, I was unfortunately hooked on heroin and I didn't realize afterward until I was in the kitchen with someone who pulled out some vinegar. And that smell. triggered a lot of memories. So. um and it's something that they they break down the heroin with I don't know but I, it was like I was totally overwhelmed and I had to leave the room. um, but there are things like that that can trigger us to have those memories of using or. Or, to put us in a mood where we. would consider doing that."
14304.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"This this worksheet goes over some of those triggers and q's some of them are emotional, some of them are actually physical i'm like the sights and sounds um. So let's see describe people. Well okay your your."
14304.0,Patient,don't do that.
741.0,Provider,"Your solo so maybe maybe in certain situations you being alone and isolated, not necessarily isolated, but just you being alone, maybe that triggers something. i'm just grasping at straws okay. you're the only one that knows that."
14304.0,Patient,yeah it could be.
741.0,Provider,i'm.
14304.0,Patient,Like I tell you I had my refrigerator in the garage.
741.0,Provider,yeah and you hadn't tucked away and.
14304.0,Patient,"yeah and you know I think go in there and sneak and, but I think it was basically it was like a game. Right see what you can get away with you know."
741.0,Provider,yeah like a little kid.
14304.0,Patient,"yeah and when you win the game, you lose you know. Like it's like Why do it it's just going to cause you trouble in the long run, you know. Exactly but it's it's a it's a mental thing is something in the back of your head that says Oh, I think I need and you say Oh yes, I think I need you know, so you go help yourself. As I mentioned i've pretty much put into that because i've restarted with water, instead of beavers you know. yeah so it's kind of hard to have a beer when you don't have one."
741.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly. Anyway, some of the other, and I think addictive behaviors are often partners social activities, and I think in your case is probably the other way around, but um. There are people out there who don't care that you're in recovery and maybe try to persuade teaser argument know argue with you to get you to relax misery loves company. Yes, and i'm. Maybe not so much in your situation, but I know in my own situation boy howdy I had to get away from all them people because they did not want me to get clean and get better. yeah um that included my husband, and that was you know Val is devastating that he didn't want to get clean and sober either, but i'm."
14304.0,Patient,You gotta do you gotta do you know.
741.0,Provider,"Exactly, but that night I had to walk away. yeah um."
14304.0,Patient,"Well, just like Bowling you know a lot of people say oh yeah you go to Bowling alley just drink beer, you know, a bicep pitcher of beer drink well. In the past I have but I don't anymore, because, first of all. The legal belong to is like a morning Lee and you know. yeah they don't sell beer before noon anyway, and the League starts before that and. So I have coffee, you know. And, and in the meantime I don't really miss it, you know."
741.0,Provider,it's right.
14304.0,Patient,will make me bowl any better or probably worse is what it would do but anyway so being bold going Bowling is not what. What is the stigma or whatever that people think that this is a place to go and party and drink in you know.
741.0,Provider,Right.
14304.0,Patient,"I there's one team. long time ago, the team name was here for the beer, you know."
741.0,Provider,Right like.
14304.0,Patient,"No man so anyway enough about that, but i'm just saying that you know there's my This is basically when i'm around people are a lot of people. And I have no desire and most of the people are all retired and they don't have this art there's only one guy who does drink beer and I don't know how he gets it or where he gets it, but he does and. So you know that's that's his problem or his thing and. stay away from that you know. So this is for the atmosphere around. i'm pretty much like a loner i'm retired i'm at home, I do stuff you know all the stuff that I do, and this is the only social connection I guess you would call it with friends and associates. there's there's nothing there to tempt me."
741.0,Provider,"Well, the other thing and. When we just when we um. we're out there, doing our thing sometimes. People and they will lists to do what we did. and family members friends co workers. They helped. avoid the consequences. So, like, for me, every time I got into trouble my mom bailed me out. Right. Like if I didn't have money for rent she pay the rent well that that helped me go ahead and spend my money on whatever I wanted to. Exactly and those there are people in in most situations that make it easier for us to keep doing what we're doing. So that's another trigger or Q. i'm. That person. Basically, either means to change or needs to understand that you don't want them to bail you out anymore."
14304.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,um but you got to figure out who those people are because some of them will help you. Get clean and stay clean and other people won't.
14304.0,Patient,yeah because they. yeah they want to be part of the system they want you to be part of the system.
741.0,Provider,"it's kind of like you meet they need you to be sick. yeah so that they can continue being sick in their behavior so they can continue to rescue you um. They got to put their their rescue Cape on and. pretend to be Superman and you know. So, then, for this thing it says, for each of the groups listed describe how you'll avoid relapse. triggers. By their actions so companions. etc and people pressuring you enablers just making a list of those those different areas. of people. And some of them may apply to you, and some of them may not. And, and then I. Look at different situations like i'm some people when they go fishing fishing and beer this, you know that that's gonna happen. yeah i'm."
14304.0,Patient,been there.
741.0,Provider,They may have to to stop going fishing if they can't learn how to go fishing and drink a soda or you know.
14304.0,Patient,"Like I said, been there, done that, and I quit fishing i've got a garage full of fishing tackle but. use it in over 30 years."
741.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14304.0,Patient,Which is. good and bad I really like fishing. But. i've learned that you know it may not be good for me.
741.0,Provider,"Right well you're you're down by the goals, and that would be really I would love to go out and do some deep sea fishing but."
14304.0,Patient,"Well, I was in best clubs, I was in three different bass clubs i'm on my own boat even and we'd go out like once a month, you know and go fishing on the lake. basket and it was fun, you know it's fun to be around the guys and we'd stay overnight, and you know we took turns cooking and doing all that stuff. Right there's like the whole weekend just. Fishing but. I guess it just kind of got old after a while and started, not to do it anymore, because."
741.0,Provider,Right.
14304.0,Patient,It wasn't good for me.
741.0,Provider,Right right. and So there's a lot of course people on us addictions to couple of stress and relationship issues um. So.
14304.0,Patient,"That has to. yeah because there was a lot of stress and relationship issues because of my drinking and my wife and I have decided that she doesn't. drink wine or anything at all, either until I do, then we do it together if we will and it's like I said, one or two glasses and that's it so she is totally behind it actually she's the one who, prompted me to do this."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
14304.0,Patient,"evolved to do it with me, you know so. anyway."
741.0,Provider,"Well, and I think you already pretty much addressed this number seven where you know you have a daily routine or something that you did it certain times like after you finish cutting the long run. right that kind of thing. In your daily routine where you're most vulnerable. So um, but this is just trying to help you become aware of those things that I think you've already gotten a little further than that, but sometimes there are things that. They can pull up for you that you didn't have."
14304.0,Patient,Awareness right.
741.0,Provider,"um so i'm. Trying to think. i'm looking at some of these to see if there's any and and there's all this will kind of help you put down okay you feel anxiety, what are you going to do to cope with that. And you can come up with several different options to choose from meditate um you know go out and work in the yard, I mean just like saying."
14304.0,Patient,yeah read a book or have a cup of coffee or. You know right take your mind off of it basically amounts to.
741.0,Provider,"well. A lot of times, we have to actually get to the root. What is it that's causing it. Where is where is the anxiousness which is usually fear based we're worried, is that what's causing that. um. I would venture to say that um. Because you said, like if you watch TV too long you feel like you're wasting time. yeah and maybe that is anxious and anxiety come about in that type of situation because you are afraid you're not going to accomplish everything you need to."
14304.0,Patient,"Well i'm. Well i'm very, very active person, as you know, by what all I do."
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14304.0,Patient,"And if i'm. sitting there you know sedimentary it's like. I should be doing something else, so, so the anxiety is. Right I that says hey you know you could be building or whatever you know or doing something else or tending your garden or whatever."
741.0,Provider,"Right, you should be doing something productive. I was raised with that attitude to that I should be doing productive. activities at all times. Right, so that makes it really difficult for me to sit down and rest. be okay sitting still and being that's when I have to start meditating. um. Because it's okay to sit still it's okay to not be productive 24 seven. Right um in fact it's actually healthy to not be productive all the time."
14304.0,Patient,"yeah if you're productive all the time being burn yourself out let's put it that way. And exactly, and you know that's the downside of being the kind of. A person that I am you know it's just like sometimes I overdo and just so exhausted that you know I can't do anything more. Right right my fault so i've got a real once that it's time to quit if you're in the middle of a project and. And you're you're tired."
741.0,Provider,"Right and what are those signals that you're tired and. or another way that sometimes I handle it as I OK, I have a lot a certain amount of time to do something. If it's finished great if it's not. Too bad, I have to stop and take a break."
14304.0,Patient,"Well, you know it'll."
741.0,Provider,I can always go back.
14304.0,Patient,But it'll still be there.
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14304.0,Patient,let's finish so.
741.0,Provider,"Exactly um so those you know there's some different things that, but you have to look at what is it that is causing. That anxiety that boredom that restlessness and, for me, I know it's because I was taught that I must be productive. Right I that sitting still is laziness."
14304.0,Patient,wow.
741.0,Provider,"And that's not. that's not accurate, but that was the message that I got growing up."
14304.0,Patient,"Well, this is funny because I am the same way. The same way."
741.0,Provider,"As I have a friend who calls me. A Dewar because i'm constantly doing so. All right, i'm going to send you this and."
14304.0,Patient,Make sure it's a PDF please.
