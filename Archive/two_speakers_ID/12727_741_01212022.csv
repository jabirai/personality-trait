741.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you doing."
12727.0,Patient,i'm doing pretty good. awesome can't complain.
741.0,Provider,All right. Did you get the worksheets I sent you.
12727.0,Patient,"I did it was. very helpful. was that there were stuck on there yeah there was stuff on there I didn't like even. realize. yeah that could you didn't even realize that was like even heard of it and that going through it and reading it, I realized there was stuff that like. Either I had done in the past with grief or somebody else had done and realizing that's why you know they're either acting that way or. i'm just being just being different in general, you know, but you you don't see. grief to everybody else, usually just seemed you know, like either like crying or being just angry, or just kind of staying away but there's just so much more to it, you know, everybody handles it so much differently."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
12727.0,Patient,"yeah my mom you know, and she is just having a really hard time."
741.0,Provider,i'm.
12727.0,Patient,"realizes it, you know cuz show even say you know I don't get the grandkids like I was and and she's just right across the street from me, you know so. yeah and the kids don't go over as often as what they even used to like my my older kids do but, like my daughter who's seven. She don't just walk over like she used to, and I think that's hard on her because my aunt lived across the street to. And so that's like a remembrance to her going over there and visiting and if she has to walk over there, then it starts, you know she remembers and then she just kind of stays away to herself so it's been it's been definitely an adjustment."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
12727.0,Patient,"My mom is probably taken it harder, you know that any of us, but I was able to. Somebody was selling reba neck or your tickets, and that was one of my favorite singers but they wasn't able to go and there's a set of three so I reached out and. I was able to get them for pretty decent price yesterday for where we're at because I live in fremont Ohio and that's in your Toledo and that's where the concert with at so I was able to pick those up last week and we went last night. And I was able to take her best friends with me and her because my sister wasn't able to go but. She needed it it it did us really good it."
741.0,Provider,is good.
12727.0,Patient,"It was a good for us it was a good bonding and memory experience and. Somebody we both had been wanting to see forever so that that kind of broke the Shell, a little bit with her, she. kind of. back a little bit you know it was you can see kind of like a breath of fresh air tight."
741.0,Provider,Right.
12727.0,Patient,Right it's not it was really nice but.
741.0,Provider,It wasn't released that she needed.
12727.0,Patient,"Definitely like it's gonna be okay, I can do this, like you know continue on and yeah. Right she's gonna have her days we're all going to have them but. That should I. know it was OK, and not to worry about everybody all the time she needs to take that time for herself because that's what she does she gives gives and gives."
741.0,Provider,yeah now. she's at a replenishment. South at this point.
12727.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's how you know she's always so worried about everybody even like you know my cousins and you know how are they doing without their mom how's the husband do and that's how my mom's always been, but she does need to focus on her. She doesn't she's not going to have nothing to go. Exactly gonna it's gonna. Take her you know."
741.0,Provider,"Right when we. be replenished, in order to give out. yeah if we not. Get replenishment. Then we don't have anything to get it."
12727.0,Patient,"yep yeah and I think she's realizing that you know because, like I said she is a helper and a giver and all that, but she has kind of. A hold on yeah yeah yeah she hasn't done as much because she's noticing people's actions, and you know if. she's noticed not so many people have reached out to her to check in on her and she's doing a daily and to play guys and i'm not putting the brakes on it completely but. i'm going to stop doing that and see you know if I don't reach out first who's going to reach out to me. right and it sucks but but that's how you learn, so you know and."
741.0,Provider,"there's also some other things that she can do to to replenish yourself some books, she can read on grief."
12727.0,Patient,yeah cuz she's a book reader anyways she. read books.
741.0,Provider,If she is she spiritual at all.
12727.0,Patient,"um she was raised Catholic she that upbringing us that way, but she does get spiritual at times so people on my aunt was really sick she told me. I would say, maybe, four days before she passed she goes, this was the first time in a long time that I can remember. That I actually sat in my room and really physically prayed like I had never done that, and so long and I noticed like when I walked into the House she is playing a lot more spiritual things or she's listening to podcasts and so she does kind of get on that end of it."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
12727.0,Patient,"yeah I think she gets her sometimes but you know that, yes, she does she does believe in definitely the higher power and all that yes."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, well, because some of that stuff is very healing and very replenishing and then she can can get the replenishment from."
12727.0,Patient,from God I.
741.0,Provider,then still have something to give out.
12727.0,Patient,But yeah.
741.0,Provider,doesn't then.
12727.0,Patient,"No she definitely does. So, and I, you know, I was never brought really that way, I mean I always knew, you know, believe in a higher power believes. The afterlife and so mad, and so you know I get into it sometimes but it's just some of this is so, confusing to me i'm just like Oh, but I definitely know there is somebody looking out after us, and all that you know, so I do. Have. An actor friend. Okay."
741.0,Provider,I had the worksheet. That can help you sort out what is spiritual what's religion. And what you believe.
12727.0,Patient,Okay yeah that is great.
741.0,Provider,"it's just asking some questions. Yes, go through it and that really good. yeah because. i'll be very honest. My experience is I had 13 years of sobriety. I white knuckled it every day, I was not spiritual I was angry at God didn't want anything to do with them. And I white knuckled it every single day so every day is that 13 years I wanted to use. yeah and I relapsed. This time, and when I went into treatment, then that very first night I screamed out to God. telling him that i've tried everything else I don't know what to do, anymore. Please remove the desire to use from me. And i'll give you my life."
12727.0,Patient,Right i've heard a lot of people say that.
741.0,Provider,"You know what the next morning, the desire to use. And I haven't I have not used. For 15 years and I have not had the desire to you at all. Now I have to maintain that."
12727.0,Patient,"Oh yeah definitely sounds. Like switching is gone, but."
741.0,Provider,"yeah but that's that. That happened and because I have grown spiritually over the last 15 years. I wouldn't trade it any up, I mean this time being clean and sober, this is what life is about. Right i'm okay with."
12727.0,Patient,"The right that was also like it, it was. His time to show you also that this was your time to reach out to help you know exactly we do things when it's our time little we're riding on his ready for it, so therefore the 13 times or 13 years before then he just wasn't ready for you, though. yeah."
741.0,Provider,"I wasn't ready. Yet, because, at the very beginning, I think I was six months clean. That first time and my father died from cancer. And he had cancer throat cancer for six months. And when I came home to visit him. I saw a 57 year old man that looked like a 98 year old man. Here it was awful."
12727.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah that's something I found I was with my aunt you know it was just like night and day like we've seen her every day and then just within two weeks see this drastically notice like. That age like 20 years but then what's so crazy is the day that we buried her. And everybody kept saying it the day that she had even as soon as she passed, it was like she gained 10 years it was so weird and then at the funeral home, we were like she looks 20 years younger, it was just and. Now we're makeup. yeah it was just you can definitely how she didn't look set it was gone. So."
741.0,Provider,"and According to my belief that, when we pass we are healed completely. And we are no longer in pain we are no longer ill. And so that's reflected in."
12727.0,Patient,"The physical boss and that's how I see it, I see it as like when they owe it like I see it as an invoice she believed that is the day that she was the happiest in her life was pretty much how she's gonna be when she's there, which was the day she married her back her second. You know, and that. Probably like Am I looking at her, I was like that's like the image, I see with her later they're like that was 20 years ago it was so crazy to see her go back in time when she just looked like she was probably 70 or 80 and now she looks like she's 56 wow it was crazy with remarkable. It was yes yeah so like I do you know and there's little things that happen around this House has never happened, so I know she's here, I believe, in all of that, I believe in fines and numbers and. starting to like read up more on it, because there's been some really weird stuff you know this House for nine years and things that are happening has never happened and it's always at the same time yeah. That stuff down."
741.0,Provider,I moved into this House and 2014. But this House was built in 1920.
12727.0,Patient,Oh wow.
741.0,Provider,So there's a lot of stuff that's happened in this House. yeah and and i'm and I have. Had experiences on several occasions when i'm spraying in my.
12727.0,Patient,bedroom.
741.0,Provider,I have a fireplace in my bedroom and I sit next to the fireplace and I pray and do my meditation and stuff and i'll be sitting there and look over and over here on this side is a little demon laughing at me. And of course I have to leave. yeah welcome here. And then he needs to go on.
12727.0,Patient,And that's a perfect way to take you back and push you and push you further out of where you're at yep.
741.0,Provider,Right so i've had and i've anointed my fireplace and I prayed over it i've actually anointed every room in the House.
12727.0,Patient,"Why, I don't."
741.0,Provider,Know what's happened here.
12727.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,But there are some spirits that have decided to hang.
12727.0,Patient,"out that at all yeah. yeah my own son's girlfriend her mom is very like. She sees things like that that people will call her, and if they have like a feeling of a sense of somebody and they're like messing with them, she can go there and like. speak like get away get out daughter she does like physically like pushes something and they don't appear like they're gone she just did that, to a friend of hers where somebody. He kept selling the President he had been in this House for the longest time what a find out, it was a duplex and somebody must have had a somebody passed in the House apartment next door so that person was like stuck in there. And nobody could leave the doors right couldn't leave one day because she this was what she was speaking to this person because she's like she's like a medium, you know it's crazy. The spirit His name was, I think it was Jim or Joe or something like that told her that he never knew he could leave that house. And when he finally did he went next door and was just messing with to do just to mess with them, because he realized, he was getting a kick out of it. And then, once you finally told him okay well you're missing you're freaking them out we've been here for years, you know you gotta go you never came back like what the heck. She goes yeah he has never he never visited him again he just realized, I can mess with this dude i'm just going to do little funny stuff around here and mess with them and. mess with them. yeah that's crazy."
741.0,Provider,"Just like just like God has angels angel armies. Well Satan has Satan set up the world the same way that God set up the heavens. And so, he has demons for his army. Right and there are different levels. Just like there are different levels, and heaven, there are different levels of in on earth of his realm and his reign and and it's very simple to tell them to leave because if you're a believer. Then you have the authority. To try them out and it just and it's."
12727.0,Patient,yeah and then it's more if you think it's more stronger and powerful when it's coming from the demons because that's something you know you shouldn't be doing so it latches on quicker but. It just seems like it sticks so much you know it's that's why you only had the good and the evil good and the bad and when you believe it makes it easier to push.
741.0,Provider,Press cloud.
12727.0,Patient,"foundation and everything else, what yes. yeah push it away because you have something else to hold on to."
741.0,Provider,"Exactly and that the other thing too is that. The closer you get to God. The more. concerned and fearful Satan becomes so he will throw more at you. Right, but as long as you're close to God and have that relationship. Then. There isn't anything he can do."
12727.0,Patient,"Right so. And yeah i've never looked so much into it like I would go in and out like after my car accident, you know, a couple years ago I get a little bit into it and then. I kind of go back to you know fading away from it, but then when like big things happen it's definitely boldly right back so I know that's where I need to be majority of the time. Right and not just one big scientific things are happening, I need to keep them. All of it in my life at all times. Right is. It because it pulls so deep so so quick to you know go grab my Bible go grab my my Journal and go grab this go grab that and if I would just continue with it, so I have been pretty good with doing that lately, to the point where. If i'm thinking or feeling something i'll pick it up and look for a passage or i've got a couple of just stop spiritual little books and stuff i'll get into those and rebound so that does really seem to help so much."
741.0,Provider,there's an APP on your phone that you can get it's called you version.
12727.0,Patient,Of the Bible APP.
741.0,Provider,"It has a Bible, it has a full Bible, it has all different versions of the Bible that has daily devotional. That you can go work like you can there's like a whole bunch of them, that you can just pick them and then they have Bible reading plan and every day, they have a scripture and somebody preaching giving a word about it. that's really, really helpful and I spend like an hour every day in prayer. But you don't have I mean it doesn't take that long there's just. A lot of. Different stuff and um. But that would be very helpful for you to because it will also give you scriptures when you're feeling. A certain way. That kind of thing and then it'll really help you get into the word and learn about God."
12727.0,Patient,"Well yeah it'll keep me more consistent with it because it's a daily. That they have for every day, for your routine for me. to know I don't have to go and look. Good and it keeps me on track."
741.0,Provider,Right and it'll actually keep you keep a tab on how many days in a row.
12727.0,Patient,Oh cool.
741.0,Provider,you've been in the word. My current streak is like 500 and some odd.
12727.0,Patient,"Right that's how huck yeah because something that you want to thrive, for you want to."
741.0,Provider,"Yes, it has."
12727.0,Patient,"Like. You moving and that was it was you version, are you guys. You version."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so y O U D E R si O and that's all one word."
12727.0,Patient,Okay. yeah i'm gonna die that.
741.0,Provider,And it has. That that out that.
12727.0,Patient,that's a little picture thinking okay. yeah yeah i'm going to do that because that'll help me because i'm this way I don't have to try to go through and find passages are verses and Mr mad. yeah one.
741.0,Provider,"The other thing I like about it, too, is that I can I have it with me wherever I go. So it doesn't matter where I am or what happens."
12727.0,Patient,I have accent yeah. that's a good yeah like that. i'm.
741.0,Provider,Like because you know things happen when you're out and about. Sometimes I need help finding my time so I start looking for sprint.
12727.0,Patient,"Car hall. yeah I like that idea, though I like having it with me at all times. like that. Being yet."
741.0,Provider,So I will send you this worksheet. yeah and i'm. i'm glad that the other was helpful we didn't ever go over now me you're on top of the paper and I can't can't function honey now it's on the floor.

741.0,Provider,"Yes, they have both been in here all day. Keeping my other kitty out sila."
12727.0,Patient,"Oh, Lord."
741.0,Provider,But I have four of them and they're all alone and the mail is like 18 pounds.
12727.0,Patient,21 big.

12727.0,Patient,"And you lose my friend has Oh, which kind are though there's a bigger ones to feel like they're tight or leopard."
741.0,Provider,links.
12727.0,Patient,"That the links and there's another one they get pretty big they almost as like a dog, but they don't shatter anything. Wrong bank yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Banco kitties. yeah my like a dog to day yeah Let me move around, they say, well, close. They don't mind the water."
12727.0,Patient,"yeah. that's how hers are she has she has four of them yeah for, and there are huge like this either dog look like there's like little tigers are cougars and stuff just kind of. walk it out, or how."
741.0,Provider,"crazy yeah so. yeah I also am I never did send you anything on boundaries, I can send you some words. Okay i'm boundaries to but and whatever happened with the love languages, and the list that."
12727.0,Patient,"We did start that we started a little bit of it and then everything happened with my aunt but wasn't really good. We came to the understanding, where we're writing stuff down or leaving little sticky notes, which kind of how like you know i'm feeling like this today i'm feeling like that or I need this so ours is more of like the physical leap, we need to have. Instead of just telling our feelings we need to be showing our feelings and that way like if I say Okay, I was hurt by something you said i'll write it down so she doesn't take it, the wrong way, by the way, i'm saying it so a lot of it is us writing. And we don't do it and texts, no more because you can't tell how it taxes we just leave one little. sentence on a post, you know send it somewhere and we communicate pretty well like that, right now, but i'm from my aunt's past we've been a lot closer or not on each other's edge more we're helping out war we're listening. I was able to speak with her three things a little bit you know saying Oh, this is my space that's your space you don't like it, you have other options. And then, it was your kind of came out a little bit well you know your How would you want to kick your daughter out and i'm not kicking you out and give you that choice. You know you have a dad."
741.0,Provider,"This is the here, and you have the to the choice of living my."
12727.0,Patient,"dream yes and that's what we've come to and i've told her you know it's not about me kick you out and telling you the lead instead if that's the case you do have a dad you're not living there, because you know he wasn't put up with stuff so I don't want to hear you have to go to. A homeless shelter or do this do that because you don't have to these are the roles, if you don't like them, then you can go. You know, and so that sense that's kind of been brought about it's been a lot more peace, you know he knows i'm kind of not going to let her walk all over things anymore. So that has been a pretty good improvement. And I hate to say it, but like I said, you know let's dive. It has. Almost all of us. It can either put you away."
741.0,Provider,or and tear it down.
12727.0,Patient,"Yes, so that, for us that's kind of helped on that and other you know and pray that out and it stays and it's not one of them, things were like in a relationship to change things for six months, three months, then you go back to the old routine and you know that's why we've kind of stated. Right we're going to do and continue with that and then, if we need to add something later on and other steps, or something. we'll add that, and we have to take it away we'll take it away, but that has really worked just kind of like leaving little notes like might have to go somewhere i'll even know you know. Thanks for vacuuming just because it's hard, sometimes, and I think it was because it was never done in my home the same views so welcomes being appreciated for anything that you. know I see it as you're living here, so why do I have to tell you, thank you for doing that you should just do it. But then i'm thinking, you know that i'm remembering Okay, but she doesn't feel appreciated so i'll just tell her you know, thank you for sweeping. Even though my head still on like I really shouldn't have to you live here, but that makes them do more, so i'm gonna get what."
741.0,Provider,makes. them feel good about contributing.
12727.0,Patient,"yeah so you know, but some that simple that's what i'm doing you know throughout the day."
741.0,Provider,"I, what does it. yeah what does it cost to do that."
12727.0,Patient,"Nothing at all and it's helping so. You know right and that's really I think that's more or less a lot of that was. Her she needed to feel appreciative of the things that she was doing, even though I felt like it should have just been done you don't need the recommendation, but it's not hurting me by doing it, I just do it."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
12727.0,Patient,"trader is saying. yeah and I knew the same thing, though, and return, you know, thank you for my stay here. I didn't have to let you stay here, thank you for doing dinner doing my laundry you know all that stuff because you're an adult I shouldn't I don't have to be doing that, with you here, but I do it because i'm as my mode okay you got laundry laundry. Right, you know, but we all need that appreciation."
741.0,Provider,Right exactly she still needs to thank you.
12727.0,Patient,"it's you're doing or not. yeah you know hey Okay, I have cleaned."
741.0,Provider,Out of time to do. My laundry so. I don't have to so that's a cool thing.
12727.0,Patient,yeah exactly. So I have enough money to to do.
741.0,Provider,Right right.
12727.0,Patient,"But yeah but so it really has helped that's helped a lot yeah that's that really works really good for us. Okay, about it because it's worked. yeah it was a good, it was a really good change yeah."
741.0,Provider,"All right, well i'm going to go ahead i'm going to send you that worksheets on spirituality and boundaries that I have so many a couple of them on. And then. I still need to go through and look look at some of my other information boundaries is very complicated and a lot of times we don't notice. But they are protection and we have a tendency to fall back into old stuff too. yeah and it comes to boundaries so maintaining ma'am is an art as well."
12727.0,Patient,"So that's The thing is maintaining on because that's how even like when my relationships, you know you always say you know we've been fighting for a little bit or whatever well i'm gonna do this i'm going to do that. And then everybody does what they're supposed to do for, say, a month and then next thing you know you're."
741.0,Provider,there.
12727.0,Patient,yeah and that's the thing maintaining it and keeping it. yep yes.
741.0,Provider,yeah so it sounds like you're doing really well.
