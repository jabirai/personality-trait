She told me to get some treatment and that's you know that's where i'm going with all this this i'm hoping the zoloft will help me. Okay, because i'm not taking prescriptions. i'm allergic. Provided and encoding and all hydrocodone owns and stuff like that and. I. With co bid and a job, and then a new area and. You know.

148.0,Provider,yeah yeah. um yeah and.
15057.0,Patient,"And then being in an area where i'm an avid Walker and outside, and all that kind of stuff and then meeting this guy online, which was really creepy and. You know feeling like I can't go outside or go anywhere do anything because he's there. and You know, not enough dirt on him to. get a restraining order I guess you know I he has to hit me and i'm not gonna let that happen i'm not gonna, but I just don't want him to be around me or feel he can walk up to a single woman's home in a strange. town. That he can just walk up into her garage when and he knows that she doesn't want him around."
148.0,Provider,And you're talking about now you could.
15057.0,Patient,"This yeah let's be. Steve this man Steve basket was I was. told to. Well, one safe place, I was referred to and. To see about getting a restraining order against him, I was talking, I was talking to a counselor about em Dr. sandy. sandy grooms and I was talking to her on the phone when. Steve. showed up and. it's just. You know it's a creepy thing it's just a creepy thing that I really just have to. live with."
148.0,Provider,"Well, do you have support now. Where are you staying now."
15057.0,Patient,"it's just me and my house, you know I know I tried to get support, but I was told basically you know he'd have to hit me in so many words okay."
148.0,Provider,And if. i'm still. Around and harassing you. Just what you're saying.
15057.0,Patient,"um I. He knew that he might be getting served a restraining order and I figured that would scare him because he has a lot of nice things and. I hadn't heard from him and I wasn't sure. After I filed the restraint or was trying to get a restraining order, whether I do it or not, because he knows a lot of icky people and I just thought you know I really got nervous if that was really a thing I wanted to do now and and. I did get a birthday card and a whole bunch of pictures is showing me different things that you know I could possibly miss you know or I missing by not seeing him it doesn't matter and not i'm not going to see him but. defend me a card. After quite a few months, but. i'm thinking that if he ever does show up. I do have a few copies of the restraining order that I did not file because there's no way I wanted to ever stand up in court cm talked about him do what i'm doing with you in front of a public forum, you know I I. need to go forward and i've had to tell the story so many times and it's just hard to move forward when you just keep getting dragged back into it okay and talking about it is doesn't do me any good. and it's best for me to. move forward with. A different life some you know not what I was trying for but. You know i'm involved in the garden club and. I don't know getting involved. Can I be protected know. I called 911 if he comes on my property I guess."
