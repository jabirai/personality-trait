6609.0,Patient,hey.
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah okay.
6609.0,Patient,Well i'm just kind of waking up. My pump is beeping at me sorry.
416.0,Provider,Does that mean it's your blood sugar's off.
6609.0,Patient,No it's just have to change the cartridge today. it's every three days yeah hi.
416.0,Provider,hi so is that still working really well for you last time you were talking about how is a game changer.
6609.0,Patient,"yeah it's been working really well I think some of my settings are still a little off, but I don't have an appointment with my endocrinologist until the end of October. So i've been trying to his think she's been out of town so it's been hard for me to get a hold of her to adjust some things so i've been having them play around with it a little bit myself. Which is okay."
416.0,Provider,"Well, how have you been. it's been a while, since i've seen you."
6609.0,Patient,"yeah no i'm sorry i'm. i've been mostly okay yesterday wasn't a great day for me and I ended up not going to work until the last couple hours of that I was supposed to be there because I was having really bad anxiety. And my boss just asked if I could just come into clothes, or I did. I spent most of the day at home yesterday."
416.0,Provider,"With with that what, what do you know what might have caused it."
6609.0,Patient,"um yeah I well yes and no so on Sunday. It was the folsom street fair here in the city and that happens to be the same day as my anniversary with my best friend, so we went and it was fine. until later, a friend of mine, a really good friend of mine kind of has this thing, where she loves to like befriend random people and we made friends and we're hanging out with them and one girl. very suddenly mentioned very casually mentioned that she had a fake Vaccination Card and I started to freak out a little bit. Even though she was wearing a mask the entire time. I still started to like kind of freak out about it and I ended up having to leave what I was doing, because I was very upset about it and that kind of set me off. And it made me freak out a little bit yesterday. yeah that was mostly mostly it."
416.0,Provider,What were your specific thoughts that happened like while you were. Like what what you learn she had a fake vaccination car and then what what triggered in your head what were your first thoughts.
6609.0,Patient,"At it was less of a thought and more of a feeling. Like I got kind of. frozen for a second like I got kind of cold and. And then I kind of jumped into being frustrated with her, and then I was like you know that's pretty irresponsible because i'm somebody that's immunocompromised and she was just like well. I just really wanted to come out to this thing and it kind of turned into this lake kind of an argument about it and I started kind of getting anxious and then. There was some other things her other friends started getting really like feisty and like shoving my other friend around, so I was just kind of like I can't do this, and it was mostly a lot of frustration. That I was feeling because it's just like. This argument this like idea that it's like it's if we all just really did this one thing this wouldn't be as big of a problem as it currently is now and it just like really got me riled up. But it completely ruined my night like I was nine and I was like I have to leave. And I just kind of ruminating about it, the rest of the night."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. That makes sense okay so um when you start to get in that sort of rumination place. In the past, did you just kind of stay there until it goes away or have you been able to stop it at all."
6609.0,Patient,"Sometimes I can i'm. Most of the time I can't and I have to let it sort of just happen and yesterday, I tried I got up. I tried to do my routine about getting ready. For work and. Men are kind of just be like you know it's fine we're going to make coffee we're going to do everything, and I just I couldn't I couldn't do it. And i'm just really fortunate that my boss is super chill about a lot of that stuff she was just like that's fine if you can just come into close it's great you don't need to come in until like six so I was like okay that's fine. But I I tried and I just couldn't get out of it yesterday until later it was even really hard for me to go into clothes, but luckily, it was dead when I got there so."
416.0,Provider,"So if you want i'm one of the things that we can do is kind of start to examine that a little more like when you kind of get into when something happens that triggers you and you kind of get into that spiral that lets us a while. And we can look at opportunities for you know, to intervene and there but it's up to you. yeah. yeah all right, I need a minute to go get what I need for this, and then I will be right back. Okay okay."
6609.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"All right, I got it it's. still have the right, page up but I hold it on it is right here alright, so this is called the chain analysis. Let me share my screen with you do you have a piece of paper and a pencil. or pen or something. So here's what a chain analysis looks like. So we start out usually and i'll kind of guide you through this so maybe like two thirds of the way over on the side of the page is where we're going to start. And we're going to list what you consider like the problem behavior, and that makes it sounds like you were misbehaving but it's really like the behavior being you. You were I don't know how you would whatever you would describe it as but, like you got really anxious and felt kind of paralyzed to to do much or whatever, however, put that in your own words."
6609.0,Patient,Okay. Okay.
416.0,Provider,And then going back like leaving a little space for these links in the middle go back to the prompting event. So the prompting that would be that you learned that this girl was. Sport fake Vaccination Card.
6609.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Now to the left of that we want to list your vulnerabilities and i'm going to. give you an example, so here's the vulnerability factors. Right so kind of going into it had you eaten. Had you taken your meds were you drinking or using anything had you. stressful events in the environment right, it was like a it was a busy overwhelming place where you know. lots of people intense emotions that you were having kind of going in if there was any sadness anger fear loneliness any stress. And then even like previous behaviors of your own that you found stressful kind of coming into your mind like oh This reminds me of when this other bad thing happened, or something right so, can you think of what your vulnerability factors might have been that day."
6609.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I was a been drinking so.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's write this down."
6609.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,So what did you end up with you've been drinking what else.
6609.0,Patient,"And i've been feeling pretty lonely. my grandparents left last week, and it was a little bit of. A harder departure for me than usual."
416.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. And then, what about how do you do in big crowds like that."
6609.0,Patient,"Usually i'm fine i'm actually. I guess, I would call myself an omnivore because I get energy from equally equally from being out as well as being alone i'm pretty i'm very, very social I really enjoy being out and i'm going out dancing is like probably one of my favorite things to do. Okay yeah."
416.0,Provider,"All right, so you had some vulnerability factors going into this. So now we go to those chains that are in the middle right so here's the. So as many changes, you need kind of to connect the event, with the behavior but usually the chains will be. find them here the change will be it's usually from the way I like to do it is usually kind of to follow the cpt model right where the first thing that happens is usually a thought about whatever happened, whatever the prompting event is and then an emotion."
6609.0,Patient,And then.
416.0,Provider,You know kind of whatever all the different things sort of lead to the behavior so imagine that you're stretching out time right in front like slowing it down and exam everything that happened between the prompting event and the behavior.
6609.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,So what do you think happened first so there's like what body sensations when she said this to you what were your thoughts.
6609.0,Patient,Your.
416.0,Provider,Emotions came in.
6609.0,Patient,To me to write them down or like kind of like talk through them a little bit.
416.0,Provider,And you can write them down and then you can just read them to me if that's helpful.
6609.0,Patient,"well. Like like I had said it was like the kind of first initial physical feeling of getting very cold and almost tingling. And really tense I like actually felt my body kind of like jerk up a little bit, I think, and I noticed that when I did that she got really kind of on the Defense very quickly about it. And then I got really angry and frustrated and started expressing that you know I have health concerns and expressing that you know, I have a certain expectation of people that if we're going to be all taking sort of a. risk that people would be smarter about it wouldn't be dishonest I was just trying to. let her know that. But in the end I ended up feeling a lot of just like this isn't worth it, it was just freaking me out and I ended up just decided it was better for me to leave."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
6609.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,And then all of that sort of leading to sort of spinning out right and not being functional for a day or so was there more after that that happened when you got home before you kind of froze.
6609.0,Patient,"yeah. When I got home, I was alone my uncle had his own plan so he was gone i'm. In my I just started dating someone and my girlfriend was messaging me about how her. Her keys were in a lift and the person lived up in sacramento so she was having a bad night as well, and she has her own issues that she's been struggling with so I felt very like I couldn't do anything to help her because I wasn't in a state to. be anything more than just supportive. And that was frustrating because I just felt really bad that I couldn't help her and."
416.0,Provider,"So it just kind of kept piling on right you got the loneliness. yeah cuz your uncle wasn't there so that kind of exacerbated the loneliness, then you have the feeling of frustration of not being able to help. and What next."
6609.0,Patient,"And then I started dissociating pretty hard, because I got overwhelmed and ended up just kind of aimlessly scrolling through tech talk for. Hours until I fell asleep at about like 2am. Okay yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so all of that just got really overwhelming you just associated scroll through tech talk until 2am. And then couldn't wake up the next morning to go to work."
6609.0,Patient,"yeah I woke up, but I just felt. Bad like yeah I it was like I yeah I dissociated for a while and it helped in the moment but the next day it was just like kind of all there and I was like. So it just got overwhelming and I had to like stay and do like kind of try and bring myself down before I had a panic attack, I did not have a panic attack, but I very I was very close to having one."
416.0,Provider,"So, given all of those links that's a lot of links right like there was a lot going on, so, given all of those links, if we look at each one separately, can we are there, opportunities for a different thought a different feeling a different action that maybe could have been. What was there, an opportunity to challenge, some of those thoughts challenge, some of those actions right was there anything else that could have changed."
6609.0,Patient,"um. I probably could have asked. The friends, I was with to. To support me, I am admittedly not good about asking for help. I probably I do regret, leaving actually. I feel like that, in a way was me like not standing my ground."
416.0,Provider,"What skills, could you have used to stay like How would you have maybe asked for help, or."
6609.0,Patient,"And I probably should have gone to my friend sherry she's kind of my friend, that I go to with a lot of. similar issues we both. Try to help each other out a little bit and just explained to her what was going on and. Possibly tried to talk to maybe the bar manager or the bouncer to be like hey this person probably should be going, we probably should meet be needing to leave because of this to kind of remove them from the situation, because I know i'm not the problem, I know that she was but. I just didn't take the time to think about that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you basically there was a point at which you just sort of had such a strong reaction that you weren't thinking clearly. yeah through like what skills, can I use yeah. So maybe at that point, there could have been an opportunity also for like a little grounding right stepping away breathing something like that, and then would have potentially lead you down a different path okay. yeah I mean hindsight hindsight is 2020 right but that's why we do this is to look. Like Okay, if something like this comes up again i'm going to try to remember that I want to get grounded before I make a decision."
6609.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And then i'm going to think about like what skills, I can use to get through this. Okay. So. You can do the consequences part of this on your own it kind of goes to the right like, if you want to complete this and. But I think it's I mean I hopefully you thought this was helpful I think it's always helpful to look back and be like okay well. let's slow down time think about something that I did I wish I could have changed and then look at like where we could change something like this in the future."
6609.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah. No, it did definitely now that i've had like a couple days to sort of. come down from it. it's easier to look at it now. It was very. Very fighter flight, and I just decided I needed to go so."
416.0,Provider,yeah. yeah you had a lot of vulnerability factors going in.
6609.0,Patient,"And the physicality that started coming into it to with the the person's friend that was there, who happened to be an er nurse, which was the most imperial thing, because I think she knew that her friend did not have a real card. It just was like there's too much going on and just I was like i'm not trying to get into a fight i've been into fights in my life and I. do not want to get that angry again because both times I ended up being the person that came out of it on top, but i'm not proud of it and it's just like i'm not trying to put myself in that situation ever again it's been a really long time and i'm like i'm too old for that. So."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. and looking at the vulnerability factors is another place for this too, so that's what kind of one of my favorite parts about this exercise, and when i've done it with myself or with somebody else for me. I I almost always see patterns, I do this with my patients to you, almost see patterns like when. About like vulnerable which vulnerability factors kind of tend to be the most powerful to lead you to a behavior that you don't like. Right, so if you do this more than once, and you might start to see patterns in like when you're the most vulnerable because you're feeling lonely or when you're the most vulnerable because you're drinking or whatever it is like whichever factor. kind of keeps popping up, then you can go Okay, when I know that's going on. I need to go into whatever situation i'm going into like knowing that there's that i'm going to have an imminent need to use more skills right. So I was going to talk with you also about the frequency that we meet. And because it seems like your schedule is making a really hard for you to see me twice a month."
6609.0,Patient,"um I am currently in the process of kind of changing my schedule around a bit at work, to try and make it work."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
6609.0,Patient,"So yeah right now I think i'm going to be transitioning to mornings on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I have every other Friday off, which happens to be this Friday. haven't really made a decision about Tuesdays yet I don't think i'm working in the morning on Tuesday so i'm. Hoping that tuesday's can be my day to do our appointments."
416.0,Provider,"So you want to try and schedule on Tuesdays that's good okay so. You want to keep it at twice a month. yeah okay let's do that. Okay, so let's look at. The next. Two weeks from today would be. 12. I have have 10 o'clock open again if you want to do that."
6609.0,Patient,That would be great.
416.0,Provider,um do you like half an hour appointments or do you want to do a longer appointment and do 45 minutes what's best for you.
6609.0,Patient,i'm probably like 45 minute appointments okay.
416.0,Provider,"All right, and then two weeks from that would be the 26 so let's make sure I have that open. yeah 26 that 10 o'clock works also if you want to do that."
6609.0,Patient,That would be a good as well.
416.0,Provider,and So the 12th and the 26th at 10am for 45 minutes. Perfect yeah perfect perfect. yeah. Okay.
6609.0,Patient,All right.
416.0,Provider,"Anything else you need from me, before we go for today."
6609.0,Patient,"Sorry, now I think i'm just gonna drink my coffee in and show up for work."
416.0,Provider,"yeah OK OK alright have a good one, then and i'll See you in group okay all."
