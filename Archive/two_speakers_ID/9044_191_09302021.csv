191.0,Provider,"yeah cuz sometimes they will give you some place to give you, like the equivalent of lack of faith sheet synopsis."

9044.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
191.0,Provider,You still doing your metformin.
9044.0,Patient,"Yes, twice a day. Twice I don't know. I don't know if you have we did bumped me up. A month or two ago we bumped me up to 1000 milligrams twice a day, instead of 500."
191.0,Provider,"We get you updated. That you ever. taught what your provider about a B 12 level because there's a percentage of people anywhere from 10 to 25%. That is there's associated with metformin is a B 12 deficiency, and if that's not correct that you can develop a peripheral neuropathy so what I used to do is. Often start people in between with metformin and check the club level, so you want to try to prevent a peripheral neuropathy and just check and see you know what your levels are and everything, so I try to get that periodically on patients okay. Okay yeah because long terms, without be 12 that can affect how you feel just neurologically and I usually check it when I have people that are dealing with depression or anything like that to. Those things yeah I feel entire for tea towel or anything like that okay Dan. And let's see any change with home or work, it may be a change for home but currently."
9044.0,Patient,He.
191.0,Provider,Okay work at home.
9044.0,Patient,"Oh, speaking of that, I do have a question for you on those surveys that we do every week two questions actually I can't remember which one is on but it asks. How much time or like how many days a week, you spend at work or volunteering obviously i'm a stay at home mom is that my work, I never know what to put their."
191.0,Provider,"You know. i'd have to look and see what they're aiming for, like, for example, I think, stay at home work being a homemaker is is a 24 hour job. You know. But it's like is it outside work or inside work in volunteer and and everything and then the truth be told, a lot of stay at home moms volunteer all the time because you're always keeping everybody together, you always here for the carpool and. yeah yeah it's an endless supply of things that you do so if you're able to respond, you may you may want to quantify just let them know you work work from home if you're able to do that. How, you know, and so they can can kind of assess that make that determination, but it's definitely work is demand. If you look at how demanding oh is definitely working in song."
9044.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah. Oh yeah. And then, my second question is the the pH Q with."
191.0,Provider,pitch. On and guess what.
9044.0,Patient,Am I supposed to be doing that every week weekly.
191.0,Provider,"yeah those are weekly. You did for September 8 okay so let's look at 928 I do you like to go over these okay. So these are screenings for like depression pH tonight is depression get anxiety. And so, for your PhD you know, for example, over the last two weeks How often have you been bothered by any of the following problems little interest or pleasure and doing things you put not at all. feeling down depressed or hopeless not at all so you're screening for depression your score was a one. All right, and so one means minimal depression, do you agree with that, how do you feel about that."
9044.0,Patient,yeah I agree with that.
191.0,Provider,"All right, then alright so let's look at your debt seven it's a screening for anxiety So these are sample of questions here. Over the past last two weeks How often have you felt nervous anxious or on he said, not at all over the last two weeks out and have you not been able to stop control worry. Worrying you said, not at all so for you get seven you had a score of zero so that's like no minimal or no high anxiety, do you agree with that. yep yep so we do that periodically are such a strong link between mental health and. Any form of addiction, that we do check that regularly, and so, if it would you know if your score was like really high that I would advise that you see me and see your therapist and usually i'll have the care navigator arrange an appointment for follow up okay. Okay, yes, I do sign off on those and look at those and and definitely respond when there's a concern, and then you and I can always go over those two if you ever have a question all right. Okay, you know right there Okay, so what are you doing about birth control."
9044.0,Patient,I have the tubal ligation okay.
191.0,Provider,"So about letter to the location all right, then so we'll just go ahead and do your review system to see how you're doing any thoughts of plans of harming yourself or anyone else.
