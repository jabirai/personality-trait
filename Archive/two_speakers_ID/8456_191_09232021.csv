You can't depend on you, I mean what you for nine months, and you had the opportunity to get a car to better your situation he didn't do that, so I don't know what makes you think that i'm a think you've helped me in my situation."
191.0,Provider,So he wouldn't get a car.
8456.0,Patient,The better has not like i'm. Income tax time came and went. And had all this money and you had the opportunity to get a car. And you didn't. And so being when the tables are turned in you need to go here go there and i'm like no I came and you mad at me cuz I got stuff to do. or because I don't feel like getting out my bed when you had that opportunity. To get into a car so better you're. Now let me ask you this.
191.0,Provider,"Let me ask you this because see you got a good training from your father and your mother, how to be a go getter start your business and make things happen. Let me i'm just asking i'm curious a lot of people didn't get that count on modeling of support did he have that no excuse for him not growing beyond that, but did he have."
8456.0,Patient,"He had a mother, that was a crack at it um you know he tells me stories, where he had to fend for him and his brother at 1415 years old and like I I don't judge people on what they have I just judge them on what they do or haven't done and, like I tell. Everybody, I believe, none of what you tell me all of what you show. And that's just The model I go by."
191.0,Provider,And mark.
8456.0,Patient,I don't judge him off for the day before I met him I judged you from the day I met you annoying. Because that's all I know so. i'm like he's been real bad and all I can't believe you even mean you can stay with me and my two bedroom apartment y'all can had a friend who runs i'm like no i'm not.
191.0,Provider,used to more than that.
8456.0,Patient,"My kids and like people don't understand like here being homeless, the only option, you have is the rescue mission. And my kids aren't used to that. that's my kids aren't used to sleeping on three Stat cuts or sharing a shower with a grown man or not so. If I feel like I could take my chances and pack my stuff I take the take the proper steps to make sure my stuff was secure i'm like I said I paid my storage until January, which I don't even plan on using it, that alone. But I got it for that long but."
191.0,Provider,plan ahead your planner.
8456.0,Patient,"I have to I told him I got four kids now that's counting on me hand and foot and I can't let them down. And two miles away. So I have to, I have to make sure. Like I tell everybody, I made a promise to God when I kept them tears that i'm going to present them to the day he takes or take them from me."
191.0,Provider,"Right that's right and yeah, let me say this, I must speak this in your life i'm hopeful that you find somebody that you equally yoked with so that your peace. In his peace can come together. so that you can get the support that you need because you sound like you have supported your boyfriend but sometimes people's best because they just never knew you still Karen lion's share everything so i'm hopeful that you meet somebody that's equally yoked okay."
8456.0,Patient,"Thank you, I tell everybody i'm not afraid you got to be by yourself, first, before you can be with anybody else. Oh yeah. I just. i'm not together, so I don't even like I tell her i'm trying to save you you're not ready for two more babies like you don't even take care of the seven you have. So how do I get right, so I don't even I don't even want to think about getting you involved in these kids lives and then you're just gone. Because I. was so sad like I used to go get his children every weekend and pharaoh yea, which is about 20 minutes for me um. He I went got him sits and I stopped going over a month ago, over a month and a half ago, but I still carried on that relationship. With the kids, no matter what me and him was going through, but I gotta cut them off too, because I don't want them to think you know, like like I even told his daughter, you know she could call me anytime. But she has a relationship my teenagers but. It shouldn't just be all that to me to get your kids to you. Probably I can't keep doing it, I got for that. yeah yeah they keep me busy so."
191.0,Provider,i'm hoping you I hope you find somebody that's equally yoked with you because i'ma tell you as much as you do in the gifts and strengths as God is giving you. If you find someone you can eat be equally yoked with that could just release a lot of burden it's not even about being dependent on but can you have could whoever you your will connect just hammered a part.
8456.0,Patient,"need you to have your part, I got my part. But it like I told him, you came in, like a knight in shining Armor we were going to basketball games together, and you know all that stuff but then it seemed like once. I couldn't do for you as much as I could hear kind of attitude and here come to. Oh, it ain't about me and i'm sorry but we got doctors appointments coming up on higher like I just I can't do it even him tat until three in the morning and you want me to get out my bed to come get you and I tell you know you had opportunity to get a car you."
191.0,Provider,"The way you think and it's beautiful that's called wisdom Daniel that's called wisdom, because the truth is, you need to be in a relationship with another adult i'm listening i'm just being honest."
8456.0,Patient,You know you're.
191.0,Provider,"Hoping that you get equally yoked because you deserve somebody that can be there for you today can actually pick you up and take you out to eat. Right, not just for the hook, but."
8456.0,Patient,"I try right here for a friend, you know, like it went from now he not really using you to you trying to you know help him, but then once that opportunity came and went and she didn't get a car you decided to do whatever it was you did with your money.

191.0,Provider,"Yes, i'm Danielle. You keep being kind and being a good person because i'ma tell you something what we put out it comes back to us, but the other thing i've learned in life is you have every right to protect your heart."
8456.0,Patient,You have.
191.0,Provider,"every right to protect your hardness the same people used to say when we were young you probably heard it. Because sounds like we got similar upbringing when it comes to certain say, as I said, do not cast your pearls to swine they'll just trample all over it, you got a lot of pearls Danielle just being being careful because i'ma tell you something. When people can't protect can't can't appreciate your gifts. And you've got you've got so many gifts that you're you're so talented and gifted get so much energy and you know some don't ever feel a shame about that that's that those are your gifts. But one of the things i've had people saying is true, we have to protect our heart, we have to be protective not fearful but protective and it's sort of like you say it you you've got that. you've got that wisdom, where you're looking at you sin and it's sort of like you get to a point where you say you know something my friendship is gold and i'm really there for my friends, but you know friendship earned. You can't just be gone all up in this domain account Level one patient, used to say I don't know if you were to sit at my DEMO tape. So know you Daniel you know something you are beautiful person and you dare to support your team members in group there's a lot of wisdom and i'm going to look forward to. just hear and how things work for you okay and i'm hopeful john you know john and I are just hopeful, because you do you give a lot to try to help people your family, the people you love, so no you're not wrong for being a good person and trying to do the right thing that's beautiful."

I got a lot of strength from it and i'm just I sit there and I said to myself, this is hard, but I look forward to seeing him again. And all the CC planet it's a funny thing Danielle it seems like when they pass on. The things that they plant, it seems like yeah they they start growing when they're alive, but I think now he's passed on they're gonna grow even more it's amazing how even in death, I was reading somewhere I think it's Hebrew where they say death is really a birthday."
8456.0,Patient,Other people.
191.0,Provider,"You know, for the person that passed it's like their birthday, so they go on to another. This like they go on to you know another place, however, people have those beliefs, but as in we're kind of waste, like a birthday, for those of us who were fortunate enough to have. Positive parents, because now, you really start noticing the things they say you know and things start popping up and you say you're. Right yeah yeah so it's just it's another birth rebirth. But no, I thought about you shortly after that happened, I said Danielle just went through this and yeah cuz you wanted to people that i've talked to that just recently lost a parent, you know.
