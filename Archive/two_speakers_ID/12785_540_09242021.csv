540.0,Provider,"Any other changes going on, that you want to talk about."
12785.0,Patient,um. I don't know how long it's been.
540.0,Provider,it's been a hot minute. I think yeah are you on monthly counseling.
12785.0,Patient,"I think so because, like Julie had me doing groups. But I thought the group is not for me because everybody's like on suboxone or something and i'm not all that stuff. yeah she she has me on by the end it because I have a D hd and i'm just like listening to all these people who are like. I don't know. Just not. Not not my. cup of tea that doesn't pertain to me."
540.0,Provider,Have you thought about changing to want to join like mental health groups.
12785.0,Patient,"Well, she told me I need to that she had, as I have a meeting with her Monday. And she said that she was like trying to place me and a group but wanted me to do one on ones. With counseling until then, so I asked her my day."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so yeah so see what's going on with that because, because if you're not at once a month counseling I if you want me to put you at once a month, I can do that."
12785.0,Patient,"yeah pretty sure I be I don't know if it's twice i'm pretty sure it's like once but, but just to check with her okay."
540.0,Provider,"Well, you and I will make that will make a follow up appointment and if Julie says that it's Okay, for you to go to once a month, then that's we can just do like that one appointment."
12785.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,"Well, the month and. cuz i'm fine with that, but I do think that if you want to want to her mental health groups, it would be more beneficial."
12785.0,Patient,"yeah because, like that's what I initially thought it was doing. And then everybody's like. it's called it's like a recovery group. And I was like yours i'm like. I asked her if she is yeah you should be in that group, like."
540.0,Provider,"yeah so yeah it says, you came in mental health and then you're in a relapse prevention group. yeah we can get that changed."
12785.0,Patient,yeah as it isn't understand that yeah.
540.0,Provider,Now I don't think yeah I think that's happened to a few of my patients so i've had to do like a switcheroo for them to get them into like a mental health group.
12785.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,Like I don't have any problems like do you guys like know there must have been some kind of.
12785.0,Patient,These people are like yeah i'm like dude so gay like. And they're like I don't know no that's what i'm judging i'm just saying they're like.
540.0,Provider,they're just not in the same yeah.
12785.0,Patient,Mental state they're in.
540.0,Provider,"yeah yeah or have like the same problems per se. yeah so what I. What i'll do is um yeah so you meet with Julie, on Monday, you said."
12785.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so why don't we make our appointment for next month we'll just make one so we'll plan on just doing monthly unless she says otherwise because i'm fine with that if that's what you want. yeah um but definitely I think that you would benefit from a mental health group. All right, so why don't we do this, what does this time work best for you."
12785.0,Patient,Now.
540.0,Provider,The time works better.
12785.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'm all I mean like. Because like it's so confusing because it's California. Western Eastern time um but yeah it's either has to be. Like morning daytime like Mondays usually i'm off. But I have to work later, but I mean I like usually the day off like Mondays and Tuesdays but um. yeah I mean, as long as it's 930. Because like I don't know how how that time difference. goes. What start."
540.0,Provider,"So, what is your time zone."
12785.0,Patient,i'm Eastern.
540.0,Provider,Okay i'm Eastern so that works.
12785.0,Patient,"Okay, just like they're telling me that you are Pacific."
540.0,Provider,"So the their scheduler is Pacific, so I feel you on the pain i've had to adjust because they're based out of California our company is based, out of California, so we have to go by Pacific."
12785.0,Patient,Because they told me that. It would be 630 your time and 930 my time.
540.0,Provider,nope nope. Time. know. That is so confusing no yeah so my time is your time.
12785.0,Patient,is like I don't know Julie is California time I think I don't know.
540.0,Provider,I think she is yeah.
12785.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"too confusing yeah it took me a long time to get used to being able to subtract three of my hours, to put it in the schedule book. yeah. Yes, and whenever I try to do i'm like my iPhone for like my kids. Like they're so like I automatically like subtract three hours now to even like just like my regular like scheduler for like my kids appointments and like I don't have to do that on my iPhone."
12785.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"But um alright, so you said Monday Tuesdays days. yeah oh yeah so we won't know what day your group is going to be."
12785.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"So why don't we are we'll put a pause on making the appointment, you talked to Julie, on Monday, try to get into another one of her groups all right, and then just call the virtual clinic and schedule with me. Just one at one time for the month unless so ask Julie say say like I I told you that and once a month would be good, on my end, but if she feels like she wants you to do twice a month, but i'm all for the once a month for you. Okay okay. OK alright, so I will see you. To be determined. yeah okay all right bye Randy. Always. Alright, for transcription That was my individual therapy session with brandi. not too much to notate just she is in a relapse prevention group so she hasn't been connecting with her group hopefully we can just get her into want to julie's mental health groups. I don't think anything else we couldn't make her appointment just because if she ends up going to a different group time on a different day, then we won't be able to do that same day so i'm going to potentially plan on seeing. brandi once a month, but i'm not going to make that permanent until I hear back from Julie."
