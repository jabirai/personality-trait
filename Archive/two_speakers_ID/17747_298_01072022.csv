298.0,Provider,"how's it, how can I help you tonight."
17747.0,Patient,"I am still struggling a bit with my medications and I also have some questions about the Program. I got kind of sideswiped Tuesday trying to change my pharmacy with a bunch of program requirements that had been presented to me, and it seems like i'm being tracked for addiction recovery, and that is not at all why i'm here."
298.0,Provider,"So I have asked my bosses if they could lay off on the addiction questions and they've told me know. And I tried i'm like but we're mental health program, why do we have to have somebody addiction questions and it's something I change. Sorry it's not working them and that's something I cannot change about this program is their survey questions so one sorry about that, and what was the other thing you've got sideswiped done."
17747.0,Patient,i'm a urine test labs.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, a urine test is done once a year. And labs are done at the beginning. And that is so that I can look for any underlying causes now if you've Had it done somewhere else, then you can give me a copy of that if you choose not to give me in labs you can a what they call it against medical advice form and i'm doing that assigning it. Okay, but the thing is just getting signed so that it's not hanging over your head."
17747.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I didn't realize that was an option yeah. What kind of labs do your request because I asked my doctor to do a bunch for me, but it was like metabolic panels and."
298.0,Provider,thyroid and that's exactly what i'm looking for i'm looking for a vitamin D level of thyroid a metabolic panel. Okay.
17747.0,Patient,I got all those done on my own initiatives.
298.0,Provider,"And that's just you know, take a picture of it if you can send it to us, I I will sign off on that that would be awesome."
17747.0,Patient,Okay okay so yeah that sounds a lot better to me then like we're looking for every single drug and.
298.0,Provider,"So i'm the uds it's once a year. And i'm. I I don't know on the first one, if they want it done in a lab. And if you really have a problem with it, let me know and i'll all signed off on it or sign good send an AMA on it."
17747.0,Patient,"yeah I wouldn't be fine if it was standard labs, but I have a bunch of triggers around being treated for addiction it's just feel so judgmental to me and so constraining and I hate it, I have, I have left other practices when they took that approach with me over what I was actually doing."
298.0,Provider,"Unfortunately, this company started with addictions, and then branched out into mental health and they have a lot on leftover. It feels like they have a lot of leftovers."
17747.0,Patient,yeah yeah. There wasn't a place to say none ever not a problem. Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, some people figure out how to get that information to me. Like stop asking me."
17747.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah. yeah Thank you um the other question wants group therapy and seeing an individual therapist I have my own individual therapist.
298.0,Provider,turned out into the virtual clinic that you have your own.
17747.0,Patient,"I just got the form Tuesday and I need to talk to my therapist about it because I don't know what information she wants me releasing about her. I also don't have her address. Okay, so."
298.0,Provider,"All right, and group therapy is a requirement of this program and having said that, when people get really upset about it, I try to cut it down to the bare minimum, which is once a month."
17747.0,Patient,once a month okay.
298.0,Provider,"And if that is what you would like I would cut you down to the bare minimum, just to be able to stay in the Program."
17747.0,Patient,I think i'd prefer that because I found when i'm in group therapy i'm doing as much work as the facilitators and especially if the rest of the programs about addiction that's going to be really hard on me.
298.0,Provider,So my mental health groups are not about addiction i'm I really tried to make sure that that doesn't happen because I get you know complaints on that. These only. Do once a month okay and let's talk about your meds right now.
17747.0,Patient,"Sure, please um I noticed when I went to fill my abilify that it's still at 15 milligrams I thought we were dropping that along with adding the Co Jensen, however, you say that."
298.0,Provider,"Okay um. I don't know what happened, did we say we would drop it to 10."
17747.0,Patient,that's what I remember hearing and that's what.
298.0,Provider,I remember that's what I remember us discussing did you pick up the 15 milligram already.
17747.0,Patient,"yeah I had to because I would be out tonight, if I hadn't taken that step."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so right now i'm writing it for 10 milligrams. and No, and do you have my email address if something should happen again whether it's a mistake of not what we agreed upon."
17747.0,Patient,I do have your email or just remember to go.
298.0,Provider,And i'm going to give you some projects that I know the cojones went through.
17747.0,Patient,"Well yeah it's it goes through, and I have been taking it, but it makes me, I can tell when it's wearing off because I have energy and I feel good. Good actually I think it's over compensating and stealing some energy, I need i'm still. Like wanting to nap in the afternoon and i'm having trouble making my day last past like 8pm i'm already really tired and it's only so 30. Right."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so I mean it's not mandatory, that you take that medicine um yeah."
17747.0,Patient,I like not being showed physically restless that I can't hold still but i'm wondering if there's a smaller dose than the three a day to see if I can actually have some energy.
298.0,Provider,"And you couldn't cut it in town, you could do just one a day it doesn't have to be three times a day."
17747.0,Patient,"Okay, great, then I can experiment with that that's right."
298.0,Provider,"Yes. Okay Okay, and are you taking the seroquel of the time."
17747.0,Patient,"Yes, I am taking just 100."
298.0,Provider,"yeah okay. All right, is there anything else that I can do for you."
17747.0,Patient,"um i'm still waking up at 430 in the morning, I have nasal congestion my beard gross is increased and i'm super tired i'm also been struggling more with shame and depression so i'm wondering if maybe. Well, hopefully dropping abilify a little bit maybe i'll get some of that energy back and some of the. more positive aspects backs."
298.0,Provider,"You also. um. there's only one medication out there that's been known to increase Stage three and four sleep and that's gabba penton even just like 100 milligrams the top dose of gabba penton is like 3200 milligrams but they say that a nighttime dose of gap of penton can help people. get over that sleep hump that they, you know that they're waking up them."
17747.0,Patient,interesting is that a prescription medication or supplement I swear i've heard of it before.
298.0,Provider,It is a prescription medication it's also used for nerve pain. it's also used as an anti-convulsants you could also do some research on it and let me know.
